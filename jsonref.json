They have done what they once told me not to do – they are believing everything negative that has been written about me. So I am reaching out to them, once again, to try to correct the lies and get the truth out there.‘Everyone says, why don’t I just shut the f*** up? That Meghan can’t speak to me because I’ll give away secrets. But that’s bull****. I’ve been accused of every terrible thing you can think of. In one magazine they had an awful story about Prince Charles right beside one about me. But no one is shunning Prince Charles.’Prince Harry went \u0027mental\u0027 and \u0027accused William of trying to...It\u0027s Meg\u0027s party! Prince William and Kate SKIP a board...Share this articleThis is just his fourth interview since the fall-out with Harry and Meghan after he staged paparazzi pictures shortly before the couple’s wedding in May and then suffered two heart attacks, preventing him walking his daughter down the aisle at St George’s Chapel, Windsor.Today, in a wide-ranging interview with The Mail on Sunday, Mr Markle, for the first time, categorically rejects some of the most ‘grievous’ lies against him and produces evidence in the form of photographs, medical statements and even a faded plane ticket that he says proves he is telling the truth:          They are the words of love from a daughter who clearly adores her father. In a Valentine\u0027s card, Meghan writes: \u0027Daddy, Everything you do for me has turned me into who I am and I am so grateful. ‘All I want to do is make you proud… and I promise, no matter what, I’ll do it. Thank you for everything daddy. I love you with all my heart now and forever. Love Bean’ – her childhood nickname‘Everything has been met with a stony silence. Their silence means people continue to attack me and write lies about me.’Mr Markle says he has been surprised by a spate of recent negative stories about his daughter that portray her as a petulant a.One claimed she reduced a staff member to tears with her 5am demands and another said she wanted to spray air freshener around ‘musty’ St George’s Chapel – a request rejected by the Queen.Perhaps the most damaging claim concerns an alleged rift between Meghan and Kate, who is said to have been ‘reduced to tears’ by Meghan’s demands over Princess Charlotte’s bridesmaid gown and who later, allegedly, reprimanded Meghan for ‘berating’ a member of her staff.Kate is said to have told Meghan: ‘That’s unacceptable. They’re my staff and I speak to them.’Meghan’s father says he is baffled by the reports. ‘I don’t recognise this person,’ he says, shaking his head. ‘The Meghan I know was always sweet, kind, generous. She was always demanding but never rude. I don’t want to say or do anything to hurt my daughter but I worry she is going to hurt herself.’And in a Christmas card, left, showing a colourful llama, she writes: ‘Because you have always been so generous with me… it brings me so much joy to be able to give you this this Christmas. I love you to no end. Meg.’ Inside was a gift of $2,000 for a holidayMr Markle, a retired Emmy award-winning Hollywood lighting director, adds: ‘Meghan grew up on set. I taught her to have respect for the crew. They can make you look good or awful. I don’t pretend to know what she’s like now.‘She bends the rules. She’s good at that. But this acting up is new. She’s never been rude to me before. I can’t believe I’ve done anything severe enough to be treated this way by her.’ Indeed, he believes his bond with Meghan is ‘unbreakable’ – a point illustrated by two cards from his treasured collection.Meghan trained as a calligrapher and wrote wedding invitations to help support herself through the early days of her acting career, a skill highlighted in her cards to her father, which are written in elegant cursive script.‘I loved getting cards from Meghan,’ Mr Markle says. ‘She wrote me hundreds of little cards and notes through the years. Sometimes they were for special occasions, other times just little notes she would leave around the house. I’ve still got a Post-It Note on my fridge which says, “I love you Daddy.” I see it every day. I got a card every Valentine’s Day.’ He pulls one Valentine’s card from a manila folder. It shows a picture of a chubby baby holding a daffodil with a touching message: ‘Daddy… I don’t express as often as I should how much you mean to me. Everything you do for me has turned me into who I am and I am so grateful. All I want to do is make you proud… and I promise, no matter what, I’ll do it. Thank you for everything daddy. I love you with all of my heart now and forever. Love Bean’ – a reference to his childhood nickname for her.    Mr Markle suffered two heart attacks, preventing him walking his daughter down the aisle at St George’s Chapel, Windsor when she married Prince Harry - who he is yet to meetOver the years, Mr Markle ‘willingly’ spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on his daughter, sending her to private school and even cashing in Facebook shares to help pay for her first wedding.A Christmas card showing a llama and the words ‘Fa-La-La Llama’ arrived at Mr Markle’s Mexican home just a couple of years ago, by which time Meghan was a successful actress, earning $50,000 (£40,000) an episode on the hit TV show Suits. The card contained $2,000 for him to put towards a holiday. She wrote: ‘Daddy, Because you have always been so generous with me and taken the best care of me it brings me so much joy to be able to give you this this Christmas. I love you to no end. Meg.’For Mr Markle, the prospect of never speaking to his daughter again is unbearable: ‘I’m hurt by what’s happened but I’m not going to stay silent.          In a wide-ranging interview with Caroline Graham near his home in Mexico, Mr Markle revealed the anguish he feels at the thought of never seeing his daughter again‘My life has been turned upside down since my daughter met Harry. When they announced her pregnancy I had seven paparazzi on my doorstep night and day for seven days. They rented the house next door.‘Their treatment of me is harsh, hurtful and unforgiving. I’m being punished for things I didn’t say.‘I’m trolled on the internet by one guy who sits in his mother’s basement spewing lies about me. Twitter is the worst but I can’t avoid it.‘I don’t read things but then people send them to me anyway. They say I faked my heart attacks, that I wasn’t at the first wedding. It’s all bull****. Meghan and I never had any problems before this.‘If she would just speak to me, things could be different. I love Meghan very much. I want her and Harry to have a beautiful, healthy baby and a great life.‘But I want them to stop believing the lies.’Does he believe he and Meghan will ever be reunited?He shrugs. ‘Maybe. Some day.’  \u0027I was so proud and overcome with emotion to see my baby in a white gown\u0027: Thomas Markle unveils touching photograph that proves he DID go to his daughter\u0027s first wedding but said no to the party bag marijuana He was reduced to what he calls ‘a footnote in history’ when two heart attacks prevented him from walking his daughter Meghan down the aisle of St George’s Chapel amid the pomp and pageantry of the Royal Wedding in May.But Thomas Markle did take a starring role at Meghan’s very different first wedding to Hollywood producer Trevor Engelson in 2011, which took place under swaying palm trees on a Jamaican beach, complete with a Caribbean steel drum band and a most unusual welcome gift for the guests.Mr Markle says he is ‘sick and tired’ of reading erroneous reports that he failed to attend the wedding, which sadly ended in orce for the couple two years later. He explains that he asked the photographer to ignore him and concentrate on the young people showing off their beautiful bodies in swimwear.          The invitationto Meghan’s first wedding showed her entwined with Trevor on a beach with a beer‘There are no pictures out there of me at the wedding because it was on the beach and everyone else was in their 30s and I was in my 60s’, Mr Markle said last night, before showing The Mail on Sunday a photograph – published here for the first time. It shows him posing proudly with Meghan just moments before he and his ex-wife Doria walked her across the sand to marry Trevor.Mr Markle also kept his business-class ticket to the four-day affair, along with an invitation, which featured a picture of a bikini-wearing Meghan on the beach entwined in Trevor’s arms, and a chilled bottle of Red Stripe beer within arm’s reach.The wedding took place at the famous Jamaica Inn, where Meghan booked all 55 rooms and villas, taking the £1,200-a-night largest villa for herself and her new husband.‘Meghan planned everything down to the tiniest detail. She took control of everything. I was given a white shirt to wear, as were all the male guests. She micro-managed everything,’ says Mr Markle.‘The picture was taken when I walked into her bungalow just moments before the ceremony was due to start. I was so proud and overcome with emotion to see my baby in a white gown, looking so beautiful. We took the picture and then Doria and I both walked her down the aisle.‘Trevor is Jewish and his father, who is a rabbi, conducted the service. But it was not a traditional Jewish ceremony. Meghan read vows she’d written herself.’          Prince Harry severely berated Mr Markle after he posed for photos before the royal wedding - contributing to their riftEach heartfelt word reveals the true sentiments of a devoted daughter. Meghan’s love for Thomas Markle is as plain as day.Yet today he is a pariah. At 74, in failing health in his twilight years, he is spending Christmas ostracised by his daughter. Heartbroken, cut off and cast out into the cold by an angry and indignant Meghan.The irony will be lost on the new Duchess of Sussex, as she fine-tunes her favoured philanthropic causes, that charity, as the saying goes, should begin at home. But to her, Thomas has become an embarrassment and a rolling public humiliation.Unable to manage and control him, she has pulled up the drawbridge. Behind the castle walls she will not – cannot – be reached. While Thomas feels wounded, Meghan feels betrayed. She is unwilling to climb down from the battlements. Meghan’s Royal ambition is leaving a large and untidy wake.She has in the past been accused of using people and then quickly moving on up the ladder, never looking back.It may be harsh to say she’s ‘ghosting’ her father – the fashionable term used when someone cuts off all communication without warning or explanation. Thomas prefers to describe her behaviour as ‘acting up’. But what’s certain is that she has approached her new Royal life at full tilt, head down, powering through.As Thomas says: ‘She was a control freak but never in a bad way – she was always sweet and kind.’Meghan’s marriage to Prince Harry wasn’t simply falling in love – although that was the main impetus – it was a life transformation of unimaginable proportions.A girl raised in a series of Los Angeles apartment blocks, who reinvented herself as a successful TV actress, is now reinventing herself as a princess.Since joining the House of Windsor her personal style has got more regal and refined. She has made sure social issues are front and centre of her public persona, like her high-profile cookbook launch to help Grenfell survivors with mum Doria in tow. And, of course, she plays the Royal wife with aplomb, as we have seen on the couple’s dazzling tour to Australia and New Zealand. She is, as one source says, ‘putting everything into this’. And as Thomas observes, his perfectionist daughter has always liked to micro-manage her life.Meghan knew her arrival in the Royal circle would be tricky. A orcee, a woman with history, there was always the chance of a disgruntled ex speaking out.What no one expected – and what has repeatedly wrong-footed Palace officials – is that it would be her immediate family who would prove to be the headache.While Doria has been the personification of discretion, Meghan views her father’s meandering outbursts during this critical time as a reminder of where she came from – not where she’s going. And right now, she finds it unforgivable. A post she shared on her old lifestyle blog The Tig gives a telling insight into how she deals with such ‘negative experiences’.She quoted Portuguese life coach José Micard Teixeira, who wrote: ‘I no longer have patience for certain things, not because I’ve become arrogant, but simply because I reached a point in my life where I do not want to waste more time with what displeases me or hurts me. I lost the will to please those who do not like me, to love those who do not love me and to smile at those who do not want to smile at me.’This philosophy still drives Meghan’s thinking and has been firmly applied to her father’s behaviour.From day one she has appeared to play favourites with her parents – Doria got an official Palace scroll announcing their wedding, Thomas didn’t. Doria was formally invited to the nuptials, Thomas wasn’t. And he was very hurt when told he couldn’t make a speech at the reception.In most family feuds, it takes a third party – a husband or partner – to intervene, break the entrenched positions and tactfully suggest the offer of an olive branch might be the best way forward.Harry should have been that peacemaker. But headstrong, unworldly and in thrall to his starry, beautiful wife he did nothing to calm the brewing storm.Rather than respectfully meeting his father-in-law face to face before the couple’s engagement was announced, he chose a quick chat on the phone. Harry – or rather his advisers – had the chance to bring Thomas into the Royal tent before the world even knew Meghan and Harry were a couple. It was a dropped ball that has led us to this point.When, only days before the wedding, Thomas foolishly agreed to stunt some photographs, Harry was on the phone again, this time to severely berate him. Thomas, recovering from urgent heart surgery and deeply embarrassed by his actions, pulled out of his daughter’s big day. Some Royal insiders suggested he faked the surgery to find an excuse, but, as we reveal today, it actually saved his life.For Meghan, the joy of her Windsor Castle wedding shared by the world was a chance to put all the unpleasantness behind her. She decided to take a ‘time out’ from her Dad, but neglected to communicate that to him properly. Once again, he felt hurt and slighted and reacted angrily in a live TV interview.Right now it’s hard to see Meghan giving ground. Just in practical terms she is heavily pregnant, working with interior designers and armed with swatch fabric and paint samples, to redevelop the couple’s new home, Frogmore Cottage, in time for the spring birth. She won’t be jumping on a plane to Mexico to make peace with her father in those circumstances. But with Thomas in ailing health, Harry needs to man up and fix what he inadvertently set off in the first place by failing to show Meghan’s father the necessary respect. Only then will Meghan and her father be reunited.Time is a great healer – but time is also something that we can never have enough of. Harry and Prince William spoke movingly last year of how they are haunted by their last hurried phone call to their mother, Princess Diana, the evening before she died.They were eager to get off the phone because they were having such a great time playing with their cousins at Balmoral. Harry said in an interview: ‘I can’t really necessarily remember what I said but all I do remember is probably regretting for the rest of my life how short the phone call was.’It’s a sentiment we have all felt in one way or another. A visit we never made, a call not returned, and suddenly the chance to say what we wanted to say is gone for ever.Meghan is at heart a good and generous woman who is ambitious and could be critical in the reinvention of the Royal Family for another generation.But what she cannot be is forever cast as the cruelly unforgiving daughter of a heartbroken and lonely old man.And Harry holds the key to making sure that doesn’t happen – before it’s too late."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/12/10/08/2F07EC3F00000578-6478541-image-a-22_1544430169645.jpg","title":"RAF scrambles Typhoon jets Lossiemouth ongoing operation","story":"RAF Typhoon jets have been scrambled from RAF Lossiemouth in Scotland this morning amid reports of Russian bombers being airborne (file picture)\u0027However, no intercept took place and the Typhoons subsequently recovered.\u0027 It is understood the jets, which have a top speed of 1,400mph, are on \u0027quick reaction\u0027 duty for NATO, with the RAF frequently dispatching planes on interception missions.The planes were scrambled at around 5.25am on the operation off the west coast of Scotland.Hi-tech coating which makes RAF\u0027s new £100million F-35...The Few become fewer: Tributes are paid to Battle of Britain...Share this article    The Typhoons are on \u0027quick reaction\u0027 duty and the UK has frequently scrambled fighters to intercept Russian planes patrolling near UK airspace this year (file picture)"},{"url":null,"title":"Hunt continues Chelsea fan appeared call Raheem Sterling f ing black c","story":"    This Chelsea fan (circled) allegedly shouted racial abuse at Raheem Sterling in a shocking incident at Stamford Bridge and Chelsea has now identified him and given his name to police          Raheem Sterling leaves training at Manchester City yesterday after allegedly being racially abused last night by Chelsea fans during a Premier League tie      Revealed: Mother of \u0027bully\u0027 accused of \u0027waterboarding\u0027...Revealed: The bully who tormented Home Secretary Sajid Javid...Share this article\u0027It is unusual for a player to get so close as they do not normally go to pick up a ball.\u0027Mr Mercer said he had never heard racist abuse hurled at opposition players from his seat in the Matthew Harding Stand at Stamford Bridge.\u0027I\u0027ve been a season ticket holder for 20 years and not heard anything like that,\u0027 he told MailOnline. I am just an ordinary fan who supports the team.\u0027 Mr Mercer, who also runs a removal firm, added: \u0027The other men in the photo are a distance from and a few rows behind.

The man alleged to have committed the offence is obscured in this picture, which shows a number of other Chelsea fans jeering the player In a statement released this evening, Chelsea Football Club said: \u0027Chelsea Football Club has suspended four people from attending Chelsea matches pending further investigations into allegations regarding the behaviour of supporters towards Raheem Sterling during our match against Manchester City on Saturday.\u0027Our investigations into this matter are ongoing. We are fully supporting the police investigation and any information we gather will be passed on to them.\u0027Chelsea Football Club finds all forms of discriminatory behaviour abhorrent and if there is evidence of ticket holders taking part in any racist behaviour, the club will issue severe sanctions, including bans. We will also fully support any criminal prosecutions.\u0027 Earlier Chelsea fan Nathan Lewis, who is black, was standing a few seats away from the men abusing Sterling.Although Lewis did not hear any racism during the match, he was shocked by the television footage, describing it as \u0027quite scary\u0027.\u0027A lot of people have been questioning me and my integrity as to why I didn\u0027t get involved, why I didn\u0027t react. But I didn\u0027t actually hear anything racial from any section of the crowd, but that doesn\u0027t mean it didn\u0027t happen,\u0027 he told ITV\u0027s Good Morning Britain programme.\u0027We all knew it was on TV because the camera was in front of us.\u0027I think it\u0027s disgusting. I\u0027m right there, three feet away from him. He\u0027s got no regard for me, Sterling either.\u0027To see that happen on TV just a few feet away from me is quite scary.\u0027The England star put on a brave face as he was photographed leaving his club\u0027s training ground in a black Mercedes 4x4 yesterday afternoon. Sterling was interviewed by members of the Metropolitan Police on Sunday, who travelled north as part of their investigation into an incident during Manchester City\u0027s match with Chelsea. He confirmed to police he had heard racist insults and other foul language as he went to collect a ball for a corner near the Matthew Harding Stand. Some of the biggest names in the world of football have praised the footballer. Viv Anderson, the first black footballer to play for England, wrote in the Daily Mail today: \u0027Raheem Sterling laughed in the face of those who he says racially abused him at Chelsea. What a powerful thing that was to see. It was the way those of us who have known discrimination have been dealing with it for years\u0027.Former Manchester United captain Rio Ferdinand suggested that footballers in England should be inspired by Colin Kaepernick\u0027s kneeling gesture and launch their own bid to fight back against racism after this latest worrying incident.Twitter users highlighted a first-half incident when a supporter at Stamford Bridge appeared to mouth the phrase \u0027f****** black c***\u0027 towards Sterling as he collected the ball in front of a section of Chelsea fans. Pictures of the moment and a video widely circulated on social media appeared to confirm this, with one spectator allegedly making the racist comment amid a barrage of aggressive abuse from Chelsea fans towards Sterling.    Pundit and former Manchester United captain Rio Ferdinand expressed his disgust online on Saturday evening Match of the Day pundit Ian Wright tweeted: \u0027The bad old days are back\u0027 and \u0027absolutely no doubt about what he says\u0027      Anti-discrimination charity Kick It Out later issued a statement following the incident  at Stamford BridgeHere is the Kick It Out statement in full: \u0027What happened at Chelsea shows what is still going on in football.\u0027Where is (Premier League executive chairman) Richard Scudamore? Where is (FA chairman) Greg Clarke? Where is Chelsea\u0027s chairman (Bruce Buck)? They should have been talking about it last night and it has to be dealt with at the top.\u0027We do not have any leadership at the top of the game to speak out, they rely on Kick It Out. We have already made comments about the way Raheem Sterling has been treated differently by the media. The print media often targets not just black players, but all footballers.\u0027Raheem Sterling has received bad press over the last few years because of his lifestyle, and clearly there are issues from potential stories adding to prejudice and I have every sympathy for him. Players know if they are abused in any way they have to tell the referee. It was awful. All players know the referee is in charge and has a duty of care, and the referee can remove those people. It didn\u0027t appear to me he told the referee in the first place.                                                     \u0027Regarding what was said at the Chelsea game as you can see by my reaction I just had to laugh because I don\u0027t expect no better.\u0027Sterling also said that he believed black players and white players were not treated equally by the media, including the Daily Mail and MailOnline, and that he believes this helps \u0027fuel racism and aggressive behaviour.\u0027 A Chelsea spokesman said: \u0027We\u0027re aware of reports and video footage. We will investigate the matter and take the strongest possible action where necessary.\u0027 A Football Association statement read: \u0027We take all allegations of discrimination extremely seriously and will work with the clubs and the relevant authorities to ensure this matter is dealt with appropriately.\u0027We strongly condemn all forms of discrimination and encourage all fans and participants who believe that they have been the subject of, or witness to, discriminatory abuse to report it through the appropriate channels: The FA, our County FAs or our partners Kick It Out.\u0027 The Met Police said: \u0027We are aware of a video circulating online in which it is claimed racial abuse was allegedly directed at a player at a Chelsea v Manchester City game at Stamford Bridge on Saturday, December 8.\u0027We will review the footage to determine whether any offences have been committed.\u0027No arrests have been made, the Met added.  Should any offence have been made, a life ban could be handed to the supporter or supporters responsible.Anti-discrimination charity Kick It Out later issued a statement, which read: \u0027We\u0027ve received reports from a variety of sources about an incident of alleged racist abuse at the Chelsea-Manchester City game.\u0027We will forward those to Chelsea and offer our support in their investigation.\u0027Yet another great day of football damaged by prejudice.\u0027The PFA has been in contact with the England international to offer support and praised the restraint he showed at Stamford Bridge.\u0027Raheem has made a stand by speaking out and we stand shoulder to shoulder with him against the discrimination of which he speaks,\u0027 said Simone Pound, the PFA\u0027s head of equality and ersity, in a statement. Do you know the man in the video?

How Kate, William, Meghan and Harry...Duke of Edinburgh, 97, enjoys a morning carriage ride around...Share this articleIn a statement to mark her 55th birthday on Sunday, Princess Masako said: \u0027Even though I feel insecure about how helpful I will be when I think about the days ahead... I want to devote myself to the happiness of the people so I will make an effort to that end.\u0027Referencing her illness, Masako said: \u0027I am delighted at the fact that I can perform more duties than before as I have tried to improve my physical condition.\u0027          Masako was born the daughter of a diplomat and was schooled at Harvard and Oxford, before starting a career as a diplomat herselfBut her doctors warned in a separate statement that it is important for the crown princess to continue treatment as she remains vulnerable to fatigue, especially after a large ceremony or successive duties.She has made few public appearances since 2003. Masako was born in Japan in 1963 as the eldest daughter of a diplomat father, and spent much of her early life living abroad - first in Russia, then America.She studied at Harvard before returning to Japan, where she met her future husband at a diplomatic event in 1986.Masako soon left the country again, going to England to study for her masters at Oxford, but never finished her thesis and returned to her country of birth in 1990.Despite her time living abroad, Naruhito kept up his interest in her, and she was twice forced to turn down his marriage proposals to pursue her career.But she eventually relented after he said becoming a princess would allow her to stay involved in diplomacy, and accepted the third proposal on her birthday in 1992.           She rejected two proposals from Prince Naruhito before eventually accepting his third offer on her birthday in 1992 when he persuaded her that becoming a princess was another form of diplomacy (pictured meeting Jordan\u0027s King Abdullah in 2018)          Emperor Akihito (far left) will become the first Japanese ruler to abdicate in 200 years when he hands the throne over to Prince Naruhito (second right) on May 1 next yearThe pair married the following year. They have one daughter, named Aiko, who was born in 2001. For a time she faced pressure to produce a male heir, but that eased in 2006 when her sister-in-law gave birth to Prince Hisahito, now 12.Emperor Akihito, Naruhito\u0027s father, will become the first Japanese emperor to abdicate in 200 years when he steps down from the throne on 30 April, 2019.Akihito\u0027s elder son Crown Prince Naruhito, 57, will ascend the throne a day later.Akihito, 84, has been on the throne since 1989 but expressed his  wish to step down in 2016, citing his age and health. However post-war legislation had not allowed for abdication, so a one-off law was adopted in June to accommodate the emperor\u0027s wishes.          Emperor Akihito (second row down, far left) will abdicate on April 30 next year before Prince Naruhito and Princess Masako assume the throne the following dayHe added: \u0027I feel deeply moved that the decision was made by the Imperial Household Agency making a major step toward an imperial succession.\u0027The last Japanese emperor to step down was Kokaku, who did so in favour of his son Ninko in 1817.Akihito\u0027s desire to leave the throne has revived a debate about the country\u0027s 2,000-year-old monarchy, one of the world\u0027s oldest, and has fuelled discussion about improving the status of female members of the shrinking royal population.The current male-only succession rules prohibit women from succeeding to the throne and female members lose their royal status when they marry a commoner.It means that, as it stands, Naruhito\u0027s only child Princess Aiko will not be able to inherit the throne after her father.Instead, Naruhito\u0027s younger brother Prince Fumihito will become crown prince following Akihito\u0027s abdication with his son, Prince Hisahito then in line to succeed."},{"url":null,"title":"Kates three bedroom Chelsea home shared sister Pippa sale 1 95m","story":"    The Chelsea home that Kate Middleton shared with her sister Pippa before she became the Duchess of Cambridge has been put up for sale for £1.95million          The bedrooms are decorated with calm and neutral colours and simple furnishings.

The print media often targets not just black players, but all footballers.\u0027Raheem Sterling has received bad press over the last few years because of his lifestyle, and clearly there are issues from potential stories adding to prejudice and I have every sympathy for him. Players know if they are abused in any way they have to tell the referee. It was awful. All players know the referee is in charge and has a duty of care, and the referee can remove those people. It didn\u0027t appear to me he told the referee in the first place.                                                     \u0027Regarding what was said at the Chelsea game as you can see by my reaction I just had to laugh because I don\u0027t expect no better.\u0027Sterling also said that he believed black players and white players were not treated equally by the media, including the Daily Mail and MailOnline, and that he believes this helps \u0027fuel racism and aggressive behaviour.\u0027 A Chelsea spokesman said: \u0027We\u0027re aware of reports and video footage.

It is an emotional crime.\u0027After the dramatic discovery  in the ER, Laura received a text saying Elizabeth, who has two older children, had \u0027lost the baby about two weeks ago\u0027 and didn\u0027t want to tell her as she was \u0027scared.\u0027However, in Facebook messages to Southern Californian News Group, Elizabeth said the baby was alive and that she might still consider allowing the Traytes to adopt her.She told SCNG: \u0027I was never trying to be cruel or mean ever... You have no idea what I have been through in my life and never will.\u0027           Elizabeth gave the Traytes three ultrasounds however one of them had a date of 2012 but she said it was just a mistake by the nurseHowever, she refused to provide evidence that the child does exist and the couple understandably now don\u0027t believe she was ever pregnant in the first place. They initially spent $16,000 on an adoption agency but when that case fell through the Traytes took matters into their own hands. They first started speaking to Elizabeth, from Virginia, in September when Laura made a website and GoFundMe page called \u0027A Sibling for Hudson\u0027 and wrote a post on social media saying they were looking for a birth mother.She then  paid $15 for Facebook to boost the post and got a message from Elizabeth Jones, who said she was an army veteran. She claimed her husband didnt want to raise the child because they couldn\u0027t support a third baby.           Matt and Laura Trayte (pictured with their eldest son Hudson) planned to adopt a baby girl as a second child but when they turned up at the hospital expecting to find their birth mother in labor, there was no babyThe Traytes said they felt Elizabeth was genuine about the adoption as she didn\u0027t ask for any money. They turned down two other birth mothers for her. They spoke several times a day, discussing plans for the nursery and with Laura receiving messages saying she\u0027d be \u0027such a good momma to baby girl.\u0027Elizabeth even sent three pictures of ultrasounds, however one of them had a date of 2012, but she told the Traytes that was just a mistake by the nurse.                              She stared at me with dead eyes. There was no remorse                        When Laura flew to Nickelsville, Virginia, to meet Elizabeth the pair posed for pictures and  even went to a lawyer to sign a Durable Power of Attorney.Elizabeth gave Laura a teddy bear with what she claimed was a recording of the baby\u0027s heartbeat inside and posed for pictures, letting Laura touch her belly. She even took her to a doctor\u0027s appointment before it was suddenly \u0027rescheduled\u0027 to a different room so Laura couldn\u0027t reach it. Because she never asked for money, the couple dismissed their fears. On November 29 Elizabeth said she was due to be induced at a hospital in Kingsport, Tennessee, at 9.30am, just across the border from where she lived in Virigina.However, hours before Laura received a message saying Elizabeth had gone into labor and was on the way to hospital with a \u0027life-saving crew.\u0027           The couple said they thought Elizabeth was genuine about the adoption as she didn\u0027t ask for money but are now \u0027broken\u0027 and trying to explain to their son why he hasn\u0027t got a sisterWhile en route to the hospital Elizabeth texted the family to say there\u0027d be another change of plans and she was going to a hospital with a Neonatal Intensive Care Unit at Holston Valley Medical Center and also sent pictures of bloody blankets.The Traytes rushed to the hospital with Laura Trayte calling a breathless Jones and coaching her over the phone. She told Trayte she had given birth texting: \u0027I’m sorry I have to push her out. I can’t keep her in any longer.  Yes yes yes. Her head is out. I gotta push again.\u0027Oh my god we have a baby omg.\u0027 They told staff to expect an ambulance coming with a baby being delivered at 33 weeks, believing Jones was behind them. Writing on her GoFundMe page Laura said: \u0027I went from coaching her through labor on the phone as we drove to the hospital to meet her to standing in the NICU surrounded by nurses waiting for a baby that would never come, in one morning.\u0027 The Traytes said when they arrived at the emergency room Elizabeth was fully clothed and claimed she didn\u0027t know them to a hospital case worker.Laura said: \u0027She stared at me with dead eyes.

Both are produced by Marvel Comics, the rival of DC Comics.  The film debuted in China on December 7 ahead of the U.S. The director James Wan, leading actor Jason Momoa and leading actress Amber Heard promoted the film in Beijing last month          Jason Momoa (left) takes selfies with fans during an event ahead of the \u0027Aquaman\u0027 movie\u0027s world premiere in Beijing in November. The film is seeing a huge success in the countryGenerally speaking, films based on characters from Marvel Comics, including Spider-man, Ironman and Captain America, perform better in box office in China.But Aquaman, the king of the seven seas, might well turn the tide. With an estimated production budget of $200 million (£157.4 million), \u0027Aquaman\u0027 has yielded a new opening-weekend record for DC Comics as well as its parent company Warner Bros in China.Interestingly, the country has its own underwater deity, the Dragon King under East Sea, in its ancient mythology.           Director James Wan\u0027s Chinese background has partially contributed to the success of the film.

Australian James Wan (温子仁) was born in Malaysia to a Chinese immigrant family.           DC Comics\u0027s \u0027Wonder Woman\u0027 grossed 610 million yuan (£69.7 million) in China last year          In comparison, \u0027Justice League\u0027 brought in 690 million yuan (£78.8 million) in China          China is expected to overtake North America to be the world\u0027s largest film market by 2020Chinese media have raved about 41-year-old Wan, praising his talent and the fact that someone with Chinese heritage has become a top-notch director in Hollywood. Mr Wan has expressed his gratitude to the Chinese market on Twitter. He wrote in a post yesterday: \u0027Thank you China, for the tremendous word-of-mouth.\u0027 \u0027Aquaman\u0027 will expand to 40 international countries next week. It will arrive in the UK on December 14 and in North American theaters on December 21. "},{"url":null,"title":"Network Rail admits major works taking place routes","story":"    All routes between Victoria and Clapham Junction will be closed over Christmas and New Year, London Paddington will suffer the same fate on December 23, 24 and 30.\u0027Who would have guessed the first day would be an utter...Can you spot what\u0027s wrong with this photo?

It will need to be levied until the GLA’s borrowing The London Evening Standard reports more than £500m has been raised since the levy was imposed. The DfT first announced an extra £590m for Crossrail in July, followed by a £350m loan to the Greater London Authority in October. Today’s loan, reportedy as much as £1.3bn, is also to the GLA.       A map of the new Elizabeth line which will take commuters from Reading and Heathrow Airport in the west to Shenfield and Abbey Wood in the eastThe announcement comes shortly after the resignation Sir Terry Morgan, chairman of HS2 ltd and Crossrail Ltd, last week.Asked why he thought he was being forced out, Sir Terry told BBC Radio 4\u0027s PM last week: \u0027I can only but assume, because I\u0027ve not yet been told, that because HS2 is such a critically important programme and with the sense of disappointment around the performance of Crossrail, that it was considered to be too risky for a programme like HS2 to continue in my role as chairman.\u0027The £15 billion new Tube line will eventually run from London\u0027s western suburbs into deepest Essex, linking Maidenhead and Heathrow Airport, with Paddington, Canary Wharf with Shenfield and Abbey Wood.When Sadiq Khan took office, the project was on time and budget. Its central section, which runs through the West End, was scheduled to be opened by the Queen this month.

Parkinson used the light that was available in the studio from its ceilings and lamps, and only specially lit shots of The Beatles reading the Financial Times, Gilbert wrote.The band did 10 takes of ‘Don’t Bother Me,’ and for an overdub of the song, Harrison ‘sang a second vocal and the rest of The Beatles added percussion on instruments from the studio’s store, McCartney playing a shaker, Starr an Arabian bongo and Lennon a tambourine,’ he wrote.Parkinson was known for wearing a Kashmiri wedding cap, and there are images where Lennon and McCartney sport it jokingly. The photographer invited his son, Simon, then aged 18, to the studio to meet The Beatles, according to the book.‘The atmosphere there was laid back: just four young phenomenally talented lads from Liverpool having a lot of fun. But, and this is a big ‘but,’ they were under the watchful care of that supreme Svengali, George Martin,’ Simon Parkinson recounted in the book. ‘He seemed to be everywhere.’George Martin was the producer on many of the band’s records, and has been referred to as the ‘fifth Beatle.’After ‘Don’t Bother Me,’ Parkinson photographed the band with Martin at the basement canteen at Abbey Road. After the break for the tea, the band was at it again, finishing ‘I Wanna Be Your Man,’ and the recording session ended up at around 11pm, according to the book.‘My father really enjoyed working with The Beatles, (recognizing) their enormous talent,’ Simon Parkinson said in the book. Norman Parkinson died in 1990. The photos he took that September day first appeared in ‘Queen,’ the magazine, and then for ‘The Beatles Book,’ a 40-page glossy magazine published in early 1964. Journalist Maureen Cleave provided the text for the glossy, and in 1966 she would interview Lennon when he said the group was ‘more popular than Jesus now.’Not long after that September photo shoot, The Beatles earned their second number 1 hit with ‘Love Me Do,’ and Beatlemania was born. The group headed to America in February 1964, and \u0027I want hold your hand\u0027 was a hit.

All the deaths occurred during or just after drinking bouts in which the victims consumed vast amounts of spirits in a short space of time while older students egged them on. One of the deceased, Maxwell Gruver, 19, a student at Louisiana State University, was found to have had a blood-alcohol level over .49 gdl at the time of his death – just .31 is considered life-threatening.“Nobody can physically drink that much ... You have to be forced to drink it,” his mother told ABC news. “It’s senseless. I mean, how is making your brother do all these things, and humiliating somebody, a brotherhood?”In his book True Gentlemen: The Broken Pledge of America’s Fraternities, John Hechinger notes that around 100,000 young men choose to be initiated into chapters annually, despite these all-male societies now being associated with what he describes as “the unholy trinity of fraternity life: racism, deadly drinking and misogyny”. Many of the young men they attract will go on to work in politics, finance and law-making, sometimes at the highest level. What’s more, the loyalties formed will be maintained throughout a working life in which the male, white and privileged look out for each other whatever their transgressions. Hechinger cites a fraternity promotional video that promises students a lifelong bond with “the best and brightest men on campus. Men who will become the best men at your wedding, pallbearers at your funeral and everything in between.”There is a funeral in Andrew Moisey’s timely and provocative photobook, The American Fraternity: An Illustrated Ritual Manual, though it is unrelated to anything that happened on the campus of the unnamed university where the images were documented. It does, though, show young men looking awkwardly ill at ease as they attend the most serious ritual of all. Elsewhere, the same young men seem altogether more relaxed in a closed, all-male campus environment where heavy drinking, boorishness, bullying and misogyny are the norms. A world in which homosexuality is taboo but cross-dressing and semi-naked wrestling are acceptable and parading your penis and testicles is almost de rigueur.“I wanted to show how the whole brotherhood thing that fraternity houses are built on actually tends to bring out the worst in young men, and the lofty ideals that once informed the organisations have now been replaced by pretty dreadful behaviour,” elaborates Moisey, who studied at Berkeley and now teaches at Cornell. “But I also wanted to get over the fact that, though these guys love to revel in their own debauchery, they don’t think of themselves as bad people.”Moisey, whose older brother was a member of the frat house in the book, began photographing there in 2008, when George W Bush, “the ultimate frat guy”, was president. “I was angry with Bush and the culture of white privilege that produced him and his values, but no one was that interested in the pictures. But now, suddenly it’s 2018 and the temperature has changed.”The book offers an uncomfortable glimpse of an enclosed world whose ultra-macho values have been sanctioned by the election of bully-in-chief Donald Trump, and his subsequent endorsement of Supreme Court judge Brett Kavanaugh. Interestingly, of the 18 presidents listed as ex-fraternity members in the book – including Kennedy, Reagan, Clinton and Bush – Trump is conspicuous by his absence. Kavanaugh, though, is included on the corresponding list of Supreme Court judges, even though the book went to the printers before his controversial confirmation. “I took a calculated risk on that one and it paid off,” says Moisey. “Out of a fraternity culture that protects bad seeds, one of the worst seeds gets elected to the Supreme Court.”The American Fraternity is a beautifully complex undertaking: the photobook as art object, conceptually mirroring an old fraternity handbook complete with pledges, prayers, vows and descriptions of the secretive rituals and rules that bind members for life. Hence images of excess and humiliation are contrasted with the grandly titled, quasi Masonic ceremonies that lend contemporary fraternity houses a historical legitimacy: the Ritual of Initiation, the Libations, the Candle Ceremony, Duties of the Chapter Orders. There are many disturbing visual echoes, including a grainy photograph of hooded inductees being humiliated that recalls images of prisoners being degraded at Abu Ghraib. Elsewhere, obviously distressed and inebriated young men are cajoled to drink more by older students with predictable results – retching, puking and unconsciousness. Aggression and humiliation are the norms here, the one driving the other.“Why are the girls there?” asks writer Cynthia Robinson in her edgy, questioning afterword. “Why did they go, why do they, to these parties where everyone knows what happens?” She then provides, from personal experience, an uncomfortable answer. “Let me tell you why, because I was there too. A sheltered southern girl eager to bust out, I was a frat-house regular by the end of my first semester. I passed out in frat houses too. Lots of girls did ... I was there because I wanted reassurance on a certain score: that I could be a certain thing, be a certain way. The girls in the images that comprise this book are there for the same reasons. They are there in order to reassure themselves, to perform for their peers, that they are desirable. Desired. This they want above all other things: to be desired.”Moisey’s black and white photographs move from portraiture to reportage to a low-lit style that is close to surveillance photography – some rituals are carried out in candlelight. Throughout, he is a detached observer, showing the unruly ordinariness of all-male campus dorm life – untidy bedrooms, filthy kitchens, graffiti-scrawled doors – alongside the debauchery and excess. The fraternity even has a pet dog, which seems to roam freely through the rooms and, in one awful image, is held by one drunken guy while being punched by another. Everything, it seems, is permitted in pursuit of this almost feral male camaraderie.“These all-male campus spaces have been around since the 1820s,” elaborates Moisey, “but they changed perceptibly during the so-called culture wars of the 1970s, becoming a safe space for guys who didn’t want to have to worry about having their kind of fun.” Many fraternities, he believes, now view themselves as embattled institutions, maintaining their conservative core values of brotherhood, privilege and machismo against a perceived liberal onslaught. Disturbingly, the code of loyalty to the brotherhood endures even after the other principles of fraternity life have long since fallen away.“The central issue is that there is an allegiance to everyone inside the fraternity rather than to the higher ideal,” says Moisey. “So even though most of these guys consider themselves highly respectable, their loyalty is such that they will protect the bad guys who hide in their midst. If you are a bad seed and you join a fraternity, you have found your safe haven. And what we are seeing right now is that the support and protection that fraternities provide for the bad seeds extends into the highest echelons of American power and decision-making.”The last image in the book shows a row of frat guys looking at a spread of Moisey’s photographs. They seem unconcerned, even amused, by what they depict. “I didn’t set out to expose them,” says Moisey, “I just wanted to show what hadn’t been shown before. And when I showed it to them, they were fine. As far as they are concerned, they’re just ordinary American guys doing what ordinary American guys do at college.”Revealingly, though, when Moisey first exhibited the work in a small show in Berkeley, it was his artist’s statement that drew the most media attention. It read: “This is what our leaders looked like when they were young.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/688fb54f14ffb6ca0b80d78bb920b14d01ccfc9b/0_0_3543_2657/master/3543.jpg?width=660\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2ca3d664e67dc83f376af83311a90498 660w","title":"tips links and suggestions what are you reading this week","story":"Your space to discuss the books you are reading and what you think of themWelcome to this week’s blogpost. Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week:First up, a treat. BerlinBirdie has been re-reading Old Glory, “Jonathan Raban’s account of sailing down the Mississippi in a small yellow boat”:Can this man write a dud sentence? The river becomes a massive character in itself, threatening and powerful, but the riverside towns, their decay or prosperity, also come to life. Raban has an incredible ear for people’s voices and though they’re all vignettes, as he’s just passing through, he gives a fascinating picture of the US in about 1980 (Carter was president) that has strong echoes today in all sorts of ways. Often very humorous - I feel the word “mordant” was invented for Raban.It also makes me very glad that he’s the one in the boat, not me. Terrifying!Hilary Mantel’s Bring Up The Bodies is “superb”, according to bluefairy:I really enjoyed Thomas Cromwell exacting his cold and calculated revenge on Norris, Bereton, Weston and Anne Boleyn in the Tower. I am really looking forward to the last in the series once it’s finally released but I actually like Thomas Cromwell’s character in the books and I’m not looking forward to him dying. I’m not the only one it seems as Hilary Mantel has said this is the sticking point with her writing the last book, she doesn’t want to write about his death.Colin Cotterill’s Love Songs from a Shallow Grave has upset nina1414:The Wayward Bus by John Steinbeck has delighted Dennis89:An absolute joy to read with a cast of characters straight out of an Edward Hopper painting. The sense of life’s frustrations and loneliness amid a backdrop of quiet desperation is so strong you can almost taste it. The guy understood the human condition of that there is no doubt.On the subject of the human condition, Tony Lewis-Jones has been reading Think Like Zuck: The Five Business Secrets of Facebook’s Improbably Brilliant CEO Mark Zuckerberg by Ekaterina Walter:A fascinating insight into the world and modus operandi of modern media and communications’ ‘Pied Piper’. Did you know for instance that Facebook claims to have ‘moles’ in the newsrooms of several major British media organisations, and the Facebook board of directors takes regular conference calls with the Trump White House ?Meanwhile, Stephen V Ash’s Civil War book, A Year in the South: 1865, has given Swelter new perspective:As the title states, historian Ash covers one year in the lives of his four protagonists – a slave in Alabama, a recently widowed mother of 7 in Virginia, the adult son of a small plantation owner in Mississippi, and a young Confederate veteran and former POW in Tennessee – with a prologue summarising what is known of their lives before that year and an epilogue describing their subsequent lives as far as possible.This is a terrific book – Ash gives us these lives with novelistic detail, while efficiently and clearly filling in historical and social contexts where necessary. Beyond putting a human face on historic events, each of the characters becomes a rounded personality in whose fortunes the reader becomes involved … This would make for thoughtful reading over the New Year – offering material for reflecting on how much or how little change a year can bring to a human life.But before we get to the New Year, there’s Christmas and JayZed has just the thing for that:I treated myself to an early Christmas present last week and bought The Penguin Book of the Contemporary British Short Story, edited by Philip Hensher, which is an absolute delight. I’ve indulged myself over the weekend and have particularly enjoyed stories by AL Kennedy, Ali Smith and Jackie Kay, although many of the stories that are not by Scottish women are also very good. It’s making me appreciate what a fine art form the short story is and how much skill and technique it takes to write a good one. I’ve never been much of a short story reader before but need to change that habit.Sounds like a worthy resolution.If you’re on Instagram, now you can share your reads with us: simply tag your posts with the hashtag #Books, and we’ll include a selection in this blog.

The retail entrepreneur states in the Liberum note that he quit the company’s board in March because he could not “put his name to the strategy”.Dunkerton told Liberum: “The interaction between stores and the internet is going to be so fundamental to the future of retail. Consumers have adopted the internet and, by doing so, have moved away from the limitations of the high street and towards a world of unlimited choice. The premise here is if one does not participate in this world you will get left behind.”The dispute is centred on Superdry’s strategy of reducing the number of products it sells. Dunkerton told Liberum that expanding when the broader market was struggling had “always been our way … and now is the perfect storm”.However, following a profit warning in October, Dunkerton told the BBC that he was willing to return to the company “in any capacity” in order to turn the company around. Superdry at the time said its board had reviewed his criticisms of the strategy but that the current board had a different view.Superdry declined to comment but it is understood that the firm still disagrees with Dunkerton’s views on the company’s strategy.The retailer, which has 246 stores, including 102 in the UK, has struggled this year, blaming unseasonably hot weather for weaker sales. The company is due to report its performance in the first half of the financial year on Wednesday.Dunkerton has hired a public relations firm as part of his campaign to return to Superdry. Brown, the Liberum analyst, formerly worked with Dunkerton as Superdry’s head of investor relations for five months in 2014, according to a social media profile.Dunkerton, who launched his retail career by selling clothes on a Cheltenham market stall, co-founded the company in 2003 with the designer James Holder. Aside from his business interests, in August, Dunkerton has donated £1m to the People’s Vote campaign, the group calling for a second referendum on the final Brexit deal.Superdry, which listed on the London Stock Exchange in 2010 and is a member of the FTSE 250, grew quickly in part because of celebrity endorsement, with names such as David Beckham and Zac Efron wearing the brand.

As successors to bog-standard incinerators they are supposed to be efficient, but they use untested technology and are not as efficient as billed because about half of the power they generate is used to clean the emissions they produce.Worse, they are being built at a time when there is a huge surplus of EFW capacity across Europe as countries turn to recycling rather than simply burning waste.You might think that Lord Blackwell, Interserve’s from 2004, and its chief executive Adrian Ringrose, who ran the show from 2003 before they both bailed out in 2016 and 2017 respectively, would have seen the dangers of stepping into the incinerator industry. Apparently not.The government is a big fan of incinerators as a quick way to redirect waste away from landfill. Almost every county and city in England has one or has commissioned one.For environmental campaigners, the situation is so dire that some councils have found themselves signing contracts to provide incinerators with levels of waste that far exceed the needs of the local population, leaving them no option but to burn stuff that could be recycled.Maybe Ringrose and Blackwell saw this as an exciting opportunity with a guaranteed income stream, one that could be bolted on to the boring facilities management contracts it has with government departments. The exciting opportunity offered by taking over probation services in England was also too good to miss.Now the company is paying tens of millions of pounds to extricate itself from EFW contracts while its partners accuse Interserve managers of not really understanding the business and missing contract deadlines.The deals at the heart of the problem are in Derby and Glasgow, and it would be unfair to say all the delays are Interserve’s fault. The main supplier of the gas turbines for the incinerators pulled out last year, leaving the projects high and dry. Determining fault is for the lawyers, but in the meantime Interserve struggles on.A recession next year is looming without a dramatic turn of events. That’s the outlook presented by the latest GDP numbers.They show that the economy went into 2018 with modest momentum only to e when the Beast from the East arrived in March. A pick up in the summer given an extra lift from the World Cup provided some respite, but the three months to October have been dire.We know from most business surveys that not much changed in November, and December is looking decidedly subdued.This pattern shows the economy is heading into the new year without any momentum, and any further hits to output will be reflected in negative GDP numbers.One remedy could be an upswing in consumer spending across the continent that boosts UK exports. Another would be a second referendum that keeps the UK in the EU’s single market. Even Donald Trump ending his trade war with China could bring the kind of confidence boost that businesses are looking for.Any of these could help avoid a recession next year., but with parliament deadlocked and the prime minister unable to chaperone her Brexit deal through without it being shredded, the uncertainty persists. In the rest of Europe, confidence is waning and Trump remains at loggerheads with Beijing. No wonder the pessimists feel vindicated."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eb459377058d751f6a477382206cbe51c8b4ae96/0_314_1320_792/master/1320.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f483aa46aa0f078034db5944b686de6e","title":"the anxious art of liana finck people who dont live in cities think im being so mean","story":"As part of our new series, the illustrated city, artist Liana Finck explains why she thinks urban living makes people so angry – and how drawing on the subway gave her her trademark styleHuman beings: can’t live with them, can’t live without them. Nowhere is this truer than in cities where, increasingly, we live on top of each other in ever-denser spaces and no one captures the resultant moments of friction better than Liana Finck. The New Yorker cartoonist has accumulated a loyal following for her line drawings conveying – in unpretentious, quivering pen strokes – all the micro-aggressions and anxieties that navigating a city provokes.In fact, she says by phone from New York, her trademark style – that can just as effectively convey apprehension or bristling anger – is derived from drawing on the subway. “That’s where my signature wiggly lines come from. A subway helps me not fake them.”While her new graphic memoir, Passing for Human, centres on family, the single panel vignettes she posts on Instagram reflect her observations of urban life and how its etiquette is breached or upheld. “I think it inspires my Instagram drawings because I use those mostly to figure out things that are bothering me and make sense of them. I know that every city must have a different flavour of micro-aggression, but I have a feeling that New York must be worse than others.”Finck’s keen observation of human behaviour reflects acute awareness – to the point of self-consciousness – of her own. She regularly draws in cafes, not out of necessity but because the quiet of her studio is not conducive to work. It is clearly a rich seam of complicated feelings for her. “I feel a lot of shame about it, I don’t know why. I feel like it’s rude to spend longer than a couple of hours in a cafe. I feel bad when baristas start recognising me, like some weird eccentric.“The point is to get your coffee, give them your business, and then get out and let someone else buy something. I hate when there’s not enough tables and there’s people quietly fighting for them.”Many of the misbehaviours (she calls them “micro-unkindnesses”) that catch her attention are fleeting and, some might say, inconsequential – like someone intruding on your space in a packed elevator or the “pedestrian rage” directed at slow walkers. Somewhat ironically, it’s those drawings that draw the most negative response on Instagram. “People who don’t live in cities think I’m being so mean,” she says.“I guess it’s the same thing they don’t like in Larry David – like, ‘why am I being so needlessly mean spirited’? It seems like I’m nitpicking, like I’m choosing this tiny thing that annoys me and blowing this thing out of proportion instead of seeing the bigger picture.”But Finck frames it as “noticing how civilisation works” – moments when the urban fabric is momentarily pulled taut. If you do not pay these trivial transgressions any mind, it may be because city living fosters – maybe demands – a certain obliviousness, a thicker skin. But not everyone develops it.“Sometimes I feel like a person who notices these things in a world of blind people who don’t,” says Finck, the sound of car horns faintly audible in the background. “We’re just putting away our bodies, packing them in the most efficient way possible, while our minds can go anywhere.”If you’re an illustrator or graphic artist with an idea for the illustrated city series, email us at cities@theFollow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8d4e584bd8d1a81a796341ddeeaeaf42427de73f/0_304_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=043c50865248e4a28cae4e35e2cd6438","title":"priti patel brexit ignorance ireland vote uk","story":"Priti Patel’s appalling comment about using food shortages to pressurise Ireland in the Brexit negotiations showed a breathtaking ignorance of history. However, while the boorishness of her remark is in a category of its own, misunderstanding Ireland has become a common feature of public discourse in the UK.“Backstop” was listed by the Collins Dictionary recently as one of the new or notable words of 2018. It defines “backstop” as a system that will come into effect if no other arrangement is made. The concept became so current in the context of solving the Brexit Northern Ireland conundrum that negotiators came to talk comfortably about a “backstop to the backstop”. However, there are deeper challenges to mutual understanding than being able to agree on the meaning of a word. The two years since the Brexit referendum have witnessed a startling decline in the capacity of many in London to understand Ireland.I can testify from four decades of working with British colleagues on EU issues, that our shared membership of the EU developed a deep mutual understanding between us. We found that we could agree on many issues but also importantly that, when our views differed, we could understand each other exceptionally well. Each grasped where the other was coming from. Each understood the other’s way of doing business. We realised that we shared a language not just linguistically but metaphorically.It is therefore worrying that, in the emotional turmoil of Brexit, a large swathe of opinion in London, although of course by no means everyone, has come to misunderstand seven major aspects of Ireland: our motivation, allegiance, influence, intelligence, resolve, politics and friendship.Ireland’s allegiance to the EU likewise seems to have come as a surprise to some in London. However, it is logical and inevitable. Ireland hopes for the closest of relationships with the UK into the future but we will be part of the European Union and not part of the United Kingdom.Perhaps the misunderstanding that has proved most upsetting to the Brexiteers has been their recent discovery of Ireland’s influence. They should have understood that for the first time in history Ireland, with the inevitable strong support of our 26 EU partners, would no longer have the weaker diplomatic hand. They should have anticipated that the power relationship of the past would no longer apply.Then there is the misunderstanding of Ireland’s intelligence – not a new phenomenon of course, but one that had seemed to be a thing of the past. There have been breezy comments about simple technological solutions to the border issue, whimsical suggestions that this could all be sorted out later, and at one point a waggish suggestion that, if it’s alright with you lads, the backstop will be time-limited. To be fair, Dublin has had the advantage of being able to focus on the complex issues rather than on dealing with friendly fire.Many in London also fundamentally misread Ireland’s resolve. They believed that the Irish government was grandstanding and would eventually cave in. That particular penny has now dropped.The depth of ignorance about Irish politics, including from some Conservative MPs, has truly made us laugh rather than cry. One thinks, to cite just one example, of the suggestion that Taoiseach Leo Varadkar was doing Sinn Fein’s bidding. More significantly, there has been a serious underestimation of the depth of public support in Ireland for the Irish government’s policy.Most importantly of all, many in London have significant misconceptions about Ireland’s friendship for Britain and for its people. The mutual affection and respect which characterised Queen Elizabeth’s state visit to Ireland in 2011 are now deeply rooted in Irish minds and hearts. They will not be dislodged by the aggression and condescension that has characterised some of the recent comment from London. Not even by Patel. The affection and respect between our peoples will transcend Brexit, if it happens. But equally our friendship with Britain today is one of equals and will not deflect us, as committed and confident members of the European Union, from pursuing our interests, none of which is greater than maintaining the status quo of the Good Friday agreement insofar as that is possible in the circumstances created by Brexit.In fact, Collins Dictionary’s “chosen word” for 2018, among the many new coinages, was “single-use”. It might be useful for MPs to look up that word too as they reflect on the Northern Ireland backstop. They should take some reassurance from the definition of “single-use” that is “designed to be used and then disposed of or destroyed”. But then they should also look up the words “unless” and “until”.• Bobby McDonagh was Ireland’s ambassador to the UK from 2009-13"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/46aa3aa5373c40ca845af6ad27651492c0f1de49/22_12_1681_1009/master/1681.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=713507534c4d0434314fe233a9c3f370","title":"the guardian view on the brexit vote the prime minister is on the run","story":"Theresa May decided to pull the parliamentary vote on her Brexit withdrawal agreement because she knew she would lose. She has been humiliated by her own MPs. It is staggering that this defeat only became obvious to her after it had been clear to everyone else for weeks. In the end, she chose to run rather than stand and fight for what she had agreed with European leaders. Mrs May is not saving her leadership, she is devaluing it to the point of worthlessness. The prime minister has no one to blame but herself for this mess. In the last two years the government has devoted itself to leaving the European Union in a manner consistent with Mrs May’s obsessions – primarily controlling immigration. Her resulting withdrawal agreement has been rubbished by her own unruly troops. They will not be easily instructed to march in a different direction.The prime minister is trying to buy herself time by getting Brussels to accept some tweaks in her Brexit deal over the Northern Ireland backstop as a means of persuading some doubters to vote for it. These will be cosmetic, as EU leaders say there can be no further renegotiation of the terms of the UK’s departure.The threats to Mrs May are multiplying. In parliament, the prime minister foreshadowed a constitutional trial of strength in a furious exchange with the Commons speaker, John Bercow. Mr Bercow rightly called for MPs to be allowed to vote on postponing the Brexit debate. In rejecting this, the prime minister continues to treat parliament with contempt.Crises of this nature are only resolved in line with a Commons majority. Mrs May’s actions invite MPs across parties to coordinate with one another so they make the conduct of the government impossible unless ministers bow to their will. It is important to note that Mrs May’s deal, even in its refined form, will garner less support in the Commons than either another referendum, in which the risk of the option of a catastrophic “no deal” is endorsed by a weary public, or some variant of the Norway deal, in which we give up sovereignty for economic stability.The prime minister wants to play for time, saying only that the vote on her deal, replete with reassurances, will be held by 21 January – the last possible date to do so. If dodging a defeat becomes the only way for Mrs May to survive, then the indications are that she will delay a vote until the last possible moment. This is playing politics with the nation’s stability. It ill behoves any prime minister to be so cavalier about such a serious issue.Her decision to stay on is one based on her own self-interest and that of her party rather than the country. The prime minister is now a diminished figure, with her authority draining away on the most important issue facing Britain. It is galling to hear her claim that the 2016 referendum vote was a cry for help from left-behind Britain when it was Tory austerity that hollowed out deprived regions. Since then, Brexit has immobilised the government, leaving it unable to deal with these problems.Mrs May might claim that she lives to fight another day. But given that the leadership is on the run from the hard Brexiters, she lives on only as a political zombie. Ensnared by her own convictions, she has resorted to dilatory tactics because she has belatedly realised the full weight of their burden. When, at last, she has been forced to recognise this, she found herself alone and politically friendless in a party that prefers accommodation of its prejudices to political calculation – let alone what is best for this country."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b834c6a740128f326b7ff8bf56def7c192ba3de0/0_29_6144_3686/master/6144.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c16d11f6c4e05aa3541d8225b80f540e","title":"why do we endlessly re enact this ridiculous victorian fantasy for christmas","story":"Every poxy advert on television features nuclear families and hilarity about socks.

In a small pan, warm the oil over a medium heat and fry the onion for seven or eight minutes, until soft.Meanwhile, gently toast the cumin, coriander and fenugreek seeds in a small, dry frying pan over a medium heat for a minute or two, until they smell fragrant, then grind in a mortar or spice grinder. Add the garlic, ginger and all the spices to the onions, and saute for four to five minutes more to soften the garlic and ginger.Finally, stir in the tomato puree, remove from the heat, season well and turn the mixture out on to a plate to cool. If you are going to cook the sausage rolls right away, heat the oven to 180C (160C fan)350Fgas 4.Once the onion mix is cool, stir in the sausagemeat and breadcrumbs. Fry a little of the mixture in a pan to check the seasoning – you may want to add a pinch more salt. Now remove the pastry from the fridge, put on a floured surface and cut in half lengthways. Divide the sausagemeat in half and roll into two long sausages. Put a sausage along the length of each pastry and brush the long edges with egg wash. Roll the pastries around the meat and press the pastry together where it meets, using a fork to crimp the edges. Brush all over with egg wash, sprinkle with fennel seeds and cut into mini rolls about the thickness of a walnut – any thinner and they will fall over in the oven. At this stage, you can freeze them, separating the layers with parchment paper.Bake for 20-25 minutes, until puffed and golden, and serve with red onion marmalade, chutney or simply by themselves.You can double the quantity of the sausage filling to make meatballs – delicious with a simple ginger- and garlic-scented tomato sauce. This is an option for coeliacs if you omit the breadcrumbs from the filling. Buy extra pastry to freeze – always handy for whipping up a quick tart or makeshift pizza."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7621bd046358b9989b396c58ad4f6e8014cedc8c/0_105_3707_2225/master/3707.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=680a564780ebb635d095bbcc5b466cfe","title":"barcelona tottenham hotspur champions league preview","story":"Mauricio Pochettino calls it his town and whenever his busy schedule permits, he invariably heads back there. The Tottenham manager first moved to Barcelona as a 22-year-old in 1994, when he joined Eyol from Newell’s Old Boys in his native Argentina as a player, and it is the place where he feels centred and relaxed full of energy.Pochettino still has a house in the north of the city, close to the mountains, and his setup is certainly appealing. He can go for a run along the stunning Carretera de las Aigues, as he has done since the Eyol days – mixing fitness with contemplation – while the sea, weather and restaurants are obvious attractions.What Pochettino loves most about Barcelona is its manageable size. Unlike London, he can get to places quickly, enabling him to cram a lot of things into a day. When he became the manager at Eyol and would spend 10-12 hours at the training ground, there was always the possibility of nipping out into the centre for a lunch.Barcelona just works for Pochettino and it holds many memories. Both his sons were born here while, on the field, he won two Copa Del Reys as an Eyol player before making the transition into management at the club.Pochettino could feel the pull of his personal history when he touched down at El Prat airport on Monday afternoon – it was inevitable – but it is what happens next that has him in thrall. Standing between him and the knockout phase of the Champions League are Barcelona, the club he has long aligned himself against. Pochettino has said on more than one occasion he could never manage them because of his Eyol connections.Spurs have to match the result Internazionale manage against PSV Eindhoven in Milan, which most people expect will be a win. And so, deep breath, this is how Pochettino has dreamed it – he will beat Barcelona on their own turf and advance in style.Pochettino has done it before. In February 2009, a month or so after his appointment as the Eyol manager, he took his team to the Camp Nou in La Liga. They were down at the bottom Barcelona at the top. Yet Eyol surprised their rivals by pressing them high and they won 2-1. It was the first victory of Pochettino’s managerial career and it ignited a successful push for survival. In nine other visits to Camp Nou as a player and manager, he has lost each time.The big news on Monday was that Pochettino’s counterpart, Ernesto Valverde, intends to make changes. Some Spanish newspapers predicted they would be wholesale and two that have been virtually confirmed are the omissions of the goalkeeper Marc-André ter Stegen and the striker Luis Suárez, who has only just returned from injury. Barcelona are already assured of top spot in Group B. Why take risks?There are question marks over whether Gerard Piqué, Sergio Busquets and Ivan Rakitic, among others, will start, while Valverde refused to be drawn on his intentions over Lionel Messi. “You’ll know in 24 hours,” he said.Pochettino accepted that Suárez would be an “important miss” and it was easy to feel Valverde’s likely lineup represented a marginal gain for Spurs. Pochettino, though, would have none of that.“The quality in their squad is massive,” he said. “It’s difficult to fight for a place with Suárez and Messi, and whoever plays will be very motivated to show they can compete for more minutes. We are going to be ready to compete in our best condition, I’m so optimistic and we need to think like this. It’s so important we think about the job we want to do, not what Barcelona want to do.”Pochettino confirmed the 21-year-old Kyle Walker-Peters would make his full Champions League debut at right-back, because of groin injuries to Kieran Trippier and Serge Aurier, and what a challenge it promises to be for him. The manager might have shuffled around his more experienced players and used Eric Dier, for example, in the position but he radiated the sort of conviction regarding Walker-Peters that he wants his team to show.“I want to remind you that Walker-Peters won the Under-20 World Cup in Korea last year and his quality is unbelievable,” Pochettino said. ≠≠“You need to trust young players. To play in the Nou Camp will make him stronger but, most importantly, we trust in him whatever happens. He will be a success in the long term for this club.”Walker-Peters aside, Pochettino’s lineup will bristle with experience. The captain, Hugo Lloris, was a World Cup winner with France in July and there will be players alongside him from the England and Belgium teams who reached the semi-finals. Nerve, patience and game-management will be key, together with the eradication of errors.Pochettino, who said he would keep abreast of the scoreline in Milan, knows his team deserved more from the away games against Inter and PSV but they did not get it and so it has come down to this. For him, it could scarcely be primed more tantalisingly. A defining occasion looms."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ab2b7dcebfaf488c866cdc8cb37b159f1741965b/0_24_2295_1377/master/2295.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=06e79fbab9591c2051e744f7f5b01679","title":"everton watford premier league match report","story":"Watford fans brought inflatable snakes to taunt Marco Silva but were deflated when Lucas Digne’s stoppage-time free-kick denied them a first victory since October. Three points, the only true way to punish their former manager, were in sight when Christian Kabasele handled just outside his penalty area. The visitors were resigned to their fate before the French full-back floated the ball inside the top corner to rescue a point for Everton.Richarlison, Everton’s £40m summer signing from Vicarage Road, gave Everton a controversial early lead that was long forgotten by the time Gylfi Sigurdsson failed to convert a second half penalty. Seamus Coleman had put through his own goal by that stage, with Abdoulaye Doucoure converting a towering header seconds later to give Watford their first victory since 27 October. Everton could have no complaints after a second consecutive meagre display on home soil.Watford’s dispute with Everton over what they deemed an “unwarranted approach” for Silva last year remains unresolved. It was their decision to sack the Portuguese coach in January following a run of one win in 11 matches but the circumstances that preceded his exit still rankle. He was greeted with a display of inflatable snakes in the away section before kick-off as the Watford fans who journeyed to Merseyside on a Monday night made their feelings clear. It was their former player, not their ex-manager, who caused the greater upset on the night, however.Richarlison scored five goals in his first 13 outings for Watford last season but none in the 28 games that followed. The Brazil international eclipsed that sum in his 10th appearance for Everton and claimed his eighth of the season when sweeping the hosts into an early, polished yet controversial lead. There was no disputing the quality of the move that brought Silva’s current team the lead. Theo Walcott, making his 300th Premier League appearance, released Seamus Coleman down the right and he found André Gomes moving into space on the edge of the Watford area. The Portugal international exchanged touches with Walcott before delivering an inch-perfect ball for Richarlison to convert beyond Ben Foster at close range. But Walcott was clearly offside when he received Gomes’s pass and, despite mass appeals from those in green, the referee, Kevin Friend, and his assistant were unmoved. Watford had another grievance with Everton.The hosts were bright in attack with Bernard and Gylfi Sigurdsson bringing finesse and vision in the final third. The pair almost combined to create a second for Richarlison but Craig Cathcart made a crucial intervention facing his own goal. The Northern Ireland defender also denied Sigurdsson when the Iceland international attempted to guide a finish past Foster and Yerry Mina was booked for deliberate handball from the No 10’s inviting cross.Watford also threatened regularly in an open, flowing first half. Roberto Pereyra found himself in space inside the Everton area with only a minute gone but shot tamely at Jordan Pickford. Troy Deeney volleyed over from two yards out when Isaac Success shot across goal – his blushes were spared by an offside flag – and the visiting captain steered a long ball from Domingos Quina wide on the stroke of half-time.Mina flirted with a second yellow card when he took Success and the ball as the forward broke in search of an equaliser. Enough of the ball in Friend’s view, to the obvious disgust of Success and Javi Gracia in the Watford technical area. They would find consolation in their team’s dominant start to the second half.The visitors’ strength, pace and movement – combined with a careless and chaotic restart by the hosts – turned the contest firmly in their favour. Silva raged at his players from the sidelines but the lead evaporated before the Everton manager could implement change. Pereyra, Abdoulaye Doucouré and Deeney went close before the equaliser arrived fortuitously but not without merit. A slip by Lucas Digne invited former Evertonian Gerard Deulofeu to release Kiko Femenia down the left. His first-time cross was steered on to a post by Pereyra but, just as Watford thought their luck was out, the rebound struck Coleman on the thigh and rolled into an empty net.Watford were ahead two minutes later thanks to another raid down their right. As Everton dawdled over a free-kick, Gracia’s team reacted sharply with Femenia playing Pereyra into space. The Argentinian delivered a deep cross to the back post where Doucouré rose above Coleman and sent a textbook header past Pickford.The game had exploded into life and seconds later Everton were awarded a penalty when Christian Kabasele needlessly jumped into the back of Mina when competing for a Digne throw-in. Sigurdsson seized the responsibility to draw his team level but, as with his spot-kick against Fulham earlier in the season, was unable to convert. Foster saved the penalty with his trailing leg to deepen Silva’s frustration against his old employers."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/18d827209f8486c033b135f5840b1ff8a6a0a203/0_50_2686_1611/master/2686.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8ea44914b0a75bbbdfb4aa402530b8db","title":"racism in football raheem sterling manchester city chelsea","story":"After a troubling week with two high-profile incidents in the Premier League, we want to hear from fansRaheem Sterling says sections of the media “fuel racism” in football after being the subject of alleged racist abuse during a Premier League match on Saturday.

Snipers stood on roofs and helicopters circled. Something big was happening. “We’ll know how it feels,” Marca said, which they wouldn’t of course, but like everyone else they hoped to find out. And, like everyone else, they were trying. Politicians packed the place, more even than usual, and people arrived from everywhere, papers dedicating dozens of pages. Florentino Pérez left Real Madrid’s match at Huesca early to be there and the best player in the world was due as soon as he’d finished, his club mates too. The third best was there. And so was the fifth.Leo Messi boarded a plane bound for the Bernabéu, where he’s scored more than any visitor, but he wasn’t playing this time. This was the weekend when Javi Calleja was sacked as Villarreal manager and a last-minute equaliser for Valencia couldn’t stop Mestalla whipping out white hankies when Betis defender Sidnei went all Maradona, or so they said, and Eibar and Levante went wild when Cornellá hosted the Catalan derby and Butarque the “southern derby”, Leganés’s mascot presiding over an on-pitch proposal at half-time against Getafe because nothing says romance like a six-foot cucumber. Yet much of that didn’t warrant a word because this was also the weekend when Madrid hosted the derby one they tried to make their own, although it’s not.The Copa Libertadores came to Spain: River-Boca at the Santiago Bernabéu, never quite the same but still quite something. And Messi, like almost everyone else, didn’t want to miss it. Yet if there was anything that shouldn’t be missed – this weekend and pretty much every other weekend too – it is Messi. One day, not so far away now, it won’t be a choice to make, and then it will be too late, Saturday underlining how much of a void he may leave. The Catalan derby had been billed as the most even in memory, Eyol chasing a Champions League place, but in front of 24,037 at Cornellá-Prat, the stadium half-empty, Barcelona defeated Eyol 4-0, Messi making a myth of equality.Ousmane Dembélé scored a lovely goal, Luis Suárez too, but this was about him – and this weekend of all weekends, as if any excuse was needed, which perhaps it is and perhaps that’s the problem. This weekend Messi did something unusual: he did something he hasn’t done before, exceeding his own expectations.On 15 minutes, he ran through, got fouled, got up and began his ritual. He put the ball on the floor, twisting it, almost screwing it into the turf, and stepped back. On the touchline, Barcelona’s manager watched. “I was thinking: Diego López es well he’s going to have to hit it perfectly,” Ernesto Valverde said, and that’s what he did, bending it high and hard, from left to right, always just beyond López’s reach, almost taunting him as it went, and into the top corner. Then, an hour in, he did it again, only into the other corner. “Sometimes you take a load of free-kicks and don’t score,” Messi said after. Yeah, and sometimes you do.This was the first time he’d scored two free-kicks in a game by the end, there was almost a hint of disappointment he didn’t score a hat-trick of them. “There’s not much I can say, not much I can add to what everyone has seen. Against a free-kick taker like him, there’s not much you can do, although you have to try something: sneak forward, stand on your toes, take the wall away maybe,” Rubí said. Messi has scored 10 free-kicks in 2018, while over the last four years, he’s scored more than any team in Europe’s five biggest leagues, ahead of Juventus, Bayern, Madrid and PSG.Like that’s everything anyway, even if some players have made a career of that. “If you don’t foul him, he gets through to the ‘kitchen’,” Rubí admitted. The kitchen, you see, is right at the back at the house, or at least it’s supposed to be. “We tried to cut off his path and if we fouled him it’s because we had to,” Rubí added. On Saturday Messi scored two, sure, but he also created five chances. You could take his first half alone, take each of the things he did, spread them out, one per game, and distribute them to just about any other footballer and you’ve got a candidacy for player of the month, two months running. It is not just what he does, it’s how much he does: the relentlessness, the repetitiveness, how routine it becomes.Even for Messi, this was superb. “His Magnum opus,” El Mundo called it. He was hyperactive – if there is a moment that stands out, it might even be when he chased back to win the ball, which is kind of daft really, but makes sense in a man-bites-dog sort of way. Perhaps there was some extra motivation in the week he finished fifth in the Ballon d’Or and Pelé bizarrely insisted he is one-footed, bad in the air, and only has one skill. Or perhaps it is everything that goes around him that makes it feel that way, everything that is said. Not so much what Pelé said as the very fact he said it. Perhaps it is the game – a derby – and the timing, the context, as much as the performance. And, yes, that makes these pages guilty too. It would be a nonsense to claim that he gets ignored but sometimes, maybe an excuse is needed for Messi to be the story.This week, there was one, that’s for sure. It’s just a pity that the excuse is often translated as indignation, some slightly strange, occasionally tiresome rage, an often-unnecessary, sometimes unpleasant anger. As if Luka Modric, or Cristiano Ronaldo or Antoine Griezmann or Kylian Mbappé are rubbish, unworthy of respect or celebration as if three European Cups or a World Cup mean nothing. As if awards actually matter that much, anyway – if there was a recurring theme on Saturday, it was Messi’s place in the Ballon d’Or. Everywhere it seemed people recalled that he’d finished fifth – a single word that seemed to come in italics and with its own built-in ?!.Democracy was derided and France Football stood accused. A grand conspiracy at worst at best, journalists who know nothing. Even though players and managers returned the same verdict. If there is something in the surprise – on ESPN, presenter Dan Thomas asked a simple, incisive question: “If this had been Messi’s first season …?” – if Messi pays for having normalised the abnormal, held to different standards if there is some underlying if not entirely justified desire for something new among voters, there is also a difference between player of the year award and best player. And the stage on which awards are decided are often different ones.Cornellá may not condition the Ballon d’Or, but the Ballon d’Or did appear to condition Cornellá it provided the context, at least. The response, too. “O Rei Messi,” cheered the cover of El Mundo Deportivo, its headline pointing Pelé’s way “the Ballon d’Or blushes”, claimed the front of Sport: it, like Barcelona’s kit, had gone pink with embarrassment. “The Ballon d’Or is very strange, but for us he’s the number one,” Gerard Piqué said. “The Ballon d’Or is a lie,” Jordi Alba added. But on the weekend when Argentina’s best game eclipsed all else and so did Argentina’s best player, Valverde put it best: “It’s bloody brilliant that Messi’s here with us.”• “We didn’t just park our arses in our own area, and the players did everything I asked of them. Sometimes I tell them that we have to be calmer when we’re in the lead, but that’s not the way I am and they tend to follow the way their manager is.” That’s what José Luis Mendilibar said and that’s the way we like him. This week above all, when Eibar and Levante went from 1-0 to 1-2 and from 4-2 to 4-4, a 92nd-minute goal providing the finish to a morning of madness.• “We did almost nothing in the second half,” Thibaut Courtois said and he wasn’t wrong. Apart from about himself. Gareth Bale’s first league goal for 99 days was just about all Madrid did as they somehow managed a victory at bottom-of-the-table Huesca. “Vulgar,” AS called them.• Two late goals from Carlos Bacca could not salvage anything for Villarreal against Celta and could not save their manager either. Javi Calleja has been sacked – and not, in truth, before time. Iago Aspas is very, very good, by the way – but then you knew that already.• Athletic Bilbao have changed their manager mid-season for the first time in a decade, but they won’t be changing their philosophy. Gaizka Garitano takes charge for the first time in the league on Monday. They haven’t won since the opening day."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1ffedcb5eea8bf11058a6dee456ccc3ac1a382a/0_134_3446_2067/master/3446.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=21263ed903414140f31d66333dceff85","title":"russia football film coach trener","story":"The second-ision team from a distant and ill-favoured coastal town are in the cup final. They’re playing in a big stadium against the country’s most glamorous and history-laden club. They go two goals down, and a pall of inevitability settles over the match. But then, suddenly, they start to score. The first goal receives applause. The second gets a cheer. When the third goes in, the place erupts.Except this is not a football stadium. This is a cinema in central London last week, at the closing event of the annual Russian film festival. This is a gala screening of Coach, attended by an audience containing many shaven-headed men who look as though they had to be reminded to leave their hardware at home and an unusually high proportion – for a football film, anyway – of good-looking young women in Sloane Street fashions.This is a Russian-made, Russian-language film, and your correspondent – who read about it that morning and snapped up just about the last remaining ticket – is one of a handful of non-Russian speakers present at the National Film Theatre. That much becomes clear when the audience reacts to the jokes in the script. The English subtitles can be read before the actors have finished saying the lines, but not until they have been spoken does the laughter erupt. Your correspondent has not felt so isolated on home territory since he was one of possibly only two non-French people in the Royal Albert Hall the last time Johnny Hallyday played in London.Football being the universal language of the modern age, Coach – Russian title: Trener – is not hard to understand. This is not Eisenstein, Tarkovsky or Sokurov we are talking about here. This is a combination of bits of Escape to Victory, Rocky, Invictus and – perhaps most of all – Brassed Off, that lovely little film in which a raggle-taggle brass band from a depressed colliery town defy the odds, and all that Margaret Thatcher’s pit-closure programme can throw at them, to triumph in the national championship.The director, Danila Kozlovsky, also stars as Yuri, hero-captain of Russia’s national team. Looking a bit like Adam Lallana, or perhaps Isco, he disgraces himself during a crucial home match against Romania by grabbing the ball from the regular penalty taker, trying something flashy and blowing it. “Why choose a Panenka at a moment like that?” one of his teammates remonstrates. Yuri loses his rag, gets sent off and has a fight with furious fans on the way to the tunnel.So far, all a bit The Goalkeeper’s Anxiety at the Penalty Kick, albeit with match sequences constructed via expensive CGI and green-screen technology and the use of a cast including real professional footballers. Inevitably Yuri sinks into the slough of despond – represented by a spell in amateur rugby on pitches that resemble the outskirts of Stalingrad after the siege – before being offered a second chance with the Russian equivalent of Grimsby Town, where he overcomes dressing-room conflicts with embittered old pros, falls in love with the club’s beautiful, sensitive young female physio (maybe there’s a bit of The Tommy Docherty Story in there, too) and returns to glory with that climactic victory over Spartak in Moscow.As the cinema lights go up, it seems no oligarchs are present there are no VIP hospitality boxes in NFT1. But at the very end of the film their presence is suddenly apparent. As the credits near their conclusion, the screen is filled with special thanks to three people without whom, it seems, the film could not have been made. One name is unfamiliar and scrolls up too quickly to be noted down. The other two are very familiar indeed.One is that of Vitaly Leontiyevich Mutko, well known to those who have followed Russian sport in the post-Soviet era. Mutko is a 60-year-oldlawyer who worked with Vladimir Putin to set up the 1994 Goodwill Games in St Petersburg, became president of FC Zenit, founded the Russian Premier League, was elected to parliament, became president of the Russian Football Union, was appointed minister for sport and ran the country’s successful bid to host the 2018 World Cup. Two years ago Putin promoted him to deputy prime minister.He was also implicated in the saga of Russia’s alleged state-sponsored sports doping operation during the Olympics in London and Sochi. Dick Pound, the head of an investigatory commission set up by the World Anti-Doping Agency, introduced his findings by saying of Mutko: “It was impossible for him not to be aware of it. And if he’s aware of it, he’s complicit in it.” Mutko rejected the allegations. In December last year the International Olympic Committee banned him from all Games-related activities for life, but he remains Putin’s No 2.The other name on the screen as the recipient of special thanks is that of Roman Arkadyevich Abramovich, the owner of Chelsea FC, another close ally of Putin and a long-time influence on Russian football, notably through his very visible support for the World Cup bid. The last scene of Coach sees Yuri’s little cup-winning team making their debut in European competition – against Chelsea, naturally – at a resplendent, sun-drenched Stamford Bridge.Unseen at the Bridge since his UK visa was not renewed earlier this year, in recent days Abramovich has been named by British intelligence among a group of Putin-friendly oligarchs to be targeted as part of a response to the tactics employed by Russia’s secret service when playing away from home. The denouement to that movie is much less predictable."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f7baa1bade8ca056d94ebe6a814aea3de1b39218/0_140_3335_2001/master/3335.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=771bd56e19a92d638a0ed0a11d763381","title":"everton v watford premier league live","story":"A gorgeous free-kick from Lucas Digne five minutes into stoppage time rescued a point for Everton against Watford at Vicarage RoadWe’ve not heard from the managers yet, but Sky don’t seem remotely interested in doing so, so I’m going to stop hanging about.

We felt we were the best team in terms of knowhow and stuff, we played the game really well.He’s asked about the referee’s decisions in the first half:The refs have got a tough job. I’m not going to come out and start hammering them. We as players just want a bit of respect when we’re talking. There’s always talk about respecting the referee … We tried to have a chat with him and felt he fobbed us off. That was the team talk done because we felt the whole world was against us. Unfortunately we just fell a bit short. We’ll take the draw and move on to Cardiff last week.Holebas, who is never far away from a temper tantrum, strops from the field, gesticulating wildly. You’d have thought that once he gets to the dressing-room Kabasele will be fielding a couple of pointed remarks about his wild stoppage-time arm-waving habits.90+7 mins: And that’s it! A pretty decent and wildly dramatic game of football, and Watford’s long search for a victory at Goodison Park continues!90+7 mins: Watford attack at the death! Deulofeu escapes down the right, goes past one defender and passes to Pereyera, but he scuffs the ball roughly halfway between the goal and Troy Deeney.And Digne curls it in! That’s absolutely lovely!90+5 mins: Another long ball sails towards the Watford rearguard, and Kabasele leaps with his hands in the air. The ball hits one of them, and Everton have a fantastic shooting chance from a couple of yards outside the area!90+4 mins: Halfway through stoppage time, and it is yet to yield a chance. Digne takes another long throw, which is boffed clear.90+3 mins: Pickford is ordered to retake another goal kick. Sky were focusing on a narked-looking Marco Silva, so I couldn’t see what was wrong with his first go.90+1 mins: A final substitution sees Quina go off after a fine full top-flight debut, and Mariappa come on to bolster the defence.90+1 mins: There will be about six minutes of stoppage time! Six minutes! As we’ve already seen, that’s long enough for a couple of goals and a penalty or so.90 mins: Everton send a long throw into the box, and it’s headed behind for another corner. Tension mounts. Digne’s cross finds Richarlison, whose overhead deflects over. Another corner.88 mins: From open play, Keane comes forward and ends up playing on the right wing. He does OK there too, working a crossing opportunity for Coleman, but Sigurdsson’s header is weak and saved.86 mins: Lookman’s corner is poor, and headed clear at the near post. He gets the ball back but his crossfield pass is poor, and Watford clear again.85 mins: Coleman’s cross is deflected, and Holebas hacks it behind. The crowd roars. The clock ticks.84 mins: The visitors have slowed the game down so much it’s almost stationary. They crawl down the right wing, win a throw-in and convert it into a corner.83 mins: Watford play the ball from left to right, but back on the left Doucouré has taken a blow to the head. They have a free kick, and a few more seconds go by.82 mins: Watford have a throw-in, and Holebas takes a while organising a long one, which is cleared. The clock continues to tick.81 mins: Watford win a corner, and before it’s taken Chalobah is booked, presumably for doing some off-camera timewasting.80 mins: The pressure is building, but it’s all a bit messy. The ball is hit long to Tosun, bounces about a bit, arrives at the feet of Sigurdsson, and he miscues his shot.78 mins: Digne crosses to Tosun, the ball breaks to Richarlison, whose first touch is poor enough to allow Foster to sprint out and claim.76 mins: “Impressed that Isaac Success managed to leave the field without falling over,” says Gary Naylor. Perhaps his inability to stay vertical while running, particularly when blue shirts are nearby, is why he took so long over his departure?75 mins: Pretty much anything could still happen here. Deulofeu nearly plays in Doucouré, Everton clear the ball upfield and Foster has to run out of his area to rescue the situation.74 mins: Further substitutional action sees Success replaced by Chalobah. His number is booed by the home fans, as is the amount of time he takes to leave the field, while Mina comes over to give him a personal and faintly aggressive farewell. The substitution took 48 seconds, for what it’s worth.72 mins: “‘Comedy clanger’ is a bit harsh, don’t you think? Not sure what Coleman was supposed to do about that one,” sniffs Phil Reilly. There can be no blame on Coleman, but it was a moment that should probably have been accompanied by a comedy clang sound effect.72 mins: Everton have made their third substitution, bringing Tosun on for Gueye.71 mins: Chaos in Watford’s penalty area! Sigurdsson flicks it beautifully to Coleman, whose low cut-back heads towards the Icelandic midfielder. On the stretch he directs the ball wide but to Richarlison, who falls over when apparently destined to score, and Watford come away with the ball!69 mins: In between Watford’s second goal and the penalty award Everton brought on Lookman and Calvert-Lewin, taking off Walcott and Bernard.Sigurdsson blasts it straight down the middle, but though Foster has ed to his right he flicked up a foot and volleyed it out of the area and away to safety!Madness! A long throw comes in, Kabasele comes out to challenge Mina, who goes down. The referee sees it as a push (which it was), and points to the spot!They’ve only got another one! A quick free-kick ends with Pereyra crossing from the right, and it deflects off the top of a sliding defender’s shin and loops onto the head of Doucouré. Though his header is close to Pickford he has no time to react and can’t keep it out!A nice move ends with a comedy clanger, and Watford are level! Deulofeu slides the ball to Femenia on the right, Pereyra meets his low cross, his shot hits the far post, and it rebounds straight into Coleman and bounces in!62 mins: Success catches Digne, and the award of a free-kick to Everton gets loud cheers from a home support that thinks the refereeing decisions haven’t gone their way. “I must say, Watford’s No10 has had great, ahem, Success in winning free-kicks for his team,” writes Gary Byrne. “One wonders what would happen were he ever actually fouled?”61 mins: “If there’s an end of year ‘Best of Effects Mics’ round-up, I reckon Goodison would star in it,” says Gary Naylor. “Post-watershed of course.” There does seem to have been a lot of audible cursing this evening.60 mins: Deulofeu is on, and Sema goes off. The home fans give the Spaniard a warm reception.59 mins: Everton calm the game down a bit, with Gomes receiving treatment to a knee injury – the physio treating him just gave a thumbs up, so he is presumably fine. Watford use the interruption to get Deulofeu ready to come on.58 mins: Watford are first to every loose ball at the moment, and there are plenty of loose balls. Deeney plays a one-two with Pereyra before spearing in a low shot from the edge of the area, which Pickford pushes away.57 mins: Chance for Watford! The long throw drops to Doucouré, whose shot deflects off Mina and then off Bernard and then out of play for a corner. 56 mins: Deeney sprints 30 yards to shoulder-barge Coleman into the ball, and both Everton player and ball end up in touch. Watford get the throw.55 mins: Pereyra curls the free-kick round the wall and into the side netting. The away fans, clearly watching proceedings from an unfortunate angle, briefly celebrate.54 mins: Mina breathes on Success, who goes down. This time he gets a free kick."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6c555946a43d23b813cb78632b93fd33ac472c9b/0_23_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=de0005c2a3d367fc704e8bd8cbd21e69","title":"nicaragua journalists press freedom crackdown ortega","story":"Journalists have been beaten, arrested, and robbed in the wake of the civil revolt that paralysed the country earlier in the yearNicaraguan TV journalist Miguel Mora was driving home from work when he was pulled over by armed police.It was the sixth time Mora had been detained by police in the space of a week. He also faces criminal charges of “inciting hate”, while drones have filmed his house and armed men on motorbikes track his movements.Such intimidation is part of an escalating assault on press freedoms in Nicaragua, unleashed in the wake of the civil revolt that paralysed the country earlier in the year.“This government has banned protest, captured opposition leaders, and now the only thing preventing a totalitarian dictatorship is the independent media,” says Mora. “This is the stage where they try to silence us.”Anti-government protests broke out in April, sparked by the mismanagement of fires in a protected reserve and fuelled by fiscal reforms that slashed social security. They spread after police used live ammunition on demonstrators, killing dozens.From the start of the unrest, the government tried to control coverage, pressuring media bosses to self-censor. Journalists at Channel 10 – owned by the Mexican tycoon Remigio Ángel González – were initially barred from reporting on demonstrations.“It was absurd: historic events were unfolding and we were ignoring them,” says Mauricio Madrigal, the station’s news editor. He and others threatened to resign, and the prohibition was dropped.“Every independent journalist has received death threats,” says Gerall Chávez, a reporter with VosTV, whose house was vandalised in August. One journalist has been killed during the violence in total, more than 490 violations of press freedom have been documented in the course of the crisis.Now, having regained control of the streets, the government is determined to impose control over the narrative. In doing so, it aims to ensure impunity for the state forces that slaughtered hundreds of protesters.“It’s an Orwellian strategy, to falsify the reality of the repression,” says Sofía Montenegro, a journalist and former Sandinista guerrilla who fought alongside President Daniel Ortega in the 1970s.The official version of events is disseminated through a media empire built by Rosario Murillo, Nicaragua’s first lady and, since 2017, vice-president.In 2007, shortly after her husband returned to power, Murillo published an ominous communication strategy, outlining plans to prevent critical media “contaminating” public perception of his administration.Through the next decade, Murillo spent millions of dollars of Venezuelan cooperation funds – ostensibly destined for poverty reduction – on buying up Nicaragua’s media.TV channels 4, 8, 9 and 13 are now owned by her children also under the family’s control are Radio Ya, Radio Nicaragua and Radio Sandino, state broadcaster Channel 6, and the online news service El 19 Digital.From April, this media apparatus worked to whitewash the government’s deadly response to the protests.“We presented an alternative reality, where protesters were rightwing extremists killing Sandinistas,” says Carlos Mikel Espinoza, who was editor of El 19 Digital when protests broke out. “It was fascistic, an attempt to infuse hatred into government supporters and police.” Espinoza quit and fled to Costa Rica in June, after police and militants burned alive a family of six in their own home.Murillo’s strategy has failed. Polls show that just one in five Nicaraguans believe the official line that “those who participated in roadblocks and marches are terrorists”. But this hasn’t stopped the Ortega-controlled courts prosecuting protesters as if they were the violent extremists government propaganda claims.“We challenge this fantasy reality every day,” Miguel Mora concludes. “The logical next step – which I fully expect them to take – is to send their paramilitaries to close us down altogether.“That would leave only their version of events: a pure, uncontaminated discourse.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/57c25bb419f90ff6f23e07c380204577984d0ce2/2_0_8723_5236/master/8723.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=68d9bf7db63ab782f125d4f4377f6ffe","title":"bolognese and bonding why i love cooking with my children","story":"With smart appliances like the Samsung Family Hub™ fridge, getting your kids to help out in the kitchen is easier than ever. Mum-of-three Antonia Windsor explains why cooking with your kids is the perfect opportunity for bonding, belly laughs and some stealth mathsBy the time my middle child Ziggy, now five, was just nine months old he had already joined me in the kitchen. He would sit on the floor with pans while I threw down the potato peelings for him to stir and spoon. I loved this bonding time with him, and proudly posted pictures of him on social media: my chef in the making. My two-year-old Zenya is following in his footsteps, often by my side while I’m chopping, offering up plates of pretend pizza for me to mime eating or cups of imaginary hot chocolate to sip.My eldest, Zayla, who is now six, had less interest in pretend cooking, but as soon as she could mix real flour in a bowl with real milk and crack an egg into it she was desperate for us to make pancakes on a weekly basis.I began to love and dread with equal measure the unfolding of the aprons, knowing that my kitchen would be chaos in just a few short minutes, but knowing, too, that there would be belly laughs and bonding that no other activity quite reproduces.Not only is cooking a fun, sensory activity for children it is also a great way for children to develop pride and confidence in their abilities. To create something from raw ingredients and actually get to eat the end product gives children a great sense of satisfaction.It is also a great way for small children to develop fine motor skills. Chopping, mixing, spreading and spooning are all actions that help develop hand-eye coordination and build strength in little fingers. As children get older they can start to read recipes for themselves and learn about weights and measures, turning family cooking into an easy educational activity that the children don’t need a spoonful of sugar to swallow. If I want to make our cooking a little more challenging mathematically, I double the quantities in a recipe and ask the children to help with the calculations. I also find it’s an easy way to help them understand concepts such as fractions - particularly when cutting a homemade cake into slices.If you are looking for inspiration on what to cook with the family, smart kitchen technology can really help you out the Samsung Family Hub™ fridge, for instance, can suggest child-friendly recipes based on the ingredients you already have in stock. We’re all big fans of the CBeebies programme I Can Cook, which has a fabulous range of multicultural recipes that are simple for children to make, and the Samsung Family Hub™ can help out here too – you can stream TV* to the built-in screen from your smartphone**.I find that when we make things ourselves from scratch it is easier to slip in healthy ingredients. Now, when we make pancakes, I slip in chia seeds and linseed, almond flour and coconut sugar. The children are happy because there are more ingredients to mix in the bowl, and they eat their creations hungrily, having hovered at the pan as I fry each one, desperate for their first taste.Now my children are old enough, we have progressed from pancakes and biscuits to them helping with dinner preparation. The children use butter knives to chop mushrooms for bolognese sauce, or help with the mashing of potato for shepherd’s pie.I talk to them as we cook. I tell them about ingredients, about where they come from and when they are in season, and I share family history, describing the food my husband’s mother prepares in Zimbabwe and the French-influenced dishes that my mum and gran cooked for me during my childhood in Jersey. In this way, I hope that our cooking together is a way that I can pass on traditions and family recipes, and help my children to grow into confident cooks who can pass these traditions down to their own children.* Service available on the Samsung Smart TV 6400 series and above, released in 2015** Requires Samsung Galaxy S6 and above or Samsung Galaxy Note 5, 7, 8 and 9 seriesDiscover how the Samsung Family Hub™ can help make your kitchen a more enjoyable place for all your family at samsungukfamilyhub"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/747655215464a8e28aab1cd96bb5e01de2660c4f/2_0_3791_2276/master/3791.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=713086eab7accae91a9513f0c889c74b","title":"steve mcqueen tarana burke in conversation metoo misogyny movies","story":"The director and the MeToo founder tackle misogyny and moviesBefore they sit down in a conference room in a New York hotel, Tarana Burke and Steve McQueen have never met, but they share an interest in social justice, sexual violence – in particular, how the trauma of assault plays down the generations – and questions of how victim representation is policed in pop culture. Burke, 45, is the Bronx-born senior director of Girls for Gender Equality, a lifelong educator and activist and, most recognisably, the founder of the MeToo movement which, 12 years before the alleged victims of Harvey Weinstein came forward, was set up to work with survivors of sexual trauma.McQueen is the English director of 12 Years A Slave, which won best picture at the 2014 Oscars, and most recently directed Widows, starring Viola Davis. The heist movie was in production in Chicago when the MeToo story broke and, says McQueen, cast and crew “talked and talked and talked. And listened and listened, more importantly for me. Stupid to say, but I was shocked.”Together, they discuss the astonishing testimonies unleashed by MeToo, as well as the backlash, and how Burke and McQueen would like to see the movement better served by the media, particularly the racial and class implications of who gets to be a “good” victim. They talk about their families’ roots in the West Indies and disagree, very mildly, on the place held by women within Black Lives Matter. Burke is passionate, ferocious, often very humorous about the contradictions and frailties of the MeToo movement, and the vision – developed over decades of unglamorous and largely unrecognised work – underpinning it. McQueen, meanwhile, is curious, soft-spoken and deferential to the expertise of the woman before him. It is a fascinating conversation.Steve McQueen Let’s just start! I think that what you’ve done has been extraordinarily influential. You’ve shifted everything, and people are thinking about things that happened to them in the past, and unearthing things that have been suppressed. It’s incredible.Tarana Burke Yes, and on both sides: I think survivors have suppressed things, and so have perpetrators, who now have a different understanding of consent.As a black person, I can’t be anything other than who I am, or be looked upon in other people’s gaze as who they think I am. But white women who come into this conversation, there’s an easy way out –TB OK, and you’re saying that versus –SM – I don’t want to mansplain, but as far as I see things with my mother and my sister, or my siblings, there’s a double –TB Oh, absolutely. I was talking the other day about a book called All The Women Are White, All The Blacks Are Men, But Some Of Us Are Brave.TB Right? And one of the things it deals with is the erasure, not just from the movement but in general, of black women, for whom there’s a choice: do I choose to be black first, or do I choose to be a woman? SM Wait, do you have to make a choice? Is there a choice?SM Do you think that? I don’t know if I agree.SM So, to go back to my convoluted question about white women coming into the debate?SM The irony is that the thing that made MeToo visible throughout the world was white women.TB And I have said publicly that I don’t have an issue with that.TB Right. I’ve been at this work, along with so many other women of colour, for years, and nothing that we could’ve done would’ve elevated this issue into the international spotlight.I’m a 45-year-old black woman from the Bronx who the media tries to ignore in some ways – who will acknowledge me as the person who “coined the phrase” MeToo, or as “the founder but not the leader”. They are constantly looking for other leadership.SM Yes, I’ve heard journalists say that, in MeToo and Time’s Up, there are no black leaders, and I’ve thought, what? Why is that?TB But regardless, they still will erase me. Due diligence in the media is to say “Alyssa Milano, the leader of the MeToo movement” and then in parentheses “original phrase coined by Tarana Burke in 2006”. And I don’t know how to say this without it sounding like “I should be the king” – I’m not saying that. I’m saying that, because of the investment in the work, there should at least be a conversation that says there’s a bigger vision.SM That’s why racism is so huge. It’s ginormous. That’s the thing that’s deafening.TB It’s the thread that runs through. Your narrative is being erased by these public perceptions set up by the media. There’s this real conundrum, of people who celebrate me as an inidual, but still won’t buy into what I’m saying because they’re inundated with headlines about who the MeToo movement’s going to take down next.SM When MeToo hit, we were in the middle of making Widows in Chicago and we just sat down and talked. I was shocked about certain things. I was like, really? Oh, wow.TB What’s interesting is that if we woke up tomorrow and 13 million people had a disease – because that’s what these people said, “Me too! I’ve got it, too!” – the whole world would stop. There would be three questions: how did we get here how do we stop it and how do we make sure it never happens again? Those three questions haven’t been answered in a year. It’s so commonplace that most of us don’t even think about it.SM That’s what shocked me, the normalisation of someone touching you inappropriately. It freaked me out a bit.SM Yes – well, I’ve had a partner for 23 years and we have two children.TB Did you talk to your wife about it?SM Yes I did, and she said some things I don’t want to talk about, that were very –SM Yes. Again, it’s heavy. I wish I could articulate it better, but I was also ashamed of myself, in a way – that I wasn’t sensitive enough to know about this. And maybe I’d normalised a certain behaviour. Not that I’d participated, but I never thought of it. I think what you did is wake a lot of people up to a certain pain that they had.TB In Widows, which I watched last night, there’s a scene where one of the women is regularly abused by her husband. And you see her with a black eye, and they’re sitting at breakfast, and he kind of plays around with her face and says, “Put some makeup on, that makes me uncomfortable.” And you’d think, when he died, she’d be like, “Yay!” And that’s not how it happens. She still has this loyalty to him. It’s nuanced. I thought that was a really interesting scene.SM I think there’s a kind of recklessness that comes after someone close to you has died. You realise your mortality – there’s a sort of liberation. That character, Alice, her mother hits her, too – and that’s conditioning.SM Interestingly enough, I’m from a West Indian family –TB Where are your family from?SM From Grenada and Trinidad.SM What’s interesting is that violence – I was beaten as a child –SM – it’s interesting how that violence is normalised.TB Things like: you don’t let anybody touch your private parts you don’t sit on a grown man’s lap. There’s a list I could run through. We all got that, and it’s an effort to keep your children safe. What happened in my case – I was six the first time – was that you have the rules, and the number one thing kids want to accomplish is not getting into trouble. We will do anything not to get in trouble.SM Right. You don’t want to get licked.TB So I have a question for you. One of the things I’m interested in is pop culture narratives around sexual violence, and the depiction of who gets to be a victim and who doesn’t. Do you feel a sense of responsibility? Do you feel a push‑pull around wanting to be a part of shifting the narrative and wanting to be super-authentic? Does that make sense?SM I think one wants to be part of shifting the narrative, absolutely. Somehow there’s got to be a way of imagining a situation where sex and the pleasures of sex are much more in balance, and much more enjoyable – where both people have equal engagement. I think that’s way more sexy.TB Yes, there’s ways to make consent sexy.SM The whole idea of men showing vulnerability is an issue. That has to be addressed – where it’s not a weakness, it’s a huge advantage. The dumbness about how this interaction has been popularised is absolutely crazy.TB To make male vulnerability sexy would be amazing. I have a friend in the BDSM world, and we had this really wonderful conversation once about what the world can learn from BDSM because it’s all based on consent.SM You’ve gone to the seed of the question. I think once people have an idea about how to talk about it, or popularise it, that’s when things will be dealt with. But it’s healing first. We can’t jump the gun.Same thing with race. Often I’ve said that, while sexual violence does not discriminate, our response is highly racial – around who gets to be a victim and who gets sympathy. We are all socialised to respond to the vulnerability of white women first. So you have the biggest names in Hollywood – they’re thin, beautiful, wealthy, glamorous white women, top of the food chain. We want to know everything about them what they eat, who they’re married to, so it’s no surprise that we’d want to know about this part of their lives that was broken, too.I definitely don’t blame them, they are also survivors. It’s not their fault the world responds to them that way. But they can also use that spotlight to amplify other folks who get less visibility.SM I just wish that could also be done racially.TB You mean, around sexual violence within race? Yes. That’s another layer to peel back. When Bill Cosby happened, there was an incredible backlash within the community. “These women are lying, he’s America’s dad,” all that. Every possible reason it wasn’t true. That was painful.TB It brought up this complicated conversation, because we know there’s a very real history of black men being falsely accused of sexual assault by white women. That’s not a debatable fact – we know it from Emmett Till. The other thing we know is that when any violence happens in a community, it’s at the hands mostly of the people in that community. So that means Asian men are raping Asian women white men are raping white women black men are raping black women. When it comes to black folks, because of that complicated history around false accusations, it becomes a shield not to deal with sexual violence at all.But what you said is right, we don’t want to take down our icons. We’re invested in their success in a way that is detrimental to our own.SM I understand it, in a way. But in order for us to grow, we have to deal with it.TB I don’t know what the solution is. If a group of black women actresses, or singers, came forward together, like with Weinstein, and said this thing happened – that would shift things so dramatically. They would still catch a hell of a backlash, more than white women. But I have based my work on the black women who did talk about their experiences. I would go into the classroom and say Mary J Blige, Queen Latifah, Oprah are all survivors of sexual violence, and they could connect to that.TB Like Ray Rice, the NFL player caught on video beating his wife. He knocked her out and dragged her out of the elevator. It was horrific. But then this thing happened where he became –TB – a monster. So your point about it coming back to race, it creates these dynamics where we’re conflicted.SM It comes back to the MeToo movement and how there’s a situation where some people don’t even know you exist. It does my head in. It all comes back to perception, to stereotypes.• This conversation appears in the ’s Weekend magazine and has been edited and abridged for length.If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine’s letters page in print, please email weekend@the, including your name and address (not for publication)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/35fd3d188549ca8467f69431a9267e3ece358c89/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=90a288bfb32c8f5754d1233f09b7b1f5","title":"im in a relationship with another man but he identifies as straight","story":"We kiss and cuddle, but he won’t go beyond a certain point physically and says he loves me as a brother. Do we have any hope of a future?Until last year, I identified as a straight man. Then, after we drank too much, I made out with a slightly older colleague, who identifies as a straight man.  We now meet to kiss and make out. He doesn’t go beyond a certain point physically. He gives me hand jobs but doesn’t want anything sexual himself, just cuddling and kissing. I love him dearly. He says he loves me, too, but as a brother or best friend, not as a partner. Recently, he has stopped kissing me on the lips but we sleep in the same bed and cuddle. I am confused. Is he straight, is he gaybi, and should I hope for romantic love with him? I love his company and we do lots together, but he will not go beyond the boundaries he has set. I don’t want to beg him to do more if he doesn’t feel comfortable, but it would hurt to walk away.This man has indicated the kind of relationship he wants, and has established control over your love-making style. But for you, an erotic exchange involves giving pleasure and receiving it. Try not to experience his sexual frugality as a rejection it could be down to embarrassment, internalised homophobia, self-punishment, fear of transmitting or contracting disease, or erectile or ejaculatory difficulties. He, too, may be confused. He may be unable to grant himself permission to cross that threshold. Consider framing your thoughts as a request, something like: “I respect your boundaries, but would be delighted if you would allow me to give you physical pleasure, too.” If he refuses, press with: “Help me to understand, what kind of feelings do you have about this? Could we talk about it?”Only you can decide if the longing you feel is too painful to continue. But learning who one is sexually, and coming to terms with it, can be challenging and take time.

Brushing hair from the ends and gently working your way to the top of the head also helps avoid snapping strands.Hairdryers and heated styling tools can leave hair brittle and lacking in shine. “Heat can, in a sense, cook the hair,” says the dermatologist Dr Zoe Draelos. “Think of it like a piece of steak – it starts out nice and soft and flexible, but when you cook it, the steak changes texture and becomes hard. Similarly, hair transforms when exposed to heat over time.” She recommends allowing hair to air dry when possible, and if using a hairdryer, to use a protective spray or serum and to start off on the lowest setting before gradually increasing the heat.Cold weather can exacerbate dandruff. Shampoos containing zinc pyrithione or salicylic acid are recommended to treat dandruff, or, for a cheaper option, try the  beauty columnist Sali Hughes’s homemade recipe: pour sea salt flakes into shampoo and rub energetically into the scalp pre-shower.Stress can cause hair loss, says Kingsley. Exercise, a healthy diet, meditation and prioritising sleep all help to de-stress body and mind.Grey hair is often finer and more fragile, but can look coarser due to oil glands producing less sebum as we age. Matt Hawes, of Josh Wood Colour, advises using a hydrating and moisturising conditioner and oils such as argan and jojoba as part of a routine to soften hair and counteract dullness. Purple- and blue-toned products are also designed to brighten grey hair.It is essential to get rid of split ends before the damage travels upwards. Charlotte Mensah, multiple winner of the best Afro hairstylist at the British Hairdressing awards, recommends a trim every six to eight weeks. “Even though it is less obvious than with straight hair, Afro hair needs to be trimmed regularly to ensure you have better curl definition.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e466d314a2e2161577833d35962f16b72bb05d86/0_491_3232_1938/master/3232.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e855843ff7d107ab67e80b30f80feb26","title":"the garrick club might finally admit women but why would any woman want to go there","story":"As the 187-year-old club once again discusses whether to admit women, it is eye-opening to discover how they view ‘ladies’Women, or to use the correct anachronistic language “ladies”, rest assured. One more door might perhaps – but probably not – be one day creaking ever so slightly ajar to admit some of us. (Though not welcoming us, understand.) While we busy ourselves despairing over the fact that 27 countries still require women to obey their husbands by law, the Garrick Club has been pondering the deeply isive question of whether to permit female members. Again.Honestly, this so-called question – which, no joke, has led incensed members to rip pages from leather-bound ledgers and to snip out a woman’s name written in the Garrick’s hallowed candidates’ book with a pair of scissors – seems to come around as often as MasterChef these days. Except the format is more predictable. Really it’s a wonder how the 1,400 members of this 187-year-old bastion of white male privilege have any time left for the banter, shoulder-rubbing, dissection of objective facts, consumption of whisky and off-the-cuff networking after so much energy is spent considering whether the club would be critically endangered by the paid-up presence of a lady.In any case, what power can an act of parliament hope to wield in the face of a centuries-old institution that counts the parliamentarians and judges who make and interpret the law among its members. Baroness Hale, the president of the supreme court and the most senior judge in the country, is permitted to enter the Garrick only as a guest, although she can use the main staircase whereas in the past women visitors were required to use the back entrance.

New York was in second place with 39. London – which topped the rankings in 2015 when £2.3bn of ultra-prime properties changed hands – slipped to third place with 38 transactions.Estate agents said London had fallen out of favour with super-rich buyers due to the increase in stamp duty and concerns about Brexit.Liam Bailey, Knight Frank’s head of research, said: “The relentless creation of private wealth globally over the past decade has fuelled the growth of ultra-prime residential markets.“Despite the proliferation of ultra-prime markets across cities, second home and ski locations, our research confirms there are three undisputed leading ultra-prime markets – Hong Kong, New York and London.“While London has seen a relative decline in its lead as the world’s largest ultra-prime market, in terms of sales, Hong Kong has steadily built a commanding lead in terms of total spend by the world’s wealthy on ultra-prime property with New York growing its position as a dominant ultra-prime location.”Most of the ultra-prime sales in London were in Mayfair, Knightsbridge and Belgravia, all of which are within the borough of the City of Westminster. The council last month banned the creation of new supersize properties built for the global super-rich in order to free up space for more affordable homes for “real people”. Westminster said banning “Monopoly board-style” homes would help free up more space for affordable homes for Londoners.The UK’s ranks of the ultra-rich have swelled by 400 over the last year, taking the number of people with fortunes of more than £38m ($50m) to nearly 5,000.

No 10 subsequently indicated it might not take place until January.The prime minister said that in the interim she would return to EU member states to seek “further assurances” on the backstop, and seek ways to “empower” the Commons.May will continue on a frantic round of European diplomacy in an attempt to obtain a written text that she will be able to present MPs, but a breakthrough is not expected this week, even though the PM will end it by going to Brussels for a scheduled summit of EU leaders on Thursday and Friday.Jeremy Corbyn, responding to May’s statement, said the country was in “an extremely serious and unprecedented situation”. The Labour leader argued it would be pointless to bring what was fundamentally the same deal back to the house, whether in a few days or next month.The CBI said the delay to the deal was a blow for business, and that the UK “risks sliding towards a national crisis”.The decision to stop the Commons voting after three of five planned days of debate on the deal prompted a furious intervention from the Speaker. John Bercow said that while the government could unilaterally pull the vote, it should reconsider doing so at an “inordinately late stage”.Downing Street said it would pull the vote formally at around 8pm tonight, when the Commons clerks call out the business to be debated. A government whip simply has to shout “tomorrow” for the business to be deferred indefinitely No 10 said the procedure was a standard one used all the time.May began her address by saying that during the debate she had “listened very carefully to what has been said in this chamber and out of it by members of all sides”, prompting laughter from many MPs.“From listening to these views it is clear that while there is broad support for many of the key aspects of the deal, on one issue, the Northern Ireland backstop, there remains widespread and deep concern,” she said.“As a result, if we went ahead and held the vote tomorrow, it would be rejected by a significant margin.”A backstop is required to ensure there is no hard border in Ireland if a comprehensive free trade deal cannot be signed before the end of 2020. Theresa May has proposed to the EU that the whole of the UK would remain in the customs union after Brexit, but Brussels has said it needs more time to evaluate the proposal. As a result, the EU insists on having its own backstop - the backstop to the backstop - which would mean Northern Ireland would remain in the single market and customs union in the absence of a free trade deal, prompting fierce objections from Conservative hard Brexiters and the DUP, which props up her government. That prompted May to propose a country-wide alternative in which the whole of the UK would remain in parts of the customs union after Brexit. “The EU still requires a ‘backstop to the backstop’ – effectively an insurance policy for the insurance policy. And they want this to be the Northern Ireland-only solution that they had previously proposed,” May told MPs. Raising the stakes, the prime minister said the EU’s insistence amounted to a threat to the constitution of the UK: “We have been clear that we cannot agree to anything that threatens the integrity of our United Kingdom,” she added.May said that before the European council summit later this week, she would visit her counterparts in other member states, as well as the leadership of the European council and the commission. “I will discuss with them the clear concerns that the house has expressed.”May said she believed it was still possible to secure a majority for her deal in parliament, “if I can secure additional reassurance on the question of the backstop, and that will be my focus in the days ahead”.“If you take a step back, it is clear this house faces a much more fundamental question: does this house want to deliver Brexit?” May asked, to shouts of “No!”.She continued: “If the house does, does it want to do so through reaching an agreement with the EU? If the answer is yes, and I believe that is the answer of the majority of this house, then we all have to ask ourselves whether we’re prepared to make a compromise. Because there will be no enduring and successful Brexit without some compromise on both sides of the debate.”Corbyn said it had been “evident for weeks” that MPs would reject the deal. “The government has lost control of events and is in complete disarray.”He asked May to clarify if she was seeking actual changes to the withdrawal agreement with the EU, or “mere reassurances” about change.“Bringing back the same botched deal, either next week or in January – and can she be clear on the timing? – will not change its fundamental flaws and deeply held objections right across this house, which go far wider than the backstop alone,” he said.There was, however, no indication when May would return. Asked by the Scottish National party’s Kirsty Blackman when a vote. The prime minister said that under the EU Withdrawal Act if no deal had been agreed with the European Union by 21 January she must make a statement to parliament.But it understood that the conditions set out in the act have already been met because the UK has already negotiated a Brexit deal in principle with the EU. Technically, the meaningful vote could be held on any date, although in practice this will be limited by the government’s ability to get through the ensuing legislation required to ratify the deal through parliament.Asked about this possibility in the debate by former education secretary Justine Greening, May discounted it, but declined to say when she would return.Bercow said: “Halting the debate after no fewer than 164 colleagues had taken the trouble to contribute will be thought by many members of this house to be deeply discourteous.”However, the Speaker said that while his procedural advice was that the government could decide on its own to delay the vote, it was “infinitely preferable” to give the house the opportunity to vote on whether the debate should be adjourned.“I can reassure ministers that I would be happy to accept such a motion so that the house can decide,” he said.He said the alternative would mean the Commons was “not only deprived of its opportunity to vote on the substance of the debate tomorrow but also given no chance to express its view today on whether the debate should or should not continue”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7c6ee72e7c9383f8aa1c2e10d629b41f5daa0af4/0_47_3883_2330/master/3883.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=56257c48136b7e01c760274db2fe2f50","title":"eu figures rule out concessions as theresa may postpones brexit vote","story":"EU officials and diplomats bewildered at decision to seek more talks before MPs voteDonald Tusk, the president of the European council, has told Theresa May that there will be no further Brexit negotiations after Downing Street announced its plan to return for new talks to the bewilderment of officials in Brussels.As the prime minister told MPs that she was delaying the Commons vote on her Brexit deal and had sent her most senior Brexit adviser, Olly Robbins, to the European commission headquarters for fresh talks, Tusk dashed any hopes of a new EU offer.Calling on EU leaders to up their no-deal preparations, Tusk said the 27 heads of state and government would not reopen the deal when they discuss Brexit at their summit starting in Thursday.“We will not renegotiate the deal, including the backstop, but we are ready to discuss how to facilitate UK ratification”, Tusk tweeted. “As time is running out, we will also discuss our preparedness for a no-deal scenario.”Presented with the tweet as she stood in the House of Commons justifying her delay to the meaningful vote, May declined to comment.The European commission, led by Jean-Claude Juncker, had also insisted earlier in the day that there would be no further concessions to Britain despite the crisis in Westminster.“Our position remains we will not renegotiate the deal that is on the table right now and that was endorsed by the EU council on 25 November, so that is very clear and as the president said himself, this is the deal and the only deal possible,” a spokesman said.EU sources said Robbins had been sent to Brussels to secure an exchange of letters or side-declaration from the EU pledging that the backstop in the withdrawal agreement, which could keep the UK in an indefinite customs union, will never come into force and would be temporary.Echoing Tusk’s comments, Ireland’s taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, who spoke to May on Sunday, said such a clarification of the EU’s intentions would be possible, but pointed to the lack of substance to such an offer.Varadkar said it would not detract from the legal reality that the UK would fall into the backstop by default if another solution for avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland was not realisable by the end of the transition period.“We have already offered a lot of concessions along the way,” he said. “We ended up with the backstop with this withdrawal agreement because of all the red lines the UK laid down along the way.“This is a withdrawal agreement which has the support of 28 member states. It’s not possible to open up any one aspect of this without opening up all aspects of the agreement.Others described Robbins’ return to Brussels as desperate, while senior EU sources suggested a clarification over their intentions would “be like dust” in the face of the legally binding 585-page treaty.The bloc’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, has already said the EU has no intention of triggering the backstop but that it has to remain in place as an insurance.The European parliament’s Brexit coordinator, Guy Verhofstadt, a former Belgian prime minister, expressed his frustration with May.He tweeted: “I can’t follow anymore. After two years of negotiations, the Tory government wants to delay the vote. Just keep in mind that we will never let the Irish down. This delay will further aggravate the uncertainty for people \u0026amp businesses. It’s time they make up their mind!”Leaving a meeting in Brussels, the Dutch foreign minister, Stef Blok, said: “Of course we will look carefully at any proposal she might make. But we know how difficult it has been to reach agreement. So if there will be talks, it won’t be easy.”Josep Borrell, Spain’s foreign minister, said of Britain’s MPs: “I think it is a good deal, I think it is the best deal and to approve this deal would be a good thing but for sure it’s up to them.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d21a3c54c842c7966ddf2e1245508005621b060f/422_32_1084_650/master/1084.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=766b6762b402954c903d5aee378bdec0","title":"theresa may brexit plan b buy more time","story":"Prime minister to meet EU leaders after delaying meaningful vote in face of crushing defeatTheresa May is to embark on a frantic round of European diplomacy in a final attempt to salvage her Brexit deal and her premiership after a chaotic day in which she pulled Tuesday’s scheduled meaningful vote in the face of overwhelming opposition.The prime minister will meet German chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin on Tuesday afternoon to seek “further assurances” to ensure that the Northern Irish backstop would never come into force, although No 10 warned a rapid breakthrough was unlikely.Downing Street said the vote could be delayed until January, reducing the time available to pass the necessary legislation to complete the UK’s departure – leading to growing concerns that a no-deal Brexit would result.The prime minister resigns after a humiliating defeat. Many MPs believe she will have to go if she loses by more than 100 votes. An interim prime minister would have to be chosen while the Tory party plans a leadership contest.May begs Michel Barnier, the European Union’s chief Brexit negotiator, left, to go the\u0026nbspextra mile and reopen the talks. She asks for\u0026nbspconcessions over the Irish backstop, and then puts whatever she can secure to a second vote in the Commons.Plenty of Conservative and Labour MPs would be happy to see a soft-Brexit, Norway-style solution that keeps Britain in the single market, as suggested by Amber Rudd, the work and pensions secretary. Although she has\u0026nbsppreviously rubbished the idea, May could do a U-turn and try to sell it\u0026nbspas a compromise to avoid the disaster of no deal.With her deal ditched, and if “no deal” is also ruled out by parliament, May’s least worst option could be to go back to the people. Many Tory MPs are pushing her to do so. If Labour officially backs the idea, a second referendum –as suggested by Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary – could happen.If parliament cannot agree on what kind of exit from the European Union it wants, and if there is no majority for a second referendum, Britain hurtles towards a no-deal departure on 29 March 2019. A hardcore group of Brexiters led by Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg would rather accept trading with Europe on basic World Trade Organisation terms than May’s deal or any form of soft Brexit.If there is no agreement on anything, and “no deal” has been blocked off as an option by parliament, the other choice available is no Brexit. May or whoever is in charge could form a cross-party government of national unity, revoke Article\u0026nbsp50 and call the whole thing\u0026nbspoff.With more than 100 Conservative MPs lining up to vote against the Brexit deal, May made the humiliating admission to the Commons that “if we went ahead and held the vote tomorrow the deal would be rejected by a significant margin”.The prime minister now hopes to secure an exchange of letters or side-declarations pledging that the backstop in the withdrawal agreement, which could keep the UK in an indefinite customs union, would be temporary and unlikely to come into force. However, Downing Street admitted that the document may not be legally binding, meaning it was not clear they would satisfy sceptical MPs, amid intense pressure from rebel Tories and the Democratic Unionist party to ditch the backstop.Labour indicated it would table a vote of no confidence if May were to fail in her emergency negotiations, saying that if she returned without significant changes “she will have decisively and unquestionably lost the confidence of parliament”.Hard Brexiters questioned what May could achieve. Jacob Rees-Mogg said it was a “rotten and humiliating day” for the government, having earlier accused May of failing to govern because she did not “have the gumption” to put her deal before MPs to approve.Cabinet sources also voiced concern about May’s strategy, having cancelled the vote – which some had wanted to take place – without the EU being signed up to anything yet. “There doesn’t seem to be any sort of plan,” one said.In a dramatic moment at the close of Tuesday’s Commons debate, as the government formally deferred the deal vote, the Labour MP Lloyd Russell-Moyle marched forward to grab the mace in protest and held it aloft. The ceremonial object represents the Queen’s authority in parliament – without it parliament cannot meet or pass laws.Tory MPs shouted “Disgrace”. Russell-Moyle appeared unsure of his next step and handed the mace back to Commons officials, as Bercow demanded he put it back down. The MP was suspended for the rest of the sitting – only a few minutes.Labour MPs had earlier won an emergency debate on the vote’s cancellations, set to be heard on Wednesday, and backed by the Tory MPs Peter Bone and Sarah Wollaston.As well as meeting Merkel May will fly out to meet Mark Rutte, the Dutch prime minister, in the Hague, on Tuesday morning and is expected to meet Donald Tusk, the president of the European council, and the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, in Brussels.Her aim is to soften up sympathetic EU leaders before the European summit on Thursday and Friday. Significantly, however, there were no plans for May to meet the French president, Emmanuel Macron, who is battling a wave of civil unrest in his own country and who recently demanded that the UK give special access to EU fishing trawlers in order to secure a future free trade deal.Tusk said he would allow May to discuss Brexit at the end of the week, but made clear that there were limits to what the EU was willing to do.The pound fell to its lowest level in two years amid fears that a no-deal Brexit was more likely, while the CBI said the delay to the deal was a blow for business and that the UK “risks sliding towards a national crisis”.There is no formal deadline for holding the meaningful vote before the UK leaves the European Union on 29 March next year but the government needs to leave enough time to pass the relevant legislation that will give effect to the 585-page withdrawal agreement that the UK has drawn up with the EU.MPs raised concern that May could never return to the Commons to seek approval from parliament, although Downing Street said that the five-day Brexit debate – halted after three days – would be resumed when the prime minister was ready. No 10 added that enough time would be left to pass the withdrawal bill legislation, although there would be less than three months left.The day had begun amid intense speculation about the meaningful vote given the scale of parliamentary opposition, but with ministers insisting that it would take place on Tuesday evening as planned.A Downing Street spokesman told reporters shortly after 11am that the vote would take place as scheduled, only for the news that it had been pulled to leak within minutes of a cabinet teleconference beginning at 11.30. Despite the leaks, No 10 would only say that May would make a statement to MPs at 3.30pm, and refused to publicly confirm what everybody knew in Westminster until the prime minister got on her feet.A backstop is required to ensure there is no hard border in Ireland if a comprehensive free trade deal cannot be signed before the end of 2020. Theresa May has proposed to the EU that the whole of the UK would remain in the customs union after Brexit, but Brussels has said it needs more time to evaluate the proposal.

May has proposed a UK-wide backstop that would result in the whole country remaining in a customs union with the EU, while, additionally, Northern Ireland would remain in some aspects of the single market."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/993c302d7eb3f3c0b71af2d00404edca72cecfd7/49_0_1793_1076/master/1793.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=87c76b6ceec87046b281233f318bb130","title":"brexit deal vote latest theresa may ecj government says ecj ruling irrelevant because uk leaving eu anyway politics live","story":"Rolling coverage of the day’s political developments as they happenThe work and pensions secretary, Amber Rudd, has said the only way forward on the Brexit deal is for all parties to make compromises. She has told BBC News:The only chance we have of getting a withdrawal agreement or something similar through is if everybody compromises. The cabinet minister said further talks with Brussels would focus on the Brexit backstop in Ireland. We don’t want to start negotiating again on fishing, Gibraltar, those matters.Rudd said she was unsure what form any changes or additions to the deal would take, adding it may be an “addendum”. When asked if the she was ashamed by the “spectacle” in Parliament, Rudd said:I do think it is shaming. It is shaming that, with all the best will in the world, we are trying to arrive at a deal and we cannot find a compromise agreement at the moment to get it through.Russell-Moyle later said he acted “on the spur of the moment” because of his frustration MPs were not being listened to. Speaking from the Red Lion pub just outside Parliament, the Labour MP said:The symbolic gesture of lifting the mace and removing it is that the will of Parliament to govern is no longer there has been removed.I felt Parliament had effectively given up its sovereign right to govern properly. They stopped me before I got out of the Chamber and I wasn’t going to struggle with someone wearing a huge sword on their hip.The official feed of parliamentary proceedings, as broadcast on BBC Parliament, did not show the mace being seized – in line with a convention not to show protests.However, the footage was tweeted by the BBC and swiftly went viral. That potentially set up a conflict with the parliamentary authorities, who fear giving airtime to such incidents can encourage MPs to take part in similar protests.An additional detail from the Brexit secretary’s appearance before MPs earlier this evening that it’s worth spelling out:As expected, a government whip has said the debate should be held “tomorrow”, deferring it to a point in the future.While MPs cried out “now”, Bercow had already made clear it was the government’s prerogative to decide to postpone the meaningful vote.After doing so, he was asked to leave the chamber.The Labour MP Lloyd Russell-Moyle picked up the mace and walked with it over the line, where he was stopped by two female serjeant at arms staff. He put up no resistance as he was stopped and handed over the mace.The parliamentary mace symbolises royal authority. Without it the house can neither meet nor pass laws.The mace is silver gilt and just over five feet long. Every day it is carried into the chamber by the serjeant at arms, where it is normally placed on the table of the house.Tory MPs screamed: “Expel him” and “Name him” as the Speaker, John Bercow, rose to his feet. Bercow said:The Speaker, John Bercow, allows Corbyn’s application for an emergency debate, saying it is “absolutely proper to be discussed”.The debate will be held first thing tomorrow and will last for as much as three hours.The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, calls for an emergency debate on the government’s decision to postpone the vote, telling the Commons the prime minister has shown a “disregard” for parliament.He says the government appears to be avoiding the vote because it fears it will lose it.The government’s incompetence can’t be used as an excuse to threaten the country with no deal.The shadow chancellor is, perhaps unsurprisingly, stoking the fire:At the moment, the Speaker, John Bercow, is dealing with numerous points of order – most of which are related to the government’s behaviour towards the Commons in delaying the vote.Among the directions he has given, Bercow tells MPs they cannot supersede the government’s decision by shouting “now” when a minister says the debate should be held “tomorrow” (see here for an explanation of what that means).But Bercow agrees there is “much unhappiness” at the way the government has acted. Meanwhile:The former prime minister David Cameron has said he does not regret calling the referendum which led to Brexit. He has told Sky News:I don’t regret calling a referendum. I made a promise in the election to call a referendum and I called the referendum.Obviously, I’m very concerned about what’s happening today but I do support the prime minister in her efforts to try and have a close partnership with the European Union. That’s the right thing to do and she has my support.Barclay is finished speaking and MPs have moved on to points of order. Here’s his full statement to the House of Commons on the decision of the European court of justice that article 50 is unilaterally revocable.With permission, Mr Speaker, I will now make a statement on the judgment issued by the European court of justice this morning on the Wightman case.Mr Speaker, today, the European court of justice has delivered its judgment on the question of the revocability of an article 50 notice. The court has found that the UK has the right, in accordance with its constitutional requirements, to unilaterally revoke the notification of its intention to withdraw from the EU.We note the judgment from the European court. It is their role to provide rulings on the interpretation of EU law.This judgment clarifies the law. The judgement does not in any way change our policy. That the government knows this course is possible, just as many undesirable actions are possible, does not change the fact that such an approach is hypothetical and the government has no intention of doing it.The government’s firm and long-held policy is that we will not revoke the article 50 notice. This position has not changed. To do this, or indeed to hold a second referendum, would be to undermine the result of the 2016 referendum and the professed will of this House to give effect to that result.This House voted to hold the referendum and promised to deliver it. 544 members of this House voted to give the British public their say, with just 53 opposed. Almost three quarters of the electorate then took part in the 2016 referendum, resulting in 17.4 million votes to leave the European Union. This is the highest number of votes cast for anything in UK electoral history, making this referendum the biggest democratic exercise in our history.This House then voted again to empower the prime minister to notify under article 50 and voted yet again to repeal the European Communities Act.The government remains focused on its task and its mandate, and delivering a deal which honours the 2016 referendum result. We will be leaving the EU on the 29th of March next year.I commend this statement to the House.Barclay provokes howls of derision by claiming it is difficult to ascertain the will of the House of Commons because Labour keeps changing its mind. The irony is evidently not lost on MPs.The rest of the EU 27 and Ireland have agreed preparations for no-deal Brexit will now intensify after telephone talks this afternoon. In a statement issued by Leo Varadkar, they confirmed negotiations would not be re-opened after Theresa May’s deal was put on life support. Varadkar said:The taoiseach and European council president, Donald Tusk, spoke by phone this afternoon. They discussed this week’s European council meeting and the current situation on Brexit.They agreed that the withdrawal agreement is the best option and could not be renegotiated. They also agreed that preparations for a ‘no deal’ outcome should intensify."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6196dd70713adfe3aa105760d2873ea154c56f3e/411_45_3637_2182/master/3637.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f2f2b53dbc7512515d0a0d486e3b504f","title":"tread softly because you tread on 23bn tonnes of micro organisms","story":"Global team of scientists find ecosystem below earth that is twice the size of world’s oceansThe Earth is far more alive than previously thought, according to “deep life” studies that reveal a rich ecosystem beneath our feet that is almost twice the size of that found in all the world’s oceans.Despite extreme heat, no light, minuscule nutrition and intense pressure, scientists estimate this subterranean biosphere is teeming with between 15bn and 23bn tonnes of micro-organisms, hundreds of times the combined weight of every human on the planet.Researchers at the Deep Carbon Observatory say the ersity of underworld species bears comparison to the Amazon or the Galápagos Islands, but unlike those places the environment is still largely pristine because people have yet to probe most of the subsurface.“It’s like finding a whole new reservoir of life on Earth,” said Karen Lloyd, an associate professor at the University of Tennessee in Knoxville. “We are discovering new types of life all the time. So much of life is within the Earth rather than on top of it.”The team combines 1,200 scientists from 52 countries in disciplines ranging from geology and microbiology to chemistry and physics. A year before the conclusion of their 10-year study, they will present an amalgamation of findings to date before the American Geophysical Union’s annual meeting opens this week.Samples were taken from boreholes more than 5km deep and undersea drilling sites to construct models of the ecosystem and estimate how much living carbon it might contain.One organism found 2.5km below the surface has been buried for millions of years and may not rely at all on energy from the sun. Instead, the methanogen has found a way to create methane in this low energy environment, which it may not use to reproduce or ide, but to replace or repair broken parts.Lloyd said: “The strangest thing for me is that some organisms can exist for millennia. They are metabolically active but in stasis, with less energy than we thought possible of supporting life.”Rick Colwell, a microbial ecologist at Oregon State University, said the timescales of subterranean life were completely different. Some microorganisms have been alive for thousands of years, barely moving except with shifts in the tectonic plates, earthquakes or eruptions.“We humans orientate towards relatively rapid processes – diurnal cycles based on the sun, or lunar cycles based on the moon – but these organisms are part of slow, persistent cycles on geological timescales.”Underworld biospheres vary depending on geology and geography. Their combined size is estimated to be more than 2bn cubic kilometres, but this could be expanded further in the future.The researchers said their discoveries were made possible by two technical advances: drills that can penetrate far deeper below the Earth’s crust, and improvements in microscopes that allow life to be detected at increasingly minute levels.The scientists have been trying to find a lower limit beyond which life cannot exist, but the deeper they dig the more life they find. There is a temperature maximum – currently 122C – but the researchers believe this record will be broken if they keep exploring and developing more sophisticated instruments.Mysteries remain, including whether life colonises up from the depths or down from the surface, how the microbes interact with chemical processes, and what this might reveal about how life and the Earth co-evolved.The scientists say some findings enter the realm of philosophy and exobiology – the study of extraterrestrial life.Robert Hazen, a mineralogist at the Carnegie Institution for Science, said: “We must ask ourselves: if life on Earth can be this different from what experience has led us to expect, then what strangeness might await as we probe for life on other worlds?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eebf28f53b1070caf8a100c3b41d68b5135f2dd2/0_40_1600_960/master/1600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b4abe6823c79ca087485eed7ad922434","title":"what happens when your child becomes violent with you","story":"Under my desk is an antique iron. It has been there since the day my mother hid it from my teenage son. That day, attempts to get him up had repeatedly failed. He was hungry but refused to eat, he became increasingly volatile until eventually he threatened to hurl the iron at my head.I’d had enough objects thrown at me in the past to not take any chances. I ran out of the house and for the first time called the police. While I waited for them, my son punched through a window, the resulting cut narrowly missing his artery.Tom, 17, has various diagnoses – autism, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), Tourette’s, ADHD – that make it hard for him to communicate, deal with frustration and regulate his emotions. As he has grown older, he has become more challenging. He was exhibiting a range of coercive and obsessive behaviours centred on me that made life intolerable. I had a choice around these behaviours: I could carry them out … or else.“Or else” could mean screaming for hours, punching, kicking, threatening with heavy or sharp objects, property damaged – or me, my other children – and neighbours kept awake into the early hours and sometimes all night. “Or else” could mean my son harming himself it was the unspoken catalyst to my life shutting down.While some may find this shocking, for others it’s a familiar story. A freedom of information request last year revealed that in the year 201516, 10,051 cases of domestic violence against adults by children were investigated by 35 of the 43 police forces in England and Wales. Of these cases, 874 led to cautions being issued and 1,459 to juveniles being charged with offences.“My feeling is that it is more widespread,” says social worker and CPV campaigner Helen Bonnick. “I am seeing lots of links with CPV and children and young people’s mental health – so if, as we are told, that is worsening you would expect there to be a knock-on effect.”CPV and APV are more prevalent in particular groups – children with mental health problems or special needs the adoption and fostering communities families that have experienced domestic violence and where young people are abusing substances.Children within these risk groups may have “several overlapping issues”, says Bonnick. Early trauma, such as neglect or living with domestic violence, may have affected the way they react to stress – or had a modelling effect. Children who are abusing substances may lash out while intoxicated or demand money for drugs. Like Tom, those with mental health issues may be living with such high levels of anxiety that it takes very little to tip them into fight, flight or freeze.“Fundamentally,” says Bonnick, “we see young people who are trying to cope with the demands of life, and are having to ‘speak loudly’ to have their needs met. They may find stressful situations extremely hard to manage because of a neurological condition or early trauma. They may have learned that violence pays off in achieving certain ends.”However, CPV and APV is not exclusive to these groups. Rachel Condry found that APV occurred across the social spectrum and that while it is more commonly against mothers by sons, a significant proportion of fathers were victims and daughters perpetrators. In some families there was a clear cause, in others Condry said she “literally could not find a reason”.Tip of the iceberg What is clear, is that the problem is much wider than reported – “for very understandable reasons”, says Suzanne Jacob, chief executive of domestic abuse charity SafeLives. “Those who experience intimate partner violence only call the police at a rate of one in five. We can all see the reasons why you would be even less likely to call the police about your child – and not just the police – there is so much attached in terms of any stigma people feel, and in terms of worries about consequences for themselves and the child.”Shame and fear can prevent parents seeking the help they need – as can lack of understanding from family, friends and agencies. “The kind of dismissiveness people in previous times applied to intimate partner violence is still applied to CPV,” says Jacob. “People end up minimising what is actually an incredibly serious issue in somebody’s home.”The insidious nature of domestic abuse also plays its part. “It can build up gradually,” says Bonnick, who runs the campaigning and resource website Holes in the Wall. “It takes a while to acknowledge that you are being abused … because it’s become so normal,” she says.Her observation resonates. I once described to a friend the lengths I had to go to in order to have a shower – reasons that included sleeping as long as I could after being awake most of the night, and also because often Tom would repeatedly batter the bathroom door. “You do realise,” she said after a long silence, “how very far from normal your life has become?”I did, and didn’t. In fact, all of us – my son, myself, and my two younger teenage children – existed in a kind of suspended reality. The scale of how wrong things were meant that when I did start contacting agencies for help, I found it almost impossible to articulate the problems.And in common with many, I had an uphill job getting people to really hear what was happening.“I think often people do ask for help and get knocked back – passed from one agency to another,” says Bonnick. “It can be very difficult to find where to go in the first place, and then even if you do approach an agency, what sort of help do you get?”It’s a good question. The reality is that there is no national blueprint for dealing with CPV and the quality of help families receive is patchy. “What you get is pockets of good practice,” says Condry, “but a lot of areas where there is practically nothing.”“There has been a massive retraction of funding for child and adolescent mental health and local services, and cuts in youth justice as well.”Last summer Jacob, Condry and Bonnick all took part in the consultation for the government’s draft domestic abuse and violence legislation. They are unclear as to whether CPV will make its first appearance in a domestic violence bill. And while there are benefits to it being included, such as raising its profile, Bonnick is wary about drawing too many parallels with adult abuse.“There is a problem with identifying with adult perpetrators because we might not want to get sucked into the sort of response that is considered appropriate for that. Children are still young and growing, and habits are not so fixed. There is much more hope for change.’Whole family protection Inclusion in the bill might, however, be a step towards families accessing the help they need.I am convinced that our own situation only changed because I started to call the police. Concerns followed about the welfare of my younger children. Our case was presented at the monthly Multi-Agency Risk Assessment Conference (Marac), which put pressure on services to act. I was allocated an independent domestic violence advocate (Idva) from an organisation called Splitz, which offers support services to people experiencing domestic abuse. We met regularly and her support was crucial in keeping our case on the radar.Chrissy Stower, area manager for Splitz, says that while recognition of the problem has improved, there is still a long way to go.“The system is geared up for parent on child abuse, not the other way round,” she says. “This is seen as a ‘parenting’ issue with the child not being seen as being at risk from the parent. We have to expend a lot of energy in making the case to achieve support for child on parent abuse cases.”Condry agrees: “We’ve heard of families who have gone to social services and been told there’s no younger siblings in the family so it’s not a protection issue. We would argue very strongly that if a young person is being violent in the family there’s a massive safeguarding issue because he or she is not developing in a way they should be.”Condry is also clear that seeing CPV as a parenting issue is an over-simplification. “I am really reluctant to dwell on explanations that involve blaming parents,” she says. “There are so many complexities in families that this happens to.“It’s impossible to work with this by adjusting your behaviour, filling out a worksheet or trying to lay down boundaries,” she says. “That sort of thing is not going to work if someone has lived under siege for a couple of years.”“Burnout” is the phrase Condry says parents used often in her research to describe the impact of APV. At the family level, child to parent violence contributes to family breakdown, economic hardship and mental health problems.My relationship with Tom’s father did not survive our disagreements over how to handle him. As Tom’s violence and coercive behaviour became worse, I watched my other children fall apart, one began to behave self-destructively and the other withdrew further into his phone.I could barely work because I was getting so little sleep, and because Tom’s coercive behaviours took up so much time. I tried to visit my GP to talk about my own mental health, but all I could do was sob wordlessly. And all the while, I worried desperately about Tom – my inability to place boundaries meant that he was putting himself at risk, mixing with people who were exploiting him, and dabbling in drugs. “What medication are you on,” an attending police officer asked me one night. “None,” I replied. “Then how are you still standing?” he asked.And there is a wider social cost to consider. In research published in 2009, Syliva Walby, distinguished professor in sociology at the University of Lancaster, found that domestic violence and abuse cost the UK an estimated £15.7bn in 2008. If CPV is now as widespread as some people believe, then the associated costs to the economy will be significant.“You would imagine that if you did apply the economic cost of CPV and APV it would be massive,” says Condry. “Somebody who works in the youth justice field told me his suspicion was that a very large number of kids taken into care, especially in the 14-plus age range, would be due to family breakdown because of violence in the home,” she adds.Fund support services“There is a good case to be made for support services being funded to save a lot of money in the long run,” says Condry.It is clear to me that support services are not getting the funding they need now. I sensed frustration among the police officers attending us that they were working with blunt tools and being left to make difficult judgment calls. Emergency foster and respite centres had been closed, so they were faced with the tough choices of putting a vulnerable youth in a cell, sectioning him, or walking away.Tom was moved out of our home in the summer. My life now is radically different. I can work, I can even go out for the evening. But I still can’t sleep. Putting my child into care was searingly painful. I am often paralysed by recriminations, guilt and despair. I no longer look at baby pictures.Tom lives in his placement on the other side of our town. He is bewildered, angry and doesn’t properly understand why he is there. His capacity to make sense of what is happening to him is limited, and he is unable or unwilling to face up to his actions, leaving little room for us to repair our badly broken relationship.As Tom approaches adulthood, my influence over what happens to him will decline dramatically. I had always envisaged that I would house and care for him for as long as he needed me. Without my support, I fear greatly for his future – with it, I fear for mine.If you have been affected by the issues in this article, please visit holesinthewall or safelives.org.uk.

Melville also said he would prefer an Englishman for the role but did reveal he would be contacting Warren Gatland in the new year.“I think they suggested every coach in world rugby is of interest. I don’t think it’s narrowed down to me,” Lancaster told the Irish Independent. “I think that was the way it was described but I think Nigel Melville said they’d be happy to talk to any coach and I’d fall into that category. It’s a hypothetical situation because it’s never been suggested. I’ve never spoken to Nigel Melville or the RFU, so I don’t even exercise my mind thinking about it.”Leinster have responded to Bath’s controversial decision to ban their supporters’ flags during Saturday’s European Champions Cup match at the Rec by insisting they are perfectly safe.Shortly before kick-off on Saturday it emerged Bath had refused to allow Leinster to distribute approximately 1,500 flags to their fans, claiming they had failed three health and safety checks, including fire. Compounding the situation, Bath distributed several thousand of their own flags to their supporters before the match but some Leinster fans still managed to sneak a few of their own into the ground, defiantly waving them during their side’s 17-10 victory.“While Leinster respect the decision made by Bath and their officials, we are keen to avoid a repeat ever happening again and in this regard we are happy to confirm that the flags distributed centrally by Leinster are covered by a safety certificate and that the same batch of flags are still in use,” read a Leinster statement.“We have also consulted with our flag providers, Scimitar Sports, and also with our own health \u0026amp safety officers who are both happy to discuss any issues with Bath direct to allay their fears. We are also reassured by the certificate in place for these products and are confident that our supporters and indeed other clubs going forward have nothing to fear.”Mako Vunipola believes he has a fight on his hands to regain his England place after the emergence of Ben Moon during the autumn.

But this show is all about letting children in, not keeping them out. The caution tape is quickly lifted and the kids are invited inside and given access to all areas. They’re here to explore the history of one extraordinary woman, Jane Nassau Senior, who used to live on this very spot. It isn’t long before the children (ages six and upwards) are leading from the front, charging about the building and gulping up historical facts as they go.The action begins outside the re-created front door of Jane’s home, The Elm House, which is surrounded by rubble and scattered leaves. This is where Britain’s very first female civil servant – Jeanie to her friends – forged her career, helped revolutionise workhouses and kickstarted the notion of foster care. The memory of Jeanie’s work is fading and it’s down to the children to preserve her place in history. We’re split into small groups and led around the venue by an impossibly chirpy Time Keeper. Our Time Keeper for the day, Elizabeth Bartram, does a stellar job at cultivating curiosity in the kids and just about managing to keep them under control.Each group is also given a giant stick, which mysteriously rumbles and directs us towards a series of simple but thoughtful installations from designer Kirsty Harris. The first child tasked with holding the stick excitedly cries out – “Magic, show us the way!’ – and with that we’re off. We stumble across a giant golden heart, which radiates warmth and throbs when we rest our heads up against it. The word “courage” is emblazoned on the wall and the children discuss what courage means, and why it’s important. Later, we come across a huge sculpture of a dandelion and talk about hope. We’re encouraged to make our own wishes, which include – among the children and adults – unicorns, a pet and a large glass of prosecco.The joy of Sarah Golding’s show (and this was also a feature of Golding’s 2015 BAC festive show, Town Hall Cherubs) is that she gives the children in the audience real responsibility and agency. Their hopes, ideas and inidual personalities are carefully folded into the fabric of the show. Archive photos are scattered at each installation and the children are asked to describe what they see. One photo is of a group of children who are now living in much kinder conditions, thanks to Jeanie’s pioneering work. A boy studies the photo carefully and proudly tells the gathered audience: “They’re smiling. They look happy. It’s not a fake smile. Their eyes are smiling too!” Brilliant."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f488b5cefbdff682a8cd74507c05fcb6241766e5/0_17_3161_1896/master/3161.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0f300ee32296596d68ad5dc23033982a","title":"cliff richard sir public private review troubling time","story":"The story of the star’s battle to clear his name adds weight to a wider look at his career and commitment to privacyThey dealt with what I suspect his devoted fans refer to only as “his trouble” upfront in last night’s documentary Sir Cliff: 60 Years in Public and Private (ITV). The 78-year-old singer suffered four years of turmoil after police raided his Berkshire home as a result of an allegation made as part of Operation Yewtree. The BBC broadcast live footage and named Sir Cliff as the subject of the complaint. After two years of investigation he was neither arrested nor charged. He sued the BBC for invasion of privacy and this year was awarded damages of £210,000.The effect of these events on Cliff, his career and his fans was threaded through the rest of the programme, adding a little heft to what was essentially – and would, four years ago, have been purely – a piece of hagiographic fluff about the “Peter Pan of pop” who has survived six decades of changing tastes and fashion and sold 250m records along the way.But for every piece of archive footage showing Cliff – looking young for his age even in his late teens and 20s – singing with the Drifters-cum-Shadows or starring in Summer Holiday and The Young Ones, there was a loop back to the unfolding Trouble and either Cliff or a friend on hand to testify to the awfulness of it all. “He didn’t sleep for four years,” says an outraged Gloria Hunniford (there is no way to write that sentence without it sounding bathetic, I’m sorry – I don’t mean to, but it’s impossible, I’ve tried). “I’ve never seen Cliff act inappropriately with anyone,” says Hank Marvin. Sir Cliff’s sister, Joan, remembers how worried she was that the stress was going to bring on a heart attack. Their father died when Cliff was 21. “He always looked after me after that,” Joan says. “He was a lovely brother.” There was a very touching moment when Cliff revealed that after his mother got dementia, she stopped calling him Cliff and took to referring to him as “that Cliff Richard” instead.It stood out as one of only two really personal details he shared (though they may already be known to his fans, among whom – despite my mother’s efforts in the 1980s – I cannot number myself). The other came, ironically, during a reiteration of his steadfast commitment to the notion that the public do not have a right to know everything about their celebrities. He saw the practical point of this abstract principle the first time – still probably in his teens – he was seen out with a girlfriend. It was just after he had given a concert and the waiting fans threw their programmes to the ground and stamped on them. Lesson, you inferred, very much learned.So, experience and temperament have combined to ensure that Sir Cliff has not kept us all informed of his thoughts, opinions, sexuality, living arrangements, partners or much of anything really, except his new album releases (there is one coming soon, and from the snatches we hear of it during the programme it sounds lyrically and musically unbearable to anyone but his followers, which at this point is all that matters) and, of course, his Christianity. He risked his career very early on by performing during a 1966 rally held by Billy Graham, the evangelist’s evangelist, in London, and talking about his faith freely thereafter. In the past few years, God has been a particular comfort. Cliff prayed every day “because I had good friends and family, but … I didn’t have anyone to talk to the way I can talk to God. With God, you don’t have to express it. I believe he knows what you’re feeling.”The commitment to privacy, of course, has left rumours plenty of space to swirl in over the years. Even as a child I was amazed at the papers’ obsession with the singer’s sexuality and whether he was a virgin (what with all that Christianity and everything), until they all went mad with salacious glee about his relationship with Sue Barker.“I quite like the word ‘enigma’,” says Sir Cliff, despite the vulnerability it caused when the Yewtree complaint was made. “I refuse,” he adds fiercely, “to be fodder for journalists.

It has suggested the flashpoint Yemeni port city of Hodeidah should be brought under the joint UN-supervised control of Houthi rebel fighters and the UN-backed government led by Abd Rabbu Mansour Hadi.Martin Griffiths, the UN special envoy for Yemen, described Hodeidah as the centre of gravity for the war. He said at a press conference in Rimbo – where the talks were in their fifth day – that he hoped to publish “detailed, ambitious and tangible” confidence-building proposals in the next few days, including plans for the future administration of Hodeidah and its port.The UN has proposed the port, as opposed to the city, should be brought under its supervision, with the Houthis and the Yemen government cooperating with the arrangement.Griffiths said he hoped the talks would agree a package including an end to the Saudi air blockade of Sana’a airport. He would like to see the capital’s airport opened to international flights, humanitarian access in Hodeidha and Yemen’s third city, Taiz, a mass prisoner release programme and economic reforms designed to shore up the Yemeni currency.“Hope is the currency of a mediator,” said Griffiths, adding that after five days of talk he was still ambitious and was focused on trying to find ways to reduce the fighting.Griffiths planned to hold a further round of talks in the new year designed to make progress on a long-term political settlement to end the four-year-long civil war.The war has pitted Iran-backed Houthi fighters in control of Sana’a and Hodeidha against a UN-recognised government based in Aden and supported by the Saudi air force.Griffiths said the UN was trying to take the port of Hodeidha out of the war “to reduce the level of fighting, increase humanitarian access, provide for the movement of people, help the process of removing mines”.Ali Ashall, a Yemeni official and member of the government’s delegation, said the city’s police must be placed under the supervision of the ministry of interior.He also demanded the management of the port to be placed under the jurisdiction of the ministry of transport. “We call on the Houthis to withdraw from Hodeidah and hand over their weapons to the government, Ashall said.Yemen’s deputy foreign minister, Hussein al-Ezzi, told the  it supported UN supervision of Hodeidha, adding that the military escalation against the port “was based on two false arguments: first, we seize the port’s resources. The second is that the port is used to smuggle weapons.”He said: “We have accepted that the United Nations play a supervisory role to ensure both that arms are not imported and resources are transferred to the Central Bank of Sana’a with the aim of paying salaries.“This initiative was rejected, indicating that the aim of the escalation in Hodeidah is to stifle the Yemeni people and force them to surrender, which is impossible and rejected by the majority of Yemeni people.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3726753.1544474353!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"comet to pass unusually close to earth on friday","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA stock photo image of a comet.

Video: Reuters\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritish prime  minister Theresa May (centre) speaking in the House of Commons on Monday Photograph: AFPPRUGetty British prime minister Theresa May is to travel to Europe to seek concessions on her Brexit deal, after calling off a crunch House of Commons vote in which she was expected to go down to a heavy defeat.In a statement to MPs, Mrs May also said the government was stepping up preparations for a possible no-deal Brexit.And she said that MPs who were threatening to vote against the deal she secured with Brussels must ask themselves the fundamental question: “Does this House want to deliver Brexit?”If the answer was yes, she said that they needed to consider whether they were prepared to make “compromises” in order to make good on the 2016 referendum vote to leave the EU.Mrs May’s statement came amid dramatic scenes at Westminster, as news of her plan to postpone Tuesday’s “meaningful vote” broke just minutes after Downing Street had insisted it was going ahead.An Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said on Monday preparations for a no-deal Brexit should intensify after Ms May pulled the vote on her EU orce deal.Mr Varadkar said in a statement that he had spoken to European Council President Donald Tusk and agreed that the withdrawal agreement was the best option and could not be renegotiated.“They also agreed that preparations for a ‘no deal’ outcome should intensify,” the statement said.Mr Tusk has announced that Brexit has been added to the agenda of the two-day EU summit taking place in Brussels on Thursday and Friday.But he insisted: “We will not renegotiate the deal.”Mr Tusk said in a tweet: “I have decided to call #EUCO on #Brexit (Art. 50) on Thursday.“We will not renegotiate the deal, including the backstop, but we are ready to discuss how to facilitate UK ratification. As time is running out, we will also discuss our preparedness for a no-deal scenario.”It is understood that Mrs May had been warned that she faced a large-scale defeat when MPs voted at the end of five days of debate in the Commons on her plans.She spoke with her Cabinet colleagues by a telephone conference call before addressing the Commons.Speaking to MPs, Mrs May accepted that there was “widespread and deep concern” over the backstop arrangement, designed to keep the Irish border open if the EU and UK fail to strike a wider trade deal.If the vote had gone ahead as planned, the government would have been defeated by a “significant margin”, she said.“We will therefore defer the vote scheduled for tomorrow and not proceed to ide the House at this time.”A Labour MP was thrown out the House of Commons after picking up the ceremonial mace in protest at the UK government’s handling of Brexit.Lloyd Russell-Moyle held the mace aloft and marched towards the Commons doors where he was stopped by officials.He handed over the mace without incident but faced angry shouts from Tory MPs who cried “expel him” as Speaker John Bercow rose to his feet.Mr Bercow, under parliamentary rules, ordered Mr Russell-Moyle to leave the chamber for “the remainder of the day”.Mr Russell-Moyle initially refused the order and remained in the House before Mr Bercow said: “No, no he must leave or be escorted, he should leave” – at which he left.The mace is the symbol of royal authority and without it neither the house of Commons or Lords can meet or pass laws.Mrs May said she believed there was “a majority to be won” in the Commons on her deal, if she is able to “secure additional reassurance” on the backstop, and that this would be her focus over the coming days.But she insisted: “There is no deal available that does not include the backstop.”Mrs May said she had spoken by phone with European leaders over the weekend and will meet others, as well as the chiefs of the European Council and Commission, before the EU summit opens in Brussels on Thursday.“I will discuss with them the clear concerns that this House has expressed,” she said.The government was also looking at “new ways of empowering the House of Commons” to ensure that any provision for a backstop has “democratic legitimacy and to enable the House to place its own obligations on the Government to ensure that the backstop cannot be in place indefinitely”, said Mrs May.She added: “If you take a step back, it is clear that this House faces a much more fundamental question.“Does this House want to deliver Brexit? And if it does, does it want to do so through reaching an agreement with the EU?“If the answer is yes, and I believe that is the answer of the majority of this House, then we all have to ask ourselves whether we are prepared to make a compromise.“Because there will be no enduring and successful Brexit without some compromise on both sides of the debate.”A spokeswoman for European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker poured cold water on hopes of a renegotiation of the Withdrawal Agreement, reached after more than 18 months of talks.In a press briefing in Brussels, Mina Andreeva said: “As president Juncker said, this deal is the best and only deal possible.“We will not renegotiate – our position has therefore not changed and as far as we are concerned the United Kingdom is leaving the European Union on March 29 2019.”Ahead of her statement, Mrs May spoke by phone to Arlene Foster, leader of the Democratic Unionist Party, whose MPs prop up the minority Conservative administration but were threatening to vote against her deal.Ms Foster said: “My message was clear. The backstop must go. Too much time has been wasted. Need a better deal. Disappointed it has taken so long for Prime Minister to listen.”And she spoke to Scottish first minister Nicola Sturgeon, who said she told the PM that “delaying the vote is an abdication of responsibility, leading to even greater chaos”.The Scottish National Party leader and Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable both urged Jeremy Corbyn to call a vote of no confidence in the Prime Minister, which they said their parties would support.Both Ms Sturgeon and Sir Vince said they would press for a second referendum in order to allow voters to pass judgment on whether they still want Britain to leave the EU.Shouts of “resign” were heard from the Labour benches as Theresa May concluded her statement.Mr Corbyn said: “The government has lost control of events and is in complete disarray.”He urged Mrs May to be clear over whether she is seeking changes to the deal or “mere reassurances” and asked if she was “ready to drop further red lines in order to make progress”.Bringing back a “botched” amendment to her deal next week or in January would not deal with its “fundamental flaws”, he said.“This is a bad deal for Britain, a bad deal for our economy and a bad deal for our democracy. Our country deserves better than this,” said Mr Corbyn.The dramatic developments occurred as the European Court of Justice ruled that Britain can unilaterally halt the Brexit process by revoking the Article 50 letter declaring its intention to leave the EU.Speaking earlier on Monday, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said he had not been made aware of any plans by Mrs May to delay the vote when they spoke on Sunday, and that the “withdrawal agreement, including the Irish backstop, is the only agreement on the table”.He said Ireland would be open to statements of clarification but that the substance of the withdrawal agreement could not be changed.Ahead of the announcement, a European commission spokesman said: “This deal is the best and only deal possible. We will not renegotiate the deal that is on the table right now. That is very clear.“Our position has therefore not changed and as far as we’re concerned the UK is leaving the EU on the 29th March, 2019. We are prepared for all scenarios.”–  reporters and agenciesDeal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches. See more here.

Despite the presence of several seats of learning here I continue to be surprised at the absence of any serious scholarship tracking the step changes happening before our eyes.Recently, I listened to former Democratic Unionist Party first minister Peter Robinson when he gave a speech to the Knock Methodist Centre in East Belfast. Later, some of those in the audience told me they are now learning Irish.Let us not exaggerate the numbers of those in the Protestant community who are doing so, but their actions are in contrast to the crass denigration of the language by some in the DUP, such as party leader Arlene Foster or Gregory Campbell.Once upon a time, Peter Robinson might have agreed, or did agree with such views. But he grew comfortable during his years in government dealing with “crocodiles” such as Martin McGuinness and fellow Sinn Féin Irish-speaking personnel, unlike his colleagues.Can you imagine Robinson’s thoughts on the Irish language as he watched his colleagues letting the issue of the treatment of it lead to the collapse last February of a deal that would have restored the Stormont institutions.Speaking at the Knock Methodist Centre, he said: “I couldn’t care less about the Irish Language. Let them speak it until they are green, white and orange in the face, as long as it doesn’t encroach on me. This was ‘such a small issue’ – smaller than, say, the devolution of policing and justice and, before that, agreeing the conditions for that Paisley-McGuinness Executive.”The DUP incontrovertibly reached a deal in February with Sinn Féin. Equally, it is incontrovertible that the DUP later resiled from that deal, leaving former ministers and its negotiators, Edwin Poots and Simon Hamilton, exposed and potentially damaged.The bona fides of the secret agreement, which Brian Rowan I reported on in Eamonn Mallie. com in the days after the collapse of the talks, were contemptuously challenged by Jeffrey Donaldson, Foster and Campbell.However, it is time to nail the big lie peddled by the DUP that Sinn Féin was responsible for collapsing the February 9th negotiations because of what the DUP call Sinn Féin’s “red lines” on the Irish language.Instead, the DUP negotiating team had bought into an agreement that embraced the Irish language. Initially, it had Foster’s blessing. Indeed, top Irish and British officials returned home that Friday evening confident the deal was in the bag.The DUP grassroots rose up over the weekend when news broke that British prime minister Theresa May and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar were due at Stormont on Monday, February 12th, to give the emerging agreement their imprimatur.During that weekend, Foster was overwhelmed by forces in her own party, including one DUP MP who told me that he took “one look” at the document after he returned from London and told the negotiators “it won’t fly with the grassroots”. The MP said it was impossible for the party to sell a package that better acknowledged the place of the Irish language given that the DUP leadership had run a campaign of abuse against it for nearly two years.The leadership panicked and the rest is history. Merrion Street in Dublin and Downing Street were left speechless on Wednesday, February 14th, after Foster tweeted: “In our view there is no current prospect of the discussions leading to an Executive being formed.”During his speech to the Knock Methodist Centre, Robinson drove a horse and coaches through the DUP leadership’s contestable history of what had happened during those days in February.“I wish the draft agreement that unravelled in February had been leaked earlier,” he said. Robinson argued that many of the fears wrongly raised in advance about quotas in the Civil Service having to speak Irish and Irish language street signs everywhere, proved groundless.The damage done then to the working relationship in February between the DUP and Sinn Féin may prove to be irreparable, certainly in the short to long term. Indeed, it could be argued that Sinn Féin has every reason to sit and wait.The United Kingdom’s impending Brexit from the European Union and the bitterly-contested withdrawal agreement May concluded with the EU27 in Brussels, should it stick, might discourage Sinn Féin from returning to Stormont.Republicans could interpret that the agreement’s terms are a tinkering with, or fracturing of, the place of Northern Ireland in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland that this is something positive and not to be discouraged.This point has to be tempered, however, by an acceptance that the deal agreed by May is surprisingly favourable to Northern Ireland, when viewed solely through economic eyes. Such a deal was considered illusory by nationalists at the outset.The confidence and supply agreement between the Conservatives and the DUP keeping May in power blindsided nationalists to any potential good flowing from Brexit. The EU May withdrawal deal came from left field.Nationalists had been feeling abandoned by Downing Street, left to the mercy of a daily London-centric, patronising DUP cacophony coming at them in waves, where Nigel Dodds and his fellow DUP MPS strutted the Westminster stage.In the eyes of nationalists the DUP have wrongly assumed it has authority to speak on behalf of all in Northern Ireland, despite the fact the majority voted to stay in the EU.The May-EU deal has been begrudgingly welcomed by Sinn Féin because it would guard against a hard border. But the reality is that if it holds, a big if, admittedly, then Brexit will do more to redefine Northern Ireland’s status than occurred during 30 years of IRA violence.Sinn Féin will likely hold back from signing up to any Stormont arrangement with the DUP. They know that the sword of Damocles hangs above that party until the cash-for-ash ( Renewable Heat Incentive) scandal inquiry reports in the new year.Sinn Féin is wary about Foster’s ability to deliver a deal. And they would need to be certain that she can deliver in any fresh negotiations. Republicans are mindful too of another shift occurring – there is a sea-change in attitudes of middle-class nationalists.This is not an accident. Doctors, dentists, solicitors, people in business and in many walks of life, from a Catholic nationalist background, ashamed of the IRA’s campaign of violence, much of it visited upon their Protestant neighbours in salubrious residential areas, and in the workplace, kept their heads down during the Troubles and got on with their lives.However, that has changed – to invoke the immortal words of WB Yeats on the back of two words, “crocodile” and “Brexit”. “All changed uttlerly changed.” Middle-class nationalism is no longer sitting on the fence.They like what they know, see and hear in Dublin under the leadership of Varadkar and Tánaiste Simon Coveney. They are proud of the Republic as a 21st century State, where its leaders sit comfortably at the Brussels table unencumbered by the historical labels of religious and social conservatism.This fact has not escaped Robinson’s attention either who remarked, while addressing the Methodists in east Belfast, “you can’t speak now of Home Rule being Rome Rule” south of the Border.The hurt – and there is no other word – visited upon nationalism in 2017 by Foster when she said, “if you feed a crocodile it will keep coming back and looking for more” was incalculable.Though the DUP leader was directing her remarks at Sinn Féin’s demand for an Irish Language Act, the injury was felt by all nationalists not just those interested in the language. Reading between the lines, they judged that parity of esteem was not on offer in what Foster calls “my precious union”.That one word did more damage to any nationalist sense of belonging to the patch of land they inhabit than anything ever uttered by former Northern Ireland PM Basil Brookeborough who in 1933 said: “Many in this audience employ Catholics, but I have not one about my place. Catholics are out to destroy Ulster. ”One wonders whether Robinson’s intervention creates a more conducive environment, providing wriggle room for Foster when “parity of esteem” for nationalists next comes back on the table.Unionism believes the sparkle from that sonorous jewel – our precious union – is in danger of losing much of its radiance as a result of the May withdrawal agreement. This is debatable since Northern Ireland’s constitutional position is guaranteed under the terms of the Belfast Agreement.The DUP is clutching desperately at their sense of Britishness. And they genuinely feel the May package poses a threat to their identity politically, constitutionally and culturally. In essence what unionism is desperate to protect is its “parity of esteem” as citizens of the UK.The deficit in the unionist psyche is that it has continuously refused to acknowledge that nationalists also feel they have an entitlement to parity of esteem. This denial to nationalism by unionism is responsible for the absence of a government in Northern Ireland.The DUP’s time in the sun was short lived. Their 10 Westminster MPs proved incapable of keeping a check on their exuberance and sense of self-importance flowing from their agreement with the Conservative party.Soon, allegations of “betrayal” and “vassal state” emerged from the DUP as it warned its deal is with the Conservatives, not with May. It will be interesting to see how long that crutch will bear the political strain.The atmosphere in Westminster fuels the DUP sense of paranoia and its conviction that Northern Ireland is being treated differently from the rest of the UK. It leaves them at risk, too, of ridicule for placing their trust in Conservatives.History students will recall former British prime minister Ted Heath’s proroguing of the Stormont government in the 1970s, Margaret Thatcher’s 1981 secret contacts with IRA hunger strikers, the 1985 signing of the Anglo Irish Agreement over the heads of unionism and former British PM John Major’s secret back channel to Sinn Féin in the early 1990s. The withdrawal agreement is but the latest act in the Conservative-unionist drama.In truth, the DUP is a party that staggers from crisis to crisis and from scandal to scandal.What leader of a large political party wants to have to stand up at its annual conference and wear sackcloth and ashes as Foster did last month in her address over the cash-for-ash scandal.I have observed enough down the years to know that at moments like these where there is talk of any threat to Northern Ireland’s constitutional status this can be accompanied by “rustling in the undergrowth” by loyalists.While the opposition role being played by the DUP to the so called back-stop agreed by Theresa May and the EU to prevent a hard border may serve as a safety valve, the Police Service of Northern Ireland, I suspect will be keeping an ear to the ground.Remarkably the DUP finds itself for the first time at loggerheads with the Ulster Farmers Union (UFU), the Confederation of Business Industry, the NI Retail Consortium, the Chamber of Commerce and several food and drink umbrella groups which are all taking a contrary position on the May withdrawal deal to the DUP. Some of these groups went over the heads of the DUP MPs to meet May in Downing Street.In turn, DUP MP Sammy Wilson accused businesses backing the deal of being “the puppets of the Northern Ireland Office”, while the usually unflappable DUP chief whip Jeffrey Donaldson lost his temper when speaking on The View BBC One Northern Ireland.There, he said, “the UFU and business leaders – they are wrong. I don’t believe they have read the detail of this, they have not read the 500 pages. There are serious constitutional and economic implications of this deal for Northern Ireland.”Such words did not go down well, particularly after Foster indulged in Trumpian politics by claiming that the media is trying to drive a wedge between her party and Northern Ireland’s business community.That opposition to the DUP’s stance has not diminished.For the first time there are signs of fissuring in middle-class unionism. The retired surgeon Terry Irwin who calls himself an Irish unionist tweeted recently: “The DUP have convinced many ‘soft’ unionists like myself to seriously consider whether we would be better in a United Ireland.”Prof Jim Dornan, an obstetrician-gynaecologist, is now entertaining the idea of a new Ireland. He said: “I would traditionally be thought of as being quite happy with the union and I have been. It has been very good to me, educationally and health wise and everything else in my life.”On whether he thought a Border poll would mean a victory for Irish unity, he said: “Against the union as we have at the moment, there is a lot of people nowadays, not just me, who are saying ‘you know what, if somebody offers me a better deal and somebody offers me a good deal, then I would go for it’.” He added, “everything is on the table” after the Brexit vote.I underscored earlier the sea-change in middle-class nationalist opinion. The fluidity of thinking in middle-class unionism – people of business and professional backgrounds cannot be ignored. Around dinner tables some traditional unionists are now openly questioning where they want to be politically – some thinking the unthinkable – living in a new Ireland. The changes may be subtle, but they should not be ignored.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches. See more here.

Photograph: Toby MelvilleReutersAny British obstruction of Irish hauliers travelling to and from Europe through the UK could lead to retaliatory restrictions on British traffic in Europe, transport and export industry sources have warned.Concerns about risks to disruptions to the vital route for haulage companies have emerged in light of calls by Conservative former minister Priti Patel to use the “land bridge” as leverage to seek concessions on the Brexit deal.The former international development minister was condemned in Ireland and UK for saying Britain could prevent the use of the country as a bridge between Ireland and European in a no-deal scenario in order to press the Irish Government to drop the contentious backstop.She later backtracked on her comments, saying that they were “taken out of context”.The UK is party to an international agreement on transport through countries known as Common Transit convention, signed in 1987, which guarantees the unhindered transit of goods.The agreement extends beyond European Union member states to countries such as Switzerland, Norway, Turkey, Macedonia and Serbia. Any deliberate delays imposed on goods passing through the UK for products originating from or destined for any of these countries and Ireland would amount to a breach of this convention.“If you stopped vehicles travelling through the land bridge, basically you are tearing up the convention, which would harm British hauliers who rely on that going to the Continent after Brexit,” said Seamus Leheny, policy manager with the Freight Transport Association in Northern Ireland.Two-thirds of Irish exporters make use of the UK land bridge, connecting Ireland and Europe through British ports such as Holyhead and Dover, according to the Irish Exporters Association. Some 53 per cent of Irish exports with the rest of the world (excluding the UK) in volume terms pass through the UK.“Would the EU take a dim view of Britain taking unilateral action in relation to the land bridge? Would they retaliate? Maybe they could. It could mean that there is a slowdown of British freight getting on and off the island,” said Simon McKeever, chief executive of the Irish Exporters Association.A bigger concern for importers and exporters, and transport companies shipping goods, is the delays arising from customs checks at points of entry into the UK should Theresa May’s Brexit deal be voted down in the House of Commons.Verona Murphy, president of the Irish Road Haulage Association, said she did not believe the UK would threaten to block off access for transiting goods but delays could make it seem that way.“If there were to be a no-deal Brexit, the disruption it will cause may well look like the land bridge has been stopped there will be so much traffic backed up at the ports,” she said.Irish business groups are expected to heap significant pressure on Government this week to disclose further details of the no-deal contingency planning being developed privately should the EU-UK orce deal be voted down by the UK parliament, as is widely expected given the level of opposition to the proposed agreement.Government sources fear that any no-deal contingency plans released in Dublin could be used for political advantage by the rival Leave and Remain factions in London to press for further demands from Brussels.The Department of the Taoiseach hosted a meeting of senior civil servants from various Government departments last Friday in what was the latest in a series of planning meetings around no-deal contingency work.Companies in the pharmaceutical and food and drinks industry were planning to begin stockpiling products should Mrs May’s deal be voted down, said Mr McKeever.“We are getting increasingly concerned about a no-deal situation and what happens then,” he said.On Friday, Ireland’s EU commissioner for agriculture, Phil Hogan, said the Government and State agencies “have to be planning ahead more intensively” for a potential no-deal scenario.He cited the risks to the land bridge specifically and said major energy and other infrastructure projects may need to be brought forward.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Charles McQuillanGettyWhy is the Irish Border such a big deal with Brexit? The 499-kilometre border running from Carlingford Lough to Lough Foyle will become the only land border between the UK and the European Union after Brexit.The 1998 Belfast Agreement brought peace to Northern Ireland and removed the need for border checks.It also established north-south rules and institutions that helped solidify the Peace Process. The border is currently invisible and neither side wants the return of infrastructure along the border or the creation of a hard border.So what exactly is a hard border? It is a frontier monitored and protected by customs officials and border inspectors, and potentially police or military personnel if there are security issues around the border.That could in turn lead to a police or military presence along the Border to protect check points. Customs and security posts along the Border were regular targets of republican paramilitaries during the 30-year Troubles.Why would there be a need for border checks? Different customs rules, regulations and standards will apply in Northern Ireland and the Republic if the UK is leaving the EU so the different rules could have to be enforced at a border.What do the EU and UK want along the Border? Neither party to the Brexit negotiations wants to see the return of a hard border but they cannot agree a plan on how to achieve this.So have they come up with anything to solve this problem? The EU and UK agreed in a political deal in December 2017 that a “backstop” was required in the withdrawal agreement – the orce deal – that would guarantee an invisible border in the event of no other solution to achieve this being found in a Brexit deal, either in a specific solution for Northern Ireland or in a broader EU-UK trade deal.The December 2017 agreement also aims to protect north-south cooperation, support the all-island economy and safeguards the 1998 Belfast Agreement. In March 2018 the two sides agreed that there had to be a legal text – not just a political declaration – around how this option would work in practice should no better option be found.What exactly is the backstop? It is an insurance policy written into the withdrawal agreement, or Brexit treaty, guaranteeing no harder border on the island of Ireland.It would only be used as a last resort or the default option if the EU and UK could not reach an overarching free trade deal that would make trade so frictionless that there would be no border between the EU and the UK, including on the frontier between Northern Ireland and the Republic.What backstop has the EU proposed? Brussels believes a hard border can be avoided and the Belfast Agreement upheld if Northern Ireland remains fully aligned with the EU’s customs union and parts of the single market after Brexit.This would mean matching the rules north and south of the Border for customs, energy, environmental regulations and laws covering agriculture and fisheries.Northern Ireland would stick to EU rules covering state aid and would fall under the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice in applying those rules. The EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier has insisted that this backstop can only apply to Northern Ireland.Does the UK like the EU’s proposed backstop? No. British prime minister Theresa May has said that no UK leader could agree to different rules applying to different parts of the UK that would separate Northern Ireland constitutionally and economically from the rest of the UK.London argues that if the backstop only applies to Northern Ireland, it would effectively create a customs and regulatory border in the Irish Sea.Does anyone else not like the EU plan? Yes, the Democratic Unionist Party, the largest part in Northern Ireland whose 10 MPs at Westminster prop up May’s minority Conservative government, and hardline Brexit supporters within her party.Both have said that Northern Ireland cannot be treated any differently from the rest of the UK after it leaves the EU in March 2019. They oppose any checks between Ireland and Britain and what they see as a border in the Irish Sea.DUP leader Arlene Foster has warned that its “red line” that there could be no Brexit deal that would ide Northern Ireland from the rest of the United Kingdom was “blood red”.The EU has since the summer been trying to devise a plan to “de-dramatise” its own backstop to make it more politically acceptable to the UK government and the DUP.What are the UK’s proposals for a wider EU-UK trade deal that might avoid a hard Irish border? May has said that under the UK government’s “Chequers plan” - the July 2018 proposal for an overarching trade agreement between the EU and the UK - the Border issue would be solved by effectively creating a free trade area for goods that would avoid the need for customs and regulatory checks between the EU and UK, including at the Border between Northern Ireland and the Republic.European Council president Donald Tusk has said that the Chequers proposals would not work.What backstop has the UK proposed? The UK government has suggested a backstop that would keep the whole of the UK aligned with EU customs union rules for a limited time after the post-Brexit transition period – a standstill period when current EU economic rules continue to apply over the UK – expires at the end of 2020.Can a compromise be reached on the backstop? The concept of a two-part backstop - also known as the backstop to the backstop has emerged in talks between the EU and UK in the so-called tunnel, the closed-door negotiating room in Brussels.This would involve a Northern Ireland-specific backstop that would effectively give way to a UK-wide customs-only backstop with additional measures applying to the Irish Border, including extra customs rules to ensure Northern Ireland’s regulations remain aligned with EU standards.That sounds like a way through this mess - is it? The EU has hinted that it would accept the whole of the UK temporarily staying in the customs union but there are still problems here.Hardline Brexiteers in May’s government are hostile to any backstop that could keep the UK or Northern Ireland subject to EU rules indefinitely and want the backstop to have an expiry date or release clause.Brussels and Dublin officials argue that this would not be a backstop it could not be an insurance policy if there was a way of backing out of it. It can be temporary “unless and until” a better solution is agreed but it cannot be time-limited or expire, they say.Is there a way around this? The UK’s Brexit secretary Dominic Raab has demanded a three-month time limit, saying that London and Dublin could accept a clause to allow the UK to withdraw from a UK-wide customs arrangement with three months’ notice.Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney has said that Ireland and the EU could never agree to a backstop that could be ended by the UK unilaterally and that these ideas “are not backstops at all and don’t deliver on previous UK commitments”.So is this proposal dead then? Not exactly. Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has said that a backstop with a three-month time limit would “not be worth the paper it is written on”, but has left the door slightly ajar for a potential solution.He has said that Ireland was also willing to consider proposals for a review clause on the backstop, drawing some criticism from opposition politicians at home.The backstop chosen in the draft will be in the form of a temporary UK-wide customs arrangement with more specific and deeper measures for Northern Ireland that will make more closely aligned with customs and the rules of the EU single market than for the rest of the UK.This, the officials believe, will avoid the need for a hard border if the matter is not addressed in a future EU-UK trade deal. The issue of the review mechanism, it appears, will involve a joint EU-UK committee judging when all-UK customs union can be terminated.But will it be agreed at a political level in London? That is the big question. UK cabinet ministers have been called to meeting to discuss the draft agreement. Hardline Brexiteers including Jacob Rees-Mogg, chairman of the European Research Group, and other Leave supporters such as Boris Johnson and Iain Duncan Smith, have already come out strongly against the proposals even before they have become fully aware of them.Johnson, who resigned as foreign secretary over May’s Brexit proposals, said the deal was “vassal state stuff” and that it was “utterly unacceptable” that the UK would be bound by laws over which it had no say.The DUP’s Westminster leader Nigel Dodds said that if the deal was in line with leaks over the last few days, then it would not be acceptable to his party, which keep Theresa May in power.And what if he doesn’t and both sides cannot agree to a backstop? If there is no backstop, there will be no orce deal and no transition period. In other words, there would be a disorderly Brexit and the UK would crash out of the EU in March 2019.It is anyone’s guess how goods passing over the Irish Border would be treated in such a scenario but the UK’s chaotic departure from the EU could create all sorts of difficulties for cross-border trade and beyond.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

She told the house that a vote on the Brexit withdrawal bill will be deferred. Photograph: PRUHOAFPGetty Images.The UK prime minister has identified the Irish border backstop as they key issue causing problems in getting the House of Commons to approve the withdrawal agreement she has negotiated with the EU. The backstop is the guarantee in the treaty that no matter what the outcome of future trade talks between the UK and EU, there will be no hard border on the island of Ireland. This would be achieved by the UK remaining in a customs union with the EU, after a transition period following Brexit, if at that stage a trade deal had not been completed between the two. This would ensure that no Irish border checks are needed. Mrs May has said she will go back to the other EU leaders to seek “reassurances” on this, but it is not clear what they might be. Many MPs have said that the backstop could see the UK “ trapped” in a customs union with the EU in the long term – so she has indicated that she will look for commitments that the EU side also sees the backstop as temporary. However Irish sources believe any limited assurances to the UK which might be on offer will not be anything like enough to get the deal supported in the House of Commons. Risks of a failure to reach a withdrawal deal have grown and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has said planning for a no-deal Brexit will be stepped up.The backstop is seen as an insurance policy – and both sides have said that they don’t want to use it. However, it has become increasingly clear that it could well end up being triggered because of the type of trade deal that the UK has said it wants in the long term. Under the withdrawal treaty, a standstill transition period would start after the UK leaves next March, lasting for at least two years and up to four years.The question is whether a trade deal could be done within the transition period, and if it would be sufficient to make border checks in Ireland, as an EU frontier, unnecessary. As the UK has said it wants to leave the EU trading bloc – the customs union and the single market – this looks unlikely. So under the agreement, the UK would then be obliged to remain in a customs union with the EU, to avoid customs checks at the Irish border, or in the Irish Sea. Some regulatory checks would be needed on goods crossing between Britain and Northern Ireland, however, and the North would have to follow some EU rules, which has caused the DUP to oppose the deal. It is not clear how the backstop, once entered, could be ended. In her speech to the Commons, Theresa May outlined the difficulties of the other courses being put forward for future trading arrangements and challenged the opponents of her deal to outline clearly a workable alternative and accept its consequences. For example those wanting to stay in the customs union and single market would have to accept that this would involve budget contributions and free movement of people, while those calling for a no-deal exit must recognise the economic damage this would bring.It is not clear what she hopes to achieve in her talks ahead of this week’s EU Summit. Referring to the backstop and its potentially indefinite nature, Mrs May told the Commons that the other leaders “ are open to discussions with us on this particular issue.” She said would seek further assurances about the “ temporary aspect” of the backstop and how the UK might exit it. It is possible that the other EU leaders could agree to strengthen some language in the political declaration – the non-binding statement on how both sides want the future relationship to evolve – making clear that both sides will make every effort to avoid the backstop, or ensure it is not permanent. But whatever language is agreed, the EU side will not shift from the terms in the withdrawal treaty itself, which says that the backstop will stay in place “ unless and until” some other arrangement is agreed to avoid a hard border. This is the essence of the backstop – that the UK cannot exit unilaterally and that it offers a permanent guarantee. There are mechanisms in the withdrawal agreement to oversee this – a joint committee and an arbitration process – but they do not provide a way for the UK to exit unilaterally. This is what Taoiseach Leo Varadkar means when he says the the Brexit deal “is the only one on the table.”The worries in the UK – that the backstop could be forever – is now the crunch issue in the talks, with obvious risks for Anglo-Irish relations. There is no obvious way out of this. Technology and advanced procedures can reduce the need for border checks between two trading blocs, but not eliminate them or control potential smuggling. Brexit was sold partly on the basis of the UK heading off from the EU’s influence and negotiating new trade deals with third countries like the US. Remaining “stuck” in a customs union would mean continuing to follow EU rules in some areas, while limiting the ability to do new trade deals. Meanwhile, the North and Britain could remain separate in some areas of regulation and rules set down by the single market, a ergence which would grow over time. While most economists say that the economic damage for the UK would be less if it stayed in the EU trading bloc fully, this would require it to follow EU rules including, crucially, on freedom of movement. Mrs May has indicated that gaining control of immigration is a “red line” issue for her. Meanwhile as she tries to sort it all out, it could be the New Year before the Commons is asked to vote again, extending and deepending the huge uncertainty which Brexit is now causing . Risks of a no-deal are growing though all still depends on the hugely uncertain political outlook in London.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Unless it is part of the legally binding international treaty, it will not fly with the DUP.”A statement from the North’s four main Remain parties – Sinn Féin, SDLP, Alliance, and the Green Party – said there was a “pressing need for backstop to be banked”.“The four Remain parties, Sinn Féin, SDLP, Alliance and Green Party continue to believe that there is no such thing as a good Brexit and our preference is for no Brexit at all. We recognise that the majority of people, businesses and civic society do not want Brexit either.“By contrast, we believe that a no-deal situation would be catastrophic for our economy and society.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3726746.1544473469!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"john major criticises breathtaking ignorance shown in brexit debate","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFormer UK prime minister Sir John Major has criticised the ‘breathtaking ignorance’ unionist leaders and Eurosceptics have shown over the Irish border during the Brexit debate. File photograph: Eric LukeThe .Former UK prime minister Sir John Major has criticised the “breathtaking ignorance” unionist leaders and Eurosceptics have shown over the Irish border during the Brexit debate. Sir John called for calm but warned that the imposition of a hard border was a possibility as a result of Theresa May’s decision to defer a parliamentary vote on the withdrawal agreement her negotiators reached with the EU.Delivering the inaugural ‘Albert Reynolds Memorial Lecture’ in Longford on Monday, Sir John described claims made by hardline Brexiteers over how any backstop would threaten the union going forward as “wholly misguided”.“Some opinion including many who believe themselves to be unionists has shown a breathtaking ignorance,” he said during the lecture, which seeks to recognise the contribution Reynolds made to the Northern Ireland peace process.“To them, Irish demand for a backstop is a bogus ploy to keep the UK in the customs union. In truth, a backstop is a vital national interest for Ireland and the UK.”Sir John and Reynolds have been credited with setting the peace process in motion through their co-signing of the December 1993 Downing Street Declaration.“If the House of Commons cannot find a way forward then the risk of a hard border remains possible,” he said.Sir John said a “reckless few” had failed to see the likely ramifications that a hard border would bring and that the challenges facing Mrs May’s administration were only beginning. “Even if at some date the prime minister’s plans are approved the problem is not solved,” he said. “A hard border, now or at the end of a long transition period or at any time would be disastrous. Peace isn’t secure, it never is and any new border would be a focus for the wild men on the fringes to reactivate old disputes and hatreds that should be laid to rest forever.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward.

When official resources are used for the Prime Minister\u0027s personal purposes it threatens our democracy.Layla Moran, LibDem education spokesman, said: “Given that the vote won’t even happen now, it is an absolute insult to taxpayers that the Prime Minister has been throwing our money down the drain promoting a deal that not even she can back.”Eloise Todd, head of the Best for Britain campaign group, said the absurdity of spending almost £100,000 on a vote that “you know you are going to pull shows flagrant disregard of taxpayers’ cash to waste it like this.”The figures showed the Conservative Party also spent £39,967 on Facebook adverts supporting the deal. Theresa May is listed as spending £1,659. The government spending was double that of the People’s Vote, of £47,313.The figures were published by Facebook as part of new advert transparency measures following sustained criticism of the platform through 2018. It included the Vote Leave campaign being sanctioned over advertising spending on the social network during the Brexit campaign.A government spokesman said: “Communicating government policy effectively to the public is a core function of the Civil Service.“We have reached a deal that is good for the UK, good for its citizens, and good for business and we will be communicating that to the country. Any costs associated with this will be published in the usual way.Adverts have included one paid for to push it to the top of Google’s rankings and linked to a website called Brexit Deal Explained which sets out the government’s case for the EU withdrawal agreement - and warns about the dangers of a no-deal Brexit.Another Facebook video featured the prime minister hailing the deal as offering “certainty for business and economy”, concluding: “Now is the time to come together to build a brighter future.”Fears Brexit will be delayed after Theresa May postpones vote on deal The chaotic day which saw Theresa May insist crucial Brexit vote was going ahead... until it wasn\u0026#39t Warship: Life at Sea, review: let\u0026#39s hope this is exaggerated – else we\u0026#39re on the brink of all-out war with RussiaSir Cliff Richard: 60 Years in Public and in Private, review: a fine celebration – but Cliff remains an enigmaHitchhiker\u0026#39s guide to Lucian Freud: how chance meeting led to creation of two little-known portraits Comment: The Tories are on the edge of their greatest crisis in modern times – MPs must rally togetherBabes in the Wood murders: after the police blunders and killer\u0026#39s deceit, how justice caught up with Russell Bishop, 32 years onDonald Trump scrambles to fill chief of staff role as leading contenders rebuff advancesTheresa May set to call Cabinet to step up preparations for \u0026#34No Deal\u0026#34 exit next MarchMacron decrees \u0026#39social and economic emergency\u0026#39 as he offers sweeteners to quell France\u0026#39s \u0026#39yellow vest\u0026#39 revoltNicola Sturgeon plots Theresa May resignation as Scottish Tories split over BrexitJohn Bercow accuses Government of being \u0026#39deeply discourteous\u0026#39 as Theresa May postpones crunch vote on Brexit dealComment: We cannot continue to be led through Brexit by a mule flogging a dead horseShocking CCTV shown in court captures moment car crashes into nightclub doormenComment: Brexit is one thing.

The account has since been deleted, but not before Instagram users took snapshots of high price Louis Vuitton slippers, among other things.“I hope this will bring this shepherd to account,” said Alexander Volkov, a spokesman for Patriarch Kirill, the leader of the Russian Orthodox Church, “and to find the words and actions to bring him to reason, so that these kinds of things will not happen again.”The priest has been strongly reprimanded by the Russian Orthodox ChurchThis isn’t the first time Russian Orthodox Church officials have been caught with high end fashion accessories, though it is perhaps the first time one of these holy men have been so blatant about it.In 2012, Patriarch Kirill himself was spotted wearing a $30,000 Breguet wrist watch in a photo posted on the church’s website. After a wave of outrage, a photo appeared with the wristwatch photoshopped out.However, Patriarch Kirill’s hand was resting on a table that reflected an image of the watch -- a detail overlooked in the photoshopped image. The original photo, with watch in clear view, was later put back on the website.Patriach Kirill, the Russian Orthodox leader, has himself attracted similar controversy in the pastAll things considered, this was not Russia’s greatest luxury watch controversy. In 2015, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov accidentally flashed a $620,000 Richard Mille RM 52-01 watch, of which only 30 were reportedly made, in a photo taken at his wedding in the resort town of Sochi.While perhaps marginally more appropriate in the halls of power, Patriarch Kirill’s spokesman laid into Father Baskakov with some harsh words for his Instagram posts, saying that his “immodest and unrestrained way of life” has no place in the church. “The life of a priest cannot be ided between the personal and public and no clergyman can act like a priest in a church from the morning until lunch and then be whoever he wants from lunch until evening,” he said.Please review our commenting policyFears Brexit will be delayed after Theresa May postpones vote on deal The chaotic day which saw Theresa May insist crucial Brexit vote was going ahead... until it wasn\u0026#39t Warship: Life at Sea, review: let\u0026#39s hope this is exaggerated – else we\u0026#39re on the brink of all-out war with RussiaSir Cliff Richard: 60 Years in Public and in Private, review: a fine celebration – but Cliff remains an enigmaHitchhiker\u0026#39s guide to Lucian Freud: how chance meeting led to creation of two little-known portraits Comment: The Tories are on the edge of their greatest crisis in modern times – MPs must rally togetherBabes in the Wood murders: after the police blunders and killer\u0026#39s deceit, how justice caught up with Russell Bishop, 32 years onDonald Trump scrambles to fill chief of staff role as leading contenders rebuff advancesTheresa May set to call Cabinet to step up preparations for \u0026#34No Deal\u0026#34 exit next MarchMacron decrees \u0026#39social and economic emergency\u0026#39 as he offers sweeteners to quell France\u0026#39s \u0026#39yellow vest\u0026#39 revoltNicola Sturgeon plots Theresa May resignation as Scottish Tories split over BrexitJohn Bercow accuses Government of being \u0026#39deeply discourteous\u0026#39 as Theresa May postpones crunch vote on Brexit dealGovernment spent £100,000 on Facebook adverts to promote Brexit deal in week before vote was pulledComment: We cannot continue to be led through Brexit by a mule flogging a dead horseShocking CCTV shown in court captures moment car crashes into nightclub doormenComment: Brexit is one thing.

Overtime will be free of tax and charges, he said, while businesses who gave end-of-year bonuses would pay no extra taxes. Mr Macron also announced he would reverse a new levy for pensioners with incomes less than €2,000 per month. “The effort asked of them was too great and not fair,” he said.However, many “gilets jaunes” protesters around France appeared unconvinced.The 40-year old centrist was under intense pressure to avoid fresh damage and bloodshed after successive weekends of violent riots in Paris and other cities that have seen 4,523 arrests and already stripped France of 0.1 per cent of GDP growth, according to its finance minister.Meanwhile, thousands of “gilets jaunes” have been blocking roads and roundabouts for almost a month in an outpouring of anger over perceived high taxes for the poor and overwhelming accusations that he is an arrogant, out-of-touch “president of the rich”.Many were furious that he had remained silent to their fury, hunkered down in the Elysée over the past few days despite the ambiance of quasi-insurrection. Many simply want the ex-banker to step down.The pre-recorded address was the most crucial of his 18-month presidencyBut Mr Macron stood firm on Monday night on his controversial decision to partially scrap France’s totemic wealth tax - another key demand from many “gilets jaunes”. To do so, he said, would “weaken us”.The president, who has abruptly become the least popular leader in modern French history after a dream start, said that the anger of peaceful “yellow vest” protesters was “fair and can be our opportunity”. He said that their movement was the result of “forty years of malaise” that “we ended up getting used to.. out of cowardice”.However, he slammed the “unacceptable outpouring of violence” of vandals. “No anger justifies attacking a police officer or public property, he said.Mr Macron also made it clear he intended to push on with planned reforms of social security and pensions. He also said he would start a tour of France’s mayorships during three months of local talks. “We will not simply start our lives back up as before as if nothing had changed,” he promised.Despite a string of concessions ahead of his speech, including scrapping the green tax on diesel and petrol that sparked the unrest, many protesters had already taken to social media to call for an “Act V” of radical action.Stunned by the savagery of the personal attacks and violence of the protests, Mr Macron had gone off radar for a week, with some aides even fearing he could be the victim of an attempted putsch.“I have never known under the Fifth Republic such hostility against a president,” said political analyst Jérôme Jaffré. “It is a personal affair between a part of the country and president, hence the incredible stakes of this speech.”“This is the start of Act II of his presidency where Macron II fiercely has criticised Macron,” he said.Political opponents dismissed the proposals.Eric Woerth of the opposition Right-wing Republicans said “tomorrow’s purchasing power will pay for today’s measures”.Far-Right leader Marine Le Pen said Mr Macron had “given up on some his tax errors, so much the better”, but said he “refused to admit that it is the model he champions that is contested”. Meanwhile, Jean-Luc Mélenchon, head of the Leftists Unbowed France party, called on protesters to take to the streets once again next Saturday.As for the “gilets jaunes”, reactions were mixed.  Jeremy Clément, one “yellow vest” spokesman, said the proposals were a start and “coherent” but remained “crumbs”.“We can’t be content with a €100 rise (in minimum wage),” he said.In one hall in Galargues, in the Hérault, southern France, some pensioners applauded at the tax breaks but many said they would continue the protests.Karl Toquard, yellow vest spokesman at a roundabout in Gaillon, Normandy, was adamant. He told the : “There was nothing for us. We’re staying put.”Please review our commenting policyFears Brexit will be delayed after Theresa May postpones vote on deal The chaotic day which saw Theresa May insist crucial Brexit vote was going ahead... until it wasn\u0026#39t Warship: Life at Sea, review: let\u0026#39s hope this is exaggerated – else we\u0026#39re on the brink of all-out war with RussiaSir Cliff Richard: 60 Years in Public and in Private, review: a fine celebration – but Cliff remains an enigmaHitchhiker\u0026#39s guide to Lucian Freud: how chance meeting led to creation of two little-known portraits Comment: The Tories are on the edge of their greatest crisis in modern times – MPs must rally togetherBabes in the Wood murders: after the police blunders and killer\u0026#39s deceit, how justice caught up with Russell Bishop, 32 years onDonald Trump scrambles to fill chief of staff role as leading contenders rebuff advancesTheresa May set to call Cabinet to step up preparations for \u0026#34No Deal\u0026#34 exit next MarchNicola Sturgeon plots Theresa May resignation as Scottish Tories split over BrexitJohn Bercow accuses Government of being \u0026#39deeply discourteous\u0026#39 as Theresa May postpones crunch vote on Brexit dealGovernment spent £100,000 on Facebook adverts to promote Brexit deal in week before vote was pulledComment: We cannot continue to be led through Brexit by a mule flogging a dead horseShocking CCTV shown in court captures moment car crashes into nightclub doormenComment: Brexit is one thing.

Updated advice to government departments from officials warned on Friday that there could be six months of reduced access and delays at Dover and Folkestone, if the UK exits without a deal.A Number 10 spokesman said yesterday the notes would enable business to prepare for a “No Deal Brexit.However, CBI director general Carolyn Fairbairn said the delay in the vote was yet another blow for companies desperate for clarity” and warned Britain was at risk of sliding towards “a national crisis.”No one can afford to head into Christmas with the threat of no-deal costing jobs and hitting living standards, she said.Fears Brexit will be delayed after Theresa May postpones vote on deal The chaotic day which saw Theresa May insist crucial Brexit vote was going ahead... until it wasn\u0026#39t Warship: Life at Sea, review: let\u0026#39s hope this is exaggerated – else we\u0026#39re on the brink of all-out war with RussiaSir Cliff Richard: 60 Years in Public and in Private, review: a fine celebration – but Cliff remains an enigmaHitchhiker\u0026#39s guide to Lucian Freud: how chance meeting led to creation of two little-known portraits Comment: The Tories are on the edge of their greatest crisis in modern times – MPs must rally togetherBabes in the Wood murders: after the police blunders and killer\u0026#39s deceit, how justice caught up with Russell Bishop, 32 years onDonald Trump scrambles to fill chief of staff role as leading contenders rebuff advancesMacron decrees \u0026#39social and economic emergency\u0026#39 as he offers sweeteners to quell France\u0026#39s \u0026#39yellow vest\u0026#39 revoltNicola Sturgeon plots Theresa May resignation as Scottish Tories split over BrexitJohn Bercow accuses Government of being \u0026#39deeply discourteous\u0026#39 as Theresa May postpones crunch vote on Brexit dealGovernment spent £100,000 on Facebook adverts to promote Brexit deal in week before vote was pulledComment: We cannot continue to be led through Brexit by a mule flogging a dead horseShocking CCTV shown in court captures moment car crashes into nightclub doormenComment: Brexit is one thing.

Used for conditions such as myopia and cataracts.Our experimental result has brought us much closer to answering the question of what is the smallest amount of early universe matter that can exist, said Jamie Nagle\u0026nbspfrom the University of Colorado at Boulder, one of the many researchers who contributed towards the experiment.The cosmic mystery that remains at the heart of our universeScientists first began research on this strange matter in 2000, when they smashed pieces of gold atoms together and threw out temperatures that were trillions of degrees Celsius. In the incredibly hot soup that it generated, the particles that make up all protons and neutrons broke apart and began to flow, suggesting that generating the new kinds of matter would be possible.Researchers developed that technique so that they could be made more precisely, generating the quark gluon plasma by smashing together only two protons – something that scientists didn\u0027t think was possible.They found that if you expanded those experiments you could push the droplets into each other, which formed exactly the kinds of unusual shapes that scientists were predicting.Imagine that you have two droplets that are expanding into a vacuum, said Nagle.\u0026nbspIf the two droplets are really close together, then as they\u0027re expanding out, they run into each other and push against each other, and that\u0027s what creates this pattern.Scientists hope to use the findings to explore how the quark gluon plasma – when it first arrived, in the earliest miliseconds of the universe – quickly cooled and became the first atoms ever to exist.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Does it really mean a recession is likely? How concerned should we really be?They are, effectively, the rates of annual interest paid out to investors by bonds.The yield on short-term US government bonds is normally well below the yield on equivalent long-term bonds, reflecting the simple fact that people will generally want a larger return if they are going to lock their cash away for longer.This results in an upward sloping “curve”, with bond yields gently rising as the redemption date of the bond stretches into the future.Sometimes the yield on short-term bonds rises, bringing short-term borrowing rates close to long-term rates, thus flattening the profile of the overall borrowing yield curve.And sometimes the yield on short-term bonds can even go higher than that of long-term bonds.This isn’t just a flattening, but an “inversion”.Is that happening now?Not quite, but it’s getting close.The two bonds that traders and analysts conventionally use to test for an inversion is the gap between the 10-year US Treasury bond and the 2-year bond.That gap is down to just 10 basis points (0.1 percentage\u0026nbsppoints), having been falling steadily since the end of 2016.So why does it matter?Historically, major economic downturns in the US, but also in certain other advanced economies, have been preceded (by around 6 to 24 months) by an inversion of the yield curve.Research by John Williams, the new President of the New York Federal Reserve Bank, has shown that the yield curve has been a better predictor of recessions than professional forecasters.A recession in the US, the planet’s biggest economy, would inevitably hit the rest of the world, including the UK.Incidentally, in the UK the 10-year2-year government bond yield gap is still around 70 basis points, though this too has fallen over the past two years.But why would an inversion signal a recession?The general argument is that\u0026nbsp traders expect the economy to be weaker further out than it is today and for the central bank to be compelled to cut interest rates at some point to support growth. \u0026nbspSo traders bid the yields on longer-term bonds lower than shorter ones in anticipation of that monetary policy shift (rate cuts mean higher bond prices which, in turn, mean\u0026nbsplower bond yields).Yet, if this is what’s going on, there’s no clear reason why this cooling should mean an outright recession rather than simply a growth slowdown.The fact that a recession has tended to follow inversions\u0026nbsphas merely been the historical pattern.So should we expect a recession for the US now?The US economy is not showing any of the conventional signs of dangerous overheating that could result in a slump.Unemployment is very low, at around 4 per cent, but inflation still seems reasonably quiescent at around 2.5 per cent.Core inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy, is only 2.15 per cent.Wages are rising at an annual rate of 3 per cent, below the levels seen before the global financial crisis.Some see signs of excessive borrowing among US households, but, again, leverage is not growing at anything like the rates seen before 2008.Any other contrary arguments?Major central banks around the world have spent trillions of dollars, euros, pounds and yen in buying up long-dated sovereign bonds over the past decade.This, the argument goes, has distorted long-term bond yields, meaning that one cannot, in the current circumstances, infer very much useful information from the shape of the curve.The current chair of the US central bank, Jerome Powell, has explicitly said he does not believe the flattening curve, and the possibility of inversion, signals an imminent downturn.Further, the predictor is not 100 per cent accurate. The Treasury curve flattened dramatically in the mid-1990s, during the Bill Clinton-boom, without leading to a US recession.The equivalent curve in the UK and Japan has sent misleading signals too in recent decades, missing recessions as well as sending out false positives.So we can relax?Not quite. Central bankers are certainly not omniscient about such matters.Back in 2006 one of Mr Powell’s predecessor, Ben Bernanke, argued firmly that a flattening US yield curve did not presage a recession. And there was a lot of talk then too about how the inverted yield curve was a broken indicator.When the crash came, not long after, it was, of course, the biggest since the Great Depression.Where does that leave us? While it would be foolish to ignore the yield curve given its empirically proven predictive power, it would also be a mistake to regard it as some kind of oracle.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Many firms cited Brexit uncertainty as a factor constraining investment and orders.“The marked weakening of the UK economy this autumn is as we expected given the continued high level of uncertainty around Brexit,” said John Hawksworth of PwC.“Until this is resolved, the UK economy is likely to remain in the doldrums as businesses will be reluctant to invest and households may also be reluctant to commit to big ticket items like house and car purchases.”Separately, the ONS also\u0026nbspreported on Monday that the UK’s goods trade balance in October widened to £11.87bn, higher than expected by City analysts.There was also a sharp downward revision to exports earlier in the year.This year’s trade boost has been suddenly revised away, reinstating this depreciation’s record as the least successful in Britain’s post-war history, said Samuel Tombs of Pantheon.In the three months to October the deficit was £35.5bn. Good exports were up by 2.1 per cent over the three months, but this was outstripped by the increase in imports, which were 3 per cent higher.Including the services surplus, the total trade deficit was £3.3bn in October and £10.3bn over the quarter.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Earlier this year, Samsung released another advert making fun of the design, featuring the same man now carrying a child with a similarly unconventional hairdo.With the release date for the Galaxy S10\u0026nbspanticipated for early 2019, the trickle of leaks and rumours surrounding the highly-anticipated device is turning into a stream, with the latest potentially revealing how the South Korean tech giant will negate the notch.Notorious leaker Evan Blass\u0026nbspshared designs of what a case manufacturer expected of the Galaxy S10, which featured three models for the lineup.As expected from previous leaks, the single lens devices have a hole in the screen to cater for the camera.The S10+ model, which will feature two lenses, makes use of two separate holes at the top centre of\u0026nbspthe screen in order to avoid the notch design.In a follow-up tweet, Mr Blass said: Usually I\u0027m a big fan of symmetry, but in this case, I hope the cutouts are offset from center as in the examples shown off at SDC.EDELSONAFPGetty Images)Other rumours surrounding the Samsung Galaxy S10\u0026nbspinclude a self-healing screen that could potentially put an end to scratched displays.A patent for a screen containing a self-healing property was revealed earlier this year, which described how such technology could be used in a portable electronic device such as a smart phone or tablet.The Galaxy S10\u0026nbspis set to launch on the 10th anniversary of Samsung\u0027s first flagship smartphone but it isn\u0027t the only high-end phone it plans to release next year.A foldable phone was unveiled in Ocober\u0026nbspat the firm\u0027s developer conference, with Samsung describing it as the foundation of the smartphone of tomorrow.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

It’s a wartime story in which, for a change, the men are relegated to supporting roles. It follows in a tradition of French rural family sagas like Jean De Florette or Manon Des Sources. The landscapes and the changing seasons play as much of a part in the story as the main characters.Dark River offers little such consolation. It has some lyrical and delicate moments but the mood is generally overwhelmingly bleak and lugubrious. Incest and abuse don’t leave much space for any comic interludes. This is a powerful film with a grinding intensity about it. Light relief it isn’t but Dark River still has quite an impact.Late on in Argentinean director Lucrecia Martel’s startling, highly original new feature, Zama, a character who has just had both his arms cut off, is advised to “shove your stumps in the sand … if you don’t bleed out, you’ll survive.” It’s a grisly, darkly humorous moment in a film that continually surprises us with both its brutality and its lyricism.The most dispiriting aspect of this otherwise enrapturing Oscar-nominated animated feature is that its storyline still seems so current. The film depicts an Afghan society in which women don’t have a face. It is set during the Taliban rule, which lasted from the mid-1990s until late 2001, but this doesn’t feel like a period piece. Seventeen years after the Taliban were ousted from power in Afghanistan following the US invasion, the plight of women in the country appears hardly to have improved. Spike Lee’s work sometimes risks sensory overload. He fires off so many different ideas and storytelling styles that audiences can become bamboozled by his scattergun approach. BlacKkKlansman is one of his very best films because the digressions are as entertaining as ever but don’t get in the way of the main story.Much of the pleasure in Aardman films has always lain in their gently ironic, Alan Bennett-like humour. They take very exotic characters and subject matter but then deal with them in a matter-of-fact fashion. They make a virtue out of their own relative modesty. Early Man isn’t the flashiest animated feature that you’ll see this year but it is certainly the most likeable. 717 Isle of DogsLike all of Wes Anderson’s work, Isle Of Dogs is very stylised, very offbeat and characterised by its extremely dry and often ironic humour. This Japanese-set stop-motion fable is also gorgeous to look at – packed full of intricate visual detail. It deals with some weighty themes (ethnic cleansing, fascism and corruption) but does so in an idiosyncratic fashion.817 Three Billboards Outside of Ebbing, MissouriWriter-director Martin McDonagh has a host of award-winning plays behind him but his movies haven’t always lived up to his stage work. This one certainly does. It shares some of the dark and nihilistic humour found in McDonagh’s previous film, Seven Psychopaths.In an era of wearisome poltergeist movies, haunted house stories and torture porn, A Quiet Place is a refreshingly pared-down and very original affair. Director John Krasinski relies on editing, sound effects and off-screen action to crank up the tension. We do see the creatures from time to time, sometimes even in extreme closeup. They are very grotesque, bigger versions of the polyp-like succubus which exploded out of John Hurt’s stomach in Alien. However, the most terrifying moments here come when the humans are waiting for them to appear, desperately hoping that they won’t. Lady Bird is one of the best American coming-of-age films since Barry Levinson’s Diner. Written and directed by Greta Gerwig, it offers an utterly winning mix of humour, poignancy and sharp-eyed social observation. Gerwig approaches her subject matter with the same tenderness and affectionate irony with which the adolescent Lady Bird regards Sacramento. Gerwig also shows Lady Bird’s heroism as the young heroine strives against the odds to become the very best version of herself she can be.If Phantom Thread is indeed Daniel Day-Lewis’s final film as an actor, he is going out on a wondrously bizarre note. This must be the oddest film in his career, one in which he gives a typically commanding but very idiosyncratic performance. Almost everything here is jarring – but generally in a very positive way. It is not so long ago that Paul Schrader seemed to be giving up on cinema. The American writer-director (whose credits include Taxi Driver, American Gigolo and Affliction) had taken to making movies like the sour Hollywood satire The Canyons with Lindsay Lohan and the cartoonishly violent Dog Eat Dog, shot cheaply, aimed at a VOD audience. The former had a montage of closed-down movie theatres. In interviews, Schrader struck a gloomy note about the future of the industry. This is why First Reformed is so refreshing. This is not just Schrader’s best film in a very long while. It is also a re-affirmation of the director’s belief in the medium.Oscar Wilde goes to ruin in Rupert Everett’s debut feature as director. Everett also wrote and stars in the film, giving a grandstanding performance as the Irish writer at the end of his life, after his release from prison, where he has been doing hard labour for “gross indecency”. This is a moving and surprising biopic that squeezes out every last drop of pathos from its subject matter. Black Panther is not only one of the most entertaining recent superhero films but has an intelligence and a political dimension that such inchoate offerings as Suicide Squad and Justice League completely lacked. It is an action movie which touches on Pan-Africanism and which owes as much to Malcolm X as it does to Batman or Captain America. Sicilian Ghost Story is a genre-bending affair that combines elements of teen romance, gothic psycho-drama and political thriller. It is loosely based on a true story of a boy called Giuseppe Di Matteo whose father, an ex-member of the Sicilian Mafia, turned “grass” against his erstwhile associates. The Mafia responded by kidnapping Giuseppe and keeping him in captivity for nearly 800 days. First Man is all about understated heroism. It’s affecting precisely because Armstrong (played with quiet intensity by Ryan Gosling) doesn’t feel the continual need to boast about his mission. The film is a tearjerker but a very subtle one. Dogman is one of the best Italian films of recent times, a modern day neo realist fable that bears comparison with the great work of Fellini, Rossellini, De Sica et al. Its main character, the dog groomer Marcello (Marcello Fonte), is a wonderful creation: loveable, vulnerable, seedy and comic all at the same time. From its slow-burning beginning, s develops into an epic melodrama. It’s a wartime story in which, for a change, the men are relegated to supporting roles.

You can even give it someone else\u0027s username, should you want to see their best nine.Created with Sketch.11 useful Instagram features you didn\u0027t know existed Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.111 Hide and reorder filtersFilters are a core part of Instagram, but there are so many available it can be easy to get lost. You can change the order in which they appear, and even hide the ones you never use, to speed up your photo-sharing process. On the filters page, scroll to the end, tap Manage, then drag and drop the ones you want to reorder, and un-check the ones you want to hide. Instagram controversially ditched its reverse-chronological order feed for a new order determined by an algorithm, making it easy to completely miss some posts. To make sure you never miss a certain somebody’s updates, you can set up notification for them by visiting their profile, tapping the three dots in the top right-hand corner and selecting Turn On Post Notifications.If you’re worried about how much of your mobile data Instagram saps, you can limit it by sacrificing the speed at which the photos and videos in your feed load. Go to your profile, tap the three dots in the top right corner, open Cellular Data Use and choose Use Less Data.411 See your LikesIt’s easy to lose track of your friends’ old posts on Instagram, but if you know you Liked it, you’ll be able to track it down easily. Just go to your profile, hit the three dots at the top and select Posts You’ve Liked. You can also save posts in a folder only you can see by tapping the bookmark icon underneath it. Take a look at everything you’ve bookmarked by tapping the same icon that sits near the top of your profile.Everyone knows you can expand the reach of your posts by using a number of relevant hashtags, but what those are aren’t always glaringly obvious. You can easily find the right ones for you by typing a keyword into Instagram’s search bar, selecting a hashtag from the list and swiping along the Related row that appears at the top of the screen.611 Clear your search historyWhatever your reasons are, you can clear your recent searches by going to your profile, hitting the three dots in the top right and selecting Clear Search History. To go a step further and hide your Suggested searches too, go to the search page, tap and hold the account you want to hide, and choose Hide from the pop-up window.Tagged photos on Instagram aren’t as prominent as they are on Facebook, but anyone can still browse through other people’s pictures of you by visiting your profile and tapping the photo of you icon. If you’re tagged in a picture you don’t want other people to see, go to your profile, hit the photos of you icon, tap the three dots at the top of the screen and choose Hide Photos.811 Secure your accountMake your Instagram account much harder to hack by enabling two-factor authentication, a security feature that protects you even if your login details are stolen. Go to your profile, tap the three dots, open Two-Factor Authentication and toggle it on.911 Share lots at onceIf you want to upload a bunch of related pictures and videos without flooding everyone else’s feed, you can shared them all as one post. Hit the + icon, select Gallery, choose Select Multiple, pick out up to 10 of the pictures and clips you want, tap Next and reorder them by dragging and dropping.Instagram Stories has been a massive hit since it came out last year, but you might not know that you can record Stories clips without having to hold one of your digits on the record key. On the Stores screen, just swipe through the options at the bottom until you get to Hands-Free. Most people know you can delete any of the images you’ve already posted, but not everyone is aware that you can also edit them. Instagram unfortunately doesn’t let you tinker with filters and effects, but you can change your original caption, tag people and update the location.  111 Hide and reorder filtersFilters are a core part of Instagram, but there are so many available it can be easy to get lost.

Instagram unfortunately doesn’t let you tinker with filters and effects, but you can change your original caption, tag people and update the location.  The site finds out which of your posts received the most likes, assembling them into a collage of nine pictures. You can then opt to share it to your Instagram – or do whatever else you like, such as sending it directly to your friends or uploading it to your story.Instagram finally lets people choose who sees storiesThe feature might take a while to compile your picture and so asks for an email address so that it can notify you of when your best nine is ready. While its privacy policy allows it to use that email for marketing, it does allow you to opt out – but if you\u0027re anxious about it, it might be worth quickly setting up a disposable email account just to make sure your address stays safe.That website – unlike some other, more questionable tools – doesn\u0027t require that you give it your login or the ability to access your account, since all the data that it needs to make the collage is public anyway. Since there are safe tools like that around, make sure not to use one that requires you to give any account information at all, since it is unnecessary and can put you at risk of having your profile used maliciously or even hacked.But for the same reason, the tool will only work for public profiles. Since it works by scraping the information from your profile, if you\u0027ve locked it down you won\u0027t be able to see the results.One option is simply to switch very quickly to a public profile, make your collage, and then switch back. As long as you do it quickly then it is unlikely anyone will notice.Another option is to make your own best nine, by picking through your photos and then arranging them into a collage using Instagram\u0027s own Layout app. That has the advantage of allowing you to choose any photos you wish you were included but aren\u0027t – but the downside of having to pick manually through what might be hundreds of photos.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Does it really mean a recession is likely? How concerned should we really be?They are, effectively, the rates of annual interest paid out to investors by bonds.The yield on short-term US government bonds is normally well below the yield on equivalent long-term bonds, reflecting the simple fact that people will generally want a larger return if they are going to lock their cash away for longer.This results in an upward sloping “curve”, with bond yields gently rising as the redemption date of the bond stretches into the future.Sometimes the yield on short-term bonds rises, bringing short-term borrowing rates close to long-term rates, thus flattening the profile of the overall borrowing yield curve.And sometimes the yield on short-term bonds can even go higher than that of long-term bonds.This isn’t just a flattening, but an “inversion”.Is that happening now?Not quite, but it’s getting close.The two bonds that traders and analysts conventionally use to test for an inversion is the gap between the 10-year US Treasury bond and the 2-year bond.That gap is down to just 10 basis points (0.1 percentage\u0026nbsppoints), having been falling steadily since the end of 2016.So why does it matter?Historically, major economic downturns in the US, but also in certain other advanced economies, have been preceded (by around 6 to 24 months) by an inversion of the yield curve.Research by John Williams, the new President of the New York Federal Reserve Bank, has shown that the yield curve has been a better predictor of recessions than professional forecasters.A recession in the US, the planet’s biggest economy, would inevitably hit the rest of the world, including the UK.Incidentally, in the UK the 10-year2-year government bond yield gap is still around 70 basis points, though this too has fallen over the past two years.But why would an inversion signal a recession?The general argument is that\u0026nbsp traders expect the economy to be weaker further out than it is today and for the central bank to be compelled to cut interest rates at some point to support growth. \u0026nbspSo traders bid the yields on longer-term bonds lower than shorter ones in anticipation of that monetary policy shift (rate cuts mean higher bond prices which, in turn, mean\u0026nbsplower bond yields).Yet, if this is what’s going on, there’s no clear reason why this cooling should mean an outright recession rather than simply a growth slowdown.The fact that a recession has tended to follow inversions\u0026nbsphas merely been the historical pattern.So should we expect a recession for the US now?The US economy is not showing any of the conventional signs of dangerous overheating that could result in a slump.Unemployment is very low, at around 4 per cent, but inflation still seems reasonably quiescent at around 2.5 per cent.Core inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy, is only 2.15 per cent.Wages are rising at an annual rate of 3 per cent, below the levels seen before the global financial crisis.Some see signs of excessive borrowing among US households, but, again, leverage is not growing at anything like the rates seen before 2008.Any other contrary arguments?Major central banks around the world have spent trillions of dollars, euros, pounds and yen in buying up long-dated sovereign bonds over the past decade.This, the argument goes, has distorted long-term bond yields, meaning that one cannot, in the current circumstances, infer very much useful information from the shape of the curve.The current chair of the US central bank, Jerome Powell, has explicitly said he does not believe the flattening curve, and the possibility of inversion, signals an imminent downturn.Further, the predictor is not 100 per cent accurate. The Treasury curve flattened dramatically in the mid-1990s, during the Bill Clinton-boom, without leading to a US recession.The equivalent curve in the UK and Japan has sent misleading signals too in recent decades, missing recessions as well as sending out false positives.So we can relax?Not quite. Central bankers are certainly not omniscient about such matters.Back in 2006 one of Mr Powell’s predecessor, Ben Bernanke, argued firmly that a flattening US yield curve did not presage a recession. And there was a lot of talk then too about how the inverted yield curve was a broken indicator.When the crash came, not long after, it was, of course, the biggest since the Great Depression.Where does that leave us? While it would be foolish to ignore the yield curve given its empirically proven predictive power, it would also be a mistake to regard it as some kind of oracle.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

That accounts for just about every phone Apple has made in the last three years:\u0026nbspthe iPhone 6S, iPhone 6S Plus, iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus and iPhone X.Qualcomm said that the ruling required Apple to stop importing and selling the phones.We deeply value our relationships with customers, rarely resorting to the courts for assistance, but we also have an abiding belief in the need to protect intellectual property rights,\u0026nbspsaid Don Rosenberg, Qualcomm\u0027s general counsel.Apple continues to benefit from our intellectual property while refusing to compensate us.

The Tatmadaw\u0027s tactics are consistently and grossly disproportionate to actual security threats, especially in Rakhine State, but also in northern Myanmar, the report added, using the official name for the armed forces in Myanmar.US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo referred to the Myanmar military\u0027s actions as abhorrent ethnic cleansing, adding that the US\u0026nbspwould continue to hold those responsible accountable.The US\u0026nbspalso imposed sanctions on three Myanmar military commanders for their roles in the ethnic cleansing.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A Boca Juniors\u0027 fan cheers at a viewing in Buenos Aires for the Copa Libertadores final against rivals River Plate.

Alongside the tweet, Cannon wrote\u0026nbsp“And I f**king love Wreck-It Ralph,” a reference to Silverman\u0027s role as the\u0026nbspvoice of Vanellope in the animation.Finally, Cannon resurfaced a 2012 tweet from Amy Schumer reading, “Enjoy skyfall f***. I\u0027m bout to get knee deep in Helen Hunt #thesessions.” He added the message: I’m just saying... should we keep going?Hart stepped down from hosting the Oscars after refusing to apologise for resurfaced jokes in which he uses homophobic slurs.

Harrison Ford’s daring archaeologist is almost always out of his depth but has impeccable underdog charm, and Douglas Slocombe’s casually stunning cinematography is matched by one of John Williams\u0027s finest scores. Indy is ultimately irrelevant to the entire plot, interestingly, but his indefatigable effort to do the right thing still inspires. HO240 The Wings of the Dove (1997)Henry James is notoriously difficult to adapt well, but here is the darkly shimmering exception. Helena Bonham Carter still hasn’t topped Kate Croy, conniving but also trapped by her circumstances, as a leading role the masquerade of her and Linus Roache\u0027s motives makes the film a psychological thriller of sorts. Iain Softley directs the Venice sequences with bewitching gamesmanship, then tears your heart out at the end. PSJapanese animation legend Hayao Miyazaki\u0027s films delight kids with their bright colours, imaginative characters and plucky heroines (usually). But there\u0027s meat to their bones for adults to digest, especially in this towering fantasy epic. As young Chihiro takes a job in a mysterious bathhouse peopled by spirits in order to save her parents, viewers can explore everything from deeply rooted interpretations of traditional Japanese myth to Miyazaki\u0027s fascination with Western filmmaking and the Second World War. And visually it’s unparalleled. HOLuis Buñuel and Salvador Dalí changed the face of cinema with this 16-minute-long Surrealist short, instantly confronting the viewer with the sight of an eyeball being slit open. Narrative is jettisoned, and the unnerving power of juxtaposition championed in dreamlike montage, which still has a fizzing voltage and suggestive power. PSYes, but hear us out: Avengers is a grand experimental film. Marvel risked four popular franchises on this superhero throw of the dice, something never attempted in cinema history. They won, and made the fizzing chemistry of the unlikely gang who must save us from aliens look easy. But the failure of every Marvel imitator since makes clear how impressive this billion-dollar gamble really was, and how difficult it is to tell character-driven stories in blockbuster cinema on this scale. And as a bonus, it has a Hulk. HOYes, but hear us out: Avengers is a grand experimental film. Marvel risked four popular franchises on this superhero throw of the dice, something never attempted in cinema history.

But the failure of every Marvel imitator since makes clear how impressive this billion-dollar gamble really was, and how difficult it is to tell character-driven stories in blockbuster cinema on this scale. And as a bonus, it has a Hulk. HO740 Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978)One of those remakes that justifies remakes, Philip Kaufman’s beautifully skilful spin on the McCarthy-era alien-clone thriller translates it wickedly to the psychobabble age of the 1970s, with a bit of post-Watergate panic thrown in. Donald Sutherland’s lugubrious health inspector is a nicely grumpy enemy of the pod people, and the hysteria ratchets up masterfully. PSWes Anderson\u0027s meticulously mannered and beautifully composed films are not to all tastes, but when combined with a cast of this calibre and a more-than-usually heartfelt script, they are capable of magic. Gene Hackman plays the disgraced patriarch of a family of geniuses, making one last attempt at redemption. With a who’s who of Hollywood in support, it’s a story that is as bizarre, hilarious and moving as family life itself. HO940 Lawrence of Arabia (1962)David Lean’s First World War epic about TE Lawrence remains a filmmaking milestone, the movie that Steven Spielberg rewatches before starting each new film. Its genius is to combine huge scale battles – notably the attack on Aqaba – with psychological insight into the toll that the war took on Lawrence’s mind. The white-led casting of Arab characters is appalling to modern eyes, but with its daring, dazzling filmmaking it remains one to watch despite that. HOA devastating portrait of the poverty trap, Vittorio De Sica’s neo-realist masterpiece remains all too relevant. Antonio (Lamberto Maggiorani) is offered a desperately-needed job – but it requires a bicycle, and when his is stolen he and his son resort to desperate measures to get it back. Shot with non-professional actors who lived in circumstances close to that of their characters, this is a study in compassion and empathy. HOSpanning five decades of Chinese history, this sprawling epic follows two stars of the Peking Opera from harsh childhood training through the perils of the Second World War, the Communist takeover and the Cultural Revolution. Director Chen Keige drew on his own experience of the Cultural Revolution to shape this groundbreaking, tormented romance both between Zhang Fengyi’s Ziaolou and Leslie Cheng’s Dieyi, and between Ziaolou and his former prostitute wife Juxian (Gong Li). HOOriginally titled 1984½, Terry Gilliam’s crazily ambitious riff on Orwell is a dystopian comedy about a world stuffed to bursting point: one clerical error and it threatens to burst, plunging Jonathan Pryce’s befuddled low-level bureaucrat into madness and chaos. A nightmare of retro-futuristic oppression, outfitted with mad bravura and some of the best sci-fi production design ever. PSPauline Kael thought that the basic appeal of movies was the “kiss kiss bang bang” of action and romance, but Yasujirō Ozu demonstrates that film is capable of much more in this quiet family drama. It’s a simple story about two elderly parents visiting their adult children, only to find that the younger generation is busy with other things. But it’s also a meditation on the passing of time, and on grief, and on the constant push towards the new that will break your heart every time you watch it. HOIf we have learned anything from film noir, it is that murder pacts never work out well for both parties. That’s certainly the lesson when Fred MacMurray’s infatuated salesman offers life insurance to Barbara Stanwyck’s femme fatale Phyllis against her unloved husband. The scheme gives way to a riveting stew of suspicion and paranoia, with Stanwyck’s ruthless determination warping MacMurray’s Neff out of all recognition as director Billy Wilder tightens the screws. HO1540 Days of Heaven (1978)Terrence Malick’s second, and for many, greatest film is a mesmerisingly gorgeous love triangle set in the Texas Panhandle in 1916, loosely based on an Old Testament parable. Richard Gere and Brooke Adams are the lovers who pose as brother and sister to fool a rich, dying farmer (Sam Shepard). Nestor Almendros’s astounding magic-hour photography rightly won an Oscar, and Linda Manz supplies heartbreaking, plainspoken narration as Gere’s younger sister. PSThe problem with calling something “the greatest film ever made” is that it begins to sound like homework. Forget that: beyond all the technical dazzle and ground-breaking filmmaking Orson Welles’s masterpiece has red blood in its veins and a huge beating heart. What’s more, its portrait of a thrusting, occasionally demagogic tycoon and the hollowness at the heart of his success remains as relevant as it ever was, and the suggestion that America might be susceptible to media manipulation all too believable. HONirvana and despair among a troupe of 19th century theatre actors, in Marcel Carné\u0027s luminously moving epic of the heart. This not only represents the full flowering of French cinema\u0027s Golden Age, but a gracious look back at the performing traditions film was built on. It’s peopled with some of the most touchingly clownish characters you’ll ever see. PSWhether you see it as Alfred Hitchcock’s celebration of voyeurism or simply one of the most nail-biting thrillers ever made, it’s a superb example of the Master of Suspense at work. James Stewart’s photographer, laid up with a broken leg, becomes obsessed with the lives of his neighbours and suspects one of murder. The unusually vulnerable hero – as in Vertigo – increases the stakes and ensures that simple brawn won’t save the day, while Hitchcock ratchets up the tension unbearably by putting Grace Kelly’s plucky girlfriend in the lion’s mouth. HOClaudette Colbert\u0027s eloping heiress and Clark Gable\u0027s hack on his uppers warily team up on a Greyhound bus, only to aggravatingly fall for each other. Frank Capra\u0027s evergreen romcom all but invented the love-hate formula that\u0027s one model for silver screen chemistry, hoicking up Colbert\u0027s skirt to flash a leg when they need to hitch-hike, and dismantling Gable\u0027s smarmy defences. The biggest hit of its day for a reason, it was also the first ever film to win the big five at the Oscars. PSThe trials of young black basketball hopefuls in Chicago tell us volumes, from their upbringing to all-or-nothing career rimshots, about the opportunities otherwise denied them. For these portraits of inner-city poverty, gliding between frustration and triumph, Steve James’s epic of ghetto realities has been influential on every sports doc that has come in its wake. The Academy’s documentary branch will never quite live down failing to nominate it. PSThis blistering Billy Wilder and IAL Diamond script is a demonstration of just how dark a love story can be get without tipping entirely into bitterness, a standing rebuke to every lazy, schmaltzy comedy going. While the entire cast is stellar and Shirley MacLaine was never better, it’s worth ignoring them all and just watching Jack Lemmon’s meek office worker CC Baxter. Every gesture and glance is flawless he carries entire scenes without a word. HOThe title of Wim Wenders’s Palme d’Or-winning emotional odyssey is both a real place and a broken state of mind. The missing Travis (Harry Dean Stanton) is found wandering there in a battered cap, and begins a trek to make amends with his ex (Nastassja Kinski), whom he finds, oblivious to who he is, on the other side of a Houston peepshow window. Culminating unforgettably with this long-take tête-a-tête, it\u0027s a mesmerising quest for redemption, with a Ry Cooder score that will twang its way into your soul. PSIt’s encouraging how many obituarists of Philip Seymour Hoffman identified this as his masterwork – literally the performance of a lifetime. The meta-theatrical conceit – Caden Cotard is constructing a play about his life, which becomes as long as his life – lets Charlie Kaufman unleash a panoply of ideas about creativity, self-worth, love, death, everyday and lifelong terrors. It’s bruisingly honest, and a shattering experience for the faithful. PSCéline (Julie Delpy) and Jesse (Ethan Hawke) have settled down since the two earlier films in Richard Linklater’s essential trilogy, Before Sunrise (1995) and Before Sunset (2004), but the problems in their lives – self-inflicted by now – only keep proliferating. Trenchantly pushing them into full-on battle-of-the-sexes territory, the film squares them off for a bitterly adult dissection of a long-term relationship, asking stark questions about love, compromise and lasting the course. PSOther Jean-Luc Godard films are punchier, ruder, more experimental. But this is his most lavish, measured, and sad: an elegiac fantasy of filmmaking, as a loose adaptation of the Odyssey grinds to a halt on Capri, with Jack Palance as the brash American producer trying to sell art by the yard. Meanwhile, the screenwriter (Michel Piccoli) and his beautiful, bored wife (Brigitte Bardot) tussle and reconcile in an incessant, pained ballet. PSSome films strain under the weight of greatness Casablanca’s quality bubbles through. Against the backdrop of the Second World War, two former lovers reunite though everything in the world is pulling them apart. Bogart’s Rick hides a huge heart under a thin veneer of cynicism opposite him Ingrid Bergman’s luminous Ilsa would melt an iceberg. Packed with quotable lines and brimming over with impeccable cool, here we are, still lookin\u0027 at you, kid. HO2740 Meet Me in St Louis (1944)On the surface, Vincente Minnelli\u0027s Technicolor classic is all sweetness and light: Judy Garland, the Trolley song, lots of dancing and tinsel. What makes this one of the great American musicals is an undertow of despair a mile wide. It\u0027s a nostalgia trip as subtly bitter as it is sugary and the subtext of “Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas” is anything but merry. PS2840 A Trip to the Moon (1902)Georges Méliès pioneered many of the visual and special effects techniques that have formed the backbone of fantastical filmmaking ever since, and he pushed them all to their limits in this turn-of-the-century tale of a rocket trip to the moon to meet the strange creatures who live upon it. Witty touches and a real sense of story mean that this is still entertaining more than a century later, and if the effects are less awe-inspiring now, they’re still beautifully designed and executed. HO2940 Out of the Past (1947)Cigarette smoke gives everyone a halo in this masterly, Jacques Tourneur-directed tale of a private investigator (Robert Mitchum) who can’t escape old associates – especially Kathie (Jane Greer), the doll-faced schemer who’s perhaps noir’s ultimate femme fatale. Aka Build My Gallows High, it’s a fatalistic masterpiece, with Kirk Douglas as the smarmy gangster setting Mitchum up for a fall. PSA screwball comedy of substance, Howard Hawks\u0027s remake of The Front Page is an objectively odd mix of high stakes and high comedy. Yet it works because the machine-gun dialogue is so quick that there\u0027s never a moment to question what’s happening (the great screenwriter Ben Hecht, who co-wrote the original Broadway play, worked on it uncredited). Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell, as the warring editor and star-reporter trying to work together long enough to land the story of the year, remain the standard by which all on-screen chemistry should be judged. HOWho\u0027s eavesdropping on whom? Hatched before Watergate and speaking eerily to it, this audacious story of an obsessive surveillance whiz (a career-best Gene Hackman), commissioned to snoop but finding himself morally embroiled, is a slippery plunge into Seventies paranoia like no other. What a run Francis Ford Coppola had, slipping this one in between the first two Godfathers. PSJohn Travolta\u0027s Z-movie sound man, out recording one night, accidentally tapes what turns out to be a political assassination. Brian De Palma hit peak ingenuity and gut-punch profundity with this stunning conspiracy thriller, mounted with a showman\u0027s élan but also harrowing emotional voltage from its star. It’s one of the most delirious thrillers of the 1980s, with a bitterly ironic pay-off that’s played for keeps. PS3340 City of God (2002)There’s a deep contradiction at the heart of this acid-bright portrait of the violence in Rio’s favelas. On one hand these child hustlers and teen gangsters have an intense lust for life, an exuberance displayed in dance and play and love on the other, they value life cheaply and take it without a qualm. Director Fernando Meirelles and co-director Kátia Lund cast a talented band of local kids to give it authenticity and then punctuated their story with Scorsese-esque violence that still shocks. HO3440 Hannah and Her Sisters (1986)The erging romantic fortunes of Hannah (Mia Farrow), Lee (Barbara Hershey) and Holly (Dianne Wiest, who won an Oscar, as did Michael Caine) provide an ideal structure for Woody Allen to check in on a midway state of adulthood, when there\u0027s already a sense of disappointment about squandered promise, but still much to play for. It hits the miraculous sweet spot between all Allen’s modes and tones. PSThe Coen Brothers had already established a ghoulish signature style with Blood Simple, but here they showed us how funny they could be, in a zig-zagging kidnap farce which manages the difficult feat of being both zany and adorable. Nicolas Cage and Holly Hunter are the unlikely couple whose abduction of a spare newborn quintuplet, Nathan Jr, causes all hell to break loose. PSThis looks and acts like a thriller, but in reality Michael Haneke’s exploration of colonialism, guilt, paranoia and privacy cares more about subtext than about scares or mystery. A well-to-do Parisian family are tormented by the arrival of surveillance tapes of their lives, but it’s not clear who could be sending them or why, leading patriarch Georges (Daniel Auteuil, never better) to confront his own past sins. As a subversion of genre and viewer expectation, there are few to match it. HOStraight up the best Bourne movie – an experience Ultimatum can’t help but want to repeat, more falteringly – because of Paul Greengrass’s phenomenal instincts for pace, Matt Damon’s unguessed flair for minimalism, and a script by Tony Gilroy that’s all about conscience. Barring Mad Max: Fury Road, it’s the best and most enduring action movie of the present millennium. PSOrson Welles suggested that Buster Keaton’s silent Civil War comedy might be the greatest film ever made, and who are we to argue? Keaton’s Johnny Gray is a key figure on the railroads of the Confederacy, but he and his engine, The General, must go above and beyond to defeat a Union spy. Ignore the dodgy politics and focus on the sublime physical comedy of Keaton’s beautifully composed routines. You’ll come out wondering if movies even need sound. HOThe Babadook is a black, hunched pop-up book monster who raps on your door three times before paying a visit. And you can’t get rid of him. Widowed mum Amelia (brilliant Essie Davis) can’t remember reading his book to her emotionally disturbed misfit of a son (Noah Wiseman) before. Jennifer Kent’s thoughtful Australian chamber shocker, a feast of inventive design, claws its way into you and leaves scratch marks. PSIs it impossible for men and women to be purely platonic? It is according to Harry, in this beautiful, brainy comedy about two neurotic New Yorkers who become friends and then more. Directed by Rob Reiner and written by wonderful Nora Ephron, it\u0027s a paean of sorts to Woody Allen\u0027s early films, with razor-sharp observations about sex and dating (I\u0027ll have what she\u0027s having). It\u0027s still the pinnacle of both Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan\u0027s careers. 140 Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981)With this update and upgrade of the 1930s serial adventure, Steven Spielberg turns what could have been pastiche into a practically perfect film.

Meanwhile, the screenwriter (Michel Piccoli) and his beautiful, bored wife (Brigitte Bardot) tussle and reconcile in an incessant, pained ballet. PSSome films strain under the weight of greatness Casablanca’s quality bubbles through. Against the backdrop of the Second World War, two former lovers reunite though everything in the world is pulling them apart. Bogart’s Rick hides a huge heart under a thin veneer of cynicism opposite him Ingrid Bergman’s luminous Ilsa would melt an iceberg. Packed with quotable lines and brimming over with impeccable cool, here we are, still lookin\u0027 at you, kid. HO2740 Meet Me in St Louis (1944)On the surface, Vincente Minnelli\u0027s Technicolor classic is all sweetness and light: Judy Garland, the Trolley song, lots of dancing and tinsel. What makes this one of the great American musicals is an undertow of despair a mile wide. It\u0027s a nostalgia trip as subtly bitter as it is sugary and the subtext of “Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas” is anything but merry. PS2840 A Trip to the Moon (1902)Georges Méliès pioneered many of the visual and special effects techniques that have formed the backbone of fantastical filmmaking ever since, and he pushed them all to their limits in this turn-of-the-century tale of a rocket trip to the moon to meet the strange creatures who live upon it. Witty touches and a real sense of story mean that this is still entertaining more than a century later, and if the effects are less awe-inspiring now, they’re still beautifully designed and executed. HO2940 Out of the Past (1947)Cigarette smoke gives everyone a halo in this masterly, Jacques Tourneur-directed tale of a private investigator (Robert Mitchum) who can’t escape old associates – especially Kathie (Jane Greer), the doll-faced schemer who’s perhaps noir’s ultimate femme fatale. Aka Build My Gallows High, it’s a fatalistic masterpiece, with Kirk Douglas as the smarmy gangster setting Mitchum up for a fall. PSA screwball comedy of substance, Howard Hawks\u0027s remake of The Front Page is an objectively odd mix of high stakes and high comedy. Yet it works because the machine-gun dialogue is so quick that there\u0027s never a moment to question what’s happening (the great screenwriter Ben Hecht, who co-wrote the original Broadway play, worked on it uncredited). Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell, as the warring editor and star-reporter trying to work together long enough to land the story of the year, remain the standard by which all on-screen chemistry should be judged. HOWho\u0027s eavesdropping on whom? Hatched before Watergate and speaking eerily to it, this audacious story of an obsessive surveillance whiz (a career-best Gene Hackman), commissioned to snoop but finding himself morally embroiled, is a slippery plunge into Seventies paranoia like no other. What a run Francis Ford Coppola had, slipping this one in between the first two Godfathers. PSJohn Travolta\u0027s Z-movie sound man, out recording one night, accidentally tapes what turns out to be a political assassination. Brian De Palma hit peak ingenuity and gut-punch profundity with this stunning conspiracy thriller, mounted with a showman\u0027s élan but also harrowing emotional voltage from its star. It’s one of the most delirious thrillers of the 1980s, with a bitterly ironic pay-off that’s played for keeps. PS3340 City of God (2002)There’s a deep contradiction at the heart of this acid-bright portrait of the violence in Rio’s favelas. On one hand these child hustlers and teen gangsters have an intense lust for life, an exuberance displayed in dance and play and love on the other, they value life cheaply and take it without a qualm. Director Fernando Meirelles and co-director Kátia Lund cast a talented band of local kids to give it authenticity and then punctuated their story with Scorsese-esque violence that still shocks. HO3440 Hannah and Her Sisters (1986)The erging romantic fortunes of Hannah (Mia Farrow), Lee (Barbara Hershey) and Holly (Dianne Wiest, who won an Oscar, as did Michael Caine) provide an ideal structure for Woody Allen to check in on a midway state of adulthood, when there\u0027s already a sense of disappointment about squandered promise, but still much to play for. It hits the miraculous sweet spot between all Allen’s modes and tones. PSThe Coen Brothers had already established a ghoulish signature style with Blood Simple, but here they showed us how funny they could be, in a zig-zagging kidnap farce which manages the difficult feat of being both zany and adorable. Nicolas Cage and Holly Hunter are the unlikely couple whose abduction of a spare newborn quintuplet, Nathan Jr, causes all hell to break loose. PSThis looks and acts like a thriller, but in reality Michael Haneke’s exploration of colonialism, guilt, paranoia and privacy cares more about subtext than about scares or mystery. A well-to-do Parisian family are tormented by the arrival of surveillance tapes of their lives, but it’s not clear who could be sending them or why, leading patriarch Georges (Daniel Auteuil, never better) to confront his own past sins. As a subversion of genre and viewer expectation, there are few to match it. HOStraight up the best Bourne movie – an experience Ultimatum can’t help but want to repeat, more falteringly – because of Paul Greengrass’s phenomenal instincts for pace, Matt Damon’s unguessed flair for minimalism, and a script by Tony Gilroy that’s all about conscience. Barring Mad Max: Fury Road, it’s the best and most enduring action movie of the present millennium. PSOrson Welles suggested that Buster Keaton’s silent Civil War comedy might be the greatest film ever made, and who are we to argue? Keaton’s Johnny Gray is a key figure on the railroads of the Confederacy, but he and his engine, The General, must go above and beyond to defeat a Union spy. Ignore the dodgy politics and focus on the sublime physical comedy of Keaton’s beautifully composed routines. You’ll come out wondering if movies even need sound. HOThe Babadook is a black, hunched pop-up book monster who raps on your door three times before paying a visit. And you can’t get rid of him. Widowed mum Amelia (brilliant Essie Davis) can’t remember reading his book to her emotionally disturbed misfit of a son (Noah Wiseman) before. Jennifer Kent’s thoughtful Australian chamber shocker, a feast of inventive design, claws its way into you and leaves scratch marks. PSIs it impossible for men and women to be purely platonic? It is according to Harry, in this beautiful, brainy comedy about two neurotic New Yorkers who become friends and then more. Directed by Rob Reiner and written by wonderful Nora Ephron, it\u0027s a paean of sorts to Woody Allen\u0027s early films, with razor-sharp observations about sex and dating (I\u0027ll have what she\u0027s having). It\u0027s still the pinnacle of both Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan\u0027s careers. After walking away from the Oscars, Hart apologised to those people who may have been offended, saying: “I sincerely apologize to the LGBTQ community for my insensitive words from my past ... I\u0027m sorry that I hurt people. I am evolving and want to continue to do so.”\u0026nbspGLAAD\u0026nbspissued a statement on the incident, saying Hart shouldn’t have stepped down he should have stepped up.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Mission operators are still able to communicate with the spacecraft but it takes information – moving at the speed of light – a full 16.5 hours to make the long journey.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialNasa declared the spacecraft had left when the onboard\u0026nbspPlasma Science Experiment (PLS) showed that it was no longer detecting the plasma flowing out the sun. That outflow creates a bubble called the heliosphere, which envelopes the planets of the solar system and represents the edge of the solar system.JPL-Caltech)“Working on Voyager makes me feel like an explorer, because everything we’re seeing is new,” said John Richardson, principal investigator for the PLS instrument and a principal research scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge.Sounds of Mars wind captured by Nasa\u0027s InSight lander“Even though Voyager 1 crossed the heliopause in 2012, it did so at a different place and a different time, and without the PLS data. So we’re still seeing things that no one has seen before.”As well as the plasma data, Voyager 2 is still sending back other information that confirmed the fact it has left the Solar System and will prove useful to scientists studying interstellar space. That region, known as the heliopause because it exists at the very edge of the Sun\u0027s influence, is still largely unknown to scientists.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s most stunning pictures of space Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.130 Earth from the ISSFrom the International Space Station, Expedition 42 Flight Engineer Terry W.

As time is running out, we will also discuss our preparedness for a no-deal scenario.”The council president\u0026nbspis said to be consulting with EU27 leaders ahead of the summit.\u0026nbspOn Monday, Ms May postponed a Commons vote on the deal, which she was expected to lose badly.A European Commission spokesperson said:\u0026nbsp“We have an agreement on the table that was endorsed by the European Council in its Article 50 format on the 25 November. As president Juncker said, this deal is the best and only deal possible.“We will not renegotiate, our position has not changed, and as far as we are concerned, the United Kingdom is leaving the European Union on 29 March 2019.”The prime minister told\u0026nbspthe Commons on Monday that she would go back to Brussels and was confident of getting legally binding assurances that the “backstop” portion of the deal – which is unpopular with her MPs\u0026nbsp– would never be used.UK can cancel Brexit by unilaterally revoking Article 50, ECJ rulesTheresa May’s Brexit deal cannot be renegotiated, Irish PM saysPound drops as Theresa May pulls Brexit deal voteBut EU member states who broke their silence all\u0026nbspsaid the agreement was not up for discussion – a united line they have taken since it was agreed last month.\u0026nbspIrish prime minister Leo Varadkar, who has been central to Brexit talks because of the Northern Ireland border issue, said in Dublin on Monday that there could be no changes to the agreement but suggested clarifications could be made.“The withdrawal agreement, including the Irish backstop, is the only agreement on the table. It’s not possible to reopen any aspect of that agreement without reopening all aspects,” he said.But he warned that “no statement of clarification can contradict what’s in the withdrawal agreement”.Guy Verhofstadt, the European Parliament’s Brexit coordinator, blasted the government for suspending the planned vote formerly\u0026nbspscheduled for\u0026nbspTuesday.“I can’t follow any more. After two years of negotiations, the Tory government wants to delay the vote,” Mr Verhofstadt said.Varadkar, the Irish prime minister (PA)“Just keep in mind that we will never let the Irish down. This delay will further aggravate the uncertainty for people and businesses. It’s time they make up their mind!”The Brexit coordinator’s comments echo the feelings of many in Brussels who were shocked by the UK’s decision to suspend the parliamentary showdown. That intervention came as Commons speaker John Bercow described the decision, apparently taken by the prime minister this morning, as “discourteous”.The prime minister’s chief Brexit negotiator Olly Robbins returned to Brussels on Monday and was spotted in the European Commission headquarters – apparently trying to seek concessions on the deal.Created with Sketch.

He\u0026nbspwas promptly asked to leave the chamber by John Bercow, the speaker.His intervention came moments after Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn secured an emergency debate on the delay on Tuesday.The impasse remains the Irish border, where a gulf remains between MPs’ demands for the UK to be able to escape the backstop and the EU’s refusal to renegotiate the withdrawal agreement.The pound plunged to a 20-month low within minutes of the announcement of the delay, as the markets digested the deepening Brexit crisis.It came just hours after the European Court of Justice confirmed the UK has the right to cancel Brexit by revoking Article 50 unilaterally, thus\u0026nbspremaining in the EU on its current membership terms.Unless a “meaningful vote” is staged, MPs have no formal mechanism to stop the UK crashing out of the EU with no agreement next March – something the prime minister admitted, for the first time, would cause “significant economic damage”.The extraordinary uncertainty was condemned by MPs on all sides.\u0026nbspMr Corbyn said: “If the prime minister cannot be clear that she can and will renegotiate a deal then she must make way.”Justine Greening, the former Conservative cabinet minister, said: “Parliament has gone round in circles on Brexit. Now today, even that’s stopped. Britain must find a direction. Kicking the can down the road again solves nothing.”And Sammy Wilson, Brexit spokesman for the Democratic Unionist Party – the Tories’ partners in power – turned on Ms May, saying: “Doesn’t she believe that, every time she returns to the House with her tail between her legs, she humiliates the British people?”A furious Mark Francois, deputy chairman of the hard Brexit-supporting European Research Group of Tory MPs, said the government had “run away and hidden in the toilets”, adding: “What the government have done today is shameful.”Downing Street\u0026nbspalso sparked fury by refusing to let MPs decide whether the vote, scheduled for Tuesday evening, should be pulled, despite being all but ordered to do so by the Commons Speaker.Created with Sketch.

More than 50 signed a letter to the party leader.But a party spokesperson said it would only make the move when it had a realistic chance of success, by persuading DUP MPs or, perhaps, rebel Tories to back it.That might come “when she brings the same deal back to the House of Commons without significant changes”, the spokesperson suggested.Continued stalemate in Brussels will increase the danger of a different vote of no confidence – by Tory MPs, if the necessary 48 signatures are collected.EU president Tusk rules out renegotiating deal but calls new meetingGuy Verhofstadt blasts UK government for delaying Brexit voteHigh Court rejects challenge to annul Brexit referendum resultSNP offers to unite with Labour to topple Theresa May’s governmentDonald Tusk, the European Council president, offered Ms May a glimmer of hope by agreeing Brexit could be discussed at a planned EU summit, starting on Thursday.However, he made clear: “We will not renegotiate the deal, including the backstop, but we are ready to discuss how to facilitate UK ratification.” The last words hinted at warmer words, but no big shift.In the Commons, Ms May insisted “nothing is off the table” in Brussels – but repeatedly said she was seeking “assurances”, rather than the renegotiation MPs are demanding.Cabinet will be cancelled on Tuesday, when Ms May holds talks with Mr Tusk, Jean-Claude Juncker, the European Commission president, Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, and Mark Rutte, the Dutch prime minister.However, her spokesman refused to say she would demand a “legally binding” exit mechanism from the backstop, or for the UK to be able to end it\u0026nbsp“unilaterally” – something the EU has repeatedly ruled out.If the UK and EU had failed to reach a withdrawal agreement, the prime minister would have been required to make a statement to the Commons by 21 January on what course she would follow.However, given the agreement was reached, there is no requirement for any motion or statement before Brexit day on 29 March.Asked to give a “cast-iron guarantee” there would be a “meaningful vote” at some stage, Ms May’s spokesman replied: “Yes. We are leaving the European Union on 29 March and we are committed to doing so with a deal.”Earlier, cabinet ministers held an emergency conference call mid-morning, at which there was “ strong support” for pulling the vote, a No 10 aide said – with no dissenters.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

People were against no deal by 44 per cent to 37 per cent, for a new referendum by 46 per cent to 30 per cent and for Norway by 41 per cent to 39 per cent.A sign of just how difficult it will be to secure any deal that enjoys broad support came from another question, which asked respondents to say what it is that is most important for a Brexit deal to secure.The equal top answers were “controlling immigration” and “maintaining smooth trading links with the EU” – two things which, to an extent, are mutually exclusive because of the red lines set out by the EU and UK in negotiations.Ensuring that there is no border erected between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland – the matter at the heart of opposition to Ms May’s plan – was rated as the key issue by just six per cent of people.EU ‘will renegotiate with Theresa May’ Brexit deal is voted down’Ms May is likely to play for time if the vote does go against her next week, and travel to Brussels for a summit of the European Council where she may ask for further concessions to try and make her deal more palatable to MPs.Despite a string of European figures saying there could be no further talks, ex-commission president Mr Prodi appeared to throw Ms May a lifeline on Saturday. Asked how he expected the commission to respond after the vote, he said: “Negotiate. We must keep free trade between us because it is in the British interests and European interest.”On Saturday, Ms Rudd hit out at Brexiteers who she said “flounce out quite a lot” instead of trying to get things done, an attack coming after Boris Johnson\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspDavid Davis\u0026nbspquit the cabinet over Ms May’s deal.\u0026nbspAll have leadership ambitions and have been jockeying for position ahead of a potential future contest in the coming weeks.In an interview, Ms Rudd also took the unusual step of revealing details of a private conversation with the prime minister, even critiquing her leadership style by saying “she is not always forthcoming” about what she wants.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbspMs Rudd is seen as a leading candidate from the moderate wing of the party and even said in her interview that she hoped it chooses a “centrist” figure for its next leader, though she said a contest at this point would be “too indulgent”.Source Note: BMG Research interviewed a representative sample of 1,508 GB adults online between 4 and 7\u0026nbspDecember.

MPs should vote down the withdrawal agreement tomorrow and then support a People\u0027s Vote. If the country support continuing EU membership the court has told us we can revoke Art 50 and keep our existing terms. The threat to this strategy comes from Labour whose posturing around mythical renegotiation and a general election would waste the time we need to organise the referendum.The Commons committee on standards has just published its response to Dame Laura Cox\u0027s report into bullying and harassment of parliament\u0027s staff, writes my colleague\u0026nbspAshley\u0026nbspCowburn.It says greater freedoms should be given greater freedom to trigger investigations into historical investigations against MPs.The publication examined initial proposals for the House of Commons\u0027 standards system following Dame Laura Cox\u0027s report, which lifted the lid on a toxic culture at Westminster.The committee report said: We agree with the commissioner\u0027s view that the requirement for her to consult the committee before beginning an inquiry relating to events more than seven years earlier is an unacceptable encroachment on her independence.We therefore recommend that this requirement should be abolished and that future editions of the guide to the rules should reflect this.We believe there should be no exceptions to the general principle that the committee does not seek to direct the commissioner\u0027s operational decision-making.For that reason, we also recommend that the requirement for her to consult the committee before beginning an inquiry into a former member should also be abolished and that future editions of the guide to the rules should reflect this also.Labour MP Kate Green, who chairs the committee, said: It is vital that trust in the process is rebuilt, following the criticisms in Dame Laura Cox\u0027s report.Whilst there is clearly much more to be done, our recommendations will make an important step forward towards a fairer, more independent and credible system.The Standards Committee is unique in having an equal number of MPs and lay members on it, and these proposals will ensure that the skills and expertise of the lay members can help to hold MPs to account in the most effective way.No 10 has confirmed that there will be a Cabinet conference call at 11.30am but insisted this\u0026nbspis to update ministers on Theresa May\u0027s conversations with EU leaders over the weekend,\u0026nbsprather than about any plans to call\u0026nbspoff tomorrow\u0027s vote.\u0026nbspA spokesperson said the vote will go ahead as planned and Ms May is confident of winning it.This is from our deputy political editor, Rob Merrick, following this morning\u0027s No 10 briefing with journalists here in Westminster...\u0026nbspDowning Street has announced that urgent talks are talking place now with cabinet ministers, amid continued suggestions that tomorrow’s ‘meaningful vote’ could yet be pulled.Theresa May’s spokeswoman insisted that was not the purpose of the sudden conference call, telling journalists: “The vote is going ahead as planned.”Instead, the talks were intended to update the cabinet on talks the prime minister held over the weekend with various EU leaders, she said.The spokeswoman refused to go into what was discussed with EU leaders, saying it would not right to do so before cabinet ministers were informed.However, she continued to insist the withdrawal agreement had been “agreed and negotiated” – and that reopening it could backfire on the UK, by allowing some EU countries to push for tougher terms.Ms May will be in Brussels on Thursday, for an EU summit. Asked if, as rumoured, she could travel there before Thursday, the spokeswoman replied: “There are no plans to do that.”\u0026nbspOver the weekend, the prime minister spoke with Donald Tusk and Jean-Claude Junker, heads of the EU council and commission respectively, as well as with Angela Merkel, the German Chancellor, and the prime ministers of Ireland and the Netherlands.NEW: Asked if the vote is being called off, one Cabinet source tells me: Looks it.BREAKING: Theresa May will give a statement in the Commons on Brexit at 3.30pm. All the signs are that the vote is being called off.BREAKING: Theresa May has called off tomorrow\u0027s vote, a very well-placed source has told me.\u0026nbspJeremy Corbyn has responded to tomorrow\u0027s vote being delayed. He said:\u0026nbsp“The government has decided Theresa May\u0027s Brexit deal is so disastrous that it has taken the desperate step of delaying its own vote at the eleventh hour.\u0026nbspWe have known for at least two weeks that Theresa May’s worst of all worlds deal was going to be rejected by Parliament because it is damaging for Britain. Instead, she ploughed ahead when she should have gone back to Brussels to renegotiate or called an election so the public could elect a new government that could do so.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp“We don\u0027t have a functioning government. While Theresa May continues to botch Brexit, our public services are at breaking point and our communities suffer from dire under-investment.\u0026nbsp“Labour’s alternative plan for a jobs first deal must take centre stage in any future talks with Brussels.”Steve Baker, the Eurosceptic ERG\u0027s main organiser, says:\u0026nbspThis is essentially a defeat of the prime minister\u0027s Brexit deal. The terms of the withdrawal agreement were so bad that they didn\u0027t dare put it to Parliament for a vote. This isn\u0027t the mark of a stable government or a strong plan.\u0026nbspHe added\u0026nbspParliament should be been allowed to voice its concerns about the proposed withdrawal agreement. Without a clear rejection of the terms by MPs, the prime minister has kicked the can down the road and the EU is very unlikely to re-negotiate.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Whether the UK had this power or not has been disputed, and campaigners had asked judges to rule.This isn’t a final legal ruling by the court, but judges usually endorse what the advocate general suggests. We should find out if this recommendation is confirmed within the coming weeks, with 17 December one date that is being talked about in Brussels.\u0026nbspIf it is confirmed, an accidental no-deal Brexit is effectively taken off the table – the government would be able to stop it in all circumstances if it wanted to.\u0026nbspThis is significant because the government’s main argument to remainer MPs to get them to support Theresa May’s deal has been that if they don’t, a disastrous no-deal Brexit could happen without anyone wanting it to. In one respect, the decision makes it harder for May’s deal to pass, because she won\u0027t be able to scare them into backing it.Meanwhile, in WestminsterAs the news from the Luxembourg court broke in the morning , MPs were settling in for a big day in Westminster. By the time they went home for the night, the Government had been defeated in three votes – a record bad day for Theresa May’s minority administration.One of these votes was about whether the Government was in contempt of parliament for refusing to release its legal advice about its Brexit deal. MPs decided that ministers were indeed in contempt – effectively forcing the government to release the legal advice. This is significant because the advice is expected to provide more ammunition for opponents of the deal, especially Brexiteers.But another vote lost by the government will likely have even bigger implications. MPs – including 26 Tory rebels – voted to give parliament more power if Theresa May’s deal is voted down.If the deal is voted down next Tuesday the Government has 21 days to come back to Parliament and lay its plan for what happens next. But under the successful amendment tabled by Tory Remainer Dominic Grieve, the Commons will also be able to vote on what it wants the Government to do. Though that vote wouldn’t technically be binding, it would be politically incredible for the Government to ignore it.\u0026nbspTaken together with the likely ECJ ruling that the UK has the power to stop Brexit if it wants, MPs would be expected to take no-deal off the table. They might also call for a so-called ‘plan B’ – a call for Theresa May to go back to Brussels and negotiate a different deal. Whether that would be successful is another matter.So what are the implications for Brexit?The overall effect of the events of Tuesday 4 December are to make a no-deal Brexit significantly less likely. Nobody thinks there is a majority of MPs in favour of a no-deal, and they will now control the Government’s response to its deal being defeated.\u0026nbspIf the ECJ decides that the UK does have the unilateral power to revoke Brexit, then no-deal is effectively off the table. But even if it doesn’t it’s unlikely member states would stand in the way and push Britain off the cliff.In one sense, the deal is also less likely to pass because of what happened: Remainers were being encouraged to vote for it on the basis that a no-deal might happen.\u0026nbspBut in a strange way, the deal might win more support – if Brexiteers decide that the defeat of the deal might mean Brexit not happening at all, they could swing behind it. A large number have already publicly said they will vote against it, however – so whether that will be enough remains to be seen.Is that everything that happened?No, that’s just the main thread. Plenty more happened that would have been big news on any other day.\u0026nbspNigel Farage also announced he was leaving Ukip – the party he has long been synonymous with – because of its increasing closeness to far-right activist Tommy Robinson.\u0026nbspThe BBC dropped out of plans to host a debate on Brexit between Jeremy Corbyn and Theresa May after the three sides couldn’t agree on a format.The Pound fell to an 18-month low after the Government lost the contempt vote, but then rebounded.\u0026nbspMeanwhile, former Bank of England governor Mervyn King wrote an article in which he likened Theresa May’s Brexit deal to the appeasement of the Nazis. All in a day’s work!\u0026nbspThe Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

But at the moment I’m looking at who is in the papers, who can we get behind, but it shouldn’t be about the personality it should be about the country.”\u0026nbspMs McVey\u0026nbspsaid she would support the prime minister if she were to go back to Brussels and try and renegotiate the deal, in particular around the Irish backstop and the £39bn ‘orce bill’ that Ms May’s withdrawal agreement accounts for.Mr Raab was interviewed on the same show, and asked if he would rule out a run, he said: “I’ve always said I wouldn’t rule it out, but I’m just not going to get sucked in to that debate.“The public and people watching this show would think it would be very self-indulgent to be engaging in that speculation.”He would not comment when asked if he would stand aside for fellow Brexiteer Boris Johnson to run for the leadership.It\u0026nbspcame as comments the government was hit by another resignation over the Brexit plan –\u0026nbspWill Quince, a ministerial aide to defence secretary Gavin Williamson.He hit out at the backstop plan to avoid a hard border with Ireland, saying it could result in the UK being “tied to the negotiating table for years, until we agree to anything in desperation” to get out of the situation.For her part, Ms May warned Tory MPs they risk handing Jeremy Corbyn the keys to Number 10 unless they back her Brexit deal in an interview with Mail on Sunday, .“It would mean grave uncertainty for the nation with a very real risk of no Brexit or leaving the European Union with no deal,” she told the Mail on Sunday.“We have a leader of the Opposition who thinks of nothing but attempting to bring about a general election, no matter what the cost to the country.“As someone who cares passionately about my country and my party, I believe Jeremy Corbyn getting his hands on power is a risk we cannot afford to take.”Reports suggested Ms May could make an emergency trip to Brussels ahead of a planned summit on Thursday in an effort to secure further concessions in an effort to win over critics of her plan.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Many firms cited Brexit uncertainty as a factor constraining investment and orders.“The marked weakening of the UK economy this autumn is as we expected given the continued high level of uncertainty around Brexit,” said John Hawksworth of PwC.“Until this is resolved, the UK economy is likely to remain in the doldrums as businesses will be reluctant to invest and households may also be reluctant to commit to big ticket items like house and car purchases.”Separately, the ONS also\u0026nbspreported on Monday that the UK’s goods trade balance in October widened to £11.87bn, higher than expected by City analysts.There was also a sharp downward revision to exports earlier in the year.This year’s trade boost has been suddenly revised away, reinstating this depreciation’s record as the least successful in Britain’s post-war history, said Samuel Tombs of Pantheon.In the three months to October the deficit was £35.5bn. Good exports were up by 2.1 per cent over the three months, but this was outstripped by the increase in imports, which were 3 per cent higher.Including the services surplus, the total trade deficit was £3.3bn in October and £10.3bn over the quarter.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Mr Musk’s settlement with the agency saw him and Tesla each fined $20m, he was ordered to step down as chairman for three years, and the company was told it must introduce “additional controls and procedures to oversee Musk\u0027s communications, including his use of Twitter. The terms of the agreement must be met by 28 December.\u0026nbspElon Musk will not smoke cannabis on a podcast again, says Nasa bossElon Musk says he is probably going to go and live on MarsHow should a tech writer deal with Elon Musk?But on CBS News’ 60 Minutes programme, Mr Musk was asked: “Does someone have to read them before they go out?” He replied “No.” “So your tweets are not supervised?” interviewer Lesley Stahl asked. “The only tweets that would need to be, say, ‘reviewed’, would be if a tweet had a probability of causing a movement in the stock.”“Yeah, I mean, otherwise it’s ‘Hello first amendment’, like freedom of speech is fundamental,” Mr Musk replied.“But how do they know if it’s going to move the market if they’re not reading all of them before you send them?” Stahl asked.“Well I guess we might make some mistakes, who knows?” Mr Musk replied. “Are you serious?” Stahl responded.Elon Musk says tweet which cost him $20m was \u0027worth it\u0027“Nobody’s perfect,” said Mr Musk before looking away from Stahl and the cameras, and appeared to be fighting back tears.His emotional response did not go unnoticed by Stahl who then said: “Look at you.”Mr Musk quickly moved on to say he did not respect the SEC, but said he was abiding by the settlement because he did respect the justice system.The SEC’s legal filing in September also alluded to marijuana culture being a component in Mr Musk’s tweet saying he would take the firm private at $420 a share.In the US the number 420 is synonymous with marijuana consumption, and April 20 each year has become a celebrated date among smokers of the drug. “Musk stated that he rounded the price up to $420 because he had recently learned about the number\u0027s significance in marijuana culture and thought his girlfriend \u0027would find it funny, which admittedly is not a great reason to pick a price,’” the SEC filing reads.Later this year Mr Musk appeared on a live web show during which he was filmed smoking a spliff with the host, which caused Tesla’s share price to fall.During the 60 Minutes interview, when quizzed on the subject Mr\u0026nbspMusk said: “As anybody who watched that podcast could tell, I have no idea how to smoke pot, or anything. I don’t know how to smoke anything, honestly.”Created with Sketch.Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 42Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.5G wireless internet is expected to launch in 2019, with the potential to reach speeds of 50mbsUber has halted testing of driverless vehicles after a woman was killed by one of their cars in Tempe, Arizona.

There is no point in the Government trying to hide that fact.The Democratic Unionist Party has vowed to oppose any new checks on goods passing between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.Irelands Foreign Minister, Simon Coveney, said that EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier indicated that the European Union will allow extra time for talks about the border.Mr Coveney said he was frustrated and disappointed that it was going to take more time than people had hoped.At the start of a key debate in Parliament on her Brexit plan, the Prime Minister said the backstop was not a trap for Britain.The backstop is not a trick to trap us in the EU, said Mrs May.It actually gives us some important benefits of access to the EUs market without many of the obligations and that is something the EU will not want to let happen, let alone persist for a long time."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/NINTCHDBPICT0004409297771.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"theresa may customs union tory dup backstop","story":"The PM’s stand comes as her pact with her Northern Irish allies hung by a thread after extraordinary revelations DUP chiefs want her gone by Christmas and deputy leader Nigel Dodds mocked Tory panic.And in fresh headache for Mrs May it was also emerged last night the EU are secretly discussing extending the Brexit process because of the chaos.Her tough words came in a bid to quell the revolt over the so called Brexit backstop - which Brexiteers insist must have “get out clause” written into it. The “backstop” would see Britain mirror EU rules indefinitelyno new trade deal is in place to keep the Northern Irish border open.The EU now suggests a longer post-Brexit transition until December , citing lack of progress. It would see us paying Brussels billions extra.But Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab insisted that it must be “time-limited” and cannot leave Britain “in definite limbo”.However he stopped short of demanding a named date as Brussels has rejected this and Downing Street said his stance was consistent with the PM.No said the PM would never agree to a deal which would trap the UK in a backstop permanently.” But Ireland said having an open ended backstop was “a deal-breaker” for them.Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said: “The backstop needs to be there unless and until something better comes along. Nobody wants to use the backstop - this is like taking out fire insurance on your house.”But yesterday Philip Hammond explicitly stated the temporary period would be needed to be invoked.Mrs May has always insisted the backstop is unlikely to ever be needed, yet Mr Hammond said: “It is true that there needs to be a period - probably following the transition period that weve negotiated and before we enter into our long-term partnership.Mrs May now heads to Brussels on Wednesday to meet fellow EU leaders for a crunch summit that faces deadlock.Meanwhile open civil war broke out between Tory MPs and their crucial DUP allies over the issue, after the Northern Irish threatened to dethrone the PM.And as Sun columnist James Forsyth reveals today, some senior figures in the DUP want the PM to be ousted within weeks.Tory MP Nick Boles hit out: “Conservative leaders are chosen by Conservative MPs and Conservative Party members. Not by MPs of any other party. And we respond no better to threats than proud Ulster men or women do.And it emerged Eurocrats are mulling plans to prolong the transition period in a bid to stop the DUP torpedoing a Brexit deal.Sources said the withdrawal pact could be changed so the  month window can be extended to reassure Unionists the backstop will never be needed.The EU is making a demand of Theresa May she cannot fulfil without national humiliation, mass Cabinet resignations and near-certain Commons defeat.Brussels must know it is utterly unreasonable to demand we stay locked in their customs union indefinitely. Or that they should dictate when we can finally leave. Which they never would.A .million majority voted to leave. MPs voted that meant leaving the customs union. Our democracy, sovereignty and trading future are all at stake. Mrs May must defend all three. God knows what happens next weekshe doesn’t.The Remain ultras should be loving this chaos. Except they have suffered their own disaster. The EU sayswe held a second referendum and voted Remain, they’d strip us of our historic rebate on payments to Brussels.So along with violent unrest, a ­collapse of trust in democracy and a huge surge in extremism, Remaining would come with a whole new price tag on top of EU membership fees: Four thousand million quid a year.Good luck selling that.But the plot will enrage Brexiteers, who fear efforts to trap Britain permanently in the Single Market and Customs Union as a vassal state.During a transition the UK will be banned from striking trade deals and will have to keep making budget payments, while following EU rules without any say.Sources said Michel Barnier is considering a new plan that would see the transition stay in place until the end of  - meaning a two year, nine month phase.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Senior figures there say that will not be decided until Monday.But they do admit they are making little headway in trying to quell this rebellion, and that they are heading for a loss.How big  “I’m sure it’ll breach three figures”, one Cabinet minister says of the margin of defeat.A way to avoid such a humiliation would be to find an amendment that could pass the Commons.This means there would be no vote on May’s deal as it currently stands, enabling the Government to argue that it hadn’t actually been defeated.Though, as one source admits, voters would be left baffled by this procedural trick.This approach isn’t guaranteed to work either.First of all, it would rely on John Bercow selecting the amendment — which is far from certain. The Speaker is supposed to be impartial, but Bercow has long used his power to cause the Government trouble.Much of Tuesday’s Cabinet meeting was taken up with ministers complaining about him. Liam Fox, the Trade ­Secretary, called Bercow “a disgrace to his office”.Also, some Tory rebels are itching to defeat the Government. They are discussing whether to vote against ALL amendments, regardless of whether they agree with them or not, so they can make clear their opposition to May’s deal. Some in Cabinet think thatMPs voted for an amendment setting out what would make the deal acceptable to Parliament, it would strengthen May’s hand with the EU.One tells me: “The negotiation has been all about us saying yes or no. This would make the EU say yes or no to something.”Chancellor Philip Hammond, though, argued at Thursday’s inner Cabinet that any concessions are more likely to come after a vote has been lost — so there was a case for pressing on.What May thinks the way ahead is remains unclear even to her inner Cabinet, much to their frustration.“The main problem is that it is very dficult to read the PM,” one tells me, adding that, “Until she decides what she wants to do, it is very dficult to put weight behind any ­particular outcome.”Backbench Tory MPs are also becoming increasingly irritated with her.One senior figure who is ­normally sympathetic complains that she has become “completely messianic about the backstop”. This source says that Tory MPs “want to hear a solution rather than this is the only choice and they’re stupid”.Allies of May are deeply pessimistic about the EU offering any meaningful concessions.Their view is that the EU thinks that the alternatives to May’s deal are either a softer Brexit or a second referendum, so it has little incentive to offer much up.Not everyone in the Cabinet is so sure.One senior minister, with Prime Ministerial ambitions, has been explaining to junior ministers in detail how they could negotiate a better deal on the backstop.Tory leadership contenders are readying themselves.They calculate thatthe vote goes ahead this week May will lose by a big margin, the  letters will then go in and May could well lose that vote of confidence, triggering a contest.If she does go ahead with Tuesday’s vote, she’ll be betting her premiership on keeping the margin of defeat respectable. It would be a mighty gamble.There are two reasons for this. First, the Labour front bench are not keen on Norway-Plus and a number of those on the Labour benches who did support it have moved to backing a second ­referendum. Second, there is now more Tory opposition to it than there was before, particularly among the Cabinet.One Secretary of State warns that a Norway Plus deal “would destroy the Conservative Party forever”.The problem is that in an effort to make the plan acceptable to the Europeans, it has gone from being a temporary solution that would give the UK time to negotiate a free trade deal with the  EU to an indefinite arrangement that involves accepting the withdrawal agreement and with  it the ­backstop. This all makes it much less ­acceptable to Brexiteers.Even those in the Cabinet who are sympathetic to the idea admit that it would face problems.One tells me: “I am not sure it is possible because so many people would trash it.”Norway-Plus would also require a new leader.Those close to May say she could not endorse a deal that did not end free movement.EVENthe Government loses heavily on Tuesday, it would still survive a vote of confidence.The Tory rebels and the DUP have been clear that they would vote for the Government in that debate.This poses a dilemma for Labour.It means that any attempt to bring down the Government would fail, and risk providing a rare moment of Tory unity. I understand, though, that opposition parties have been mulling a dferent approach – a censure motion in the PM.This would allow the House to express its disapproval of May’s handling of Brexit, without bringing down the Government.The thinking is that this might persuade the DUP to support it.  It would demonstrate that without them, the Government cannot win a confidence vote.Traditionally, these censure motions have been accompanied by a cut in salary for the minister concerned. But there are worries on the Opposition benches that such an approach could backfire because it would look too personal.So,the UK couldn’t now leave without a deal without facing catastrophic consequences, who should carry the can for that ONE theory doing the rounds this week is that May could resign as PM and advise the Queen to ask her de facto deputy, David Lidington, to form a government.This government would then, so the thinking goes, move towards a Norway-style deal.But I am told there would be resignations from the Cabinetthis happened, and a leading Tory backbencher warns that such a government would not be able to command the confidence of the House.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But it is not the serious, sensible, unying compromise he believes. Nor does it deliver on the referendum.Joining EFTA — part of the European Economic Area — alongside Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein would leave us nominally “out” of the EU. But that’s pretty much where it ends.We would still be in the single market, accepting free movement, with a supposed “brake” we would never deploy.Worse, we would remain in an EU customs union too, to “avoid” the mythical hard border in Ireland no one will ever build.We would effectively still be EU members  with no vote, nor power to strike our own trade deals — wrecking Brexit’s central economic case.It’s a non-Brexit that only satisfies Remainers. The Leave victory was motivated by a desire for sovereignty, including  control over immigration. This fulfils none of it. It won’t fly.Even a second referendum is better  — though obviously “Remain” cannot be on the ballot, the first vote having ruled it out.CAN the Government not see the obvious conclusion voters draw from its zombie-apocalypse vision of a no-deal Brexit Downing Street trots out these scenarios — medicines, food and water running short and bodies going unburied — like they were inevitable. But it was their job to prepare us. Had they done so from , we would be in good shape.Chancellor Philip Hammond actually considered it irresponsible to spend money on it. The Government, incredibly, feared upsetting Brussels.Now they’re saying: “Brexit’s coming! Look how little we’ve done to be ready.”It is jaw-dropping negligence.He seriously claims Labour could secure all the benefits of the single market while defying its rules, including on immigration, and staying in a customs union while doing our own trade deals.Literally none of it is possible.

So why do my friends think they must vote for it Because they believe that there is no alternative: that we may not like what has happened – but that we have run out of time and run out of road.It is crucial to understand that this pessimism is just flat wrong.If this deal is voted down on Tuesday – and I devoutly hope it is - we need to do two big things.First we need to change the Withdrawal Agreement, keeping all the sensible things that have been agreed on citizens’ rights, but getting rid of the “backstop” agreement on the Northern Irish border.We should use the so-called transition period both to negotiate a big and generous zero tarf zero quota free trade deal, and to solve the technical problems posed by the Northern Ireland border.There is no reason why we should not use that time – almost two years – to put in place the systems that will allow our whole country to come out of both the customs union and the single market, which is what the people were promised both at the referendum and the general election.We should be clear that we will keep back at least half of the £billion until the free trade deal is done.And second it is time now to show our EU friends that we mean business.This should be a take it or leave it offer – and so show that we mean business we must be able to walk away.This is a great country, capable of rising to immense challenges – and I believe the people of this country are fed up to the back teeth of being told by their government that they are simply incapable of managing the logistical problems of Brexit, when for two and a half years this government has studiously and deliberately failed to address those logistical problems.It is that failure and that lack of resolve that has so weakened our hand in the talks.Now is the time to get on with it – and remember,we have to go down this route, we will have the entire £billion to spend on it.We need to get our ports ready, hire the staff, ensure that the planes can fly and that companies are helped to transfer their data under any circumstances.I don’t believe for a moment that our EU friends and partners want such an outcome.They have a £ billion surplus with us in goods alone.They don’t want barriers to trade.They want a deal as much as we do.Do you really think that the people of the Calais region would be gratefulthe Paris government took steps to block commercial traffic from the UK Have you seen what is going on in France No one wants disruption of any kind – and the way to avoid it is to get ready to manage it now, with energy and conviction.We can still get a great deal, and I am sure we will.

Over two years later, it’s time to settle the squabbles and get on with the job.I want MPs to support the Prime Minister’s agreement on Tuesday because it offers the surest path to Brexit.The alternatives – a second referendum or no Brexit at all – would fly in the face of the will of the British people. Instead of honouring and respecting the referendum, politicians would be ignoring the result.Pulling out of the EU is a hugely complex task. Leaving a bloc that we joined nearly  years ago, while staying friends with its members, means that everyone has to compromise.Some people legitimately say that the Withdrawal Agreement is not perfect, but it offers the most practical way of doing what the British electorate want.People voted to take back control of our borders, laws and money. This deal fulfils those instructions, while protecting jobs and the integrity of our United Kingdom.If you are in the EU, you have to accept the automatic right of any citizen of any other member state to live and work in your country.This agreement will end that situation and restore the British Government’s power to decide who should settle in our country. We will admit people with the right skills for our economy, regardless of their background.Britain is generous and tolerant, so the rights of EU citizens already living here will be protected, along with the rights of Britons residing in the EU.We will also stop making vast annual payments to the EU, allowing the British Government to decide on public spending priorities.As I know from my previous job, this Government’s priority is the NHS. By , we will be investing an extra £ million in the NHS every week.Tomorrow I will go to Brussels to meet fellow Foreign Ministers from across the EU. We will discuss how to take forward our work to counter the common threats from terrorists and hostile states. That vital task will continue under the Prime Minister’s Brexit deal, which allows us to work together when it makes sense, and go our own way when we want.The real choice is not between the Prime Minister’s agreement and a perfect solution.The real choice is between this agreement and going back to square one and running the risk of Brexit not happening at all.

I’ve had to lose half his stuff because I’ve got nowhere to put it.“You’ve got to keep your pram downstairs during the day.

As time is running out, we will also discuss our preparedness for a no-deal scenario.And a spokeswoman for European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker poured cold water on any prospect of a renegotiation of the Withdrawal Agreement.Speaking ahead of Mrs Mays statement, the spokeswoman said: This deal is the best and only deal possible. We will not renegotiate.Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar ruled out reopening talks around the backstop, saying it was not possible to reopen any aspect of the Withdrawal Agreement without reopening all of it.Downing Street was unable to give any indication of when the vote will now be held, saying that this would depend on how quickly Mrs May is able to secure the assurances which will satisfy MPs.Speaking today, the PM said: Ive listened very carefully to what has been said in this chamber and out of it by members on all sides.From listening to those views it is clear that while there is broad support for many of the key aspects of the deal, on one issue – the Northern Ireland backstop – there remains widespread and deep concern.As a result,we went ahead and held the vote tomorrow the deal would be rejected by a signicant margin. We will therefore defer the vote scheduled for tomorrow.She will now travel around the continent to try and get a better deal on the Irish backstop ahead of a Brussels summit on Thursday.The PM told the Commons: I spoke to a number of EU leaders over the weekend, and in advance of the European Council I will go to see my counterparts in other member states and the leadership of the Council and the Commission.I will discuss with them the clear concerns that this house has expressed. We are also looking closely at new ways of empowering the House of Commons to ensure that any provision for a backstop has democratic legitimacy.The backstop - designed to keep the Irish border open - would trap the UK in the customs union, and require checks between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.Dozens of Tory MPs have said they cant back Mrs Mays deal unless there is a mechanism for Britain to get out of the backstop without the EUs permission.But the PM warned thatthe Commons blocks her withdrawal agreement, Brexit could be cancelled altogether - or we could crash out of the EU without any deal at all.She asked: Does this house want to deliver Brexit  Andit does, does it want to do so through reaching an agreement with the EU If the answer is yes, and I believe that is the answer of the majority of this House, then we all have to ask ourselves whether we are prepared to make a compromise. Because there will be no enduring and successful Brexit without some compromise on both sides of the debate.Mrs May concluded: Even though I voted Remain, from the moment I took up the responsibility of being Prime Minister of this great country I have known that my duty is to honour the result of that vote.And I have been just as determined to protect the jobs that put food on the tables of working families and the security partnerships that keep each one of us safe.And that is what this deal does. It gives us control of our borders, our money and our laws. It protects jobs, security and our Union. It is the right deal for Britain.I am determined to do all I can to secure the reassurances this house requires, to get this deal over the line and deliver for the British people.But quizzed on when she would hold the rearranged vote, the PM refused to confirm when it would be - saying only that it will be before a deadline of January .Brexiteers were already quick to tell Mrs May today that it wouldnt be enough to simply tinker around the edges of her deal.Jacob Rees-Mogg told journalists this evening that changing the backstop wouldnt be enough to get him to vote for it.He said the result was inevitable and it would get rejected unless there is a new Prime Minister.This is a rotten day for the government. And it is a humiliating day... I think the feeling is sad that the government is in such a mess.As Mrs May fights for her deal - and her career:That put Mrs May on course for the worst Conservative rebellion in history - sparking a possible leadership crisis or even a fresh election bringing Jeremy Corbyn to power.Critics hit out at the PMs decision to pull the vote - Nicola Sturgeon blasted: Pathetic cowardice it is from PM. Yet again the interests of the Tory party are a higher priority for her than anything .Jeremy Corbyn added: The Government has decided Theresa Mays Brexit deal is so disastrous that it has taken the desperate step of delaying its own vote at the eleventh hour.Nigel Dodds of the DUP, which is propping up Mrs May in power, said in the Commons: “Doesn’t she get it by now that the withdrawal agreement isn’t acceptable to this house Please, Prime Minister, really do start listening and come back with changes to the Withdrawal Agreement or it really will be voted down.His colleague Sammy Wilson raged: Every time she comes back here with her tail between her legs, she humiliates the British people - when will she stand up to the EU The future is now uncertain - with a new deal, No Deal Brexit or even a second referendum possibly on the table.Mrs May this afternoon confirmed that the vote is delayed, with Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom set to announce the parliamentary procedure used to pull the motion from the agenda.The PM is then scheduled to travel around Europe pressuring EU leaders to give her a better deal ahead of a summit in Brussels starting on Thursday.Dozens of MPs have said they can never vote for the withdrawal agreement unless it offers a guarantee that Britain cant be trapped in the backstop.If she succeeds in tweaking the deal, it couldto the Commons either next week or after Christmas, with January  the deadline.But the Government could still lose the rearranged vote - which would trigger a letter from Mrs May setting out the way forward.MPs would be free to amend the PMs statement, directing ministers to adopt a dferent strategy such as calling a second referendum.Or the Government could adopt a radically dferent strategy such as pivoting to a Norway-style Brexit which keeps Britain in the single market.But without MPs agreeing on a new path, Britain will be on course to crash out of the EU without any deal.Mrs Mays own position could also be under threat - Labour have threatened to call a vote of confidence in Parliament which would topple the Government.And the PM will face a challenge to her leadership of the Tory party of her colleagues write letters calling for her to go.And pro-EU Tory MP Anna Soubry told The Sun: I fear we are becoming the laughing stock of the world.But when she was accused of bottling it by pulling her vote, the PM hit back saying: If I was bottling it, I wouldnt have come to this chamber and been on my feet already for two and a half hours.This morning a No spokesman claimed Mrs May still intended to let MPs vote on her deal tomorrow.But minutes later she spoke to the Cabinet in an emergency conference call - then announced she would be making a Commons statement.It came after a string of weekend phone calls with European heads of state.Mrs May called Angela Merkel, Irelands Leo Varadkar, top Eurocrats Donald Tusk and Jean-Claude Juncker, and Dutch PM Mark Rutte.The Sun was the first to report a week ago that the Government was considering pulling tomorrows vote instead of suffering a public humiliation.Ministers this morning insisted the PM did still have a chance of winning the vote - hours before it was pulled.Foreign Office Minister Alan Duncan hit out at the wreckers and called for the Tories to unite behind Mrs May.But Boris Johnson said the deal could be fixed as long as the PM ditched the backstop.He wrote in the Daily : We are told that the EU does not even like the backstop.Well,the EU doesnt like it, and the UK Government doesnt like it, and the British people dont like it, why on earth is it there  Let us get rid of it and move on."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/NINTCHDBPICT000455376765.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"theresa may says there could be a third brexit referendum if she gives in to mps and gives them a second","story":"The Prime Minister said thatshe decided to give the decision back to the people now, then MPs would be crying out for yet another one in future.She said that some people would never be completely happy with the result and would always fight to overturn it.It came as she revealed she would postpone her vote on the Brexit deal in the face of a humiliating defeat.She will now fly around Europe to try and beg the EU to make tweaks to the deal or assurances on the hated Northern Irish backstop.On a second referendum Mrs May said: Does she honestly think that If we were to have another referendum and it came out with a dferent result, people wouldnt say we should have a third referendum to find out what the result was And she added: I wonderit came out with the same result, she would still be asking for another vote.Several MPs used her Commons appearance to demand a so-called Peoples Vote on another deal.But Mrs May slapped them down, saying she genuinely believed that the peoples first say should be respected and Brexit MUST be delivered.Mrs May said: I believe that as a country we should meet those obligations.I think those people, many of whom voted for the first time when they voted in the referendum in , will indeed question why should we vote in futurethis Parliament does not deliver on that result, she stressed.As Mrs May fights for her deal -

this sort of premature Parliamentary ejaculation - that has put the lie to the claim she sticks to her guns.“When she won’t even tell us when the vote is deferred to, it would appear the lady is for turning.She added: “How can we ever trust anything she ever says again ”There were hoots of laughter and one MP muttered “wow, wow that’s strong”.But Mrs May appeared to enjoy the joke, which came after nearly three hours of hostile questioning.She replied: “If she looks carefully, she will see I I am not capable of a parliamentary ejaculation.”It echoes Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable, who fluffed a line about Brexit being an “erotic spasm” in his party conference speech, instead saying “exotic spresm”.Today Mrs May told MPs she would delay her vote on the Brexit deal, telling them she would go back to Brussels and ask for more.But the EU has said they wont re-open her deal, only promising to work on how to facilitate UK ratication.As Mrs May fights for her deal -

A phenomenon you’ll be well aware of,you watch television or engage with Twitter.The Last Leg’s Adam Hills, for instance, is a helluvaguy. So are presenters like Nish Kumar, James O’Brien and all those other blokes who cannot stop wanging on, very publicly, about their feminist credentials and just how much they love the NHS.While others might rely simply on empty words though, Nick Knowles preferred grand heroic gestures, right from day one in the jungle when he threw himself into the water to save four women who were in absolutely no danger of drowning.The idea that Nick Knowles was every woman’s Sir Galahad, was clearly never in doubt then. At least not in his own mind.The ever-so-slightly deluded David Brent-side to his character did not fully emerge, though, until the very last week when James McVey revealed Nick’s version of Make You Feel My Love had gone to number one in the iTunes chart.A stroke of genius for production to let the news slip, obviously, and for someone to send an acoustic guitar into camp, so that Nick could delight everyone with an unplugged rendition, which Emily Atack described as “a viral moment,” much like Ebola.Dec was clearly having the time of his le poking fun at Knowles as well, describing him as: “So good at DIY he’s even gravelled his voice.”I need nearly hardly tell you what happened next then.The public got rid of Nick Knowles, just as they get rid of any jungle contestant who’s ever shown the slightest inclination to act like an entertaining jerk.This is a problem that dates right back to series one, of course, when livewires Uri Geller, Darren Day, Rhona Cameron and Nigel Benn were all voted out before silent Nell McAndrew, and it continues to prevent a genuinely great line-up from turning into a genuinely great series, eventhis one did end with exactly the right winner in Harry Redknapp.I don’t see any way round the problem, either. The voting public just seems to prefer self-absorbed young bores, on “a journey,” to genuine characters.If any of us thought Nick Knowles was finished, the moment Dec read out his name, though, we reckoned without an eviction interview which will surely take its place in I’m A Celeb . . .  folklore.For it turns out Nick Knowles wasn’t in the jungle for purely personal or financial gain.It was to heal a ided nation.“We’re having such a hard time in the UK,” he told Dec, alluding to Brexit, “I thought,we can get on, it might be a bit of a pointer to the nation.”Gee, thanks Nick. I had been wondering why a cane toad was sat on your head, during the Wicked Warehouse task, but it’s beginning to make sense now. He wasn’t finished either.“I’d like to say one last thing.” Go on . ..“Please support veterans, support the police, support the NHS, support the emergency services.They have it a lot harder, on a day to day basis, than we have it in here.”A hell-of-a-claim to make when you’ve reportedly just been paid £, to sit around a television set, in Australia, with John Barrowman, but then Nick Knowles is clearly a helluvaguy.SO there was Gemma Collins behaving like a monstrous old boot as usual, last week, when fellow BBC diner Adrian Chiles silenced her with a simple question.“Is there anything you can’t stop eating ”At which point you could see Gemma disengaging from the conversation as she ran through the checklist: “Cakes, buns, crisps, Pringles, biscuits, pies, potatoes, cows, pigs, horses, breeze blocks, deep-fried landfill, light aircraft . . . ”The silence couldn’t last forever, obviously, but it was a nice  seconds on BBC’s I’ll Get This, a celeb dinner party show, that I hadn’t really seen the point of up until the arrival of Chiles, who has a streak of honesty that’s very rare among presenters.Even by Adrian’s own standards, though, his response to the question “Why would you make the best chat show host ” was brutally self-aware.“For a huge amount of money, a big hullabaloo, billboards everywhere, I went to ITV and did another chat show, Daybreak, at which I was s**t.“I failed abysmally, humiliatingly. I looked miserable, I was sullen, I sat there like a bag of potatoes, I dragged everyone down with me, from the moment I walked in the door at am.“SoI ever get the chance to host another chat show, let’s be honest, unlikely, I will be the best chat show host ever, ’cos I know what it’s like to succeed and I know what it’s like to fail, dismally.”A confession that I expected to be met with stunned silence but it was actually greeted by spontaneous applause, from fellow celebs, and a faint whirring noise from Gemma Collins’ brain: “Doritos, kebabs, dips, mini eclairs, maxi eclairs, Jenny Eclairs . . . ”I PARTED company with Celebrity Antiques Road Trip the moment the commentator announced: “Russell Kane’s heading for an auction at Penkridge.”Anyone know how much he fetched UK’S Strongest Man. Best dead-weight lt was, of course, won by Declan Donnelly . . .  who carried about  kilos for three weeks.FRANCE is burning, Paris is in lockdown and its government’s on the brink.So how many mentions do you think TV’s fearlessly impartial satirical news shows, Have I Got News For You, The Mash Report and The Last Leg, gave it, on Friday Correct. None. Because these inconvenient facts don’t fit the narrative and agenda of the BBC and Channel , which believe Britain is a basket case and Europe is our only salvation.So it was simply ignored and all three proceeded with the same lazy and witless anti-Brexit and Trump routines they go with every week.There were some slight iations with the other material, obviously.The Last Leg and HIGNFY, ably hosted by Danny Dyer, both invited lists to be outraged by alleged sexism at the Ballon D’Or awards, held in Paris, ironically.While the final Mash Report of the series offered Rachel Parris lecturing viewers about poverty, as only a privately-educated, Oxbridge graduate truly can, before smug-bucket in chief Nish Kumar closed the show by saying: “We’ll be back next year,the will of the people demands it.”Which is almost the very last thing the will of the people will ever demand.The Mash Report will be back, though. The political agenda of the BBC demands it.Who said the following last week: “Oh my God, there’s a cockroach having dinner on my butthole.”A John Barrowman doing the Rotten Retrieval trial on I’m a Celebrity B Tyson Fury during his Good Morning Britain interview with Piers Morgan Sent in by Connor David.

The Prime Minister wanted MPs to give final approval to her -page agreement to leave the EU. But she delayed the vote at barely  hours notice after  Tories threatened to defeat it. Now she will go back to the EU to negotiate, aiming toto the House of Commons for a vote at a later date. Yet the EU has declared we will not renegotiate and ramped up No Deal Brexit planning. And MPs say they wont change their minds. What happens next will decide the future of the nation.  We could crash out in a disastrous no-deal Brexit, force the PM from office, have a general election or even a second referendum. Theresa May might have bought herself some time by delaying the vote, with those doomsday scenarios delayed while MPs watch for her next move. On the other hand, she could also face a putsch earlier that that as Labour or Tory MPs patience runs out. Things are volatile. This is all a guess. So to the best of our abilities, heres whats happening now with Brexit - and our guess of what could happen next. Monday  December: The Labour Party and European Research Groupboth meet to decide their next steps from pm. Tuesday  December: This was the day MPs were supposed to vote on the Brexit deal. Instead Theresa May is travelling to European capitals to try to win some compromises from EU leaders. She will meet Dutch PM Mark Rutte to seek assurances over the controversial backstop - which will trap the UK in EU customs rulestheres no deal for the Irish border. Wednesday  December: The PM s to the UK for Prime Ministers Questions at noon.   Thursday  December: Theresa May travels to the European Council summit in Brussels to try to get  leaders to agree new compromises. But EU chief Donald Tusk has already issued a hardline statement saying: We will not renegotiate the deal, including the backstop. He said only that the EU can discuss how to facilitate UK ratication - in other words - cosmetic tweaks to the political declaration. Friday  December: Theresa May s to the UK just as MPs go back to their constituencies - a time for Tory grassroots anger to be given voice.  What happens next  Theresa May has said shell bring back the deal for a vote in the House of Commons. Shes suggested shell only commit to doing this before January , , so it could be after Christmas. And in fact the House of Commons says she has until March  to actshe wants. Even longerArticle  is extended, giving her a few more months. Even then theres still a huge chance the new deal will be voted down by MPs. Or, alternatively, Labour and Tory MPs will run out of patience and take action before that happens. Either way, the options after that are pretty similar. Here are the main ones on the table.  Theresa May can resign as Tory leader, like David Cameron did after Britain voted Leave in . She seems unlikely to go of her own free will, but she might be forced to quit by the men in grey suits of her Cabinet. This wont force a general election - but it will force a Tory leadership contest. After all the candidates are declared, MPs eliminate one at a time in votes held each Tuesday and Thursday - like a Big Brother eviction. The final two candidates then go to the ,-or-so strong Tory membership for a final vote. Expect a battle between Remainers like Amber Rudd and Brexiteers like Boris Johnson and Esther McVey. Others like Sajid Javid and Jeremy Hunt could try to appeal to both camps, or leavers and Remainers could run on a joint ticket. HOW IT COULD END: A Brexiteer is thought to have the best chances among the Tory grassroots - and could drive the UK off the clf-edge of No Deal. If a Remainer wins, they could bring in a Norway plus option of softer Brexit.  If the Prime Minister refuses to budge, she can still be challenged for the Tory leadership. All it takes is  Conservative MPs to submit no-confidence letters in her to the chairman of the backbench  Committee, Graham Brady. Weve already been close to  for months, so it would only take a handful more to tip over the edge. But Tories have repeatedly cried wolf. We were meant to get to  several times and its still not happened. Whats more, a leadership contest isnt automatic. Evenwe hit , a full race only gets triggered MPs then vote no confidence in the leader. If fewer than  vote her out, she stays in office and cant be challenged in this way for another year. Sir Graham himself played down chances of an immediate vote. He said: Lots of people have predicted the Prime Minister’s downfall - they’ve been wrong when they’ve done so. It’s best to recognise we’re in uncertain times, a very dficult point in British politics, but the Prime Minister has done the right thing. HOW IT COULD END: Many Westminster watchers think its unlikely  MPs will vote her out. So theres a chance Mrs May could soldier on, like Jeremy Corbyn did when his MPs voted no confidence in him in . . Labour bring a no confidence vote - leading to a general election or second referendum  MPs can use Parliament to force a general election in two ways. The first is to vote directly for an early election. But itd need two-thirds of MPs backing to pass. That means more than  Tories would need to vote for an election - thats very, very unlikely. The other option however is for MPs to vote no confidence in Theresa Mays government. This would only need half of MPs backing, so around  or  Tories. If a this motion passes, parties have  days to try to form a new government. That would give Labour a chance to team up with smaller parties. If no combination can win half of MPs backing within  days, a general election is triggered automatically. More than  Labour MPs and peers have called on Jeremy Corbyn to call a no confidence vote in the government this week - and the Lib Dems say they would back Labour in such a vote. But Labour sources worry bringing a no confidence vote too soon would just risk failure. Its a big ask for Tory MPs to vote their government down. Its not thought Labour would bring such a vote before Mrs May has gone to Brussels. HOW IT COULD END: This could trigger the countdown to a full-blown general election - refreshing the parliamentary arithmetic and allowing some kind of deal to pass. Labour Remainers also claim it could be used to force through a second referendum. But Labour arent planning to demand a no confidence motion until after the vote, because they only want to proposeit they know they can win. And Jeremy Corbyns allies insist other options should be exhausted before the prospect of a second referendum is taken up.  If there is a vacuum of power Labour claims it could take control - with or without an election. Jon Trickett, the Shadow Cabinet Office minister, said the very strongly preferred option is to force an election. If thats not possible, he claimed we are ready to form a minority government. But its not clear how this would actually happen. Theres been some suggestion Labour could force a censure motion in the Prime Minister. However, some opinions suggest evenshe resigned, Theresa May would have a duty to stay in office until a replacement is installed through a Tory leadership contest. The Queen can be invited to nominate a leader who can command Parliaments support - but onlya PM resigns on behalf of the government. If Theresa May resigns from her inidual position, its not so clear. HOW IT COULD END: Labour,they manage to take power, would try to renegotiate with the EU. But theyd run into the same dficulties, since Jeremy Corbyn has insisted that under his plan, there certainly wouldn’t be a backstop from which you can’t escape. Deadlock could then lead to a second EU referendum or general election. . MPs try to force a second EU referendum   Fears are growing among No insiders and Cabinet ministers that we will end up with a second referendum. Several Tory ministers have quit to demand a so-called Peoples Vote. There are many paths to such a vote and none of them are certain. But momentum for it is growing. One way would be for Labour to take power and push for one - this is covered above. Another way would beMPs win an effort to direct the government about what happens nextshe loses the vote. In theory they could mount a bid to force the PM into holding a new referendum. HOW IT COULD END: Remain could win, infuriating Brexiteers and in their words, splitting the country - but potentially halting Brexit in the process. On the other hand Leave could win for a second time - meaning were no further along than we are now. Andnone of that works  We leave on  March  with no deal.

More than  MPs,  peers and five MEPs wrote to the Labour leader after Theresa May shelved a crucial vote on her deal with hours to spare. Lib Dem MPs also urged Mr Corbyn to call a no confidence vote and said they would support it. Mr Corbyns team tonight said he will wait until after Mrs May tries to secure more concessions from the EU - because then shell be weaker. But MPs including Chuka Umunna claimed he should launch the move this week. If it fails, they claimed Labour must commit straight away to a second referendum, with an option to remain in the EU.  Signatories to the letter, organised by former shadow cabinet member Ian Murray, include a number of prominent supporters of a so-called peoples vote including Chuka Umunna, Chris Leslie and Owen Smith. Mr Umunna, Mr Leslie and Mr Smith have been among the Labour leaders more prominent critics in the past. With the Government now clearly unable to command a majority in the House of Commons for the Prime Ministers Brexit plan - which is at the heart of the Governments entire agenda - it is imperative to take action this week under the terms of the Fixed-term Parliaments Act to table a vote of no confidence in HM Government, the letter stated. If this fails we must commit to a public vote with an option to stay in the EU straight away. It is imperative that the country clearly knows where our Labour Party stands at this critical moment so now is the time to immediately take steps to move forward to a public vote.  The letter echoes calls from other opposition parties - including the SNP and the Liberal Democrats - for Labour to move a no confidence motion. The Labour leadership however, has been cautious about tabling a confidence motion, warning of the dficulties of forcing a general election under the terms of the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, originally passed by the coalition under David Cameron. A Labour spokesman said: We will put down a motion of no confidence when we judge it most likely to be successful.  It is clear to us that Theresa May will not renegotiate the deal when she goes to Brussels, and will only be asking for reassurances from EU leaders. When she brings the same deal back to the House of Commons without signicant changes, others across the House will be faced with that reality. At that point, she will have decisively and unquestionably lost the confidence of Parliament on the most important issue facing the country, and Parliament will be more likely to bring about the general election our country needs to end this damaging deadlock. How a no confidence vote would work MPs can use Parliament to force a general election in two ways. The first is to vote directly for an early election.

Potential candidates for the leadership have begun setting out their stalls even while the Prime Minister is in office. And after she was forced to pull a Commons vote on her Brexit deal, she is looking more vulnerable than ever. A leadership contest can be forced in two ways - either Mrs May quits, or shes challenged. If she resigns, candidates will put themselves forward. Tory MPs whittle them down one at a time to just two people, in votes each Tuesday and Thursday. Then the final two will go head to head in a vote by the Tories ,-or-so members.  If shes challenged, its a lot harder for a leadership contest to happen. First  Tory MPs must write to the chairman of the backbench  Committee. However, it then takes  voting no confidence in the Prime Minister to trigger a full leadership race. If fewer than  vote no confidence in her, she clings on and cant be challenged for another year. Here are the Tory big beasts whove put themselves in the frame so far. Boris Johnson    The former Foreign Secretary appeared on the Andrew Marr Show on Sunday with a smart new hair cut and refused to rule out challenging the PM. Mr Johnson, who reportedly decided to back Leave on a whim, has become the darling of the Brexiteers. The former London Mayor backs what he calls a “managed no deal”. Asked to give an “absolute, categorical promise” that he would not stand against the PM, Mr Johnson said: “I will give you an absolute, categorical promise that I will continue to advocate what I think is the most sensible plan.” Rees-Mogg preparing to go out round the coutnry and campaign for Boris. Dominic Raab    Don’t be embarassedthe name leaves you scratching your head. Mr Raab was Brexit Secretary for about five minutes but quit over the Prime Minister’s deal. He is very much on the right of the Tory party, called for us to leave the EU years before the referendum. He is understood to have offended Theresa May with a  online article in which he attacked the “equality bandwagon” and said that men were getting “a raw deal” which may have slowed his progress up the ministerial ladder. He is known to order the same lunch every day from sandwich shop Pret a manger. His preferred combo of the chicken Caesar and bacon baguette, SuperFruit pot and Vitamin Volcano smoothie quickly became known as the Raab special. The former Brexit Secretary said there were moments the UK could have “pressed harder” on the backstop. Asked about the leadership on Sunday, he said: “I’ve always said I wouldn’t rule it out” but “it would be very self-indulgent to be engaging in all that speculation when we’ve got such a big issue up for decision on Tuesday”. Michael Gove    Boris Johnson’s partner in crime on the Leave campaign displayed a ruthless streak when he shafted his friend during the last leadership campaign. The Environment Secretary has managed to take one of the government’s less exciting briefs and made a name for himself after banning plastic straws and increasing the price of plastic bags. Mr Gove said on Monday morning it was “extremely unlikely” that he would stand as a future Conservative Party leader which is definitely not ruling out a bid. Sajid Javid    The Home Secretary is understood to have told Cabinet colleagues he is gearing up for a bid. It’s widely expected the next Tory leader will be a Brexiteer mean Mr Javid, who backed Reman but now supports Leave, would have a real fight on his hands to win round Tory members. He took over at the Home Office after Amber Rudd was forced to quit over the Windrush scandal and has since been seen as a safe pair of hands. Mr Javid, the son of Pakistani bus driver, would be the first non-white Prime Minister. Esther McVey    The former Work and Pensions made a clear pitch to take the top job when quizzed on Sunday. She said she would give the prospect of standing as leader “serious concern” and suggested that Brexiteers should unite around a single candidate. The ardent Brexiteer quit the cabinet earlier this month saying that the PM’s deal was a breach of trust with voters and that Mrs May shouldto Brussels to get a better deal. She wants an end to the Irish backstop and is convinced it is unnecessary. She said: “The EU says it doesn’t want it, we don’t want it so why is it there  Remove it.” She became a hate figure for the left because of her role in bringing in the bedroom tax. Another ardent right-winger. Jeremy Hunt    Mr Hunt is seen as a safe pair of hands after showing he could weather controversy as the longest serving Health Secretary in the history of the NHS. As Foreign Secretary he has had success in helping free British academic Matthew Hedges from prison in the United Arab Emirates. But Mr Hunt, who campaigned for Remain but accepted the result of the referendum, may have a hard job trying to win over hardcore Brexiteers in the party. Amber Rudd    Amber Rudd has gone from one tricky department to another. She was forced to quit as Home Secretary during the Windrush scandal. But after eurosceptic Esther McVey quit the government, remain-supporting Ms Rudd ed to government. In an interview at the weekend she criticised male Brexiteers who “flounce out quite a lot” instead of trying to get things done. She has also suggested a plan b for Brexit could see the UK in a Norway plus arrangement. Ms Rudd, who is seen as a leading candidate from the moderate wing of the party, has said she hoped the Tories choose a “centrist” figure for its next leader. Penny Mordaunt    The Royal Navy reservist who is currently the International Development Secretary would appeal to right-wingers with her plans to cut back on sending aid to wealthier countries. Ms Mordaunt took part in a reality TV show splash and showed she had a sense of humour after using the word “cock” six times in a parliamentary debate as a forfeit issued during a dinner in the officers’ mess. The Brexit-supporting minister has been clear that she does not back the Prime Minister’s deal but has stayed loyal to Theresa May. She criticised attempts by Jacob Rees-Mogg and other Tory backbenchers to unseat the Prime Minister, saying: “That was not helpful.”  Odds from Ladbrokes accurate as of December th.

Fin Mc Caul, of Prestwich Pharmacy and Fellow of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society, said: “Headaches can have a considerable impact and I see a spike in the number of people suffering over the festive period. “Often by the time people come to the pharmacy, it’s when they are really suffering. It is important to understand your pain and to know that you can address it early rather than just seeingit will go away or not.   “There are a range of pain relief options available that can reduce headaches, so you can get back to your day. If you are unsure, seek advice from your pharmacist to help you find a good option.” The results found women often take the most strain, with around double the number of females to male sufferers experiencing headache symptoms from online shopping and organising Christmas presents. And the younger generation may suffer more as online shopping causes headache symptoms for approximately twice the number of - year old sufferers compared to the over s. Other headache triggers include a lack of sleep, dehydration and spending time in noisy environments. However, according to the research conducted through OnePoll ,  per cent of Brits opt for a ‘wait and see’ approach when they feel a headache coming, ignoring it in the hope it gets better.   When they do treat a headache, up to three quarters of people are not completely satisfied with how quickly pain relief kicks in or how long it lasts for. The survey also found that headaches not only impact the sufferer in regard to pain but for  per cent of the population can have an impact on their sex le.

Researchers who polled , adults identied the things we wish we’d done dferently – including not learning a second language, holding grudges and worrying too much. Taking le too seriously and saying ‘no’ too often are feature in the top  - with health concerns such as smoking, drinking and not exercising also making it to the list. Commissioned by Lottoland, the research found four in  UK adults carry a regret. Nigel Birrell, CEO of Lottoland, said: “As the end of the year draws closer, many of us will be reflecting on the things we regret. Some may wish they’d taken more chances and invested more money.  “But it’s also important to focus on the achievements and good things we have in our lives – our health, our families and friends, or a promotion at work.” The study also found relationship woes are a common regret - one in  admitted they’d married the wrong person or failed to break off an unhappy relationship sooner. However, one in seven wished they’d had more children and one in  regret not having kids at all. When it comes to professional choices, not asking for a larger salary, choosing the wrong career and working too hard emerged as the top regrets. The average Brit has around seven regrets and they spend around an hour each day thinking about them. But one in  mulls over their bad decisions for up to four hours each day. And there seems to be some truth to the phrase ‘how do you sleep at night’ with one third of Brits admitted their regrets keep them up into the early hours. Fortunately, it’s not all doom and gloom as Brits have much to be proud this year.   More than four in  felt a sense of achievement in making and maintaining great personal relationships with family, friends and loved ones. And a quarter of Brits are happy with the professional decisions they had made and felt they had achieved some of their career goals. Despite many of us feeling regretful for not saving money, the research carried out through OnePoll found one in four are financially comfortable. Given the chance to do things over, a third of the population would have pursued a dferent career path and one in five would have saved more money. Nigel Birrell added: “It’s also never too late to recty these regrets – go on more dates, master that skill, and look to  with excitement and fresh eyes.” *This Christmas, Lottoland is offering its customers the chance to bet on the outcome of the Spanish El Gordo Lottery – one of the longest running lotteries in the world.

The arch was to be flanked by six -ft storeys of rooms and galleries, containing homes, a granary, corn exchange, chapel, tavern, museums, general market, a library, a marine school offices and a stables, reports Bristol Live.

Although shes garnered the publics adoration, a slew of recent reports suggest she is struggling to adapt to some aspects of royal le. Meghan has been plagued with reports about her demanding behaviour over the last few weeks, and royal insiders have allegedly given her a new moniker. According to the Express, its claimed in some quarters that Meghan has been branded Duchess Dficult because shes a challenge to work for. This comes after sources claimed she is up sending emails at am - and her formidable work ethic is something that has tested palace officials.  Among rumours of her demanding behaviour, Meghan reportedly asked for air fresheners to reduce the musty odour in the chapel at her wedding. She was also apparently unhappy when she didnt get her first choice of tiara for the nuptials, an emerald encrusted piece that was denied as the palace werent sure of its origins. Meghan also allegedly fell out with Kate about the way she spoke to her staff, a source told the Sun. The Duchess of Cambridge told Meghan not to berate members of her team after she b*****cked a member of staff, a rumour which the palace denied.Meghan is set to lose close aide Samantha Cohen in the spring, a palace veteran who has served the royals for  years.Samanthas departure departure follows the recent resignation of Meghans personal assistant Melissa Touabti, who lasted six months in the post. A source told the Sunday Times: Sam will be a huge loss. Going forward, Meghan might need someone cut from a slightly dferent cloth to traditional courtiers, who is not a career civil servant or royal insider.

Signing the cards with his name, a heart and two ‘kisses’, the eight-year-old put a stick of chewing gum in each one as a special treat. But he tragically never got the chance to hand them out - after he and his three sisters were killed in a horric arson attack as they slept. The youngster’s charred cards were discovered at his flame-ravaged family home by grieving relatives this summer, months after the blaze. His cousin, Courtney Pearson, said she was left smiling after she opened the scorched red envelopes and strips of “chuddie” fell out. Now, on the one-year anniversary of the devastating attack, the family has allowed the Mirror to publish a picture of the cards for the first time.  The image shows how magical Christmas scenes were destroyed by the raging flames at the mid-terrace home in Salford, Manchester. Santas, Rudolphs and elves can be seen smiling beside blackened marks, while the envelopes Brandon so carefully addressed to “Ellie”, “Jacob” and other classmates lie singed on a kitchen worktop. The boy’s gran has now paid tribute to her “thoughtful” grandson, as she marks the anniversary of the petrol bomb attack on December . Sandra Lever, , says: “We just found the cards in the house after the fire. It was my granddaughter who opened them up. “He had put in a piece of chewing gum for the kids. “He was thoughtful, he was always trying to make people laugh.”   Brandon, described as a “little architect in the making”, died after suffering smoke inhalation and burns in the blaze. His siblings Demi, , Lacie, seven, and Lia, three, also lost their lives. The children’s brave mum, Michelle Pearson - Sandra’s daughter - suffered severe burns and was in a coma for months after the attack. Nearly  months on, she remains in hospital, too sick to leave. “She’s still got the tracheostomy in,” Sandra says. “She’s just up and down really with constant infections. We see her most of the time, we all go to see her at dferent times. “She phones me every day. “She’s been talking about the build-up to the one-year anniversary.” Tomorrow the family plan to “light up” Jackson Street in Walkden - the scene of the murders - with candles for the anniversary.   They have invited strangers to join them for the special event, during which they will hold a minute’s silence to remember the siblings. However, Michelle, , is unable to go - three months after she was forced to miss her children’s funerals for medical reasons. “She’ll still be in hospital, she’s too poorly,” Sandra says. “She said, ‘Take some pictures and show me.’ The mum stays in her hospital room “all the time”, although she is allowed out for balloon releases on her childrens birthdays. “When they do the balloon releases with her, they do let her go in the yard,” Sandra adds. On the night of the blaze, Michelle screamed “Not the kids! Not my kids!” before being overcome by smoke, heat and flames.   After coming out of her coma earlier this year, she was initially shielded from watching the news in case anything on the fire cropped up. “We tended to avoid her watching the news at the beginning,” says Sandra. “She was OK with the funeral. “We don’t really put normal TV on, we’ll put Netflix on.” Michelle, who also sometimes listens to the radio, has only recently been able to accept the loss of her beautul children. “She still gets upset,” Sandra told the Manchester Evening News this week. “Twelve months she’s been in here, but she wasn’t awake for half of it, so she has only just begun the grieving process. “It took a long time for her to get her head around what happened. We’d have to remind her every day because of all the medication.   “She has now accepted it and has started to grieve.” She added that whenever she tells Michelle she “bets she will be glad” when she finally gets home, she replies: “Not without the kids”. Michelles son Kyle, now , and his pal, Bobby Harris, also survived the fire after managing to climb out of a bedroom window. A court heard how courageous Kyle grabbed a hammer and started smashing a living room window in a desperate bid to save his family. He also tried to force open the front door, jurors were told. In May, two men were jailed for le for Demi, Brandon, Lacie and Lias murders. Zak Bolland, , who had been involved in a “petty” feud with Kyle, was handed four le terms and told he must serve at least  years.   David Worrall, , was ordered to serve a minimum of  years. Bolland was also convicted of three counts of attempted murder relating to Michelle, Kyle and Bobby, who was staying at the house at the time. Worrall was found not guilty of three counts of the same charge. A third defendant, Courtney Brierley, , was found not guilty of murdering the children, but convicted of the alternative of manslaughter in each case. She was handed  years in a young offenders’ institution. Sandra, who considers Bolland and Worrall “monsters”, says she still finds it dficult to believe the pair could do something so evil. “The people in the house were so young,” she says. “Why would they do that to a woman with young children ”  She adds that while she would like to say “a lot” to the killers who took away her grandchildren, “I would never consider visiting them.” “They won’t be released,” she says confidently. “They’re not walking about - like my grandkids aren’t.” During the attack, two lit petrol bombs were tossed inside the home at around am, with the second device ‘exploding’ near the stairs. This blocked the only exit to the ground floor and trapped the victims upstairs as flames engulfed the house, Manchester Crown Court heard. Demi, Brandon, Lacie and Lia were laid to rest in September. And although their mum will remain in hospital this Christmas - her second one running - there are plans in place to move her to a rehab facility.   Even then, she will have a long road to recovery ahead of her. “I’m hoping she’ll be home before Christmas next year,” says Sandra. “She mostly has heat burns, she has bandages.” She earlier told the MEN: “She keeps getting chest infections which is because of the tracheostomy and the smoke from the fire. “At the moment she’s doing a few little steps with a hoist, after Christmas she is going to be moving to rehab to try and get her walking again.” In the meantime, loved ones are doing all they can to remember Michelles children - including holding birthday balloon releases and decorating the outside of their home with banners, flowers and candles.  They have invited the community to join them in Jackson Street at .pm tomorrow to remember the four “angels” a year on from the attack. People are encouraged to bring candles to help “light up the street”. “The kids will love what we’re doing,” Sandra says. “We definitely feel their presence. “We’ll keep it going. We want to keep the children happy.” And one thing the gran is certain of is that “angel” Demi will be looking out for her younger siblings, as she did on Earth. “She’s a mother hen,” she says. “She’ll be looking after them up there.” "},{"url":null,"title":"walter mitty conmans holiday snaps","story":"NewsWalter Mitty conmans holiday snaps reveal le of luxury on £, of stolen tripsAdam Grfiths shared photos on Instagram in exotic locations including Singapore and Dubai - usually featuring magnums of Champagne or trendy vodkaShareCommentsByJason Evans:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC NewsAdam Grfiths boasted of his luxury travels on social media\"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA fraudster dubbed a Walter Mitty character by a judge shared photos of his holiday adventures online - paid for using stolen travel agents pass codes.

Baba Vanga has been dubbed the Nostradamus of the Balkans for her predictions, which seem to strike with eerie regularity. Conspiracy theorists have long revered her prophecies on global events and natural disasters - despite her being dead for over two decades. Now it appears she has foretold some le-changing occurrences for the next  months, including an economic collapse in Europe and an assassination attempt on Vladmir Putin. She reportedly believed the threat to Putin will come from inside his own security team - but did not specy whether the head of state will die in the attack. She thinks a mega-tsunami, similar to the  disaster, will strike in Asia while a meteorite will land in Russia.  Not only that, but Donald Trump will fall ill with a mystery illness, leaving him deaf and suffering from brain trauma. Born Vangelia Gushterova, Baba Vanga passed away in  aged  but had already developed a noted reputation in her home country of Bulgaria by the time of her death. The clairvoyant was partially sighted and legend has it that she mysteriously lost her vision after she was caught up in a tornado during childhood.

Her millions of followers believe she had paranormal abilities including telepathy and being able to communicate with aliens. In  she guessed that America will be hit by a terror attack by two steel birds She said: Horror, horror! The American brothers will fall after being attacked by the steel birds. The wolves will be howling in a bush, and innocent blood will be gushing.

It also emerged that she predicted that Vladimir Putin and Russia will dominate the world In , during a meeting with writer Valentin Sidorov, Vanga said: “All will thaw, asice, only one remain untouched - Vladimir’s glory, glory of Russia. Too much it is brought in a victim. Nobody can stop Russia. All will be removed by her from the way and not only will be kept, but also becomes the lord of the world. ” Specialists have since calculated that  per cent of her prophecies had come true - slightly less than the  per cent claimed by her followers.

And she also manages to get her Christmas presents from the local bins. With Christmas around the corner, I’ve got my Secret Santa gts out of the trash, she admitted.

Taking a better look, she found cheese, jam, olives and biscuits - all untouched and still in their packaging. She was shocked to realise all the goodies would go to waste, so decided to scoop them up. And when she took them home to her husband, he couldnt believe how good the quality of the items were.

He has been held in a Tokyo jail since then for questioning, but had not been officially charged until now. Prosecutors also re-arrested Ghosn on Monday for allegedly understating his income for three more years through March .   Nissan, which fired Ghosn as chairman days after his arrest, has said the misconduct was masterminded by the once-celebrated executive with the help of former director Greg Kelly, who was also officially charged for the first time on Monday. Ghosn and Kelly have not made any statement through their lawyers, but Japanese media reported that they have denied the allegations.Calls to Ghosns lawyer, Motonari Otsuru, at his office went unanswered, according to Reuters.After its indictment was announced, Nissan said it took the situation seriously.

Paige Mills, , trains for two hours a day despite countless hours spent on a busy ward where she works as an emergency nurse. The super-fit, from Melbourne, Australia, says men are surprised when they find out she can lt more than them. Paige has worked as a registered nurse for three years since graduating, also working with patients in rehabilitation which has fulfilled her goal of having an impact on other peoples lives. Although she is incredibly busy at work, Paige thrives off the chaos and feels that the constant busyness is what keeps her mind and body stimulated.   Paige first found her love for fitness when she finished her nursing degree which made her feel inactive, making her want to burn off energy in the gym. Now, Paige works out for five or six days a week, for two hours each day. Her dedicated fitness regime is all thanks to Paige not owning a TV aerial at home which means she has plenty more time to work out because she doesnt watch any television. Through nursing, Paige has learnt to appreciate her fitness as she deals with patients who may never even walk again. Even during long periods of consecutive night shts Paige manages to maintain her fitness regime as she can squat kg and deadlt kg. At first I wanted to get a degree for the self-actualisation of doing it, but I decided I wanted to do something where I could have an impact on peoples lives instead, said Paige. Ive also tried out hospitality, driving trucks, being a dancer and a builders labourer, but then I found nursing and I also do some fitness modelling now too.   I studied to be a nurse for three years at university while I also worked as a carer in a nursing home, but Ive now been a registered nurse for three years since.I love the chaos of it being on my feet and doing a million things at once keeps my body and mind stimulated. Having gone from very physically demanding jobs before to then studying and working as a nurse made me feel very sedentary, so I felt like I needed to burn off some energy. Thats when I first found fitness and joined a gym. Now I will work out for two hours a day, five or six days a week. It can be hard to keep up with my routine sometimes when Im transitioning from day shts to night shts and when Im sleep deprived. In nursing we arent allowed to manually lt patients, so the strength isnt as handy as you may think, but back injuries are super common among nurses. I think powerlting has taught me the correct lting techniques, so hopefully Ill never have a work-related back injury. I hear people say they dont have the time to go to the gym, yet they watch two to three hours of television a day. Whereas I dont have a television aerial at home, so I guess theres time for anything you loveyou make it a priority, and training comes first for me of course.   Paige spoke about how she makes sure her diet fuels her busy schedule and ensuring she can recover properly. Patients will often comment on Paiges muscly physique and men are frequently surprised to find out that she can lt more than they can. Before I started lting, I wasnt able to distinguish between a woman with muscle and a woman carrying excess fat. But now I very often get patients commenting on my muscles, said Paige. The reaction I get from men is often saying wow, you can lt more than me. But I think people who have known me forever arent surprised that I ended up being somewhat of a public figure because Ive never been afraid of the limelight. Im a pretty open person.   I eat so much I try to eat a lot of protein and carbohydrates to fuel my workouts. If I dont eat enough, I wont perform well in training, which makes me feel frustrated. I usually eat around  to  calories a day. Nursing has taught me not to take any physical abilities for granted. I dont think people realise that there are people my age who are in stroke wards or in nursing homes and theyll never walk or talk again. You should exercise to celebrate your capacity to do so, and love your body for what it can do, not for how it looks. You can follow Paiges fitness regime by checking out her Instagram, @bikerbiddie.

CCTV spotted the lad, who has been branded the worlds most flexible cheat, as he climbed into the tiny slot where people usual grab the toy that theyve won. But instead of paying  Taiwanese dollars - about p - to have a go, he went inside the machine. He can be seen approaching the neon-lit arcade game outside a shop in in Xinzhuang District, Taiwan at am on Tuesday, December .  He crawled through the tiny opening at the bottom, before reaching up and getting his whole torso inside the glass compartment. The boy then grabbed two of the biggest prizes with his hands and wriggled back out of the machine. After watching back footage of the theft the next day, shop attendant Shi Chengyu said: This thief has such flexible bones.  His skill is very impressive, but we still have to report him to the police. He only needs to pay a small amount to play the game, just  Taiwan dollars. The whole idea is to play and have fun.

At times it was scrappy, Hamilton had a couple of opportunities as well which flew by the post, and shows games at this level are dficult to win but we got the breaks at the right times.“I thought in some of our play you could see a confidence appear when we got the second and third goal, we started to knock the ball about and created opportunities.“First and foremost we just wanted to win the game, it didn’t matter how but to score four goals was fantastic.

We can’t take our foot off the gas and it was disappointing.“Look, I’m sure all the boys have experienced heavy defeats before and it’s not nice but, as the manager’s been saying, it’s about how you react.“The manager’s been brilliant at saying ‘look that’s us drawn a line under it’ and all our focus has been on getting back to winning ways and trying to get some positivity about the place and smiles on the boys faces again.“If we can go and win three or four games in a row then, hopefully, that result will be forgotten about.”And Booth feels the timing of their blip is a positive because there is plenty of time left this season to recty it.Following the game in Greenock today, United face Inverness in the Highlands as they aim to close the six-point gap on Ayr.And Booth insists that is the intention, saying he does not want to go through the turmoil of play-off disappointment again after last term’s relegation with Partick.He added: “They’re hugely important, absolutely massive games, especially with the gap at six points just now, they’re vital games.“We’ve two tough away games in Morton and Inverness coming up but we’ve been playing quite well away from home this season so, hopefully, that can continue and we can keep picking up results and close the gap over the festive period.“No one would really want play-offs but we’ll see what happens. Ayr have, obviously, been flying and they’re doing really well and County are up there as well but we’ve managed to narrow the gap to kind of make it a three-horse race.“We just need to get back on the same kind of run we were on before last Friday night, we’d been playing really well and were getting all the praise.“Hopefully, coming up to Christmas and New Year, we can put another run together and I’m confident we can.”Looking ahead to the game at Cappielow today, Booth is well aware Morton will be hurting, too, and look to recover after last weekend’s - loss to Dunfermline.“It will be a tough game. Their results have been up and down this season, they have some really good results and then, like last Saturday, not so good.“They probably deserved to win the game up at Tannadice earlier in the season, I think we scored a rd-minute equaliser.“It’s going to be a hard game but one we’ve prepared for well this week and go into it confident.“We’re both going into it on the end of two shocking results last weekend so it’s going to be about who reacts best to that.“Hopefully, with the squad we’ve got and how hard we’ve been working, then we’ll be the team that comes out on top.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/12/5c0a9db08ec57.jpg ","title":"lochee united fan alex hands back 500 of jackpot lottery win for new players lounge","story":"Lochee United season ticket holder Alex Marshall has handed back £ of his jackpot club lottery win to help fund a new players’ lounge.Alex received a £, windfall when his number came up and has given some back to be used for the redecorating of a lounge in tribute to a former player.Ian Anderson died in May while on holiday.

With more than two decades of experience in financial institutions across Europe and the USA, he is responsible for helping the bank to meet the innovation challenges it faces.“At Royal Bank of Scotland, we are always coming up with creative ideas and solutions that suit a world that doesn#t pass us by,” he says.“The scale of innovation is huge, we are seeing fundamental changes taking place in the world of financial technology with increasing regularity. It is becoming harder and harder to be truly disruptive. We#re looking for things that can be delivered into the hands of our customers at scale.”Those creative solutions have resulted in customer tools which were once the reserve of the pages of science fiction. Facial recognition is part of the bank’s safety and security log-ins face ID is now used by customers to log in securely to their account via their phones.Cora, a web-based chatbot, is also changing the way people interact with technology and banking. Developed to answer basic customer questions, this year Cora held more than one million conversations with customers to solve their queries.For Dan Salmons, Director of Innovation, Home Buying and Ownership, customers are at the heart of every new development: “Innovation should solve a business problem. If you don#t have a problem, then don#t fix it. I love solving problems to help people see a way through any obstacles. The best things for me are the things which change customers lives, evenit#s something small.”Like many of Royal Bank of Scotland’s technology leaders, he is passionate about coming up with new solutions to solve business issues but remains realistic about the role of innovation.“I like new technology and I like old technology that continues to work, but what I really like is new things that work better than old things. I love coming across a product that fits a hole that I know I#ve got,” he says.Keeping track of expenses for businesses can be a challenge, so Royal Bank found a technology-led solution to help its customers and added new features to its award-winning Receipts and FreeAgent apps to help iniduals and small businesses look after their finances.Other technology related introductions by the bank include placing TechXperts at Royal Bank of Scotland branches to help customers use online and mobile banking launching Esme Loans, a digital lending  that allows small and medium-sized businesses in the UK to quickly get unsecured loans of up to £, and the creation of completely paperless mortgages, a service which only Royal Bank of Scotland offers.While Royal Bank may be consistently pushing boundaries of innovation and service, it is important that customers are comfortable and confident with the technology they are using. That#s why measures like TechXperts, have been introduced, alongside the Secure Banking Promise and the Little Book of Big Scams, produced in partnership with Police Scotland, to help keep customers safe and help people make use of the technology that is available.According to Louise Smith, Head of Digitisation, Personal and Business Banking at Royal Bank of Scotland, this is an exciting time.“It#s a massively exciting time in banking and financial services,” she enthuses. “There are thousands of opportunities appearing each day and the challenge is to decide which ones will bring the most benefit to our customers and society.#Kristen Bennie created Open Experience at Royal Bank of Scotland to help staff across the business work together on exciting new solutions. The creative space based at the bank’s headquarters in Gogarburn in Edinburgh is a hub where design and technology collide to develop new products, services and experiences.She explains: “Some of the most exciting innovation currently taking place is focused on improving connectivity. Technology can have massively powerful benefits when it comes to bringing people closer to their friends and family as well as businesses with their customers.“New technology helps inspire me that everything is possible. The only limits are our imagination. That thought alone is truly exciting.”To learn more about what the bank is doing, click here. vw, px\"  "},{"url":null,"title":"swansea city eye up move for dundee midfielder glen kamara","story":"Swansea City are eyeing up a move for Dundee’s star midfielder Glen Kamara, the Tele can reveal.The English Championship side were linked with a move for the Finnish international last summer, among a host of others.And with the -year-old available to sign on a pre-contract in January as he moves into the final six months of his contract, the Welsh club have stepped up their interest.Manager Graham Potter had a scout in attendance at Dens Park for Dundee’s impressive - victory over Hamilton on Wednesday.And the Swans will be keeping a keen eye on how Kamara fares against Steven Gerrard’s Rangers on Sunday.They are unlikely to be the only ones, however, with the Gers themselves and Old Firm rivals Celtic credited with interest in the summer while Hearts and Hibs are also keen on the former Arsenal man.Meanwhile, Dark Blues boss Jim McIntyre says the loss of centre-back Darren O’Dea is a blow as he prepares his side to take on Rangers on Sunday.The experienced defender has played a big part in Dundee’s recent revival under their new manager but limped off against Accies on Wednesday.And that calf injury is almost certain to keep him out of the weekend clash.Jim said: “Picking up the injury with Darren is a blow because him and Gensyhave done well together but there are other good players here who need to step in and show what they can do.”n Long-serving directer Steve Martin has retired from his position on the board.In a statement, Martin said a need to spend more time with his family and pursue other business interests was behind the decision."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/12/5c0ab2d177bf6.jpg ","title":"tesco staff hand over 370 gifts for kids in dundee and perth","story":"Staff at the Tesco Customer Engagement Centre have been busy collecting for the Help for Kids Christmas toy appeal.This year the company handed over  gts to the charity so that a child in need across Dundee and Perth would have something to open on Christmas Day.Help for Kids manager Stacey Wallace said: “I just want to say thanks to everybody.

With more than two decades of experience in financial institutions across Europe and the USA, he is responsible for helping the bank to meet the innovation challenges it faces.“At Royal Bank of Scotland, we are always coming up with creative ideas and solutions that suit a world that doesn#t pass us by,” he says.“The scale of innovation is huge, we are seeing fundamental changes taking place in the world of financial technology with increasing regularity. It is becoming harder and harder to be truly disruptive. We#re looking for things that can be delivered into the hands of our customers at scale.”Those creative solutions have resulted in customer tools which were once the reserve of the pages of science fiction. Facial recognition is part of the bank’s safety and security log-ins face ID is now used by customers to log in securely to their account via their phones.Cora, a web-based chatbot, is also changing the way people interact with technology and banking. Developed to answer basic customer questions, this year Cora held more than one million conversations with customers to solve their queries.For Dan Salmons, Director of Innovation, Home Buying and Ownership, customers are at the heart of every new development: “Innovation should solve a business problem. If you don#t have a problem, then don#t fix it. I love solving problems to help people see a way through any obstacles. The best things for me are the things which change customers lives, evenit#s something small.”Like many of Royal Bank of Scotland’s technology leaders, he is passionate about coming up with new solutions to solve business issues but remains realistic about the role of innovation.“I like new technology and I like old technology that continues to work, but what I really like is new things that work better than old things. I love coming across a product that fits a hole that I know I#ve got,” he says.Keeping track of expenses for businesses can be a challenge, so Royal Bank found a technology-led solution to help its customers and added new features to its award-winning Receipts and FreeAgent apps to help iniduals and small businesses look after their finances.Other technology related introductions by the bank include placing TechXperts at Royal Bank of Scotland branches to help customers use online and mobile banking launching Esme Loans, a digital lending  that allows small and medium-sized businesses in the UK to quickly get unsecured loans of up to £, and the creation of completely paperless mortgages, a service which only Royal Bank of Scotland offers.While Royal Bank may be consistently pushing boundaries of innovation and service, it is important that customers are comfortable and confident with the technology they are using. That#s why measures like TechXperts, have been introduced, alongside the Secure Banking Promise and the Little Book of Big Scams, produced in partnership with Police Scotland, to help keep customers safe and help people make use of the technology that is available.According to Louise Smith, Head of Digitisation, Personal and Business Banking at Royal Bank of Scotland, this is an exciting time.“It#s a massively exciting time in banking and financial services,” she enthuses. “There are thousands of opportunities appearing each day and the challenge is to decide which ones will bring the most benefit to our customers and society.#Kristen Bennie created Open Experience at Royal Bank of Scotland to help staff across the business work together on exciting new solutions. The creative space based at the bank’s headquarters in Gogarburn in Edinburgh is a hub where design and technology collide to develop new products, services and experiences.She explains: “Some of the most exciting innovation currently taking place is focused on improving connectivity. Technology can have massively powerful benefits when it comes to bringing people closer to their friends and family as well as businesses with their customers.“New technology helps inspire me that everything is possible. The only limits are our imagination. That thought alone is truly exciting.”To learn more about what the bank is doing, click here. vw, px\"  "},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/08/5b7522c881405-140x84.jpg class=attachment-small size-small wp-post-image ","title":"commons vote on brexit deferred says theresa may1","story":"Prime Minister Theresa May has told the House of Commons that Tuesday’s vote on her Brexit deal is being “deferred”.Announcing the decision to delay the vote on the Brexit deal, Mrs May told the Commons thatit had gone ahead as planned, the Government would have been defeated by a signicant margin.“I have listened very carefully to what has been said in this chamber and out of it by Members from all sides,” she said.“From listening to those views it is clear that while there is broad support for key aspects of the deal, on one issue, the Northern Ireland backstop, there remains widespread and deep concern.“As a result,we went ahead tomorrow it would be rejected by a signicant margin.”Mrs May said it was an “inescapable fact” that the Northern Ireland Ireland border would become the external EU border on March .She told the Commons: “The challenge this poses must be met, not with rhetoric, but with real and workable solutions.“Businesses operate across that border, people live their lives crossing and recrossing it every day.“I have been there and spoken to some of those people, they do not want their every-day lives to change as a result of the decision we have taken.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

We have ended up with the worst of all possible outcomes, with England and Wales voting to leave and leaving, Northern Ireland voting to remain and retaining a foothold into the EU and Scotland who voted to remain being completely dragged out against its will.No one should fall for this  choice being desperately spun by this isolated Tory Prime Minister, that seeks to force us to choose between a #bad deal# or a #no deal# at all.Brendan O#Hara MP, Argyll and ButeSir,We expect over  schools to be represented at next year’s Scottish Schools Pipe Band Championships, based on the number of school pupils being taught in programmes run by the Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums Trust .The trust now has projects going in  council areas supporting lessons to over , young people.We are getting a large number of enquiries from schools wanting to come along to the event on March  in Livingston.SSPDT aims to safeguard our wonderful musical traditions and to help young people develop skills for le, learning and work, with a focus on deprived and remote areas, by helping to introduce piping and drumming tuition to state schools on a par with orchestral instruments.We established the championships in  to offer a positive and friendly experience for players who are new to competition, and as a forum for bands at the very top of their game.The trust has resources to support more state schools in Scotland to introduce piping and drumming tuition, and we invite local education authorities, teachers and parents to contact us.All enquiries can be made via our website sspdt.org.ukAlexandra Duncan, chief executive, Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums TrustSir,Having campaigned extensively for the re-opening of the A after a landslide in October, I welcome Cabinet Secretary Michael Matheson’s commitment to identying a permanent solution to disruption on the road, whilst continuing to invest in shorter term mitigation measures.Closures to the A lead to untenable ersions and re-routing of traffic onto other roads, which is why is absolutely essential for permanent measures to be put in place to end these closures.The safety of the people who use this road has always been the top priority for the Scottish Government, and I am grateful to all those who have been involved in working towards a practical solution to make this road accessible for local people, visitors and businesses in my constituency.Michael Russell MSP, Argyll and ButeSir,The withdrawal agreement with the European Union has now been published.Our industry has consistently called for clarity over what that UK’s new relationship with the EU will look like in practice, particularly on the continued protection of geographical indications, customs procedures and future trade policy.The provisions set out in the withdrawal agreement provide us with a credible foundation on which to build in the next phase of the negotiations, during which a number of critical issues remain to be resolved.A no-deal Brexit would cause the Scotch whisky industry considerable dficulties and would force cost and complexity into production, distribution and exporting.  The withdrawal agreement is a compromise, but it is a positive step towards much needed business certainty.Karen Betts, chief executive, Scotch Whisky AssociationSir,I am struck by the comments of Theresa May that her Brexit plan will stop EU migrants #jumping the queue# when it comes to working in the UK.How low the UK has sunk that its Brexiteer government is now resorting to spreading resentment towards European citizens, classing them as #queue jumpers#. These iniduals took no part in this mess and work here legally and contribute to the country in so many dferent ways.They have the same general right of freedom of movement that allows British people the opportunity to work in Berlin and Paris, or retire in Spain.Even so, their reward seems to be an increasingly hostile atmosphere. Ms May makes no mention of those British #queue jumpers# in other EU countries, symptomatic no doubt of the same attitude that classes those Brits abroad as #expats#, while those from the other EU countries who come to work here are #immigrants#, an increasingly negative term.Since the referendum in  there has been an alarming increase in both veiled and more explicit verbal abuse to EU nationals, and this will no doubt increase as the negative impacts of Brexit become clearer and scapegoats will be required. Step forward those innocent EU nationals in our midst.The UK has taken a wrong turn, as exhibited by the dog-whistle politics of Theresa May and her Tory government.As the UK enters full panic mode, the victim of a bitter and corrupted Etonian gamble gone very wrong, we must do all that we can to support those EU nationals in our midst and defy this vile populist rhetoric.Alex Orr,  Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"tarbert golfers go home with trophies","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Subscribe NowTarbert golfers gathered at the Tarbert Hotel on Saturday November  for their annual dinner and presentation of prizes, where all those in attendance were treated to a superb meal.Captain Chris Smyth, assisted by Eric McDougall, took charge of the presentation with Chris thanking Sheena Ferguson for her superb organising of the event while paying tribute to Steven Barclay and Gordon McCaffery who sadly passed away during the season.Gents Club Champion John MacNab congratulated all the trophy winners and thanked the members for their support during the year."},{"url":null,"title":"luke naisby named red stars new manager","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Subscribe NowAccomplished defender Luke Naisby is Lochgilphead Red Star AFC#s new manager.The new manager#s first challenge was to take charge of Red Star against Ferguslie Star AFC on Saturday November  in Paisley.The Red Star Facebook page said: #The committee is delighted to welcome him to his new role with the club.

No wonder he looked nervous.The boys got to grips with the dferent handling characteristics of Willie Senior#s car and started to up the pace in the afternoon bringing the car home in a respectable th overall and third in class three. This result was enough to secure second position in the overall championship in class.Jamie Miller continued the learning process with the little Citroen C-RMax with Ian McCulloch pointing him in the right direction. A very neat rally from Jamie with very few mistakes saw him finish a creditable th overall and second in class two, only beaten by the Scottish Tarmac Champion for  Michael Harbour in his similar Citroen, who was only one place above him after seven stages.Innes Mochrie was once again out on the stages in the Mightyand this time he had someone whom he might listen to in the co-driver#s seat. His daughter, Kirsty, had elected to fill the silly seat for this event and they, after a few first stage detours, managed to keep speaking right to the end and brought the class one pocket rocket home in th overall and a brilliant second in class. The mind boggles as to what the result could have been , as Kirsty was heard to remark, she had #someone who would listen to her#.Jonothan MacDonald and Chris Wareham were out in the beautully prepared Mull of Kintyre Cheese sponsored Peugeot . Their pace was good enough for th overall and fourth in class three.Mull pair Malcolm MacDougall and Stuart MacLean were out in the class one Vauxhall Nova and were getting visibly quicker as the day went on, a trend that had repeated itself over the course of the year with confidence and technique increasing with every stage mile covered. They finished th overall and a commendable fourth in class one.There were three Argyll co-drivers directing their pilots around the airfield. Ian Parker, recently announced as one of seven # and the only Scot # co-drivers to be selected to join the MSA Academy for , was back in the Honda Civic of Fraser Smith. The Civic screamed its way round the stages with minimal fuss, other than perhaps a lucky trip on two wheels after clipping a tyre, to finish in nd overall and fourth in class two.The final Argyll man out was Eoghan Anderson from Cairnbaan who was shouting left and right for Greg Inglis of Montrose in his quick and agile Lotus Exige. Eoghan had been co-driver for Alan Kirkaldy in the earlier Granite Stages Rally, also held at Leuchars, and they had been first overall that day, so no pressure there, then.Greg found the Lotus was almost perfect for the stages on the day with a great balance of handling, braking and pace when needed. They were surprised, perhaps unjustly, to find out they were sitting well up the leader board after the first few stages. They got the hammer down over the last three and were to finish fth overall and first in class three.They were beaten only by the Kirkaldy brothers, both in Escort MkII#s of the highest calibre, and two WRC cars driven by Brian Watson and Reay Mackay.Last but not least, Oban#s Angus MacNeil was out with Sam MacFadyen in Brian Watson#s Mitsubishi Evo  binging it home unscathed in th overall.The event was won by Alan Kirkaldy in a freshly built Escort MkII, followed by his circuit racer brother Andrew in secondand Reay Mackay taking the last podium place in his WRC Fiesta. This was a fitting finish to the Championship at Leuchars with very fast stages and a good test of manand machine in equal measures.Photographs by West Coast Photos."},{"url":null,"title":"speedy kirsty points the way ahead for dad","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Subscribe NowAt the age of , Kirsty Mochrie made her first outing as navigator for Innes Mochrie at the  Kingdom Stages rally.Seasoned campaigner Innes, who happens to be Kirsty#s dad, was well guided around the course in their Kilmory Coachworks .Kirsty#s gran Libby told the Advertiser: #She just loved it.

The buildings on the main street and the front street just look sad.The front green for years has waited and unfortunately it still waits#this time for the council to clear away debris after a storm.Come on # the place looks bad enough. Clear it up as it happens or do something in the development plan to make sure it doesn’t in the future.Name and address supplied.What do you think about Lochgilphead and its future  Contact the Advertiser on editor@argyllshireadvertiser or message us directly via Facebook. Alternatively write to: Argyllshire Advertiser,  Argyll Street, Lochgilphead, Argyll, PA NBSir,As reported in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser, Christmas came early for local causes in Argyll recently when the Co-op revealed a £, festive funding boost.The money was shared by three organisations, all of whom are making a real dference to communities throughout the region. These are Argyll and Bute Youth Forum, Heart of Argyll Wildle Organisation and Lochgilphead Phoenix Project, which wants to build an information point on the front green in Lochgilphead.This is the latest round of payouts from the fund generated by more than  , Co-op members in Argyll and Bute and means the Co-op has invested £, in nine groups in Argyll since the membership scheme launched in September .Co-op members, who receive a five per cent reward for themselves with a further one per cent going to local causes when they buy own-brand products, have a say in how the money is allocated, and are encouraged to select the organisations they wish to support online.Since the launch of the local community fund Co-op members have helped , organisations make a positive dference in their neighbourhoods and in the last  months alone £m has been invested in local causes.The fund is now supporting a wide iety of local organisations, from village halls and support groups to education providers and neighbourhood watch schemes, all of which are helping to make Argyll a better, happier, and healthier place to live.Rebecca Birkbeck, Co-op director of community engagement.Sir,I was pleased to attend the latest Argyll Islands Strategic Group meeting in Kilmory recently.I was able to speak to Scottish Government and Argyll and Bute Council representatives about the challenges facing our island communities.While we on the islands of Islay, Jura, Colonsay and Gigha are rightfully enjoying strong local economic growth, future growth will be stled by poor local infrastructure, at times unreliable ferry links and the never-ending troubles with the A.Regardless of what political stripe the leadership of the Scottish and UK parliaments have, all should be united in getting our vital links to the mainland and wider the UK economy back up to scratch.Without large scale investment from central government to fix Argyll and Bute#s roads and Transport Scotland#s trunk roads, our future prosperity is at risk and, as ever, it will be islanders that suffer the most.While political bun fights in the local press letters pages are entertaining,  what we really need is action from our MSPs and MPs.If we were talking about road and transport links between Scotland#s cities, it is highly likely these problems would already be fixed. The Scottish Government must in the future not be so urban-centric in its allocation of resources.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward.Sir,I write following the release of the latest figures on alcohol use by the Office for National Statistics .The more you drink, the greater the long-term risk to your health and these ONS figures show a worrying increase in the number of alcohol-specic deaths in the UK, particularly amongst women and  to -year olds.From time to time, we are contacted by the families of people who have died as a result of alcohol and are only too aware of the heartbreak and utter sense of helplessness people feel when trying to lead someone to seek help for alcohol misuse.We must all do more to address the stigma that people feel in reaching out for support. For many of us, there are simple and effective ways for people to cut back on alcohol.Taking more drink-free days each week for example can reduce the overall amount of alcohol you drink and reduce the risk of developing serious illnesses. The Drinkaware website also provides information and resources for people concerned about their drinking or that of someone close to them and our DrinkChat online advisors can direct people, in complete confidence, to local treatment agencies.Elaine Hindal, Drinkaware chief executive."},{"url":null,"title":"lochgilphead opens up for christmas","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Subscribe NowShop locally or risk losing our distinctive shops.

That kind of team confidence comes from having the care and understanding of first class management.The staging was deceptively simple and the backstage staff produced a delightful cart and car for Mr Toad, plus his horse, and the costumes were not elaborate while most effective.All were well-rehearsed, and the singing was clearly the result of very careful expert teaching. It was a great pleasure to see how some of the young voices have been developing since their last appearance in #The Wizard of Oz#.We would have liked a couple of the characters to project spoken parts more audibly but overall the clarity of words should be complimented.The energy of Mr Toad himself carried all before him, just as it is written in the script and the original Wind in the Willows.No inidual names are here mentioned, quite deliberately, as the outstanding impression of this show was the seamless blending of the entire team involved, with each and every participant a star in their own right."},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13471434.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_emp_ayp_080918AyrCurrie_09JPG.jpg","title":"ayr rugby club near move","story":"NewsAyr Rugby Club near move to new town centre base at Dam Park as they prepare to sell Millbrae homeThe Millbrae men, who top the Tennents Premiership, are in advanced talks to sell their Millbrae home and move to Dam Park in Ayr town centre.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  OCT NewsDam Park could play host to Ayr Rugby Club as soon as  \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailBooming Ayr Rugby Club are nearing a deal to sell their Millbrae home and move to the town centre. Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"ayrshire swimmer 67 proves age","story":"NewsAyrshire swimmer, , proves age is no barrier after scooping medal on debutHe finished the ‘swimming marathon’ at Tollcross in Glasgow in a very impressive .:.ShareByGary Fanning:,  DEC NewsDundonald swimmer Sandy Mavor \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailSwimmer Sandy Mavor proved age is no barrier as he claimed a bronze medal on his competitive debut at the Scottish National Masters m Championships. The -year-old finished the ‘swimming marathon’ at Tollcross in Glasgow in a very impressive .:. Sandy trains with the Masters squad at North Ayrshire Swimming at the Portal in Irvine after taking up the sport again when he retired seven years ago. “I swam at school a long time ago,” he explained. “I did the Loch Lomond  mile swim, and the Cumbrae to Largs in August, so I thought I’d try a pool swim. “The coaches here were brilliant here when I arrived. They couldn’t have been more welcoming and helpful - especially for refining my e off the starter blocks! “I think Masters is not quite so competitive so you can just go along and enjoy it. It’s good exercise and you get a good community and it keeps you fit and ticking over.” His first pool race didn’t go entirely to plan, it seems. “I got this racing ‘bullet cap’ and they told me to put another one underneath to stop it coming off, but it didn’t seem to work,” he laughs.  “I don’t know at what point I lost it but apparently I was in the lead for the first eight laps so maybe that was when it happened  I managed to retrieve it from the bottom of the pool at the end of the race, though, and I was very proud to be wearing the North Ayrshire cap.” Sandy’s success shows that swimming is a sport for all ages, with the benefits increasing as we get older as an ideal form of resistance training which is also kind to the joints. “It’s never too late,” said Sandy from Dundonald. “I speak to a lot of people who’ve never done crawl and they say ‘I could never do that’ but I’ve heard of beginners starting really quite late on in le. Initially they can’t swim onebut before they know it they’re swimming a mile. Once they’ve cracked the mental barrier they’re away.” Masters swimming is increasing in popularity, according to North Ayrshire’s head coach, Jess Wilkie. “It’s good for all ages to come down and meet new people and learn new skills, which you can’t beat,” she says. “We like to keep it ied and try and do a bit of everything to suit everyone from distance swimmers to those who want to come in and do a bit of technique work. “What we always say is that there’s a lane for everyone – it doesn’t matter what speed you swim, you can still participate. “I think the oldest swimmer we have is in her s and she’s still firing up and down the pool and matching younger guys.” “There are plenty of sessions to choose from whether you’re a morning person or prefer to exercise in the evenings.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13713656.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_CP43067514.jpg","title":"ayr united players pose inbetweeners","story":"NewsAyr United players pose as Inbetweeners stars on hilarious Christmas party nightHigh flying Ayr United hit the town with some of their squad bearing a resemblance to the cast of the Inbetweeners.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC NewsAyr playersJames Hilton, Liam Smith, Daniel Harvie and Michael Rose\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailTheyre flying high in the Scottish Championship.

She has changed the dynamic of the school.Peggy will live with Caroline, but will be in school full-time.Having settled into her new home at Priorsford Primary this week, Peggy is already the most popular pupil in school.Despite skipping five primary year-groups to join the P class, Peggy is at the very start of her journey to becoming a certied school dog.ldquoShe has settled in well and has already met the pupils at assemblies. My daughter is a vet and told me to expose her to everything straight away. The time between eight and  weeks is really important for stamping the personality and the secureness of the puppy, added Caroline.Peggy is learning how to become a listening dog, who will help children read aloud more confidently. She will put her head in their lap and listen without judgement, prompting them to turn a page with her paw.Caroline explained: ldquoNot only will she improve the pupilrsquos literacy skills, Peggy will be there for any children who are feeling anxious or worried, they can take some time out to talk to her.I joined the P class in the library as they read the tale of Greyfriars Bobby to Peggy.

But a vision of an angry mob in blue chasing me through the playground fills me with fear and I decide she is exactly where she should be.It is said that dog is a manrsquos best friend.

That science has or will find solutions to all our manmade problems. The issue with this approach has always been that, experiments carried out in controlled environments like laboratories and then replicated in nature have always been unexpected and sometimes catastrophic.These scientic methods involved limited assessments and tests and mainly conducted for profit by big pharma!Having covered Making Scotland GMOFree in my previous column I will focus on our next vision, which is to make Scotland a  per cent organic country.The green revolution introduced in the s, sprayed fertilisers and pesticides on farm land all over the planet to increase crop yields. This in turn led to many forests being cut down to grow what was then called lsquocash cropsrsquo and small-scale farming was replaced by industrial farming on a massive scale supported by government subsidies.Big corporations acquired land across the globe, food was added as a commodity to be traded for profits on the stock market and this in turn has led to inequalities in health and access to food especially in developing and third world countries.The unforeseen impact of chemicals for growing over the last few decades, has led to the fall of nutrients in the soil, as this was being depleted by over use and irregular crop rotation. Profits were maximised and are even today. For example, soya beans are now grown in many countries as cattle feed for the West! This then leaves no arable land for the local population to grow food leading to widespread hunger and impoverished conditions.We need to go back to our roots and grow food at local levels on a small scale and bring back farming as a lucrative job for people to invest their time and energies. This will be a sustainable long-term approach and remove the need for farming subsidies that are the biggest scandal of our times as most go to big landowners in this country. Can you imagine governments are currently paying farmers in some cases not to grow Organic farming will not only bring back the health of the soil but also stop corporations making money through selling chemicals and hybrid seeds. This will have a positive impact on the lives of all people as lsquoorganic produce will no longer be the domain of the rich and middle class who can afford to feed themselves and their children with good food. This choice should be available to all.So! Whatrsquos happening globally where organic farming is concerned  Denmark is on its way to becoming the worldrsquos first  per cent organic country, followed by Bhutan and Estonia. India has the North-eastern state of Sikkim designated as the first fully organic state anywhere in the world and was awarded the UN lsquoOscar for the Best Policy that is inclusive and comprehensive of all socioeconomic aspects.Can Scotland be  per cent organic  Yes! It can."},{"url":null,"title":"borders-factory-announces-50-redundancies","story":"ONE of the regions major manufacturers has announced that it is looking to pay off more than  members of staff.Jedburgh-based Mainetti UK is looking for voluntary redundancies following a second year of reported losses.Bosses at the Oxnam Road coat-hanger manufacturer are blaming recycling and a reduction in high street retailers as well as an increase in the minimum wage for combined losses over the past  months of more than pound million.Mainettis Regional MD Jim Hutchison stated: \"The last two years have been dficult for the business.\"In  Mainetti UK Limited made a loss of pound, and this year we are forecast to lose a further pound,.\"The business is faced with an ever increasing cost base with increases in the National Minimum Wage, higher electricity costs and higher business rates.\"To add to these cost pressures the business is seeing local UK demand for hangers reducing.\"Many retailers are closing down shops or reducing their selling space and this means there are less hangers required.\"In addition, an increased emphasis on recycling means more hangers are being ed from stores for resorting, which further reduces manufacturing demand.\"Mainetti UK currently employs around  staff.Talks have already started with unions over the planned  redundancies.Mr Hutchison added: \"These changes will only impact the Jedburgh hanger manufacturing unit.\"All other products made in Jedburgh ndash flower buckets, polythene bags, Glastic and The Seatcase will not be impacted and in fact the company will continue to invest in all these areas during , in order to grow those parts of our Jedburgh manufacturing business.\"Local MP John Lamont has been in talks with the company over the past few days.He told us: ldquoThis is disappointing news from a long standing employer in Jedburgh.ldquoClearly their market is changing and Mainetti are having to adapt to that.

Hall would certainly have restored the Christmas spirit.Since  the Right Angle Theatre Company has been making sure theres enough feel-good-factor in the town to last throughout the festive season and beyond with the staging of an annual pantomime.And this years crackpot carry-on will certainly be regarded as one of the best yet.Sleeping Beauty was brought bang up to date with mobile phones, spell-checkers, defibrillators and Brexit.Andthe bellows of laughter coming from the audience was anything to go by, it certainly hit the mark.Leading lights Amy Thomson and Stuart Mitchell bring professional acting ability and wonderful singing voices to the stage.Their performances made sure the story unfolded with some resemblance of order, while their magnicent duet of Keanes Somewhere Only We Know could have stopped romantics the world over in their tracks.But, as with the very best pantos, the crazy characters always steal the show.Jodie Miller was a natural in the dragged-up dame role of Nurse Hettie Harpic.Armed with one-liners, put-downs and a riotous wardrobe, the local hair-dresser was a blast.And equally appealing throughout the entire three-hour show was mad-cap palace handyman Muddles, played by Billy Rooney.If Zippy, George and Bungle are ever planning to bring back Rainbow, in the Hawick actor they have a ready-replacement for Geoffrey.Antony Wilson and Katie Gordon are natural entertainers and their pairing of Fetch and Carrie provided some of the funniest moments of the entire show - their Burnham on Sea microwave joke was worth the admission fee alone.These four crazy characters swayed towards slapstick, flirted with farce and brought down the house with a bombardment of belly-laughs.Despite all the fun and frivolity, though, Sleeping Beauty was still a sensational piece of stage theatre.Julia Noble and Steve Hartley-Oliver were authoritative and appealing as Queen Marigold and King Cactus.And the regular arrival of sinister Witch Hazel, played by both Tracey Borthwick and Julie Smith, in a cloud of customary green smoke made sure the young audience were kept on their toes.The couplet duels between the villainous Witch and Fairy Lilac, played exquisitely by Amanda Blacklock, were both clever and entertaining.Couplets aside, music was at the heart of Sleeping Beauty, from the opening Lazy Hazy Crazy Days of Summer all the way through the seasonal finale, and many of the most memorable numbers came from Fairy Lilac and her supporting coloured fairies of Shannon Mack, Ruby Everett, Caitlin Green and Katie Wilson.From You Can Do Magic and Dream a Little Dream of Me to the luscious Hushabye Mountain, Amanda and her young apprentices were wonderful.A beautul rendition of Born with a Smile on My Face was the highlight of Aimee Richardsons all-to-short appearance as Young Rose.And the childrens fun-filled version of Wake Up You Sleepy Head was also among the many highlights of a fantastic night of musical theatre.The songs came thick and fast - as did the jokes.Hawick, Melrose and Tweedbank were ridiculed regularly, as were Theresa May, the Ladhope Vale one-way system and the residents of Abbotsford Court.The laughs were loud and the cheers, especially when Braw Lad and Braw Lass Greg Kelly and Kimberley OMay turned up for Roses Christening, were even louder.The choreography was both imaginative and eye-catching with dancers Emma Wilson, Jess Thomson, Rachel Falconer and Sara Facchini having obviously put in the rehearsal hours.The score was foot-tappingly good, the scene changes were swt and the stage was picture perfect.But ultimately its the actors, dancers and singers who take a production to new heights.And when the cast is enjoying themselves as much as the audience, the people behind the Right Angle Theatre Company can go to sleep this Christmas with a smile on their faces.CASTFairy Lilac: Amanda BlacklockWitch Hazel: Julie Smith Tracey BorthwickMuddles: Billy RooneyKing Cactus:

ldquocourteous, respectful and mature thing to do.Mr Bercow intervened following Mrs Mayrsquos statement to criticise Number  for leaking their plans in advance of telling the House, saying the vote was being delayed at ldquoan inordinately late stage.He added: ldquoHalting the debate after no fewer than  colleagues have taken the trouble to contribute will be thought by many members of this

range of partners and potential funders are actively engaged in the effort to bring the project to fruition.#While our interest is focused on the sailing and powerboating aspects, we fully understand the benefits of working with other water based sports to create a community asset, within which we create synergies, economies and share skill sets.#It is a model that is worthy of replicating where and one which closely aligns with general development in community sport across Scotland.#We firmly believe the new Kintyre Seasports facility will create a hub within the community of Campbeltown where all members of the community can learn, practice, train and enjoy an active engagement in the sea.#Such opportunities are known to provide a tangible connection to improvements in health, social cohesion through volunteering and introduce many, particularly young people, to their first structured employment as instructors within their chosen water sport.#We are clear that developing grass roots opportunities within sailing and powerboating as well as other sports, provides young people with positive habits and skills that last a letime and iniably enhance employability.#We find the club environment is also an excellent place for the development of interpersonal skills, intergenerational relationships and to experience positive role models from many walks of le.#Families enjoy a place which is safe for children and supports the active participation of parents in sport, sustaining lelong participation and encouraging family cohesion through sharing of activity.#The uniqueness of sailing is that there are no barriers to participation.#Those aged from eight-years-old to , with disability or able bodied, LGBT or otherwise can share the same activity, learn and compete on an equal basis with minimal adjustments and are bonded by their love of boating.#There is every reason to expect that the Kintyre Seasports Project will be a shining example of inclusion.#The full potential of the project lies in the wider connections across the communities of interest the facility will serve.#Campbeltown sits on one of the most ied and interesting stretches of water in Scotland having benefits of both the shelter for Campbeltown Loch and immediate access to wider open sea in the Kilbrannan Sound and the Irish Sea.#In addition to becoming a hub of community activity, it is entirely conceivable that future events in dinghy racing, sea kayaking, coastal rowing and yacht racing will find a regular home in Campbeltown, facilitated by the skills and resources of the Kintyre Seasports Project.#RYA Scotland is excited by the prospects of the Kintyre Seasports Project and remains committed to supporting its development for the future.#We commend the efforts of all

However, when the fall of communism led to the break-up of Yugoslavia, war came to Bosnia in , driven in part by Serbiarsquos desire to create a lsquoGreater Serbiarsquo, including large parts of Bosnia, from which they planned to remove Croats and Muslims in what became known as lsquoethnic cleansingrsquo.Our delegation leader Resad Trbonja was , living in Sarajevo. On April , , he woke to find his city under siege, surrounded by Serbian artillery and snipers on the mountains overlooking the city. The siege would last four years, the longest in modern warfare, longer than Stalingrad. An average of  mortars landed in the city every day, , on the worst day.Resad, who lived through, and fought in, the siege, explained that Sarajevo regressed two centuries overnight ndash no water, no electricity, no phones. The Serbian army allowed minimal UN aid into the city sporadically but nothing .The survival of the siege is a story of human courage, spirit and defiance.Our first visit was to the remnants of a tunnel, dug under Sarajevo airport to reach Bosnian-held territory on the other side. This tiny tunnel was the only way in or out for four years.Through this tunnel extra aid came, for example from Edinburgh Direct Aid, who drove lorries of supplies from Edinburgh to help Sarajevans. My own predecessor, John Home Robertson, then MPfor East Lothian, spent several Parliamentary recesses as a volunteer lorry driver. It was dangerous work and one of his colleagues died on the notorious road known as lsquoSnipers Alleyrsquo.Perhaps the most affecting visit in Sarajevo was to the War Childhood Museum, where those who grew up in the siege display the things they kept to remind them of what it was like, and tell their story.A homemade cardboard knightrsquos breastplate made by a brother who later died a cuddly toy from a UN delivery, cuddled threadbare because it was the only toy a homemade lsquounormrsquo for a childrenrsquos choir which rehearsed and performed in defiance of bombs and bullets the remains of a playpark lsquojungle gymrsquo kept to remember the day a mortar tore it apart and killed your friend ndash no one who visits this museum will forget it.That is true too of Srebrenica. This was supposedly a lsquosafe havenrsquo protected by UN troops. Yet on July , Serbian paramilitary units overran it. Thousands of Bosnian Muslims sought refuge in the UN base at a disused factory.When we visited the museum now sited there, survivor Hasan Hasanovic explained to us how UN soldiers stood by as women and children were herded onto buses and deported, while their men were separated and removed in lorries. They were systematically murdered nearby. Thousands more who tried to escape through the forest were hunted down, shepherded into a meadow, and shot. In all, , Bosnian Muslim men and boys were slaughtered at Srebrenica.Finally, the international community acted. In a matter of days, air strikes lted the siege of Sarajevo, drove Serbian paramilitaries out of much of the territory they had occupied, and forced agreement to a peace deal signed in Dayton, Ohio.Srebrenica was not the only genocide in this war, but it is emblematic because it happened under the noses of the UN and because of the bravery of the Mothers of Srebrenica, who ed home to find out what happened to their husbands and sons, refused to be silenced, and demanded justice.This led to the International Commission on Missing Persons and the forensic anthropology unit in Tuzla, where we saw the incredible work done to identy remains using DNA. More than , victims of genocide have now been identied, allowing their families to grieve and to bury them at the final stop of our visit.We arrive at the cemetery at Potaceri, outside Srebrenica, as the sun sets. On the hillside, , stark white tombstones bring home the enormity of what was done over only a few days a mere  years or so ago.More than , died at Srebrenica , perished in Sarajevo , women suffered rape as an act of war millions fled their homes, some even finding their way to the refugee reception centre at Cheylesmore Lodge in North Berwick.All the survivors I met asked the same question: why did so much suffering have to happen before the international community acted to stop it  In telling us their story, they relived their own pain. They did so in the hope that we learn the lessons of Bosnia. We need only look at Syria or Yemen to know that we have not.That is why we must remember Srebrenica.If any local groups would like to hear more about the work of Remembering Srebrenica, please contact my office on  ."},{"url":null,"title":"the-best-fortnite-gifts-for-christmas-2018","story":"Fortnite is the most popular video game of the year and has taken over not just everyonersquos console, but Christmas lists up and down the country too.If you have family members, big or small, who are mad for Fortnite but find yourself utterly clueless as to what itrsquos all about or what to get someone who loves it for Christmas, we can help out with this guide to everything Fortnite from the game itself to presents you should buy this year.*On some occasions, we earn revenue from content.

But this is surely a societal and technological change rather than the fault of any one broadcaster.And thatrsquos why I think recent criticism over the Christmas Day listings is so unfair.The BBC schedule, in particular, was met with hoots of derision on social media, with memes quickly doing the rounds suggesting BBCrsquos Christmas Day line-up, which includes a Strictly Come Dancing special, Call the Midwe, EastEnders and Mrs Brownrsquos Boys, was actually a clever spoof produced to advertise Netflix. writer Michael Hogan moaned that viewers would find their stockings ldquoworryingly empty on Christmas Day, laying into the BBC for failing to find room for Doctor Who, a big period drama or a much-loved detective on its December  schedule. To be fair, all of these will be appear between Christmas and New Year.Most disappointing of all, Hogan wailed on, is the lack of a crowd-pleasing comedy to unite the generations, reeling off the likes of Morecambe and Wise, One Foot in the Grave, Men Behaving Badly and the Vicar of Dibley as examples. Itrsquos funny, recall all of these being Marmite shows, loved and loathed in equal measure, but there you go.To be fair to the BBC, a line-up that contains Strictly, Call the Midwe, EastEnders and Mrs Brownrsquos Boys wonrsquot be to everyonersquos taste, but in its own way it does reflect modern Britain. I also reckon it will please the target audience.I donrsquot particularly want to watch Danny Dyer yelling ldquoIrsquom not lsquoaving it in my pub on Christmas night, but then I wasnrsquot interested in Den serving Angie those orce papers in the festive episode of EastEnders watched back in  by more than  million people, either.No single programme would or could attract that number of viewers these days, but since millions still watch soaps, a Christmas Day visit to the Queen Vic or the Rovers Return is surely a welcome and expected part of the schedule for many.Taste, then, as well as tradition, will always play a part. My beloved grandmother always watched The Queenrsquos broadcast to the nation, while I never missed the Top of the Pops Christmas Special that preceded it.Regardless of this, however, I think the BBCrsquos critics are missing the point completely. Put simply, times change.During what we now seem to look back upon as the golden age of Christmas TV, the s, s and even s, the period we seem to get so nostalgic about, my aforementioned grandmother was regretting the loss of the Christmas Day evenings of her youth, in the s, s and , which had been spent around the piano singing Christmas songs.She seemed sad that people didnrsquot come together as a family to listen to the ldquowireless any more, or play games like charades. One change she always embraced and relished in the s, however, was the fact that Christmas Day was a public holiday at all. When she was young this wasnrsquot the case in Scotland unlike in England, many factories, shipyards, shops and offices would stay open on December , a practice that went back to the Reformation.Technology may have made our modern Christmas Day more fractured, even a bit less social, but at least we get to spend it in a togetherness of sorts. Indeed, the very smartphones and tablets we decry for being antisocial allow us to communicate with loved ones overseas in a way we could never have dreamed of even a few years ago.So, letrsquos not be too harsh on the Beeb over the lack of Christmas TV crackers. Especially since the channel is also gting us more than  box-sets.

But this is surely a societal and technological change rather than the fault of any one broadcaster.And thatrsquos why I think recent criticism over the Christmas Day listings is so unfair.The BBC schedule, in particular, was met with hoots of derision on social media, with memes quickly doing the rounds suggesting BBCrsquos Christmas Day line-up, which includes a Strictly Come Dancing special, Call the Midwe, EastEnders and Mrs Brownrsquos Boys, was actually a clever spoof produced to advertise Netflix. writer Michael Hogan moaned that viewers would find their stockings ldquoworryingly empty on Christmas Day, laying into the BBC for failing to find room for Doctor Who, a big period drama or a much-loved detective on its December  schedule. To be fair, all of these will be appear between Christmas and New Year.Most disappointing of all, Hogan wailed on, is the lack of a crowd-pleasing comedy to unite the generations, reeling off the likes of Morecambe and Wise, One Foot in the Grave, Men Behaving Badly and the Vicar of Dibley as examples. Itrsquos funny, recall all of these being Marmite shows, loved and loathed in equal measure, but there you go.To be fair to the BBC, a line-up that contains Strictly, Call the Midwe, EastEnders and Mrs Brownrsquos Boys wonrsquot be to everyonersquos taste, but in its own way it does reflect modern Britain. I also reckon it will please the target audience.I donrsquot particularly want to watch Danny Dyer yelling ldquoIrsquom not lsquoaving it in my pub on Christmas night, but then I wasnrsquot interested in Den serving Angie those orce papers in the festive episode of EastEnders watched back in  by more than  million people, either.No single programme would or could attract that number of viewers these days, but since millions still watch soaps, a Christmas Day visit to the Queen Vic or the Rovers Return is surely a welcome and expected part of the schedule for many.Taste, then, as well as tradition, will always play a part. My beloved grandmother always watched The Queenrsquos broadcast to the nation, while I never missed the Top of the Pops Christmas Special that preceded it.Regardless of this, however, I think the BBCrsquos critics are missing the point completely. Put simply, times change.During what we now seem to look back upon as the golden age of Christmas TV, the s, s and even s, the period we seem to get so nostalgic about, my aforementioned grandmother was regretting the loss of the Christmas Day evenings of her youth, in the s, s and , which had been spent around the piano singing Christmas songs.She seemed sad that people didnrsquot come together as a family to listen to the ldquowireless any more, or play games like charades. One change she always embraced and relished in the s, however, was the fact that Christmas Day was a public holiday at all. When she was young this wasnrsquot the case in Scotland unlike in England, many factories, shipyards, shops and offices would stay open on December , a practice that went back to the Reformation.Technology may have made our modern Christmas Day more fractured, even a bit less social, but at least we get to spend it in a togetherness of sorts. Indeed, the very smartphones and tablets we decry for being antisocial allow us to communicate with loved ones overseas in a way we could never have dreamed of even a few years ago.So, letrsquos not be too harsh on the Beeb over the lack of Christmas TV crackers. Especially since the channel is also gting us more than  box-sets. Just think, yoursquoll be able to watch them on your new Christmas tablet."},{"url":null,"title":"derek-mackay-urged-to-pass-on-16bn-of-uk-funding-to-public-services","story":"The SNP Finance Secretary will present his Budget to Holyrood on Wednesday, outlining his tax and spending plans for the next financial year.The Scottish Tories said Chancellor Philip Hammond had handed Scotland the third highest cash boost out of all the UKs spending areas in his own Budget in October.Official figures show the Scottish Government will receive an extra pound. billion next financial year, third only to the UK departments of Transport and Health.Murdo Fraser, the Scottish Tories shadow finance secretary, said this proved there is no need to raise taxes in this weekrsquos Scottish Budget.He said: ldquoThese figures prove that the Scottish Government will benefit enormously from the UK Budget.ldquoWhile the SNP canrsquot bring themselves to welcome it, this is a huge investment in Scotland.ldquoThis shows that the SNP Government has enough cash to support our ailing public services without asking taxpayers more.ldquoThe SNP has become a lsquopay more, get lessrsquo government.

It has been a gradual build-up over the years but I think the way the Highland Council has been dealing with issues has not helped and it has not helped any of you whatsoever.Mrs Manson promised a ldquolistening council when she took the reins from Steve Barron last month. That has included a y series of drop-ins across the sprawling Highland Council area inviting people to share what they feel the local authority does well and where therersquos room for improvement.The council faces a massive budget gap against a backdrop of simmering public discontent over areduction in services as belts are tightened.She said she was willing to look at all issues raised. She said: ldquoI need to think about how we structure staff in the council so that people feel there is an equal service out there.The planned introduction of parking charges to a town which boasts freely available space prompted warnings. Councillor Margaret Paterson said: ldquoI can tell you that the majority of people in Dingwall want you to stop imposing parking charges. And as a council you donrsquot care how the High Street will go down the plug hole because of it.Mrs Manson said she would consider the concerns raised during the drop-ins and would report back in January.What do YOU think  We welcome feedback.

What do my constituents, or at least the majority of them, feel I should do The atmosphere at Westminster has at times been what is best described as ‘febrile’. Much more experienced colleagues tell me they have known nothing like it.Since the start of the week, however, and three straight defeats for the Government, it’s probably been much more about mutual, cross-party team spirit and comparing notes.Team spirit may seem like an odd phrase to use about a place much more used to tribalism. But that is exactly what has been happening.I’ve had snatched conversations with colleagues from other parties, sharing our confidence that we might still be able to pause this economic disaster long enough to give the people the chance to have their say. A final say. A people’s vote.: Hard Brexit makes these people fear for their lives – Christine JardineBut, and I shall come back to this later, I have also spent hours reading the hundreds of emails, letters and postcards that I’ve been sent by constituents eager for me to know their views.I appreciate that many of you will be worried that a referendum on the deal could create yet more isiveness. But, at this point, with parliament in gridlock and no majority for any deal, going back to the people might just be the best option. By far.Our five days of debate in the Commons have, so far, been long, tiring and, at times surprising. There is no cohesion on the Government benches.A Tory rising to their feet is as likely to be criticising their own party for either falling short on delivering Brexit or for ignoring the national interest as they are to be attacking the opposition. Even the Cabinet is unpredictable.And for each of us inidually, there is the thought that this is a decision we cannot afford to get wrong. The country cannot afford for us to get it wrong.Which brings me back to the correspondence I have had from my constituents.I take the privilege of representing the people of Edinburgh West more seriously than any role I have ever had, outside parenting.And for me that has meant taking every opportunity to check that their views have not changed since the referendum on  June, .On that night, I left the count at Meadowbank with the figures ringing in my ears. More than  per cent of the voters in Edinburgh wanted to stay in the European Union. The support in Edinburgh West was among the highest in the country.: Refugees like young Alan Kurdi are still dying in the Med – Christine JardineNow,  months later, I have little reason to doubt the solidarity of that opinion.Out canvassing, I have listened carefully to what both myself and my colleagues have been told on the doorsteps.I have kept a careful log of what those who have written to me have had to say.I also have my own reasons, of course, for thinking our national interest is not well served by the current proposals.I do not think this, or any deal, can deliver the continued economic stability we have in the European Union. Our industries and businesses need an end to the uncertainty.Even the Chancellor Philip Hammond said recently that we will not be as well off economically outside of the EU.I have also argued consistently that the people should have the final say and that is now, I believe, even more pertinent.The issue of Northern Ireland, the problems created for a still-fragile peace process and the fact that the Government seems content to let them drt away from the UK in this agreement has also been a factor.And then there are my constituents. Their future and their views.Of the several hundred who have taken the time to share their views with me, more than  per cent want me to vote against this deal.That,you believe in representative democracy, is a strong argument.The people who elected me, to whom I will answer at the next election, do not like what this Government has presented as our future.If all the other arguments were put aside that would still be enough to persuade me of what I should do.So tomorrow night, I expect to go through the lobbies to vote down the proposals for our departure from the European Union.I shall hold fast to my promise last year to the people of Edinburgh West and keep faith with all of those who are looking now to Westminster to sort this mess and then give them the final say.©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4841538.1544428934!/image/image.jpg","title":"brian monteith voting down may s brexit plan is about more than the backstop","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...There is far more to worry about in the Prime Minister#s plans than just Northern Ireland, writes Brian MonteithIt does look likely that the vote on the Prime Minister’s Withdrawal Agreement will go ahead tomorrow and will be heavily defeated.There is a large exercise in expectation management emanating from Downing Street, with the possible scale of a defeat being talked up so thatit happens to be less than a hundred it can then be portrayed as not as bad as it might have been and this will justy Theresa May carrying on to try and get some concessions from the EU.This behaviour should not be acceptable to anyone who supports democracy.The Withdrawal Agreement is completely and utterly owned by Theresa May. She has told everyone it is her deal or no deal – or even no Brexit. She has sought to rely on the votes of Labour MPs – providing briefings for key Labour MPs ahead of those from her own party. Accordingly the deal has undergone close detailed scrutiny and been found wanting. Some of the legal advice that the Government then chose to ignore has exposed the deal’s real weaknesses – which, crucially, are far more than the Irish Protocol known as the backstop.Of real concern must also be the failure of Theresa May’s government to show that it has made a serious effort to prepare for No Deal. Those two counts – losing a vote over her flagship policy and leaving the country ill-prepared to face an economic risk – are capital offences that would normally warrant removal from office. It should be remembered that in  the British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain actually won a vote of confidence following the failure of the Norwegian campaign yet he knew he no longer had moral or political authority and resigned with dignity. Theresa May must also resign to maintain any degree of political respect, andshe does not she should be subject to a vote of confidence within her parliamentary party, for that is the only way to replace her with someone who can get down to the task of preparing the country for leaving without a deal while trying to get the EU to compromise.A vote of no confidence put forward by Labour would most likely fail, as the DUP would not wish to bring down the governing party in favour of Jeremy Corbyn – and recalcitrant Tory MPs would also fall into line rather than be responsible for the fall of the government and the calling of an early general election. So it must be down to backbenchers to submit their letters to trigger the Conservative Party’s own procedures. At that point I would expect the likes of Jeremy Hunt and Savid Javid to tell the Prime Minister it was time to step aside or face humiliation from her own colleagues.There is much talk for May being given one last chance in Brussels this week and thatshe can get a time limit on the Irish Protocol or other such fix that allows the UK to claim a minor victory then her deal could then pass. This would be a foolish and dangerous approach, for even without the backstop the deal is not Brexit. It would still tie the UK into many Single Market rules overseen by the European Courts of Justice and throw away £ billion for nothing in . Countries like South Korea and Canada make no contribution to access the EU’s markets and the House of Lords found there was no obligation to pay the EU £bn.A couple of weeks ago I had the pleasure to meet, Simon Boyd, the Scottish CEO of Reid Steel. Simon, who served his apprenticeship in a Clyde shipyard, explained to me how the company he runs, which exports to some  countries around the world, was originally established in France in  – but is now located in Dorset. Yet despite this pedigree and the existence of the so-called Single Market he finds it easier to export steel to Mongolia than he does to France. He gave me two examples of why the first was when his company had a UK Government contract to build storage facilities at Calais, and the second was for a £.M aircraft hangar in Toulouse – but Reid Steel could not do either because it is not a French company. In France only French companies can buy the insurances needed to work in their country. Those insurances also require that all materials have been approved by the French testing authorities, making it more dficult for UK manufactured goods.Far from creating a level playing field like the single market Scotland enjoys across the whole of the United Kingdom, the EU has rigged the game rampant protectionism is the only winner – and this state of affairs is what the Withdrawal Agreement seeks to maintain.Boyd also explained to me how the EU’s Eurocodes system for design unormity ensures each dferent country, and in some cases dferent regions, have their own local ‘annexes’ or conditions. Often they are in native languages and are simply a means to tie up competition in a tangle of prohibitive and costly red tape. Businesses have to purchase Eurocodes from the British Standards Institute, which is a signicant overhead and can be a barrier to entry for many SMEs. To purchase just one part of the Eurocodes for Reid Steel’s type of work costs circa £,, and that is for just one of the  parts of the codes that relate to their industry. For an SME like Reid Steel these overheads are burdensome,not completely unaffordable.As a further example Boyd told me of how Reid Steel designed and helped build  structures in the Caribbean, all designed to British Standards . Every single one stood up to the category five hurricanes last year. Boyd doubted Reid Steel would have been able to win that work using Eurocodes as the use of Eurocodes internationally is rare.The UK needs to be free from the EU’s bureaucratic restraints of the Single Market, Customs Union and the jurisdiction of the ECJcompanies like Reid Steel are to maintain their global reach and grow. The Withdrawal Agreement is a bad deal – with or without the Backstop – and on Tuesday MPs need to take the brave pills and defeat it to ensure a real Brexit can be delivered by setting up the chance for a better deal.©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4841571.1544428298!/image/image.jpg","title":"lesley riddoch norway plus is not an option for the uk s brexit","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Amber Rudd and her colleagues are deluding themselves with their Brexit plan B, writes Lesley RiddochScots stand today, surveying the collapse of British governance, like folk on leboats watching the mighty Titanic start to slip beneath the waves.Most of us do not vote Conservative and never will. Most of us voted to Remain in the EU in . And now most of us would opt for independence in the EUa self-harming Brexit goes ahead. And no matter which withdrawal deal is advocated by desperate members of both main political parties south of the Border, each one is more damaging than simply staying in the EU. That includes Amber Rudd’s crazy, last gasp advocacy of “Norway-plus” as a Brexit option,or really when Theresa May’s dead duck is finally allowed to waddle off the stage. Of course, on the face of it, Norway-plus looks inviting. The UK was one of the founding members of the European Free Trade Associationin . Britain left to join the EEC in , so EFTA membership could be portrayed as ato the fold we should never have left. Rejoining EFTA would let the UK remain inside the European single market by also gaining eligibility to join the European Economic Areaand that would guarantee genuinely frictionless trade.Britain would leave the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice, the common agricultural and fisheries policies and be free of the drive towards “ever closer union” from the end of . And the “plus” bit – remaining in a temporary customs union – would allow goods to join services enjoying business asnormal instead of the impending chaos of a no-deal Brexit.But the price is high, especially for a party which consciously decided to follow the irresponsible and malicious path of blaming Brussels, EU nationals and immigrants for the Dickensian levels of poverty, inequality, starvation, collapse of public services and general hopelessness created by their own policies in Britain. There is therefore no way the Tories can sell a Norway-plus deal which accepts freedom of movement and “rule-taking” from Brussels while paying - per cent of full membership fees to feverishly Brexit-ready English voters. Of course, there’s another tiny problem with the Norway-plus option. Norway will block it.Last week, Heidi Nordby Lunde, Conservative MP and president of Norway’s European Movement, kicked British membership of the EFTA roundly into touch, telling Channel : “I’m sceptic to letting the UK into the EFTA family because it’s kind of like having an abusive partner spiking the drinks and inviting them to the Christmas party.”When askedshe felt that the potential of Britain joining the EFTA would upset the balance in that group, she added: “I think you would mess it all up for us, the way you have messed it up for yourselves.”This kind of reality check has so far been completely missing from Britain’s pie-in-the-sky Brexit debate and is all the more signicant because Norwegians are usually the world’s most diplomatic people – the product of compromise and consensus that comes from almost a century using PR in elections.But Lunde summed up Britain’s Norway-plus problems succinctly: “The Norway deal has four issues that I don’t think UK politicians want. First of all, we accept migration internally in the EU, we also accept rulings by the European Court of Justice, we accept the rules and regulations that we get from the EU. Also, being in the EFTA bloc, we can’t make our own free trade agreements without having Liechtenstein and Iceland with us.”Interestingly, none of these obstacles for “red line” Britain would create an insuperable barrier to an independent Scotland which wanted to pursue the EFTA EEA routeEFTA members and Scots decided that was preferable to full EU membership. But after this one short interview on Friday, Norway-plus stood roundly demolished as an option for Britain. Yet, unbelievably, the very next day, flying in the face of all that had just been said, Rudd became the first Cabinet minister to publicly back the Norway-plus modelMay’s Brexit deal is defeated in the Commons tomorrow. Even more incredibly, Rudd’s desperate advocacy of this non-viable Norway deal propelled the Work and Pensions Secretary back up the pollsters’ rankings in the race to become the next Tory leader. Mind you, since the attempt to keep legal advice from MPs also shunted Attorney General Geoffrey Cox into the running, why should anyone be surprised  Despite defeat in the Commons, Tory MPs and London-based political commentators were apparently moved and impressed by the gravelly, authoritative quality of his voice. These are the depths to which “leadership” in British politics has sunk.In short, a proposal that was comprehensively trashed only  hours earlier by a Norwegian Conservative politician has earned the deluded or deliberately obfuscating Rudd an even greater chance of taking over when May has gone.If folk believe this bourach can still be described as governance, they must be part of the minority – according to weekend surveys of Scottish public opinion – that still prefers Brexit in the UK to Scottish independence in Europe. You don’t have to be a card-carrying Christian for a verse of Matthew to come to mind: “Beware of  prophets, who come to you in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly they are ravenous wolves. By their fruits you will know them.”Well, now all Scots know how the Conservative Party and the British Government choose to operate. They are always focused on the short term, always seeking one-off deals instead of long-term relationships, always feathering their own nests – recent European investments by leading Brexiteers haven’t escaped public attention – and always suspicious or careless of neighbours’ interests. It’ll be a very long time before the Irish forget Priti Patel’s appalling suggestion that the prospect of food shortages should be used to scare Irish people into submission over the backstop. Of course, Scots are not immune from Brexit or its ill effects.But looked at from the perspective of those boarding the leboat north of the Border today, there’s only one question left as Britain embarks on its final act of jaw-dropping self-harm.

Famous flame-haired Scots include actress Karen Gillan and singers Annie Lennox and Lulu, while even the ancient Romans described the Celts as redheads.Until now it was thought that their red hair was controlled by a single gene, called MCR. Previous studies had shown that redheads inherit two versions of the MCR gene that leads to red hair – one from each of their parents.Although almost everyone with red hair has two copies of the red-haired version of MCR, not everyone carrying two red-haired versions is a redhead. Scientists knew there must be other genes involved but these have mostly remained a mystery until now.Researchers at the University of Edinburgh have identied eight previously unknown genetic dferences associated with red hair.Professor Ian Jackson, of the Medical Research Council Human Genetics Unit at the University of Edinburgh, said: “We were able to use the power of UK Biobank, a huge and unique genetic study of half a million people in Britain, which allowed us to find these effects.” Professor Albert Tenesa, of the University of Edinburgh’s Roslin Institute, said: “We are very pleased that this work has unravelled most of the genetic iation contributing to dferences in hair colour among people.”©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.The project, costing around £ million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in .

It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People .”Are they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be doneI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish##.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc###and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of le or some other pointless title.Over the years art has very much lowered its standards signicantly to make and justy it becoming more commercially viable####.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called # limited edition rubbish #.I would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at###atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.No doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and le experience###..despite the fact everybody  looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.Love the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of le. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.HGIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the # shock value # when it comes to expressing what art is or should be Personally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it # And the winner of the Turner Prize is#. #. lol“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is###. ”.Go on David,since you are consumed with what is appropriate why not have a go yourself  You said “ personally , I would just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it “ And the winner of the Turner Prize is##.David Spence.

LoLThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.Based on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear..."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.It is rare enough for a local game to end -, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.Astonishingly, Delting’s - triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 25 ","story":"Those responsible finally saw sense this week, reversing the ridiculous decision to play both Scottish League Cup semi-finals at Hampden Park on the same day.Celtic, one of the four sides involved, had indicated that a draw should be made to determine which game was moved to Murrayfieldthe original plans were scrapped.But the holders’ game against Hearts will now take place in Edinburgh at .pm on Sunday th October. The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"lerwick harbour traffic continues to rise ","story":"The downturn in offshore operations had an ongoing impact on overall freight handled in the first nine months, compared with the same period in .Statistics for January to September, released by Lerwick Port Authority, show that vessel arrivals jumped by . per cent to ,, with tonnage up . per cent at . million gross tonnes.

He deserves all the support possible.Tomorrow’s match, despite being outside the Six Nations, should still be hotly contested.

He had represented Cunningsburgh, Ness United and ious Shetland select sides, once making a trip to Faroe with a county squad.Alastair was probably a wing-half in his early days, but after the change from -- to modern formations he usually formed part of the central defence.He played alongside the late Ian Manson for Ness, while for Cunningsburgh his long-term partner was Douglas Halcrow. They were part of a team which enjoyed many successes in Southern League football, and also which won the Parish Cup in  and .Cunningsburgh had a number of outstanding players in that era, not least twins Billy and Malcolm Adamson and the late George Adamson, but Alastair was definitely one of the most consistent.Very similar to his -year career at The Shetland Times, he was as dedicated as it was possible to be, someone you could always count on whatever the issue.As former goalkeeper Peter Farmer said after the funeral last Friday, “I played behind Alistair for  years and he was so reliable, the way he read the game.”Football runs in the family. His younger brother Gordon also played for Cunningsburgh and Ness while another brother Jim represented Shetland in  and . Nephews Raymond and James Aitken and Tony and James Johnston did likewise, with the latter becoming the county’s equal most-capped player.When the Times started a works league team in the s Alistair was persuaded to come out of retirement and take part in the very first match, a friendly against Bressay. That was where his we hailed from and I recall him saying that “I better no score a goal or Margaret will nivver spaek ta me again”.He also came with the works team on a trip to Orkney. He was a bit unsure about that and actually got injured in one of the matches, but as far as I recall he had as good a time as anybody where the after-match entertainment was concerned.Alastair and Margaret had three daughters, Wendy and twins Susan and Alison. They were all musically gted while Susan and Alison excelled at hockey.One of his grand-daughters, Sophie Moar, is a top athlete. At the island games in Jersey three years ago she won a bronze medal in the long jump and was a member of the gold medal-winning # metres relay squad. Alastair and Margaret were there to see it and I would imagine that was one of his proudest ever moments. After his retiral in  our paths crossed a few times but unfortunately not all that often. He was always friendly and good company.The last time I saw Alastair was earlier this year when I visited him and Margaret at Bremmer in Cunningsburgh. It was a very dficult experience as by then the dementia had taken its toll, and he was a shadow of the vibrant figure he had been. He still knew me though, which made it worthwhile.Alistair was a tremendous guy. I know Margaret, their daughters and grandchildren, and the other family will miss him greatly, and I would like to give my condolence to them all.: : : : : : : :News came this week that Crystal Palace footballer James McArthur had retired from Scotland duty as he believed it was the only way he could “continue to play at the top level”.There was a time when representing your country was considered the “top level” but sadly that is not a view shared by an increasing number of people in the game.McArthur, who won the last of his  caps a year ago, says he has found it increasingly dficult to manage a number of physical issues. He is only .The Crystal Palace midfielder will continue to turn out for his club in what could be -odd games a season. However, he has deemed the half a dozen or so he could be required for his international side to be just too much.McArthur follows in the wake of a number of Scottish players who have taken this decision, the highest profile being Celtic captain Scott Brown. Others, such as Alan Hutton, are still performing regularly for their clubs.There were also the recent instances where both Leigh Grfiths, Robert Snodgrass and Kieran Tierney asked to be released from the international squad because of perceived “fatigue”.No doubt McArthur, like the others mentioned, has his reasons for arriving at this decision. But I cannot help thinking that players from a dferent era would never have done so.Some, notably Denis Law and current Scottish boss Alex McLeish, have said they have never retired from their country. They would still be availablerequired. Attitudes have definitely changed, and not for the better.: : : : : : : :The Australian Cricketers’ Associationthis week called for the bans to be lted on the three players who were involved in ball-tampering in South Africa earlier this year.The association has laid part of the blame for the incident at the door of Cricket Australia, who it has labelled “arrogant and controlling”.Steve Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft were all “contrite men who have suffered enough”, a review carried out by the ACA stated.Smith, who was captain at the time, and vice-captain Warner are seven months into their one-year bans, while Bancroft, who carried out the cheating, will be eligible tonext month.While the three may have endured both a degree of humiliation – Smith’s tearful confession was felt by some to be meaningful – and financial penalties, lting the ban now would send all the wrong signals.Cheating in sport, however apologetic the protagonists may appear in the aftermath, is an anathema which needs punishing.

What we haven’t heard is what exactly it will mean for Shetland.”But clarity remained out of reach over the next two and a half hours with a pivotal vote in the House of Commons scheduled for Tuesday.Presenting a view from Westminster Mr Carmichael said: “Every time you think we’ve got to peak madness in the House of Commons something  happens.”He added that Tuesday will likely to be on “another level” and said that he hesitates to “predict anything beyond the next hour at the moment”.Miss Budge said that farmers were particularly worried about the future of subsidy payments in the aftermath of leaving the EU.“The big concern is where the Scottish government or UK government will find that kind of money to put into farming.”The tourism industry was most concerned about maintaining visa free travel for citizens of the EU, said Mr Mathieson, while Mrs Hambleton said that businesses had to scenario plan in order to offset any potential negative side effects from Britain’s departure. which had highlighted government analysis which warned of potential delays of up to six months for pharmaceuticals.“Project fear is now project reality”, he said.Unsurprisingly, the biggest optimism came from Mr Collins, who viewed Brexit as an opportunity for fishermen. He noted that British fishermen caught less than half of fish in UK waters, compared with Norway catching around  per cent in theirs.He later criticised the EU as undemocratic but said he was a committed European and that he and his partner had four EU passports between them. His ideal scenario would involve dismantling the EU and for the project to be rebuilt with more accountability and less bureaucracy.Indeed the EU came in for criticism throughout the night. Mr Carmichael said that his view was not “massively dferent” from that of Mr Collins. But where the fishermen’s chief was keen to depart Mr Carmichael favoured remaining and reforming.A straw poll at the close of proceedings found an overwhelming support for this view. One person favoured Theresa May’s deal, two opted for leaving with no deal and  said their preference was to stay in the bloc.Isn#t the whole idea of Brexit, to do with the Conservatives wanting a trade deal with the USA, without the interference of the EU This will also, I think, be the beginning of the mass privatization of most government responsibilities and duties of care going to USA companies, where the Conservatives will benefit from such a deal  .The impact on Shetland, I fear, will be very damaging indeed, as economic circumstances will mean a vast reduction of Local Authority spending. This will also force the SIC to do huge cuts in budgets and very much streamline and prioritize what money goes where.This will force many other companies and people owning their own business to either reduce the workforce or shut up shop The general outlook does not look favourable for Shetland in the long term.I sincerely hope my outlook is proven wrong .."},{"url":null,"title":"review kansa impress at mareel album launch ","story":".from their new album an early highlight of the set., an ode to making the most of the time you have, proved an audience favourite also.Huddled tight together in a semi-circle at the front of the Mareel stage, Kansa appeared in a number of dferent guises throughout the night, with fiddlers Lynda Anderson and Lois Nicol swapping sporadically.After the interval, former Kansa member Stewart Grains provided the audience with a mixture of reels and Christmas classics with the accompaniment of Kirsten Hendry on piano. reduced some audience members to tears.The night belonged to Kansa though, and theirto the stage for the end of the concert was greatly appreciated by the full audience.

However, on turning , she was required to move home and the family worked with Comhairle nan Eilean Siar#s social work department to put in place suitable arrangements.It took two years to find a solution and in May this year, Eilidh moved back to Stornoway, where she was housed in supervised accommodation with a young male who also suffers from autism.Four complaints by the family over that accommodation provision were upheld by the Care Commission and, following an incident, the male was removed from the house to another unit. However, that sudden change in circumstance sparked an escalation in Eilidh#s behaviour and the family were informed by social work management that they were seeking an order under mental health legislation.Eilidh had been housed on her own in the psychiatric ward in the Western Isles Hospital in Stornoway but was flown to the mainland on Tuesday of this week as that ward faces closure. She is also on a daily course of benzodiazepine # despite never previously requiring any medication. Catherine Ann MacLeod, Eilidh#s aunt, said there had been a #mishandling# of her situation from the moment she was required to come back to the island.#Eilidh is not psychotic,# said Ms MacLeod. #What she was displaying was traits of autism. The male was removed from the house all of a sudden and Eilidh is not able to process sudden changes without careful handling. That#s why she became more aggressive she#s not able to express herself properly. It would never have happened had a proper care plan been in place.#Whatever happens now, they#ve broken Eilidh # she#ll not be the same now. It#s broken my sister, too. I want the whole thing investigated by the proper authorities so this does not happen to another family.#Miss MacLeod, who said the case was #a clear abuse of Eilidh#s human rights#, was not interested in any apology from the council. The case has been raised with local MSP Alasdair Allan.He said: #I have met with Eilidh and her family. I am very concerned that they need to be reassured that there is accommodation for Eilidh long-term on the island, where she can be near her family.#There is no doubt that the family have had reason to be anxious about this question and I hope that we will now see dferent agencies working together in the islands to find a solution. I continue to work with the family to raise a number of complaints which they have about the way they feel they have been treated this far.#The islands currently face a major shortage of staff in the care sector, partly as a result of depopulation.The comhairle denied that decisions over Eilidh#s care were in any way motivated by budgetary constraints. A spokesman said they were #unable to comment on inidual cases#.#As a general principle,# the spokesman added, #we are committed to supporting people with complex needs in their own communities but for a small number of people there are circumstances in which outcomes will improvethey are supported in specialist centres of excellence on the mainland. This is not a matter of a lack of financial resources but rather not having the required levels of specialist care and expertise.#Whilst this is the case for many areas across Scotland it is clearly more acute in an island setting because it involves those requiring such care to live away from home for perhaps extended periods of time. It is also the case that implementing such measures and deciding when it is appropriate to repatriate service users is a matter of assessment and judgement.#The spokesman added that they were currently #in the process of developing a new strategy on learning disabilities and autism and this will consider whether we have the right balance between local support and specialist mainland provision#.By Murray MacLeod"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27495  ","story":" Robbie SmythOver the last  years Irishsociety has evolved and transformed in many ways.

Ireland north or south was never a concern yet we will all pay the cost for generations to come.Brexit represents a huge threat to the social, economic and political le of this island. The outworking of Brexit could be the imposition of hard border.That is why the people of the north - from all communities and backgrounds - voted to reject it.They knew it would devastate the economy, strip away rights and undermine our political agreements.And that is why, in the immediate aftermath of the referendum result, Sinn Féin embarked on a diplomatic offensive across Europe warning of the dangers of Brexit and putting forward our demand for a unique solution for the north which would respect the majority remain vote.Through intense lobbying in Brussels, Strasbourg, Dublin and London, Sinn Féin led and built support for the idea that our unique position and peace agreements required a unique Brexit solution.Our case for special status for the north within the EU sought to ensure there would be no hard border, that citizens rights would be upheld and the Good Friday Agreement protected in all its parts.As the prospect of a no deal Brexit became more likely, we made it clear the north needed to remain in the customs union and single market in order to prevent our economy being driven off a clf by the Tories and their DUP allies.That was reflected in the backstop which was agreed by the EU and the British government. But as soon as it was agreed the British government, as they always do, began trying to renege on its commitments.Our position remains now as it was then. That backstop must be maintained and protected. It provides the bottom line and is our insurance policy against the worst excesses of Brexit, which we know will be a disaster for this country.The backstop is not perfect and neither is the withdrawal agreement. There is no such thing as a good Brexit after all.There are still issues of concern and clarication required, particularly relating to the issues of rights and representation.Over the course of the last number of days Sinn Féin has met with An Taoiseach and An Tanáiste and have been in contact with Theresa May about all of these concerns.The pro-remain parties represent the majority of people in the north and are fighting on their behalf.By contrast, the DUP are actively trampling the best interests of people and business in the north in their reckless cheerleading for an as yet  Tory Brexit.Sinn Féin will continue to stand with all other parties who advocate for citizens’ rights, our economic interests and our agreements in the face of Brexit.  We will continue to put pressure on the Irish government to act in the interests of citizens, north and south and hold the Taoiseach to his pledge that the people of the north will never again be left behind by an Irish Government.Whatever twists and turns the Brexit debacle takes next, the backstop as agreed must be maintained. It cannot be sacriced in an attempt to save the ailing career of Theresa May or to serve the hard-line agendas of the Brexiteers in the Tory party or the DUP. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27499  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonGUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers# rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.- Declan Kearney MLADimitrios Papadimoulis is a Greek MEP who represents the Syriza party in the European Parliament.He has spent a le time involved in left wing political activism in his native Greece and has been a member of the Syriza central leadership which brought the party from opposition into government in , while the country was still in the midst of its financial and economic crisis and subjected to extreme political and economic pressure by the European Unionestablishment.Dimitrios is ‘laconic and philosophical in the way of Sparta’ – to borrow a phrase he used during a contribution at a recent conference which we attended together in Brussels, organised by GUE-NGL the European Parliamentary group to which both Sinn Féin and Syriza are affiliated.This meeting brought together leadership representatives and MEPs from twenty of the most signicant political parties on the progressive Left in the EU to discuss the future direction of GUE-NGL and future political strategy and co-operation among left wing and progressive parties including the  European elections, and the next term of the EU parliament.During one of our conversations at the conference Dimitrios recalled a story from - years previously, when he was travelling to deliver a speech.Dimitrios told his taxi driver what he was planning to say at the meeting.The taxi man replied:“Remember, you are a politician, not a prophet. Do not promise me things it will take  years to achieve. Make change for me tomorrow.”Dimitrios immediately decided to change his speech. He learned a lesson that day from the taxi driver which has stayed with him ever since.Theories or notions, and even visions for changeremain just that unless they can translate into concrete change in society.People want change which makes a material dference in their lives for them and their families.And thats how it should be.Fair wages high quality education and health services free at the point of delivery and a clean sustainable environment should not be dreams. They need to become realities.So political activists who are committed to transformational change need to be grounded in the real world.They have to understand what they can deliver in the here and now, and then to have a plan to achieve even more.But the progressive Left can only make change when it has the strength to do so.That means setting realistic objectives and priorities, and then devising strategies which work.I said in my opening comments to the conference that Europe is at a crossroads.The political direction, policy orientation, and increasing need for reform of the EU coupled with, and often fuelling the rise of the extreme right wing, now presents an existential threat to the principles of the progressive Left.Social democracy has effectively collapsed both politically and electorally across Europe.There is a need to build a progressive Left alternative, and to popularise a new political narrative or common sense based upon core ideas: To include:·         That economies serve the many and not the few:·         That human and democratic rights are inalienable:·         That the global environment is protected:·         That Europe should act as a force for international peace and solidarity: and·         That racism, sectarianism, misogyny, homophobia and xenophobia are opposed.These ideas should be a common  for expanding the political strength of the progressive Left.However, that potential faces many challenges.Some of these are beyond the control of the progressive Left, but others are not.All of this was under discussion at the GUE-NGL conference.There were many notable contributions.Arnaldo Otegi, the General Secretary of the EH Bildu was in attendance.He had just received the ground breaking judgement from the European Court of Human Rights, which ruled his prosecution was wrong.During Arnaldos presentation he provided a powerful critique of global capitalism and the importance of defending community and social values.Panos Skourletis has been a senior minister of the Syriza government.In a highly signicant move several months ago, he moved from that role to take up the position of Secretary of Syrizas Central Committee.Panos set out an analysis of the situation in Greece and wider Europe and argued that it is time for a common front of left parties and other progressives and democratic forces in Europe.Earlier I argued that unity and cohesion are essential between parties and democratic forces on the left in Europe: and that we must focus on what expands unity, whilst respecting our dferences and uniqueness as parties and national movements.Sinn Féin believes that GUE-NGL has successfully enabled progressive parties from the left to co-operate within the European Parliament, whilst recognising the autonomy of political delegations.This is one of GUE-NGL’s strengths as a parliamentary group and deserves to be consolidated.Unanimity is not required on all issues, all of the time but progressives cannot afford to be disunited.Political sectarianism undermines political strength, solidarity and fraternity on the progressive Left.The collective strength of the progressive Left in Europe stems from the domestic relevance and political strength of its constituent parts.The left will only be as strong in the European Parliament as progressive Left and republican parties are relevant and strong in their national contexts.The success of a real progressive Left alternative,  depends upon securing strategic beach heads of political strength and influence.This is why support for Europes only left wing government in Greece is so politically important.Whilst progressives need to be in a hurry to make change and in pursuit of a social and more democratic Europe, we also need to be realistic and pragmatic.The distinction between strategy and tactical positions need to be understood.Alliances with others are indispensable to the process of changing the overall balance of forces.Rigid or dogmatic ideological positions can prevent agreement upon shared objectives and securing unity among the widest cross section of progressive and democratic opinion.The political discussion and focus upon an emergent European Progressive Caucus embracing the Left, social democrats, and environmentalists is such an innovative and welcome initiative.I proposed to the Brussels conference that a strategic consensus among the progressive Left and others should be based upon support for national independence, social emancipation, citizens rights, and democratic control over the economy.For our part Sinn Féin will contest the European election in  on an agenda which advocates for the creation of a Social Europe.We will be emphasising the need to protect rural and fishing communities the promotion of economic democracy enhanced environmental policy, human rights and social justice as well as defence of the Irish peace process and support for a united Ireland.The onset of Brexit has changed the political and social landscape in Ireland, and also signicantly influenced political discourse within the EU itself.It has swept away all of the established constitutional, political and economic assumptions about the status quo in Ireland and refocused international attention upon the democratic case for Irish unity.During the conference I highlighted the denial of citizens rights and blocking of political democracy in the north of Ireland by the DUP and British Tory government. The point was made that this existential rights crisis, combined with the imposition of Brexit represented the most serious threat to the Good Friday Agreement, and the democratic option for managing change in the north of Ireland.The European Parliament  EU institutions have become strategically important forums within which to promote the democratic aim of a united Ireland and to encourage support for an Irish unity referendum. The level of interest in, and support for constitutional change in Ireland is now at an unprecedented high level across the EU.Sinn Féin will continue lobbying to make the case for a united Ireland a priority for the progressive Left and within other sections of democratic opinion represented in the European Parliament. Irish unity is integral to the vision of a new Europe.Going forward, the progressive Left in Europe needs to focus its collective efforts upon maximising representation and influence in the next parliament.GUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.That is what the shared ambition of a New Europe should mean. Sinn Féin has a central role in promoting that vision.The progressive Left across Europe has much to do.We need to be people in a hurry.The future cannot wait.We need to plan, organise and attract the popular support to make change for all tomorrow: To build a New Europe - a Europe of Equals. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27500  ","story":"• John James Kelly, Jimmy Joe Reynolds and Charlie #Cathal# McCafferty Staff ReporterThe three men were in a back room in the house of Patrick Kelly, brother of John James, when the explosion blew away part of the walls and roof.On  November , IRA Volunteers blew up six customs posts along the border in Counties Armagh and Fermanagh.

The exact cause of the premature explosion has never been discovered, though Patrick Kelly said later that the men realised that the proposed time of the Strabane explosion coincided with the coming home of Strabane people from the cinema in Lford. The Volunteers decided to change the time on the timing device and in doing so they caused the explosion.The three men who died were experienced Volunteers. John James Kellys father had been a Fenian and he himself was raised in the Fenian tradition. He was recruited into the IRB at an early age and formed a group of Irish Volunteers in Clady.

Hundreds died and many more spent many weeks crippled in agony in their beds during the winter months.Richard Coleman was born in Dublin in , one of eleven Coleman children, most of whom were active in the Gaelic League. Brought up in Swords, County Dublin, Richard was a religious and a patriotic young man. He trained to be a Christian Brother, but left to begin a career with the Prudential Insurance Company.When Thomas MacDonagh came to Swords in April  to recruit members for the recently formed Irish Volunteers, Richard was among the first to join. When John Redmond forced a split in the Volunteers later that year, the remaining Volunteers elected Richard as their captain.On Easter Sunday , Richard mobilised his men, the Fingal Battalion, at Saucers Town, ensured that they were ready for what lay ahead and dismissed them till the following day. On Easter Monday they, along with other Volunteers from surrounding areas, came under the direction of Thomas Ashe, whose instructions were to prevent British reinforcements from reaching Dublin. They fulfilled that task heroically that week.On the Tuesday,  Volunteers were sent into the GPO in response to a request from the Commander-in-chief, James Connolly. On reaching the GPO, the group was split up. Six men became the tunnelling unit around the GPO - `the engineering corps - while the others under Richard were instructed to reinforce the garrison under Sean Heuston in the Mendicity Institute. Connollys parting words to them did not augur well for their mission: ``I dont think you will all get there, but get as far as you can.They got as far as the Mendicity Institute unscathed. A Volunteer at one of the barricades they passed through said of them: ``In the midst of the firing, men approached up Church Street towards our barricade. When they reached it, they passed briskly towards their objective - whatever it might have been. They were dressed and, I thought looked, like countrymen... I could not but admire very much they way they went into action.At the Mendicity Institute, the garrison was under severe pressure, with the British attack coming virtually from all directions. By Thursday, things were hopeless and Sean Heuston was forced to surrender to a much larger British force.They, similar to the other captured Volunteers, were corralled at the Rotunda Hospital for identication purposes. They were then court-martialled and sentenced. Richard was sentenced to death, though this was commuted to three years penal servitude.The sentenced prisoners were transported to Dartmoor Jail in England first and then ided up. Richard was sent to Lewis Jail in Kent. When they were released after a very successful campaign in Ireland and abroad for their freedom, each Volunteer was granted £ from the National Aid Fund in America to help them rebuild their lives. They all pooled their money and began the New Ireland Friendly Society, with Richard as a director and a trustee with a superintendents wage.Like many of the other released prisoners in June , Volunteer Richard Coleman of Swords travelled to Clare to help Sinn Féin and the Irish Volunteers in their efforts to get Eamonn de Valera elected in the by-election.While there he addressed the first unormed parade of Irish Volunteers to be held since . For this, he was arrested and jailed for six months. While in Mountjoy Jail, he and the other prisoners went on hunger-strike, led by Thomas Ashe. Ashes death led to such a public outcry that the remaining prisoners were first moved to Cork Jail and then Dundalk Jail before being finally released.Richard was not to remain `at large for long and he was again arrested, along with many of the other republican leaders whod been active in rebuilding the Movement, as part of the British authorities `German Plot conspiracy.The prisoners were assembled first in Dublin Castle on  May  and were then ided up and sent to Usk and Gloucester Jails in Britain. Conditions were harsh in the jail and attempts were made to criminalise them with the order to wear prison unorms. They resisted and at the direction of the Home Office the prison governor, Mr Young, capitulated. On their first night in Usk, the internees won the right to free association, the right to receive and send letters, to smoke and to wear their own clothes.Despite their victory, the prison regime and their confinement weakened the men and with the onset of a severe winter, many succumbed to the influenza virus which had reached epidemic proportions, killing hundreds outside the prison walls. Richard was among a group of POWs struck down by the virus - they were left in their damp and cold cells for three days after the flu struck them down. On  December, a new prison doctor, Dr. Morton took up his new duties in the prison and immediately he diagnosed that Richard had now suffering from pneumonia and he had him transferred to hospital. He died a few days later on  December .Remembering the result of Thomas Ashes inquest - that the prison authorities were culpable - no formal inquest was allowed and when Richards brother arrived he was prevented from getting an adjournment of the local inquest so as to instruct a solicitor. The local inquest heard Richards brother state that Richard was a strong healthy man at the time of his arrest, while three fellow POWs attested to the insanitary conditions in the jail and that improper nursing contributed to his death. These statements got good publicity in the Irish press and added to the campaign to get the POWs released.Richard Colemans remains were released to his brother and were taken to Dublin where they lay in state for a week in St Andrews Church, Westland Row. Over , people filed past the coffin to pay their last respects. Volunteers in unorm formed a guard of honour during that time. A public funeral procession in driving rain from Westland Row to Glasnevin was followed by over , people. Three volleys were fired over the grave in Glasnevin Cemetery by six Volunteers despite a huge police presence. The size of the crowd prevented the police from moving against the Volunteers.Volunteer Richard Colemans death in an English jail, aided Sinn Féin campaign against Britains occupation and their general election campaign which was in full swing at this stage, and two weeks later Sinn Féin won a landslide victory of parliamentary seats. A month later in January  Sinn Féin MPs met as Dáil Éireann for the first time. The escape from Usk Jailby four of Richards comrades on the same day saw that republican POWs were unbroken and unbowed by their comrades death.Volunteer Richard Coleman died of pneumonia in Usk Jail on  December ,  years ago this week.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27507  ","story":" Michael McMonagle“This proposal from Priti Patel really exposes the Brexiteer attitude to Ireland as nothing more than a colonial irritant whose rights really shouldn’t be taken into account. - Chris Hazzard MPThe proposal from a senior Tory MP that the threat of food shortages in Ireland should be used to put pressure on the Dublin government and the EU in the Brexit negotiation exposes the colonial attitude of Brexiteers, a Sinn Féin MP has said. South Down MP Chris Hazzard was speaking after senior Tory MP and former minister Priti Patel urged the British government to use the threat of food shortages which could arise from a no-deal Brexit as leverage in the Brexit negotiations. The Tory MP, who previously stepped down from her ministerial role after revelations of secret meetings with the Israeli government, asked why the threat of food shortages wasnt being \"pressed home\" during the Brexit negotiations. Her remarks have sparked outrage on social media, with comparisons to Charles Trevelyan, the notorious British civil servant known for his role during The Great Hunger. Chris Hazzard said the proposal from the Tory MP were \"crass and offensive.\" “This proposal from Priti Patel really exposes the Brexiteer attitude to Ireland as nothing more than a colonial irritant whose rights really shouldn’t be taken into account.“They know the history of the Irish famine and Britain’s role in it and the very fact that they would seek to inject that into the Brexit debate is crass and offensive.“The Tories couldn’t care less about the impact of their reckless Brexit agenda on the people and economy of Ireland. We are simply collateral damage,\" he said. The South Down MP also said these and other public statements from Tory MPs highlight the importance of the backstop. \"It is our only insurance policy against a hard border in Ireland and comments such as Priti Patel’s will only serve to reinforce the determination of those of us who are saying that the backstop is the bottom line.

We were republicans in the mould of Markievicz. We were what we were. We are what we are. Unashamed, unrepentant republicans to this day and forever on.I was asked to speak at this event because I am a woman ex-PoW. To my mind there is nothing extraordinary in that, because I am only one of many.  There are hundreds of women throughout this country who have endured imprisonment because of their republicanism – and who carry that past with pride. There are women around us today who have shown bravery that would be considered well above the call of duty in any other walk of le. And, there are thousands who have quietly lived their lives and never told anybody of the things they did to further republicanism.And today we’re here to honour the memory of Constance Markievicz, one of the most famous republican women in recent Irish history a woman revered equally by historians and revisionists, and a woman who believed in, and participated in physical force republicanism.Constance Markievicz didn’t give a second thought to taking up arms and declaring war on the British Empire. Neither had she any misgivings about teaching young Fianna members to fight and bear arms. And she is rightly hailed a hero for taking that stand but the same people who revere her would, in a heartbeat, condemn me and others like me, and would pour scorn on those women on our republican role of honour, and claim that there is a dference.But I wonder could they tell me the dference between Constance Markievicz, who stated in  that:And the words of Volunteer Mairéad Farrell when she stated in :And I would love those revisionists, who laud Constance Markievicz and condemn Mairéad Farrell, to explain to me the dference between the circumstances that drove republicans in  to strike a blow against the British empire, and of republicans in  and  who took up arms to defend small communities like mine – trapped on the fringes of loyalist east Belfast, subjected to sectarian pogroms, ignored by a British government and forced into a state that neither wanted or accepted us.Marie Moore, a native of Clonard, a veteran of republican struggle and Belfast’s first Sinn Féin Deputy Mayor speaking of her le of republicanism rememberedWhere were the revisionists when thousands were being burned out of their homes when frightened mothers were dragging terried children onto buses and trains and being forced as refugees across the border, hoping for help and safety in another state that had abandoned us, and that also neither wanted nor accepted us When those who revere Constance Markievicz’s philanthropy and work among the poor of Dublin are celebrating her le, do you wonderthey ever give a thought to what she would have done had she been there when the hundreds of refugees from ‘the black north’ poured off buses with their meagre belongings in battered suitcases Do they think she would have stood idly by and did nothing I know none of us can speak for the dead none of us know what the other would have done, but we know enough about her to come to our own conclusions and I would like to think that she would have been as much a leader now as she was then.Her commitment and her legacy was an example to young women like me when I was growing up in a war-torn Belfast. She inspired us. She gave us aspirations to live up. She set an example. And part of that example was to never back down.We knew her history. We knew she took up arms. We knew she was a commander in the IRA. And we aspired to be just like her.She was also a POW, and when young women were imprisoned throughout the conflict, in this State, in Britain and in the six counties, they knew they were walking in the footsteps of the women of . We were republicans in the mould of Markievicz. We were what we were. We are what we are. Unashamed, unrepentant republicans to this day and forever on.And no political opponent or revisionist will tell me, and all those thousands like me, that I should be ashamed of that.But the irony is, that the people who are so quick to condemn today’s republicans for taking the decisions we did, have never once considered what drove so many Irish men and women, young and old, to walk the hard roads we walked during these last  troubled years. We didn’t do for fame or fortune. We did it because it was the right thing to do.There are always reasons and circumstances behind people’s decisions and, we need as much today to consider those journeys, as we do the journeys of the men and women of . Circumstances and history shaped all of us. That’s undeniable.Throughout the decades republican women have been to the forefront of struggles in Ireland in the Suffragette movement, the Labour movements, the Gaelic League, and many other organisations – much as republican women today are deeply involved in every aspect of daily le and organisations working to better peoples’ lives.In every phase of the struggle, women have taken risks. From their involvement in the ’s border campaign, to those who broke the Falls Curfew and carried guns and ammunition out under their coats, in prams and in shopping bags. And, we know many too who lost their loved ones, and their own lives, to plastic, rubber and live bullets on active service for the IRA, and to loyalist and British State murder squads.We all know women who walked the streets wrapped in blankets, in bare feet, in rain and snow, to highlight the plight of the prisoners in the H-Blocks and Armagh who smuggled comms, love letters, and much more into and out of the prisons who marched in their hundreds to the steps of Stormont when Sinn Féin were locked out of talks, demanding their rights and representation.There are women who travelled every week, for years, to visit loved ones imprisoned in this state, in the six counties and in Britain, most times with young children in tow. The hardship of prisoners’ families is often forgotten, and imprisonment impacted on thousands upon thousands of people throughout this island, not just the prisoners themselves.Brave republican women stood as Sinn Féin candidates in the early ‘’s and ’s, when in councils throughout the six counties they were vilied and subjected to the vilest of sectarian abuse and threats of death.And I’m proud to say that the temerity of those who led the way has paid off in idends. Republican women were elected in their hundreds – councillors, MLAs, TDs, MEPs, Senators and including – dare I say it – three very proud and very capable women MPs are walking in the footsteps of the first female MP elected to sit in the British House of Commons the first abstentionist Sinn Féin MP, Countess Constance Markievicz.And still, there are people telling us today that our Sinn Féin MPs, elected by thousands of Irish citizens full in the knowledge that, like Markievicz they would not be taking seats or swearing an oath to a foreign government, should take seats in a British parliament, or better still, resign those seats and gt them to others who are more than willing to doff their caps and swear an oath to defend an English monarch. Do these people even listen to themselves These same people, who are lecturing us, will no doubt be lauding Constance Markievicz for her part in the birth of the nation, with all her history of abstentionism and of physical force republicanism.Do they genuinely not understand irony And do they think that our supporters, those who flock to the ballot boxes in their thousands toSinn Féin elected representatives, don’t aspire to the goal of Markievicz, of a democratic republic that cherishes all of the children of the nation equally Where is the equality for nationalists in the six counties  Where is the respect for the democratic mandate of thousands upon thousands of people who have yet to have their rights and entitlements respected in the British constructed and maintained sectarian six-county state  Where is the support for our democratic mandate  Where is the aspiration to cherish all of the children of the nation equally  Or do they not consider us part of that nation  They need to bear in mind that when the Proclamation was being written there was no border in Ireland – hard or soft.They also need to bear in mind that there is no single narrative to this conflict. Yes, people have been hurt, on both sides, and those who are trying to revise the history of the IRA of , are also trying to revise the history of the IRA of this phase of the struggle to present one side and one side only. As a republican woman I am proud of the rich history of Irish women that we can lay claim to, and many here today were part of that history. And I am proud and in awe of those women who lost their lives as part of that struggle.Unfortunately, throughout the decades of our troubled past people who know nothing about what we went through are writing and rewriting our history.We cannot allow the memories of our dead, the stories of nationalist and republican victims, and the history of repression and oppression that led to young people again taking up arms, in the same way Constance Markievicz and Tom Clarke and Pádraig Pearse and all those others in  took up arms, being airbrushed out of our history. And maybe one day we’ll be in a place where the circumstances that led to those decisions are acknowledged and accepted.Because, rest assured, not one of us woke up one morning and decided on a whim to take up arms, to put our lives on the line, to face imprisonment and death. There are always reasons why people make the decisions they do but some people just refuse to see or accept that.We know those reasons and we need no lectures from people who have not walked in our shoes. is something we should all aspire to.We have a duty to future generations to ensure that our revolution isn’t rewritten. We need to make sure that our young people know why and where our history of struggle comes from to remind, educate and to see that it never happens again to ensure that young women continue to be inspired by Constance Markievicz, by her bravery, her philanthropy and her work for those less well off. But we also need to ensure that the circumstances that led to her and future republican women seeing the need to take up arms, never happens again.test"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.ballymenatimes.com/webimage/1.8734911.1544460417!/image/image.jpg","title":"jonathan rea honorary degree i feel a lot more comfortable in leathers and a helmet but it s nice to be recognised","story":"Four-time World Superbike champion Jonathan Rea has received an honorary degree for his outstanding contribution to sport.The Co Antrim racer received the honorary degree of Doctor of Lettersfrom Ulster University at its winter graduation ceremony.World Superbike Champion Jonathan Rea collects his Honorary Graduate from the University of UlsterOf the occasion at the Waterfront Hall in Belfast, he said: “It’s dficult to stand in a room full of highly educated people and receive an award like that when I haven’t gone to university. “But I have served my time.

My sacrice and dedication went to motorcycling and I’m very proud to be a Doctor of Letters because of that.“It’s a lelong sacrice. Since I was six-years-old I’ve travelled theand breadth of the UK racing. The injuries I’ve faced, the ups and downs, to actually win a world championship on top of all that is massive.“It’s nice that my family can see there was an endgame after all their sacrice in the beginning.Jonathan Rea shows off his new threads“It’s a very proud day for the whole family. Especially my two little boys , they realise that it’s not normal to be at an event like this. They know the ious race tracks inside out but this is dferent. I hope I can be a good role model for them.”The -year-old said it was the first time he had ever attended a graduation, adding: “I never imagined the first one would be my own.”Asked about his graduate attire for the ceremony, he said: “Of course I feel a lot more comfortable in leathers and a helmet but it’s really nice to be acknowledged outside the sport. It’s something that’s happening more and more recently.”The honorary degree follows the  award of an MBE on the New Year’s Honours list.

The travelling support has been immense these last few years. It just keeps getting bigger and bigger.“On my sighting laps and slow down laps I can see the Northern Ireland fans.

Karen Mooney, chair, said: “This winter, we know that our GP practices are going to be under immense strain, and we can do our bit to help support our health service.

All we do know is that she shall be like Him for she shall see Him as He really is and all He really is, is love.What can we hope to achieve in le except to have made this world a better place for our having been in it And Caoilte has made this world a better place. She has brought love and faith and spurred our hope.”Following Requiem Mass, Caoilte was laid to rest in Carnmoney Cemetery."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"community change makers combating malnutrition","story":"Concern Worldwide’s Darren Vaughan visited Burundi to see how funding fromFood in a Fragile World appeal – supported by the North Belfast News – is making a dference to tens of thousands of children facing hunger“She’s energetic and bouncing with le,” says -year-old mum Clotilde Ndayisenga as she attempts to squeeze a hug from her second youngest daughter, Ines.The five-year-old finds it dficult to stay still for a moment as we sit on a bench outside the two-room family home in a rural village in Rugombo. The draw of playing with her friends a few metres away is just too much for her.“She loves to be involved in everything,# says Clotilde, #especially helping to prepare food and cook. She#s quick to learn.#The proud mum of four is thankful that Ines and her other children are growing up strong and healthy. She puts it down to a combination of a ied and nutritious diet and the help and advice of community-based health workers, carers and volunteers supported by international development charity Concern Worldwide.Burundi is one of the poorest countries in the world, where more than a third of the population don’t have enough food to eat. Poverty, political instability and scarce rainfall all contribute to high levels of food insecurity and hunger. And children, who make up around half the population, are disproportionately affected.What makes it even more of a challenge is that Clotilde and her family live in Cibitoke – an area with one of the highest levels of chronic malnutrition in the country. Every other child living there is chronically malnourished.Hunger prevents them from developing. It causes stunting and weakens their immune systems making them more susceptible to diseases. Their ability to grow and learn is permanently damaged. By the time they are two-years-old, the effects of chronic malnutrition are irreversible.The overall level of acute malnutrition in the area is also poor, with one in every  children moderately or severely malnourished. Last year, the UN estimated that as many as . million children in Burundi were impacted, with almost , under-fives requiring treatment for severe malnutrition.It is for that reason that aid agencies like Concern are targeting pregnant women, and mums with young children. The aim is to prevent malnutrition in the first place or spot the early signs before it takes hold.A few kilometres away, we meet another -year-old mum, Charlotte Nzeyimana. She has been walking for almost two hours carrying baby Keddy on her back and with four-year-old daughter Kyntia by her side.In the shade of a banana grove, Charlotte shares her concerns about young Kyntia, who sits motionless on the ground beside her. “My daughter is not very healthy,” she says.Seven months ago little Kyntia was diagnosed with oedema – a symptom of severe acute malnutrition. She was admitted to hospital and recovered after a month. But her situation remains precarious.“I breastfed her until she was three-years-old,# says Charlotte. #After that, she began to get sick. She has never had a ied diet – and has only ever eaten cassava paste.#In the next few weeks, though, Charlotte will begin to reap the benefits of the same vital health and nutrition advice and support that Clotilde enjoys.The programme, which started in July, is run by Concern with funding from the UK government. Last year, as part of the overseas charity’s Food in a Fragile World appeal, the public donated just over £, which was matched pound-for-pound by the government. That matched funding is now being used in this part of Burundi to help improve the lives of more than , under-fives at risk of malnutrition.At the heart of Concern#s efforts to tackle hunger is a team of  skilled Community Health Workers . They are trained to detect the early signs of malnutrition on the spot and treat certain illnesses and infections. Concern also supports , Care Group Volunteers and  Mother Leaders who promote breastfeeding and good nutrition, food preparation and hygiene practices.#We rely on our Community Health Worker,# says Clotilde. #She has treated my children for malaria and diarrhoea. Andthey fall sick again, she will know what to do.#Both Clotilde and her husband earn what they can from casual work cultivating cassava and corn. Between harvests and during lean times they sell eggs, buns, soap and home-made banana juice to friends and neighbours. It is enough for them to survive on.#The CHW has told us the importance of having a balanced diet,” she says. “We eat twice a day – mostly beans, corn, rice, cassava paste, sweet potatoes and vegetables.”On a steep hillside in Bukinanyana not far from where we met Charlotte, Community Health Worker Jeannette Icimanishatse is greeted by shouts and laughter. The -year-old grandmother is visiting one of ten households on her weekly rounds. It is clear that she has gained the trust and respect of her neighbours, encouraging them to take simple preventative measures to positively impact their children’s lives.“I am proud of what I do,” says Jeanette. “Mums depend on us for help. It is rewarding to know that we are doing something to make the le of the community better.”Community Health Workers like Jeannette refer any cases of severe acute malnutrition to the local health centre for specialist treatment. They even help to arrange transport and encourage mums to save a little for emergencies. Mothers whose children are moderately malnourished are enrolled in community-based nutrition demonstrations where they receive advice on key feeding and care practices. They are also given support to build a kitchen garden which enables them to have vegetables all year round, and an opportunity to be part of a savings and loans scheme.It is a highly effective approach, according to Sebastien Sebahizi, Concern’s Health and Nutrition Programme Manager in Cibitoke, because it focuses on behaviour change and peer-to-peer communication.“What we have observed,” he says, “is that some mothers in exactly the same living conditions have children who are healthy. We bring them into the programme as Mother Leaders and Care Group Volunteers, so that mums who are struggling can spend time with them and see how it’s done.”A further spin-off from tackling malnutrition at grassroots level is that less of a strain is placed on the therapeutic and stabilisation services provided by local clinics.“What we hope to achieve,” says Sebastien, “is to halve the number of childhood nutrition-related consultations in local health centres. That will ease the pressure on the system and enable medical staff to deal with more complicated cases.“But ultimately, our goal is to reduce childhood malnutrition and give more young children the opportunity to grow up healthy and well. It is something each one of them deserves.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"mcgurks first uvf target searched 48 hours","story":"THE bar that the UVF had intended to blow up before switching their sights to McGurk’s had been raided two nights earlier by the British army and patrons arrested and screened.Fteen civilians, including two children, were killed in the North Queen Street bar massacre on December  .Ciarán MacAirt, a grandson of two of the victims, unearthed the informationin secret military documents in the National Archives in London. This week marks the th anniversary of the atrocity.At pm on December ,  – two days before the McGurk’s attack, British soldiers of the nd Battalion Royal Regiment Fusiliersraided and searched the Gem Bar close to McGurk’s Bar on North Queen Street.Less than  hours later, loyalist paramilitaries of the Ulster Volunteer Forcetargeted the Gem Bar for a major bomb attack. The Gem Bar was suspected by the British Army of being frequented by members of the Official IRA.The one convicted bomber, Robert James Campbell, confessed that the UVF gang drove to the area to attack the Gem Bar.It is believed that they could not plant the bomb there as young men were outside the bar so the bombers drove around the corner and pulled up beside the side entrance of McGurk’s Bar instead. One of the bombers got out of the car and placed the bomb in the entranceway, lit the fuse and ran back to the car which then sped off down Great George’s Street.Ciarán MacAirt said: “It is horric to contemplate that the British Army believed that the Gem Bar was frequented by members and supporters of the Official IRA and had raided the bar, searched it and screened its customers before lting a half dozen men. The action resulting from these lts is redacted in the files. Then, two nights later, pro-state loyalist extremists targeted the Gem Bar but failed to get clear access so made the fateful decision to attack the soft target of McGurk’s Bar instead.“We also know from these files, contrary to what the police and Office of the Police Ombudsman reported to our families, the British Army within an hourhad linked the Gem Bar to the bomb attack as the files record that McGurk’s Bar “was close to the Gem Bar” – but the British Army’s description of the Gem Bar is withheld from the families even after  years after the atrocity.“I believe the redacted information records that the Gem Bar was a ‘Goulding’ bar which in British military parlance denoted its alleged affiliation to the Official IRA whose leader at the time was Cathal Goulding. The reason that it is redacted could be that it shows that the British Army had correctly considered the Gem Bar to have been the target and the bombers loyalists. This alone would undermine the botched investigations our families have endured until now.“We also know from the same file that a British Army bomb expert had reported that the seat of the explosion was clearly in the entranceway and not inside the bar as the police had lied to the public, so the bar was attacked as witnesses had testied. Finally, from this signicant new discovery, we now know for a fact that the British Army’s covert death-squad, the Military Reaction Force, was operating in the area with  RRF who had raided the Gem Bar and we had long suspected that it had facilitated and directed the bombers.”Niall Ó Murchú of Kinnear and Co. Solicitors is legal representative for many of the McGurk’s Bar families. He added: “With every piece of new evidence which a family member had to find, it is becoming increasingly clear that the British army was involved in the planning and targeting of this bomb attack. “To allay all suspicion, we challenge Chief Constable George Hamilton and Police Ombudsman Michael Maguire to retrieve this file and release the information that the British Ministry of Defence is withholding from the families  years later.”"},{"url":null,"title":"karen bradley brexit deal must be passed for uk economy to flourish","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

This puts the whole of the United Kingdom in prime position to seize new opportunities as we leave the EU.As we establish our new relationship with Europe, the Industrial Strategy will help us to build the foundations behind our withdrawal agreement. Our prosperity and ability to build a strong economy is dependent on how we encourage innovation, develop high quality jobs and skills, and support businesses throughout the UK to thrive and grow.Northern Ireland has a world-leading reputation in key sectors, including construction and automotive, as well as future industries such as Articial Intelligence , cyber security and le sciences.The Industrial Strategy has led to specic partnerships between the government and these industries, which will help these major employers in Northern Ireland face the future outside the EU with confidence.Today I am pleased to announce, with the Business Secretary Greg Clark, £, of funding from the Industrial Strategy Challenge Fund for the County Antrim-based le sciences company Randox. This will pay for the research and development of cutting-edge technology to enable diagnostic tools to be manufactured more quickly and effectively.Eventually, this will lead to more manufacturing jobs as a result.Northern Ireland is also benefiting from UK-wide funding programmes under the Industrial Strategy, including Armagh City, Banbridge  Craigavon who have successfully bid for £.m and Belfast for £.m as some of the  areas benefiting from the £m Full Fibre Networks Challenge fund, designed to increase connectivity across the UK.The UK has a strong economy, with eight straight years of economic growth, over  million more people in jobs, and higher employment and lower unemployment in every region and nation of the UK - we should be proud of this.We are open and enterprising, founded on invention, innovation and competition.In Northern Ireland, employment levels are almost at a record high, and the UK government is determined to build on this progress.We are at the forefront of scientic invention because we embrace change and use regulation to stimulate an environment for creativity.We have globally admired universities and research institutions, such as Queens and Ulster University, because we have nurtured our intellectual powerhouses with public investment. And we have a deserved reputation for being a dependable and confident place to do business because we have high standards, clear regulation and great partnerships.The UKs businesses can take on the world because they have access to a skilled workforce and modern infrastructure, and Northern Ireland is an important and growing part of that. The Prime Minister, the rest of our Cabinet colleagues and I will continue working to secure the best Brexit deal for the whole of the UK.At the same time we are delivering our long-term plan to support businesses throughout the UK to thrive and grow.Building on the great strides the Industrial Strategy has already taken so that after we leave the EU, our businesses and institutions are in the best possible position to build on our strengths and lead the world.Karen Bradley MP is Secretary of State for Northern Ireland"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37610293.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/graph.jpg","title":"survey reveals 65 in northern ireland would now vote remain and 60 think united ireland more likely","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Unlike the pro-Remain parties, there was no joint press conference. But in separate statements, the DUP, the Ulster Unionists and the TUV insisted that no unionist worth their salt could sign up to the deal and called for the backstop to be binned. Sometimes, a secret document doesnt live up to the speculation. This was not such an occasion.Geoffrey Coxs advice set off alarm bells in even moderate unionist circles. No wonder the Government wanted to keep it under wraps. It said the whole of the UK would form a single customs territory with the EU, but Northern Ireland and Britain would be there on dferent legal terms.Only Northern Ireland would be legally part of the customs union, following the full EU customs code. The European Court of Justice would continue to have jurisdiction over its compliance with those rules. DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds said: \"Goods passing from Great Britain to Northern Ireland will be subject to a declaration process.\"Northern Ireland will remain in the single market for goods and the EUs customs regime, and will be required to apply and comply with the relevant rules and standards,up regulatory ergence in the future.\"Britain would be \"essentially treated as a third country by Northern Ireland for goods passing from GB into NI\".The DUP is livid that despite all Mrs Mays pledges, economic and trade barriers would be erected within the UK - something it branded \"unacceptable and economically mad\". The legal advice said the backstop could continue indefinitely and that the drafting didnt provide for a mechanism that is likely to allow the UK to exit lawfully.Despite promises to the contrary from Mrs May and Secretary of State Karen Bradley, the TUV said Northern Ireland would be \"annexed permanently into the EU\".The Attorney Generals full advice, released yesterday, was \"more emphatic and plain than that dressed up for the summary\" in the House of Commons on Monday, Mr Allister said.\"The trap is clear. All of the UK for now is held in a customs territory with the EU but only Northern Ireland is legally part of the EU Customs Union, where we would stay indefinitely evenGB was released,\" he added.\"This is utterly incompatible with the constitutional and economic integrity of the UK.\"Mrs May had previously stated the very arrangement that she ended up signing up to would be unacceptable to any UK Prime Minister.Mr Swann said while the Government tried to downplay unionist concerns as recently as last week when he met the Prime Minister and Cabinet Office officials, legal advice reinforcing those fears was actually sitting on their desks.\"What was the point in them spending the best part of a year saying that they shared our concernsall the while they were negotiating a deal that contains everything we were concerned about \" he asked.The UUP leader said Mrs May must stop \"flogging this dead deal\" and pursue alternatives. But nationalist parties and Alliance want her to do nothing of the sort. Sinn Fein MLA Conor Murphy said the backstop had been agreed by the Government and the EU, and the Attorney Generals advice changed nothing. \"It must be maintained and protected. It cant be derailed or undermined by the votes of Brexiteer MPs,\" he stressed.An SDLP spokesperson added: \"There will potentially be minor dferences between GB and NIthe backstop is required, but they will be minimal.\"This is not a secret, but any ergence is a consequence of Brexit and the extreme version of Brexit that the DUP insisted on pursuing. If the DUP cannot accept this consequence of Brexit, they should do the honourable thing and support a referendum on the deal.\"Alliance deputy leader Stephen Farry said nobody should be shocked at the legal advice on the backstop, because \"its nature and purpose should have been evident to anyone following the negotiations over the past  months\".The backstop was needed to protect the Good Friday Agreement and to avoid a hard border, he insisted. Mr Farry didnt see it undermining the Union - it \"may create comparative economic advantages for this region\", he said."},{"url":null,"title":"watch pm may address commons on rollercoaster day as brexit vote deferred","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Rather than taking back control, under the Prime Ministers Withdrawal Agreement, the United Kingdom would be trapped..pushThe Northern Ireland Protocol, set in international law, could not be exited unilaterally by the United Kingdom.It would continue indefinitely until superseded by another agreement.The Attorney Generals legal opinion is a devastating blow for the Prime Minister and those Cabinet ministers who are trying to sell the Withdrawal Agreement as a good deal.The publication of the legal opinion is a clear vindication for those of us who campaigned for it to be published.It is regrettable that we needed to use the Contempt mechanism to secure its publication. It did not need to be this way.Nonetheless, we now fully understand why the Government did not want to publish the Attorney Generals legal opinion.It flies in the face of what the Prime Minister told us on February  in the House of Commons.She said: \"The draft legal text that the Commission has published would,implemented, undermine the UK common market and threaten the constitutional integrity of the UK by creating a customs and regulatory border down the Irish sea, and no UK Prime Minister could ever agree to it.\"I will be making it crystal clear to President Juncker and others that we will never do so.\"Yet the Attorney Generals advice to the Cabinet confirms that the Northern Ireland Protocol would mean very dferent trading arrangements for Northern Ireland than the rest of the United Kingdom.A customs and regulatory border is precisely what the Government now propose.The Prime Ministers public and private commitments lie in tatters.Of course, it is important to rewind  months. It was this week last year when Arlene Foster telephoned the Prime Minister while she was in Brussels and urged her to bin the backstop.We pointed out the folly of the arrangement. We insisted on Paragraph  being added to the Joint Report to safeguard frictionless trade between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom.Twelve months later, the Withdrawal Agreement has hundreds of detailed legal clauses about the Northern Ireland situation and the backstop, but there is not a single line and not a single word in relation to paragraph  of the Joint Report.That provision was inserted specically to allow that the final say in and decision on any regulatory dferences between Great Britain and Northern Ireland should rest with the Northern Ireland Assembly and Executive.It is deeply regretful that we have received no satisfactory explanation as to why Paragraph s commitment has been deleted.Conceding a fallback position to the EU before even starting talks about our final exit arrangements was always a bad idea.Too much time has been spent on negotiating this awful backstop. Even the ministers selling the deal dont like it.The Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Rt Hon Philip Hammond MP, said on ITVs Peston on November : \"I dont think this backstop is a good arrangement for our economy. I dont think it is a good arrangement for our Union.\"So, its bad for the economy and the Union.And then the Attorney General, the Rt Hon Geoffrey Cox MP, said in the House of Commons on December : \"It has unattractive and unsatisfactory elements for us. I would have preferred to have seen a unilateral right of termination in the backstop. I would have preferred to have seen a clause that allowed us to exit.\"The words of the Prime Minister, EU commissioners and Cabinet ministers will come and go.They can be twisted and contorted to mean whatever one wants them to mean, but the legally binding text of the Withdrawal Agreement will remain.Our grandchildren will live with the outworkings of that international agreement.The Withdrawal Agreement will commit Northern Ireland to large swaths of EU single market rules for goods and agri-food.Of course, there are already regulatory dferences between GB and NI, but those were set for health reasons by our Parliament or NI Assembly, not because we were in a dferent single market regime.In such circumstances, our core industries would have their rules set by the European Commission and be subject to the European Court of Justice, yet we would have no say over them.It is utterly unacceptable, to me as a unionist, that Northern Ireland, in trade terms, would treat the rest of the United Kingdom as a third country.The Attorney General has confirmed this as being his legal opinion.We were told by the Prime Minister in her six declarations to the people of Northern Ireland last December that she would ensure that Northern Ireland left the European Union with the rest of the United Kingdom.She assured the public that no part of the United Kingdom would be left in the single market or the customs union and that no part of the UK would be left subject to the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice.These pledges have now been broken.We want a deal which works for the entire United Kingdom and delivers on the referendum result.We want Parliament to be sovereign for the entire United Kingdom.Rather than go through the process of debating and voting on this flawed deal, the Prime Minister should work for a better deal and bin the backstop.Nigel Dodds is the DUP MP for North Belfast"},{"url":null,"title":"ireland ranked as worst in eu for tackling climate change","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Minister Bruton has successfully raised expectations in recent weeks, but as yet he hasn’t taken actions that will actually lower our emissions.”It’s time for Government ministers to wake up and listen.Jenner HigginsFacebookTwitterJenner Higgins, policy and advocacy adviser at Christian Aid Ireland, said: “We have heard consistently citizens calling for more action, and a willingness to take on the radical changes we need to see domestically to tackle climate change.“It’s time for Government ministers to wake up and listen, not only to the science and to the criticism we continually face at the bottom of the pack, but also to the people, both at home and in countries worst affected by climate change.“With Minister Bruton coming to Katowice to the UN Climate Conference this week, the Government needs to respond immediately to the strong recommendations from the Citizens’ Assembly.”The publication of the report comes a month after Mr Bruton announced the development of a new Government climate action plan.A special all-party Oireachtas Committee on Climate Action is currently considering the recommendations from the Citizens’ Assembly and will produce proposals for the development of Ireland’s new National Energy and Climate Plan.The Climate Change Performance Index  also highlights the continued growth and competitiveness of renewable energy globally.However, it is emphasised that the gap between current emission levels and what is needed to put the world on track for a pathway of well below C or even .C is widening.Almost half of the G countries are in the group of very low performers: Japan , Turkey , Russian Federation , Canada , Australia , Koreaand – at the bottom of the index – the USAand Saudi Arabia ."},{"url":null,"title":"brexits key players as week of drama looms","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

MPs warned simply “tweaking” the backstop would not be enough to allay their deep-rooted concerns.Remain supporters called for a second referendum, while the SNP and Liberal Democrats – along with some Labour MPs – urged Jeremy Corbyn to move a vote of no confidence.– What about the reaction in Brussels EU leaders were quick voice their dismay, while making clear there was no appetite for reopening negotiations on the Brexit deal at this late stage.European Council president Donald Tusk hinted at some wriggle room, however, suggesting they could look at ways to “facilitate UK ratication” when leaders meet in Brussels on Thursday.– So when will the vote take place For the moment the Government is not saying, although it looks likely to be early in the new year as MPsto Westminster on January  following their Christmas break.Ministers could still decide to go before Christmasthey feel the tide is turning in their direction.– What happensthe Government loses All bets are off. A Tory leadership challenge, a vote of no confidence, a General Election, the formation of a government of national unity, a “hard” no-deal Brexit, or a so-called “people’s vote” with an option to remain in the EU are just some of the possible outcomes being talked about at Westminster.

Politicians are also conscious that dog fouling is a problem which does nothing to enhance the districtrsquos image.The new campaign is reminding dog owners that they should never allow their pets to foul on the street and that when out in public to carry a bag with them so they can collect dog dirt and dispose of it properly.Council chairman Mark Murnin said all councillors were unanimous in their support for the new awareness campaign.ldquoWe intend to monitor and extend this initiative over the coming months, he explained. Dog fouling is a serious matter and we need to remind dog owners that not only is it unacceptable, but also can potentially cause disease.ldquoIt is important that we develop and promote a culture of responsible dog ownership and are asking all dog owners to help us keep the parks and open spaces in the Newry, Mourne and Down area clean and welcoming for all users.As part of the new campaign, notices about dog fouling will be displayed prominently across the district to ensure that the local authorityrsquos message to pet owners is clear to all..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Classy Campbell seals victory  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH secured an excellent away win on the articial surface at Old Wesley as a strong second half performance was enough to get them over the line in a match strewn with penalties.lsquoHinch lost Rory Butler, James Simpson, Stuart Morrow to injury during the extremely physical encounter with Banbridge and, coupled with the unavailability of Johnny McPhillips, their midfield had to be rejigged completely with Callum McLaughlin and Robin Harte starting in the centre, outside fly half Hilton Gibbons.Tom Martin came in at lock to replace Simpson and the pack was bolstered by Tommy OrsquoHagan, who made his debut at tight head prop.

The goal I am working towards now is to get as much usage back in my arm as I physically can.Damien said the air ambulance costs pound, per day to run so every penny really does go a long way to making sure this vital service can continue.He added: ldquoI was delighted when Carryduff Building Supplies nominated the Air Ambulance to benefit from its annual fundraising breakfast.

Then came his sudden realisation of what the meaning of the word lsquoOmertarsquo was ndash the code of silence.He didnrsquot see it coming or expect it. Colm arrived into the Shimna Suite to a tumultuous welcome ndash the sort of welcome only heroes get, the standing ovation, the shy bow of the head and of course the irreplaceable smile.He was among friends and worshippers. He spoke to his adoring audience and we lapped up every word. He spoke of his unease at the inidual honours he achieved as Gaelic football is a team game and that he achieved much on the shoulders of giants both in size and sheer ability. They gave him the  to achieve what he did.Colm said It wasnrsquot about Colm ndash itrsquos what others did for him. The unglamorous work, the blocking, the chasing ndash all the stuff we, as footballers do.The first video, mist and rolling hills ndash the early strains from the film many years ago ndash yip local hero.We all canrsquot be wrong. Wersquore all thinking the same way. In true lsquoThis is your lersquo style our compere for the evening, the classy one and only Austin OrsquoCallaghan eased Colm into his throne.He didnrsquot sit easy. Hersquos in the spotlight. Itrsquos not like the chair at home from which he was supposed to be watching the Late Late Show . As Colm said himself, before Mickey Cole got his tuppence in, saying it was about Colmrsquos level of viewing.There was laughter from the hall. Now, like all his years on the field, he is being watched once again. The evening will unfold. There will be surprises. He will forget himself, the nervous tension will go.He will relax into the throne ndash on one which he will wear a virtual crown. There was one thing missing ndash the big red book. This was duly delivered by Colmrsquos grandchildren, Eimear and Senan adorned in the Castlewellan and Liatroim Fontenoys colours.He got his biggest hug of the night from them. They probably whispered lsquowe love you grandarsquo to him. He would have known that.And so the story of his le began and it began with family. His sisterrsquos Mary, Nuala, Una and Dympna talked warmly of their brother. They spoke of the early days in Dublin, the near emigration to Australia and ultimately theirto Liatroim.In later years one newspaper headlined ldquoColm McAlarney ndash Dublinrsquos gt to Downrsquo ndash which we all know now is so fitting and thank God for that.The next sign of the hero status revealed itself though not a sporting one. Dympna told of how as a four year-old she misbehaved at Mass. As children wersquove all got the ldquowait until I get you home remark from a parent. When she got home, Colm being the big brother. gave her a big protective hug and all was forgiven by her parents.Stories of his early playing days were laid out by his friends Tommy Armstrong, Brian Malone, Gerry and Noel McCabe.Those days as young lads where they played in a field, set up goals and the youngesttold they were in goal. The humorous story of those times set the evening up well.We also heard from Willie Doyle and Colm Shields of those days in the mid-sixties when the young Colm was starting to make his mark on the Gaelic field. And so the flow of old playing colleagues from St Patrickrsquos High School, Downpatrick, with MacRory Cup memories, Down Minors and U-s of the day.In  Colm played for Down in three Ulster finals in the space of eight days mdash for the seniors, minors and U-s. A quite unique feat and a sign that perhaps greater things would come.Another unique fact was revealed. Colm played in four consecutive minor county finals, one with Loughinisland, one with Annaclone and two with Castlewellan. The great and the good continued to file passed.They told their tales of opponent, rival, colleague and what makes the GAA tick ndash friendship. We all know the headline stories, but it will always be the anecdotal tales behind the stories which give us all the biggest chuckles.Of course there was the glory years where we had Paddy Doherty, Sean OrsquoNeill, Gerry Dougherty, Kevin McIlroy, Donagh OrsquoKane, Barney McAleenan, Liam Sloan, Peter McGinnity, Sean og McGourty, Ray Carolan to name but a few.The little story from Liam Sloan, when back in , he received a call from the Ulster Council to seea trophy Colm won the previous year could be ed to be presented to the next recipient. Liam called to Colmrsquos house where Colm went looking for it. Imagine the scene, Colmrsquos backside sticking out from under the stairs, arm reaching back with each trophy saying ldquodo you think itrsquos that one.There were video messages from Kevin Moran, the great Mick OrsquoDwyer, Sean Cavanagh, Mickey Harte and then of course there was Joe Brolly, who wants to sit down and have a pint with Colm sometime.Colm could turn his hand to any sport. Basketball was always a preferred past time. What was revealed also was when he was at St Josephrsquos Training College was how he became involved in a wee bit of boxing.When members of the Immaculata Boxing Club came over from Divis to lsquoThe Ranchrsquo Colm took up the gloves. They were impressed by his skills. They wanted him to join the sport and even came to watch him play.The young Colm simply did not have the time to fit it in. The one good thing was that, as many of you will remember boxing skills came in handy in the Gaelic football arena back then. Better with the skill than without it.I cannot tell everyonersquos tale but perhaps one of the greatest footballers of all time, the great Kerryrsquos Jack OrsquoShea, paid Colm the greatest of sporting accolades by telling everyone he modelled his game on Colmrsquos.The second Gaelic football, box to box player, learning from the first and had Colm been a Kerry man ndash well you know how many All-Ireland medals hersquod have. This comment met with huge applause and nodding approval for our hero.Another milestone in Colmrsquos illustrious career, sometimes forgotten, was his foresight back then in  to introduce Saturday morning coaching sessions in Castlewellan for potential footballers between six and eleven years of age, a true testimony this practice is still thriving within the club some thirty three years down the road, all due to Colm McAlarney.The most touching tribute of the night came from his daughter Grainne. Hersquos dad and not the hero we know.He is the hero that is her dad. It was only in her early twenties she appreciated the GAA star her dad is. Sometimes, whenever she mentioned her surname, through the medium of her work with Danske Bank, there was then the silence and the pause, then the question, ldquoAnything to Colm  which she would answer with pride and a smile ldquoyes thatrsquos my dad.Hersquos first and foremost a dad. Sitting quietly and elegantly through the evening, watching the proceedings unfold and Irsquom sure bursting with pride, was Theresa, Colmrsquos we. Along with the family she kept the secret of what was months in the making.Her smile and perhaps a quiet reflection on a sporting le which she supported all through the years deserves recognition. Though, I suspect she would be like Colm in that that recognition doesnrsquot sit easy with her either.The final video of the night was delivered to the tunes of My Way and Simply the Best. This was a reflection of a career which spanned four decades. Perhaps most poignant of moments was the final montage from the  Down Senior Championship final where we saw a very proud Michael McAlarney with his son Colm and Colm Og with the Frank OrsquoHare Cup he spoke of bursting with pride of the two men beside him.Colm did it his way, but never to the detriment of others and he is simply the best. All the guests rose to their feet, once again, when the red book was handed over. The evening wasnrsquot over yet. There was another award. One from within his own club. Castlewellan chairman Kevin Sweeney, came to the podium and announced that Colm was the worthy recipient of the Castlewellan Hall of Fame award.Some of our previous proud winners were there to see Colm presented the Johnny OrsquoNeill Trophy by Johnnyrsquos son, our vice-chairman, John OrsquoNeill. Colm is now among a special group of people within our club.Well done to Kevan Owens, Kevin Sweeney, Gerry Dougherty, Liam Sloan and Barney McAleenan. This is the team who put the night together and they deserve our praise and appreciation.So, there you have it - the word hero ndash you know by now itrsquos a big one.Kitty Kelley said that a hero is someone we can admire without apology. I use the word unashamedly. By the way, that  year-old I mentioned at the beginning was the late Gerry Rushfrom the Bann Road. He was a very proud Fontenoy, my friend and a McAlarney man.JR went to his eternal rest in October , but his spirit was there on Friday night to pay tribute to a very special local hero..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"McNamara and Murray strikes send Olympic into raptures  ","story":"TWO goals in a mesmeric three-minute first half spell proved decisive as Ballynahinch Olympic secured their place in the Christmas showpiece final against Crumlin Star.Strikes from Niall Murray and Chris McNamara had Olympic purring, but they took their foot off the gas after the break and nearly threw it all away.Orangefield huffed and puffed for most of the second half, but a determined Olympic restricted them to a solitary strike from Vitalis Ogunwa in the th minute.There wasnrsquot much to write home about in the opening exchanges, but Olympic looked the more comfortable in possession with their fluid and ambitious -- formation.Orangefield had the first shot in anger when William Gracey had a shot from the edge of the box well blocked by the impressive Chris Magee. Owen Peden then had a header blocked as Orangefield had penalty appeals for hand ball waved away.Stuart Nelson had a shot comfortably saved by Ryan Walsh as Orangefield probed for an opening, but Olympic were nor for yielding.However, the east Belfast side committed a cardinal sin by ping their guard and affording the roaming Murray and Nathan Jones far too much space and time on the ball.Jones served notice of intent in the rd minute when he was picked out totally unmarked on the right side of the box, but he contrived to screw his shot badly wide.Three minutes Ryan Molloy instigated one of Olympicrsquos trademark moves when he released Murray. Without even having to look up to see his options, Murray immediately fed Jones, but Glenn Taylor denied him with a parried save.With  minutes gone and Olympic in the middle of a power play, Jones again found space down the right and played an angled pass in behind centre half Jonathan Doey that was latched on to by Murray and he beat Taylor all ends up with a sweet strike.It was - three minutes later. A sweeping pitch- move, started out on the left by the immaculate Dalton Tate, ended with Chris McNamara, who was involved in the build-up, converting a sublime pass from Jones.Jones could easily have made it - in the st minute, but his well-struck shot was tipped round the post by Taylor. Jones then played a brilliant ball into the path of Murray, but he was denied by an alert Taylor who rushed off his line to interceptTaylor saved from McNamara at the start of the second half, but Olympic strangely retreated into a defensive shell with Jones being starved of possession and Murray and McNamara being forced to live off crumbs.It was at this stage of the game that Ryan Noade really started imposing himself on proceedings and he revelled in providing protection to his back three with numerous, telling tackles and interceptions where it mattered.Orangefield were seeing much more of the ball, but they were never able to hurt Olympic.If anything, Olympic still carried a greater goal threat with Jones having a free kick blocked and Stevie Noade flashing one wide after Jones threaded the ball into his path.Orangefield managed to reduce the arrears in the th minute when Ogunwa beat the offside trap inside the box and drilled an unstoppable effort past Ryan Walsh.Despite applying intense pressure, Orangefield never looked like equalising and with the  minutes almost up, Olympic hit them on the break only for Murray to blast wildly over the bar with only Taylor to beat.Ballynahinch Olympic: Ryan Walsh, Chris Magee, Ryan Noade, Conor Reid, Jason Noade, Dalton Tate, Stevie Noade, Niall Murray, Nathan Jones, Ryan Molloy, Chris McNamara.

The scale of the crisis is quite simply breathtaking and the figures speak for themselves.Mr Savage said an estimated , applications had been made for social housing district-wide, with almost , of applicants placed in the urgent need category.He continued: ldquoThese figures highlight the terrible extent of the housing crisis in this district. Enough is enough, it is time for us to take action and time for everyone to put their shoulder to the wheel to tackle this mounting problem.ldquoThe conference is the first step in getting sustainable solutions at a time when the people we represent cannot get a place they can call home. The Department of Communities has an obligation to come and play a lead role because it oversees the Housing Executive and needs to hear first hand the level of need in the district and work with us all to provide collaborative solutions to the problem.Cllr Savage added: ldquoWe need to explore all the options. Access to a home is a fundamental human right and we need to act swtly so the current generation is not left without a place to live.Cllr Billy Walker said all elected representatives are approached about the lack of social housing on a daily basis and that not one of the part of the district is not affected by the current crisis.ldquoWe need this conference to pull all the key players together and we must be robust with them on this issue. We need solutions going forward and this conference is the perfect opportunity to do just that, he added.Cllr Davy Hyland said the council needed to do what it could to find solutions for people in desperate need of housing, while Cllr David Taylor said a lack of resources was not helping the housing crisis which had left people on the waiting list for several years in some cases.He added: ldquoWe need a new social housing strategy and need all the key players to buy into this. We also need funding to meet the demand which exists.Cllr Andy McMurray said he was ldquoacutely aware of the trauma associated with being on the waiting list for social housing, describing the waiting list figures as ldquopretty shocking, while Cllr Jarlath Tinnelly suggested the social housing crisis ldquohas gone well beyond crisis point.Cllr Willie Clarke described Newcastle as a priority area and warned that the current social housing shortage has the potential to get worse in the months and years ahead.He said there is a particular need for accommodation for small families, highlighting the problems social housing providers face when they have to compete with private developers to secure building land.Cllr John Trainor said that while work on a major social housing scheme was underway at the old Downe Hospital site in Downpatrick, it was important to plan for the townrsquos needs over the next five to  years..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Murlough runners in full flow  ","story":"ON a wet Saturday morning, some  Murlough AC members made their way across the province to Loughgall in Co Armagh to complete the third race in Born  Runrsquos Run Forest Run series.There is no other way to describe the day other than it chucked it down, our feet were well and truly soaked before the race began.

Children who are educated together create friendships which last for the rest of their lives, she continued.ldquoWe believe that there are more opportunities for children in integrated education which can provide them with a broader experience a safe, neutral environment where people can mix with each other and help us create a genuine, shared future for everyone.Mrs McAlpine explained the aim locally is to create the new steering group to take the post-primary project forward and write to existing controlled schools to testthey would be interested in transforming to integrated status.She said this would be a ldquofundamental change which may be dficult for some, confirming that existing schools preferred to maintain the collective status quo, the Mid Down steering group would adopt a greenfield approach for a new school.ldquoNICIE will be delighted to support parents in favour of new integrated post-primary provision as in all consciousness we cannot allow the current situation to continue as it is. You have around  children not being able to secure a post-primary place in the integrated sector and I think there is something we can do to redress the imbalance, she said.ldquoWe want to provide provide a much better future for post primary integrated education in the Mid Down area and hope to form a new steering group before Christmas and then contact controlled schools in the New Year to testthey wish to transform to integrated status.ldquoI have asked the Department of Educationwould it start a site search for me and I have an idea where a new school could be located but not a specic site. We currently have an integrated school at Blackwater in Downpatrick which I believe has never had the chance to reach its full potential as its site is quite restricted.Mrs McAlpine added: ldquoI am trying to get something that will enable us,the children would like to transfer, to get everybody on the same site and we would hope to have new post-primary integrated provision in the Mid Down area by , either in an existing school or via a new-build project..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"New principal at Knockevin Special School  ","story":"THE new principal at Knockevin Special School in Downpatrick is looking forward to her new role with relish.While Sara Liddell has been acting principal since the start of the new school term, her appointment as Mrs Anne Cooperrsquos successor was only confirmedrecently and she says she is delighted to be at the helm of a school which has a special place in the heart of the community.Sara always wanted to work in special education and feels privileged to head up a school where work on a much-needed new extension is expected to start next September.The former Down High School student worked at Tor Bank Special School in Dundonald before moving to Knockevin, where she was a teacher and vice-principal for four years before taking over as principal.From Downpatrick, the new principal has a close link with Knockevin as her brother Jamie was educated at the school.ldquoI always wanted to work in special education and wanted to be here in Knockevin because it really is such a special place, said Sara. ldquoWhile I was studying at Stranmillis I did my teaching practice here which was lovely for me.ldquoThere is such warmth in the community for the school which has such a lovely, family feel about it. I obviously knew the school because Jamie came here and know how special it is. I wanted to work in special education because I saw what Jamie was able to achieve.ldquoJamie came through Knockevin and while he has his challenges, he was able to leave school and secure a job a few days a week which is great. My brother learned so much because he was educated here.ldquoThere is so much warmth about this place and I am fortunate to work with a wonderful staff team. Everyone, including pupils and families were so supportive to my family when Jamie was a pupil here. That sparked my interest in special education and was why I always wanted to work in this field, Sara explained.Knockevin is split across two sites, with an Early Years centre in Dundrum catering for  children and  pupils based in Downpatrick with a - strong teaching staff across both locations.ldquoWe are the only special school for a wide geographical area and have pupils coming from as far away as Kilkeel and Newry, with others closer to home coming from the Downpatrick, Ardglass, Strangford, Crossgar and Killinchy areas, the new principal continued.ldquoI am looking forward to my new role and already knowing the staff, pupils and families has been a big help. Knowing I have their genuine support is really wonderful.Given that it is the only special school in the local area, Knockevin is oversubscribed, with Sara explaining her appointment coincides with what she described as a ldquochallenging time.She continued: ldquoWe have a good reputation which has been enhanced with the new early years centre in Dundrum which is a real centre of excellence and we have huge numbers coming through, she continued.ldquoWe are pushed for space in Downpatrick, but Knockevin is in the school enhancement programme and work on a new extension will hopefully start next September, replacing mobile classrooms with a new permanent structure and it is a really exciting time to be part of this.Tendering documents are currently being prepared ahead of the start of building work which is expected to take  months to complete to meet what the new principal described as a ldquohuge need in the area.As Sara settles into her new role, she admits the fact she was vice-principal for four years has made the transition a smooth process.ldquoThere is so much love and warmth for the school across the community and local people are fantastic. May aim moving forward is to harness that warmth to give our pupils lots of new opportunities, she explained.ldquoWe already have a fantastic work experience programme where seniors go out and so many businesses have been so supportive. This is something I really want to build on, strengthening our school links.ldquoWe have been involved in a few projects with the Assumption Grammar in Ballynahinch and St Patrickrsquos Grammar in Downpatrick which produced benefits for everyone involved. As a former Down High student I have been able to establish a link with its student council which is really beneficial.Sara believes that linking Knockevin with other schools is important as it provides young people with an insight into what a special school is ldquodemystying the issues around it. She is also pleased her students can attend other schools to use a range of specialist facilities which provide access to art and drama, science and technology in particular.ldquoIt is amazing how other schools have opened up to us. We are delighted with their support which I believe says a lot about this area. Our staff and parents are also very committed and we are involved in a shared education project with Sacred Heart Primary in Dundrum.Sara added: ldquoOur neighbours at St Colmcillersquos Primary School are also supporting us with the P pupils selecting Knockevin as their chosen charity and when some of the pupils visited us recently they used makaton signing to communicate with some of our students.ldquoI am lucky to be the principal of a school which enjoys the warmth and support of so many people.

Organisers say the service is open to all, not just those who have a relative who took their own le.Ailish Teague, who helped establish Le Change Changes Lives with her husband, Manus, said the service will be held in the charityrsquos new home for the first time.ldquoIt is a joint service organised alongside PIPS and it will be the third we have organised. PIPS initially came up with the idea and asked could they use our new premises which we were delighted to make available, she explained.ldquoThere has been a very good response over the past two years, with the service an evening where people can join together in their grief and remember loved ones collectively. Relatives are alongside others who have experienced the same pain and there is a lot of empathy and understanding.Ailish said the service is open to people from across the district and explained that there will be an opportunity for people to place the names of their loved ones on a Christmas tree.ldquoPeople are given as much time as they need and this can, for some, be a cathartic experience.

It is always a very emotional service and there are very few people who donrsquot know some family that has been touched by it.Ailish explained that all the names placed on the tree this year will be kept and placed alongside those gathered over the past two years with the intention of placing them in a time capsule at some point in the future which will be buried locally.She continued: ldquoChristmas is a dficult time for families and that is why we do not decorate our tree located at the front of our building which looks out on to Market Street. There is no tinsel or lights.ldquoThis time of year can be troubling for many families and we choose not to decorate our tree which is much like the empty chair in many peoplersquos homes as their loved ones are no longer here.Ailish said the tree is decorated by those who have lost their lives, not through suicide, but due to mental health problems and addictions, highlighting the importance of people recognising this.She added: ldquoIt is depression that kills, not the selfish act of an irrational mind. People think suicide is a selfish act, but it is not.ldquoWe are extending an open invitation to next Thursday eveningrsquos service and people who have lost loved ones, regardless of the reason, are welcome to join us.ldquoWe would like them to join us and place a small decoration on the Christmas tree in memory of a loved one.

For the past few years we have been unable to tell Tourism NI or Bord Faacuteilte when our festivals were likely to take place as the local authority does not even have a calendar of events looking forward.ldquoMost festivals run at the same time each year in the Down area and it would not be a dficult task to publish a calendar that would cover a five year period to include both council tourism and community-led events.Cllr Enright believes the introduction of such a calendar would have several benefits, ensuring there would be no overlapping of festivals in the same area, allowing Tourism NI to be aware of them well in advance and local festivals and events appearing in their brochures and in tourism offices at home and abroad.Gerry Casey, from the Ardglass Festival Association, described the current funding mechanism in place for community festivals as ldquoinadequate.He continued: ldquoVillages cannot plan ahead with such short-term annualised funding. The process in the new council makes funding for these festivals precarious and uncertain from year to year and inhibits festival organisers booking in advance to get best prices or being able to secure match funding from where.ldquoThe Ardglass festival has been running for  consecutive years and been funded for  of those. Over the past two years, ours was one of the community festivals that had been unsuccessful in securing council funding.Mr Casey added: ldquoAs we approach our th anniversary, it would be a boostwe knew we had funding in good time, allowing our festival to be included in tourism brochures next year..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/17241849.students-told-to-cherish-the-opportunity-they-have-been-given/resources/images/9115844.jpg","title":"nuj calls for psni investigation into film makers trevor birney and barry mccaffrey to be dropped","story":"The  documentary by Mr. Birney and Mr. McCaffrey broke new ground by publicly naming those it said were suspects.No one has ever been convicted for the killings.They were applauded by a crowd of around  journalists who gathered to show solidarity as they arrived at the Police Service of Northern IrelandrsquosMusgrave Street station in the city centre.ldquoThis is an extraordinarily important day for press freedom in Northern Ireland, he said.ldquoThis is about press freedom but more importantly itrsquos about the Loughinisland families.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community.

Gem is so sociable and would like to say hello to everyone.The couple remember vividly the arrival of their first guide dog puppy, a yellow Labrador retriever named Gilly.ldquoWe were excited, very well prepared, and fell in love with her straight away, said Mrs Arthur. ldquoIt was the most joyful and wonderful experience, but you have to be prepared to put in the hard work to train the puppy.ldquoHanding her back after a year was hard, but we were kept informed of her progress and wersquore proud that she is now a qualied guide dog.The charity is seeking more puppy raisers in the Vale of Glamorgan area. Volunteers need access to a car and must be free to spend time with the puppy for most of the day.

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home.

It is these very services that are now under threat as a direct consequence of year on year under funding.As the proposed cut to the Valersquos budget is below the  per cent threshold, the authority will not receive any further support during the settlement process, Councillor Thomas says.Councillor Thomas says the reduction of pound.million ldquoignores the impact of inflation on council budgets. He said the impact of pay inflation on the council next year will be pound.million..The Vale council is also facing unfunded cost pressures in   of pound.million due to changes in the pension scheme for teachers.Providing for growing numbers of pupils with additional learning needs, and also complying with new Welsh Government legislation, would also cost the council an extra poundmillion which is also unfunded, Councillor Thomas says.Vale councillor Bob Penrose also added that school cutbacks ldquoare inevitable.Cllr Penrose said: ldquoIn July UK Government announced a . per cent rise in teachersrsquo pay which would cover England and Wales.ldquoThis was followed by the announcement of a  per cent increase in employersrsquo contribution to teachersrsquo pensions.ldquoWhat was lacking was an explanation of how this would be paid for.The council has set out its initial budget for  , which says the authority would need to find an additional pound,, in savings next year.That would be on top of pound,, cuts which have already been planned ndash which include a one per cent funding reduction for schools across the Vale.A council tax rise of . per cent for each of the next three years had been assumed in a provisional financial plan published by the council in September. The final level of council tax is not expected to be set until early in .But the council says raising council tax would only cover a small amount of the money it needs to balance the books. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work.

As time is running out, we will also discuss our preparedness for a no-deal scenario.mdash Donald TuskDecember , The European Council president said that Brexit had now been added to the two-day EU summit taking place this week after the events at Westminster.However, Mr Tusk signalled the EU intends to stand firm, stating that the EU would not renegotiate the deal, or backstop measures on the Irish border issue, but would only discuss ldquohow to facilitate UK ratication.Mr Tusk has repeatedly expressed sadness at the prospect of Brexit and its impact on both sides.Jean-Claude JunckerJean-Claude Juncker is backing the Irish government The European Commission president has also made clear that negotiations will not be re-opened.Mr Juncker has made a point of saying the EU will stand firm with the Irish government over backstop arrangements for the Irish border which would see the UK remain subject to the blocrsquos customs rulesno wider trade deal is agreed before the end of a transition period.Leo Varadkar\"Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar The Taoiseach has taken a much tougher stance on Brexit issues since taking over as Irish leader from Enda Kenny in .Heading a minority government and facing possible elections within the next few months, Mr Varadkar cannot afford to be seen to give ground to the UK at home.Citing the need to maintain peace in Northern Ireland, Mr Varadkar has insisted that backstop measures must stay in place after the transition period ldquounless and until a trade agreement is in place.Arlene FosterJust finished a call with the Prime Minister. My message was clear. The backstop must go. Too much time has been wasted. Need a better deal. Disappointed it has taken so long for Prime Minister to listen.mdash Arlene FosterDecember , The DUP leader has been flexing her partyrsquos political muscles over Brexit as Mrs May relies on it for a slender Commons majority.Mrs Foster has insisted that the backstop measures are unacceptable and the DUP cannot support them.However, the DUP has said it will back Mrs Mayshe faces a confidence vote in the Commons, but onlythe EU Withdrawal Agreement is voted down or signicantly changed.Angela MerkelAngela Merkel will meet with the PM The German Chancellor will be a major player in any moves on Brexit.However, she is now a weakened figure after standing down as the leader of her CDU party, but remaining as Chancellor.Mrs Merkel will be a key voice in any softening of the EU line, especially as French President Emmanuel Macron is expected to maintain a tough position.Penny MordauntCould Penny Mordaunt be the next Cabinet minister to resign  The International Development Secretary, and prominent Brexiteer has sounded ambivalent about the Brexit deal at times.At Westminster she is widely seen as the most likely next Cabinet resignation over Brexit.Other leading Brexiteers, Environment Secretary Michael Gove, and International Trade Secretary Liam Fox, have ndash so far ndash publicly backed Mrs Mayrsquos stand.Sir Graham BradyHow many letters are in Sir Grahamrsquos possession  The chairman of the powerful  Committee of Tory backbenchers is the only person who knows how many MPs have put in letters calling for a vote of confidence in Mrs May.If the figure reaches  Tory MPs then a vote would be automatically triggered.Sir Graham said he backed the PMrsquos decision to defer the Brexit vote, but added:ldquoI think itrsquos best to recognise we are in uncertain times. A very dficult point in British politics.Jacob Rees-MoggJacob Rees-Mogg leads the European Research Group The arch-Breexiter believes the chances of a no deal exit from the EU have increased due the Prime Ministerrsquos Commons move.The MP wants a ldquomanaged no deal and has turned up the heat on Mrs May repeatedly insisting a new PM would be needed for such a course of action.Mr Rees-Mogg was widely considered to have overplayed his hand recently when leading figures from the European Research Group of Tory MPs he heads called for backbenchers to put in letters into the  Committee calling for a vote of confidence in Mrs May..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Brexit us key players as week of drama looms article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  comments        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg --\"Most popularMost commentedLoading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos nowMost popularCommentedLoading...Read more         ,CommentsSorry, an error occurred.Thank YouYour complaint has been sent to the site administrators.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentContact UsPhoto SalesNewsquest PrintingAdvertiseArchiveSite MapAnnouncementsLeapExchange and MartDatingTerms  ConditionsPrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyManage ConsentTerms of AdvertisingContributor TermsDiversity StatementIpsoregulatedThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Against the euro, sterling shed % to hit ..European Council president Donald Tusk announced that Brexit has been added to the agenda of a two-day EU summit in Brussels taking place on Thursday and Friday.Mr Tusk said: ldquoWe will not renegotiate the deal, including the backstop, but we are ready to discuss how to facilitate UK ratication. As time is running out, we will also discuss our preparedness for a no-deal scenario.I have decided to call #EUCO on #Brexiton Thursday. We will not renegotiate the deal, including the backstop, but we are ready to discuss how to facilitate UK ratication. As time is running out, we will also discuss our preparedness for a no-deal scenario.mdash Donald TuskDecember , And a spokeswoman for European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker poured cold water on any prospect of a renegotiation of the Withdrawal Agreement.Speaking ahead of Mrs Mayrsquos statement, the spokeswoman said: ldquoThis deal is the best and only deal possible.We will not renegotiate.Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar ruled out reopening talks around the backstop, sayingit was not possible to reopen any aspect of the Withdrawal Agreement without reopening all of it.Addressing the Commons, the Prime Minister accepted that there was ldquowidespread and deep concern among MPs over the backstop arrangement, designed to keep the Irish border openthe EU and UK fail to strike a wider trade deal.WATCH LIVE: PM @Theresa_May gives a statement to the @HouseofCommons https:t.co AiWtkLcFmdash UK Prime MinisterDecember , But she insisted that there was ldquono deal available that does not include the backstop.And she said that none of the alternative outcomes ndash a second referendum, the so-called Norway-plus membership of the single market and customs union or no-deal Brexit ndash could command a majority in the House.Mrs May said she still believed there was ldquoa majority to be won in favour of the Withdrawal Agreement and Political Declaration on future EU UK relations agreed with Brussels after more than  months of negotiations.And she said:ldquoIt is clear that this House faces a much more fundamental question.ldquoDoes this House want to deliver Brexit  Andit does, does it want to do so through reaching an agreement with the EU ldquoIf the answer is yes, and I believe that is the answer of the majority of this House, then we all have to ask ourselves whether we are prepared to make a compromise.ldquoBecause there will be no enduring and successful Brexit without some compromise on both sides of the debate.An anti-Brexit campaigner waves at passing vehicles in Old Palace Yard, Westminster The Government was also looking at ldquonew ways of empowering the House of Commons to ensure that any provision for a backstop has ldquodemocratic legitimacy and to enable the House to place its own obligations on the Government to ensure that the backstop cannot be in place indefinitely, said Mrs May.The remaining two days of a planned five-day debate on Mrs Mayrsquos proposals will be deferred, along with votes on the deal, to a date yet to be fixed.This was being done by a parliamentary procedure which does not require approval from MPs, despite Speaker John Bercow saying it would be ldquodiscourteous to do so.Downing Street was unable to give any indication of when the vote will now be held, saying that this would depend on how quickly Mrs May is able to secure the assurances which will satisfy MPs.A spokesman said there was no plan to extend the two-year Article  process under which the UK will leave the EU on March  , whether or not there is a withdrawal deal.So @jeremycorbyn ndashLabour, as official opposition, lodges motion of no confidence in this incompetent government tomorrow, @theSNP will support  we can then work together to give people the chance to stop Brexit in another vote. This shambles canrsquot go on ndash so how about it mdash Nicola SturgeonDecember , She was briefed on the likely scale of her defeat by chief whip Julian Smith on Monday morning before deciding to ldquoconsult Cabinet colleagues in a conference call on her decision to defer the vote.A Downing Street source said that the PM received ldquostrong support from Cabinet ministers for the postponement, with none opposing the decision.To cries of ldquoresign directed at the Prime Minister from the Labour backbenches, Mr Corbyn told the Commons that ldquofundamental flaws in Mrs Mayrsquos proposals meant she could not simply bring it back next week or in January and hope to win MPsrsquo approval.ldquoThe Government is in disarray,uncertainty is building for business, people are in despair at the state of these failed negotiations and concerned about what it means for their jobs and communities ndash and the fault of that lies solely at the door of this shambolic Government, said the Labour leader.And the Prime Minister was accused by veteran Labour MP Dennis Skinner of being ldquofrit and ldquohanding over power to the EU.Conservative Brexiteer Andrew Bridgen was heckled by some colleagues as he said Mrs May had ldquolost the trust and credibility of the Commons, the country and the EU.The dramatic developments occurred as the European Court of Justiceruled that Britain can unilaterally halt the Brexit process by revoking the Article  letter declaring its intention to leave the EU.The usual Tuesday Cabinet meeting will be held later in the week due to Mrs Mayrsquos travel plans, Downing Street said..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Theresa May to meet Angela Merkel over Brexit deal article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  comments        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg --\"Most popularMost commentedLoading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos nowMost popularCommentedLoading...Read more         ,CommentsSorry, an error occurred.Thank YouYour complaint has been sent to the site administrators.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentContact UsPhoto SalesNewsquest PrintingAdvertiseArchiveSite MapAnnouncementsLeapExchange and MartDatingTerms  ConditionsPrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyManage ConsentTerms of AdvertisingContributor TermsDiversity StatementIpsoregulatedThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Here Emma Deighan scours some of the top NI venues to see how they are catering to the corporate Christmas Arguably the most anticipated social event in the work diary, the Christmas ‘do’ has evolved over the years.And many of Northern Ireland’s top hosts agree and have widened their offering in response.Event managers and venue owners say everything from the format of the Christmas party to its timing have changed to accommodate the demands of employees today. How, when and where we celebrate are top priorities.Take the evening do, for example. For many, that age-old three-course setup doesn’t cut the convenience factor, prompting my employers end the work day early to take advantage of lunch dates. It’s a favourable move that delivers on two fronts – it offers time-poor workers the relief of a shorter day but doesn’t infringe on family obligations.Owner of Bishop’s Gate Hotel in Derry and former president of the Northern Ireland Hotel’s Federation, Ciaran O’Neill agrees. “Christmas has changed over the last number of years for our industry with more businesses looking for lunches, as opposed to the traditional party nights of old,” he said. “We do still have ‘big nights’, but these tend to occur on Fridays and Saturdays.”Ciaran says he has also noted an increase in smaller party sizes over the years.“We are seeing less private large events and more small groups dining with us. Employees are arranging ‘get togethers’ with colleagues or teams that they work directly with.”Bishop’s Gate, which has become Derry’s hospitality jewel attracting the AA Hotel of the Year- accolade, among many other awards, pairs an historic setting with parties for Christmas.The Bullitt Hotel in Belfast is setting the scene for the experience-savvy hipster workforce – and this Christmas Bullitt’s ‘experiences’ reflect the discernment of its guests.General manager at Bullitt, Michael Sullivan has seen a spike in ‘experience’ events, upgrading the turkey feast to a cooler, more casual event.“We have had a number of enquiries for informal gatherings in our Good Room event space, with a festive lunch to follow. The Good Room is the perfect space to blur the lines between work and play for intimate company get togethers ahead of a more traditional Christmas do,” he said.“We’ve also had enquiries for private gin and whiskey tastings and can also organise a number of unique events and team-building activities for groups, from candle-making to chunky knitting workshops for a truly memorable Christmas party.”This December Bullitt has a range of packages to suit private and shared s – from sit-down meals in its restaurant Taylor and Clay to VIP packages in its Baltic Bar or secluded enclaves above in Babel – its rooftop bar. And its ‘Tipsy Tea’ is geared towards the day-time revellers. Prices range from £. to £. a head.“Bullitt has brought something new and exciting to the traditional Christmas party market, with a range of novel spaces set within cool, contemporary surroundings. We like to think that we’re helping to shake up the scene somewhat by offering something a little dferent,” Michael said.If you want to push the boat out with your corporate squad, Titanic Belfast is ready for boarding.

Laura Cowan, head of sales at Titanic Belfast said: “We host bespoke private Christmas party nights, which are tailored to our clients’ needs across all of the Titanic venues – Titanic Belfast , SS Nomadic and the Titanic Exhibition Centre. “These can range from private dining, iconic tailored experiences, drinks receptions and gala dinners.

People increasingly seem to be looking for something out of the ordinary.“We have seen a trend for corporate bookings where companies are looking for alternatives to a traditional evening dinner. For example, our Festive Afternoon Tea is very popular – especially the Champagne iety.

Recruitment firm Hays says among NI-based employers, % said they expect to hire additional staff in the next year, compared to a UK average of %. That’s the highest percentage in the last five years. Meanwhile, % of firms polled said they had experienced some form of skills shortage within the past year, against a UK average of %. The survey also showed that some Northern Ireland employers are finding it harder to recruit staff, due to lower levels of unemployment leading to a rise in wages. John Moore, managing director of Hays in Northern Ireland, said: “Employers in Northern Ireland told us they are pressing ahead with business plans and are generally optimistic about the wider economic climate for the next two to five years. Recruitment expectations are at their highest levels for five years, for both temporary and permanent roles. “Increased competition for talent coupled with skills shortages has helped support above UK-average salary growth in Northern Ireland. While that is positive for those seeking new employment it also has downsides, including negative impacts on productivity, staff morale and the ability to deliver projects. “Given the intense competition and, at times, unrealistic salary requirements from candidates, it’s never been more important for employers to understand the complex factors that influence employee movement. “Salary is still a top consideration, but candidates are now influenced by other benefits, such as le balance and career progression opportunities. However, only % of employers surveyed saw work le balance as a priority, compared with % of employees.” The survey is based on responses from almost , employers and professionals working in a range of industries, including almost  in Northern Ireland.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/les_1.jpg","title":"a word from the wise les mccracken","story":"Posted on Monday  November  by Ulster Business Name: Les McCracken Position: Managing director, McCue Crafted Fit How did you get to the position you are in today I’m a big believer in work ethic. When I was young,  or so, I had a summer job on a farm. I would have milked  cows, morning and night, in addition to general duties around the farm. I was probably working  hours a week at that time, plus cycling five miles back and forth. It has stood me in good stead throughout my le. If you apply yourself, you can do anything.What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  In short, people. They are the greatest assets to a company but they can also be the biggest challenge. I’ve been fortunate enough to build a fantastic team around me at McCue but that has taken time. I’ve been here over  years and we’ve organically grown over that period from  employees and a turnover of £, to  employees and £m. It is also worth noting that in our sector there is a lack of skilled people, when you train them up some leave, which is disappointing but you have to train them and hope they stay. More must be done to engender the younger generation in to these skilled jobs. Too many are still going aimlessly in to third level education not knowing what they want to do, whereas they can earn as you learn in a trade, and that is much needed across the manufacturing sector.How would you describe your management style  I like to think I have a good management style, most of the time I’m very easy going and I do believe in autonomy. I expect those with responsibility to be capable and willing to do their job to the highest of their ability. I also have an open door policy allowing anyone to come and discuss problems but please bring with you a solution too.This allows my team to complete projects around the world from Vienna to Milan to Stockholm. We’ve been very fortunate to work with great brands, both in retail and hospitality, and on some fantastic projects from Ten Trinity Square in London to Danske Bank in Belfast and around Northern Ireland.What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  Of course, who wouldn’t say things could be done dferently, and better  Nobody is perfect, there’s always room for improvement. If I was to work until I was  years old, I would still learn something new every day.Have you done it all on your own  No, of course not. Who does  After  years I’ve a fantastic team who are very competent and trustworthy. But it has taken hard work and graft to get here. Today is very dferent to  years ago and for me I chose the right path. Today, you can enter this sector via a trade, an apprenticeship or a university background it’s about the right fit and enjoying what you do.How would you like your business to be remembered  McCue Crafted Fit is bigger than I. It’s been going for  years and providing unquestionable quality work. Like Jimmy McCue, who set this company up, when I choose to go, I hope to be remembered as a good leader who left the company in the best possible shape. Thirty years is a long time to be managing director and I have seen many changes in skill base, technology from hand drawn floor plans to full colour D fully explosive plans. It certainly has been an interesting three decades or so. I’d also like to note that McCue weathered the recession very well. I took some strategic decisions in  and , which ensured we not only held our own, but grew as a company.What piece of advice would you give to a -year-old you Be patient. Time will come. Don’t think you know everything, as each day you’ll learn something new.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/k11.jpg","title":"kainos sees profits and sales surge","story":"Posted on Monday  November  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland IT firm Kainos has seen a sales and profits surge with revenue rising by % to £.m for the first half of the year. And boss Brendan Mooney says it is “disappointing” that a political argument around Brexit is “over-shadowing” the business case, which is largely supportive of the withdrawal deal currently on the table. The company, which has it headquarters in Belfast, saw adjusted pre-tax profit rising % - from £.m to £.m, in the six months to the end of September. It says much of the increase is down to the expansion of its Workday business throughout Europe. It says “to support the continued expansion with our Workday-related business, in Europe we continue to grow from our recently established offices in Frankfurt and Copenhagen, alongside our existing offices in Amsterdam and Gdansk”. “In North America we continue to expand our presence in Boston and Atlanta and we will open an office in Toronto in the next few weeks.” Brendan Mooney, the firm’s chief executive, told Ulster Business “There is no single reason or new reason .” He said the firms government commercial work was still a very strong part of the business, with a move towards digitalisation. “In Workday, as it rolls out across the world, there is great demand for the service as well. “There is underlying geographical expansion and signicant revenue outside the UK – we are seeing growth across Europe.” The company has grown its workforce to , – up again on the previous year, and has continued to grow. Of that,  workers are based at its Belfast and Londonderry offices which Brendan says “are a very important part of our business, and that trend will continue”. On Brexit, from a company perspective, Brendan says the services it provides to government are “not linked to Brexit”. “For us, it doesn’t get impacted by the Brexit direction – we are pragmatic on that. “In terms of Northern Ireland, the reality is… conversations about a political impact, they are over-shadowing what businesses are talking about and that’s disappointing.” He said looking forward at the next five years, the rise in demand for areas such as machine learning could form a much bigger part of the business.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/chamber_1.jpg","title":"outline your alternative to brexit deal says ni chamber president","story":"Posted on Thursday  November  by John Mulgrew It’s now time for political leaders opposed to a draft withdrawal agreement on Brexit to “outline alternative proposals” as an overwhelming majority of Northern Ireland’s business community back the plans, an industry leader has said. Ellvena Graham, president of the Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said Prime Minister Theresa Mays deal on the table is “definitely much better than a no-deal scenario”. “After a long period of negotiation we now have a draft Withdrawal Agreement which is undoubtedly a welcome step forward for the majority of businesses in Northern Ireland,” she said. “We want the outcome that’s best for businesses, for consumers, for the economy and for the future stability of Northern Ireland – and we’ll do everything we can to ensure that we get it. “We therefore encourage our political representatives who support the draft agreement to do everything in their power to influence political representatives in Britain to join them. “For those that are not in support of the draft agreement, it is now time to outline your alternative proposals. We are willing to listen.” Ms Graham was speaking at the NI Chamber’s President’s Banquet at ICC Belfast. And as Northern Ireland approaches two years without a devolved government, she said that while there is a “vibrant and innovative business community that wants to invest and grow” that it is “stymied because of the prolonged absence of a regional government and the endless Brexit bickering”. Joining Ms Graham at the Banquet was guest speaker Jed Mercurio, creator of BBC hit dramas Bodyguard and Line of Duty.

A deal is on the table, though.Nick says that, aside from issues around getting staff, a transition must be in place after March  for export certicates, otherwise he can’t sell product outside the UK.“I have an ambition to get it to the mid-s . We are growing our EBITA from the £m average to about £m.”Pre-tax profits have cracked the £m mark in the last year, while turnover has soared by almost £m to £m.Nick says he turned his attention to attracting back some of the farmers which it has lost to other competitors.“At one point we had a billion litres of milk, now it’s around  million. We hadn’t been paying a particularly good milk price. “What ithad done is invested in itself quite heavily, and invested in the future, and had made a really brave strategic decision in , long before I came here, to get out of producing milk powders, and getting in to cheese and whey.“Now, that cost them £m to do that. That was really brave.“The first thing we did was get out to farmers, and explain to them what their business was.“We have paid a leading milk price, and that has brought genuine pride.“We needed to get into the business. The most fundamental change – it’s a people agenda. We were a very centralised business and all decisions came from the top, and went out.“Now, we have put the business into seven strategic business units and we are getting more adept with strategy, day-to-day, and developing people within the business to take ownership.”Nick says it’s about getting the right people into the business, and helping mentor and develop strong teams to ensure Dale Farm’s success.“We have spent a lot of money on additional people in the business. It’s not about numbers, it’s not about capacity, it’s about capability. We are really trying to find world-class people. gtHe said the firm will spend another £m on its people this year. Meanwhile, data and decision making is another area it’s expanding and developing. gt“We have a little bit of latency in the business, and I’m saying how do I get live information to those people ”That includes looking at new markets and products. Nick says the business had been focusing on the macro, and perhaps missed potential opportunities.“We have massive opportunities for growth,” he said. “The EBITA growth isn’t necessarily about growing your top-line, although it will grow a bit. We process  million litres of milk. Are you making sure you are making products which will give you the most profit from that – the answer to that is no.“We can switch categories and products, and we can make a whole lot more money with the  million litres. “It’s looking at consumer trends by getting out of commoditised type products and getting in to more value-added products. That’s about understanding your consumer.”He said the business has made “serious traction” in the last two years, as a company. As for growth in the future, with March  around the corner, Nick says it will continue “as long as there isn’t something mad and disruptive from Brexit”.“That could happen. A ‘no deal’ and no transition Brexit is mad and disruptive and changes everything. I don’t think people have really looked at it, and really understand what it means. We have looked at it, and it’s very challenging.”For Dale Farm, Nick’s Brexit concerns centre around staff and people – with around % of the workforce EU nationals.Nick says the company has struggled to get lorry drivers when milk supply is at its peak.But for Dale Farm, and other food processors, there is a concern over the certication process, following Brexit. “It’s basically an export certicate for dairy products. You are not allowed to export without this certicate,” Nick says.“For example, we have signed a quite public announcement with Lidl. We are supplying Lidl all over the world. If Lidl were to ask me in the morning, can you guarantee that you can supply my countries outside the UK on April   I actually can’t.“It’s nothing to do with tarfs or costs. If I don’t have animal health export certicates approved well-ahead of Brexit – these things take about six months to negotiate.“I’m screaming at DEFRAand DAERAhere to get this done now.”“Why don’t you agree the wording, and have the work done, so when the agreement is or isn’t made… now you can start. “It’s a huge risk for this industry here,we can’t get stuff off the island.”Around % of Northern Ireland’s dairy output goes to the EU and the rest of the world. “In milk, milk keeps flowing. We can’t say to farmers ‘we can’t sell the product, can’t get the certicates, tell the cows to take a break for a few weeks’. It doesn’t happen.“I’m going to have to reassess... ‘how long can I survive not selling my % of dairy off the island ’“If there is a no-transition no-deal Brexit it will be really bad for business. Supply chains will be severely disputed and you’ll have a shortage of products everywhere.” ■View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/sk_123.jpg","title":"more than  of business group members back brexit withdrawal deal","story":"Posted on Monday December  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland’s business community has overwhelming thrown its weight behind a withdrawal agreement on Brexit – with almost % of one major lobby group’s members in favour, it can be revealed.The CBI, Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce, Federation of Small Businesses and IoD are among the groups which have backed the deal on the table. Meanwhile, farming unions in Northern Ireland and throughout the UK have also issued their support for the deal.It would essentially provide a backstop, and create a deeper customs union between Northern Ireland the EU, along with a closer alignment in the single market.Stephen Kelly, chief executive of Manufacturing NI says that the agreement is “the only show in town.”He said a poll of its members showed .% of those who replied were in support.“This is the only show in town. The rules are clear – in order for the UK to move to the most productive discussion on what the future relationship will be, we need a withdrawal agreement. The options are the agreement, or no deal,” he told Ulster Business.“Business in Northern Ireland and agri-business have made it clear that no deal is not an option.”Other business groups backing the proposed agreement include the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, Retail NI, Hospitality Ulster and the Freight Transport Association.Writing in the Belfast , Prime Minister Theresa May said Northern Ireland will thrive under the proposed Brexit deal, and its position as part of the UK “is guaranteed”.She said her agreement with Brussels “puts Northern Ireland in a fantastic position for the future”, and moved to reassure unionists that “Northern Ireland’s constitutional status as part of the United Kingdom is guaranteed.“Under this deal the future is certainly bright for Northern Ireland.”On the backstop, Ms May said three things made it “an acceptable insurance policy”.She said the transition period could be extended instead of entering the backstop, regulations would be the same across all of the UK, and Northern Ireland would not be treated dferently.Meanwhile, in a joint statement, the Ulster Farmers’ Union, NFU Scotland, NFU England and NFU Cymru, said:“The draft Brexit withdrawal agreement, while not perfect, will ensure that there are no hard barriers on the day we leave the European Union, and will allow trade in agricultural goods and UK food and drink to continue throughout the transition period largely as before.
