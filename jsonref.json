But that isn’t breaking any rulesFor any author, being able to describe yourself as a bona fide bestseller is key to conferring your career with a certain gravitas – and will often bring you even more sales. In the UK, while most book charts are tallied by Nielsen BookScan, the Sunday Times bestseller list – like the New York Times chart in the US – has become the gold standard. But making the bestseller list isn’t necessarily as straightforward as tallying sales. Not all is fair in romance and war (and other genres) when it comes to getting to the top of the charts.Take the case of Mark Dawson, a British writer who just over a week ago hit No 8 on the Sunday Times hardback list with his thriller The Cleaner, released by the independent publisher Welbeck at the end of June. This is a great achievement for any author or small publishing house, but Dawson had done something remarkable: he bought 400 copies of his own book, at a cost of £3,600, to push his sales high enough to make the top 10.On the latest episode of his Self Publishing Show podcast, Dawson explained why he did it. When Nielsen released its midweek chart, Dawson had realised that The Cleaner was sitting at No 13, having sold around 1,300 copies that week – just outside the coveted top 10. He hit on the idea of buying the book himself in the UK, to sell to readers overseas. “We’d like to get to the top 10 … we’ve been trying to think of ways we can do that that would count those sales as sales for the chart,” he said.After sending an email to gauge interest, around 400 people in the US said they would buy the book if he bought the copies himself first. So Dawson went to a children’s bookshop in Salisbury. “I said, ‘would you be interested if I placed an order for 400 hardbacks of my own book?’,” said Dawson on the podcast. “They were like, ‘Yes, of course.’”Several authors on social media have since shared their concerns over Dawson’s strategy, including thriller writer Clare Mackintosh, who said it was “disingenuous” that Dawson, when celebrating his top 10 spot on Twitter, had not also shared that he had personally bought almost a quarter of the books that got him there. Dawson maintained he was just fulfilling orders, though on his podcast he specified that he had expressions of interest from abroad rather than firm sales.But if it is not against the rules to buy your own book, is it morally and ethically correct? Some might argue that bestseller lists are not indicative of a meritocracy anyway the big publishers use their clout to push certain books through advertising and PR campaigns, and will fork out to have their titles placed in the most lucrative positions in bookshops as standard practice. Dawson is just taking on the risk himself. But to buy your way on to the charts also feels undemocratic. With median earnings for UK authors being just under £10,500 a year, paying more than a third of that to secure a bestseller tag angles what should be a level playing field towards those writers privileged enough to be able to personally afford it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c114f503bf2c64521712b90ff005f88f5400982c/0_0_2666_1600/master/2666.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d9d03c2cc00b7817724d329afe36d2df","title":"hermes to create 10000 new jobs as delivery business soars","story":"Firm spends £30m expanding operations as home shopping benefits from lockdownParcel delivery firm Hermes is creating more than 10,000 jobs as it gears up to cope with the shift to home shopping during the coronavirus pandemic.The company says it wants 9,000 more couriers, most of whom are classed as self-employed and so not guaranteed the legal minimum wage, full sick pay or holiday benefits. It will also hire 1,500 full-time staff, including some roles at its head office in Yorkshire as well as warehouse workers, managers and supervisors.It currently employs 4,515 staff and 20,000 couriers.Hermes has ploughed £30m into expanding its operations this year, including buying vans and opening depots, as home shopping surged during the high street lockdown.High demand for delivery services is expected to extend into the second half of the year, with the volume of parcels being handled by Hermes set to almost double to 3.5m a day during Black Friday and the run-up to Christmas – the busiest trading period.While high street stores including Marks \u0026amp Spencer, John Lewis and Boots have been laying off thousands of staff, delivery firm DPD has said it would hire 6,000 workers, including HGV drivers, warehouse staff, managers and support staff such as mechanics. The new hires are part of a £200m investment in expanding its next-day parcel delivery service.Martijn de Lange, the chief executive of Hermes UK, said: “The pandemic has expedited the already phenomenal growth of online shopping and we see no sign of this changing. As a result, it is important that we have the right infrastructure and people in place to support this. This is good news for the many people who have sadly had their income affected and we are pleased to be able to support the UK economy with so many jobs at this time.”He said that in the first fortnight of lockdown Hermes had thousands of applications from pub staff, chefs, dog walkers, hairdressers, pilots and others who had been furloughed or laid off because businesses had been forced to close, and he hoped to welcome more in the coming weeks."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3402045129074e2c37be3b415078276436dc05e6/31_0_1690_1015/master/1690.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=23a0c9cd919f3ebf6078c0459790712f","title":"uk seeing v shaped recovery says bank of england economist","story":"Andy Haldane, however, clashes with fellow MPC member Silvana Tenreyo over economyThe Bank of England’s chief economist, Andy Haldane, has insisted that Britain is enjoying a V-shaped recovery, despite concerns among rival central bank policymakers that the economy is struggling after high-profile job cuts that are expected to send unemployment higher.Haldane, who has become a controversial figure in recent months for his comments that the UK is in the middle of a quick turnaround, said the UK economy had recovered about half of the massive fall in output that took place in March and April when the Covid-19 lockdown was most intense.Tenreyro said the threat of rising unemployment meant Britain’s economy was probably heading for an incomplete V-shaped recovery.Speaking to members of the Treasury select committee, the London School of Economics academic said she was less confident than Haldane about the signals from experimental “fast” indicators that he cited as the basis for his optimistic view of the recovery so far.“Spending is going to suffer because of the perceived health risks and this will feed into higher unemployment and lower incomes,” Tenreyro said, adding that the UK faced a downward spiral as lower incomes in turn caused lower levels of employment.Tenreyro voted to increase the Bank of England’s stimulus programme at the last meeting of the MPC in June, while Haldane voted to preserve the current level of the Bank’s intervention.Haldane also said the UK could face inflation pressures after the coronavirus crisis even if unemployment remained high, owing to a potential lack of qualified workers for jobs that remain in demand.He said he saw both upside and downside risks to inflation over the medium term. “There has been some fracturing of domestic and global supply chains, raising the costs of some goods and services. And it is possible a higher long-term equilibrium rate of unemployment could cause the earlier re-emergence of wage pressures.”But Tenreyro disputed his outlook, saying that while a no-deal Brexit may cause a temporary barrier to goods arriving from the EU, triggering a spike in prices, the trend was for consumers to be reticent about spending, forcing firms to cut prices.“In June I judged that demand was falling behind supply and there needed to be a further stimulus from the Bank,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/955ffddc8daeee9d22becaed381b3100c5ffba3c/0_151_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4f9ced14cb529260a705ef18cb4d8922","title":"glaxosmithkline makes bold move with 130m covid 19 investment","story":"GSK’s share price has been left standing by AstraZeneca’s high-risk success in cancer treatmentsMonday’s most important vaccine news was the promising early data from the Oxford University and AstraZeneca coronavirus trial – “robust immune responses” is encouraging. But let’s not overlook other vaccine developments. The industry has been viewed for years as a dull subsector of the pharmaceutical business now it is a whir of deal-making activity.CureVac, alongside the likes of fellow German group BioNTech and Moderna of the US, is a pioneer of the messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) approach to vaccine development. Instead of injecting an antigen to trigger an immune response, the approach tries to encourage the body itself to produce the necessary protein. It’s pioneering stuff but, if it works, the idea is that development and production schedules could shorten radically.GSK will not have a role on CureVac’s Covid-19 programme, though it will obviously have exposure via the equity stake. Instead, the prime interest will come via five research projects for which GSK is providing £104m of funding. Those programmes are yet to be named but, if they are successful, the milestone payments would be multiples of the initial sum. So there is potential for this to be a big deal.GSK’s share price was virtually unmoved since the adventure is still only a long-term bet that carries obvious scientific uncertainties. But it is further evidence of GSK’s increased willingness to take more punts, even if, on this occasion, the other rationale will be to defend a historic strength in vaccines (for shingles, meningitis and so on).A greater appetite for risk-taking investments has paid off spectacularly for AstraZeneca in oncology in the past five years. GSK, which has been left standing in share price terms, now seems to be taking the same bolder approach under chief executive Emma Walmsley. There are no guarantees, but being big in vaccines suddenly looks a much-needed point of advantage for GSK.Marks \u0026amp Spencer has been in restructuring mode for about two decades, so there’s no surprise that Covid-19 should produce more of the same. Most traditional retailers, from John Lewis to Boots, are in retreat and M\u0026ampS chief executive Steve Rowe had signalled job cuts in the offing in May with his “never the same again” riff on the pandemic’s effect on shopping habits.If anything, the intended loss of 950 jobs at M\u0026ampS from a workforce of 78,000 probably counts as a smaller retrenchment than feared given the corporate ambition to complete three years’ worth of restructuring in 12 months. Store management posts, plus head office roles in property and operations, are the target this time.Shareholders, then, can expect more exceptional charges. To put it mildly, the “adjustments to reported profits” line tends to be busy at M\u0026ampS. An astonishing £1.9bn of adjustments (always downwards, naturally) have been clocked up in the past five years as stores have closed, the value of freeholds been written down and so on. The end to restructuring, unfortunately, is not yet in sight.Roll up, roll up, who wants to buy Asda? Or, if you don’t fancy the whole thing, how about an ownership slice? Yes, US parent Walmart is looking for buyers or investors for its supermarket chain again, having received “renewed inbound interest”.It is hard, though, to believe the pandemic has boosted Asda’s value. Becalmed share prices among the quoted UK supermarket chains tell the story: extra online demand from shoppers has not translated into a profits boom because operating costs have also soared.An investor in Asda at this point must also assume consolidation among the big four UK chains is impossible. The Competition and Markets Authority rightly killed a planned takeover by Sainsbury’s last year and its analysis may apply for a generation. Walmart will find somebody if it drops its valuation of Asda low enough, but there’s an air of desperation about this on-off auction."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2c4509b47aee5052bf73cda0fd59abd9ea56d40d/0_346_6024_3615/master/6024.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7a077ade74ad35f4d02958f7d97ef920","title":"israel west bank two state solution palestine","story":"The future of Israel-Palestine lies in it becoming a federal democracy with liberal valuesFor now, the coronavirus crisis appears to have stayed Israel’s outright annexation of the West Bank. Benjamin Netanyahu’s corruption trial – he’s been accused of bribery, fraud and “breach of trust” – has been newly invigorated, a development that may further delay the announcement. But talk of annexation is beside the point. Fifty-three years of occupation and settlements have produced their own reality. Ironically, it is a reality that may give hope to those who seek justice in Israel-Palestine.For many in the movement for Palestinian rights, the Oslo process – which began in 1993 and was ostensibly designed to produce a Palestinian state alongside Israel – appeared too limited in its ambitions. The Palestinian struggle has evolved from being a struggle for national rights, a 19th-century ideal, to one focused on human rights, a timeless, universal ideal. Indeed, while there are Palestinians who are committed to an ethnic Palestinian state, many are not. Personal dignity, an inclusive state, the freedom to preserve cultural identities (or not), freedom of movement and the pursuit of a life lived free of racial or ethnic fetters – those are our ideals.Nor is this state of things reversible. I recall being a young boy in Rafah, a camp in Gaza where I was born. Sometimes I would ride my bike to the beach past a Jewish settlement called Rafiah Yam. The only time I would glimpse the people who lived there was at the seashore. The settlers occupied a private space isolated by fence and wire. But it didn’t last very long. In 2005 the Israeli government chose to remove 8,000 Jewish settlers from among more than a million Palestinians. The ensuing national fight and trauma propelled the settler movement with new energy, and they successfully redoubled their efforts in the West Bank and Jerusalem. Who will remove 650,000 settlers from these areas? One may ask, controversially among Palestinians, whether it should even be done.In other words, the egg is scrambled. Reconstructing the yolk is an impossible task, but frankly, it is also not an edifying one. The vision for a single, liberal, democratic state in Palestine-Israel is a positive one. It is the only possible outcome given initial conditions, but it is also the most desirable outcome. Simply, it accords with a modern understanding of what a liberal state can be.People who study political solutions to ethnic conflict – most notably Brendan O’Leary and Arend Lijphart – catalogue different methods of organising democracies. One criticism of majoritarianism, the system in the United States, is that it enables extremist positions in the pursuit of electoral success. The theory is that winner-takes-all systems promote resentments and deepen fissures.In deeply ided societies such as Israel-Palestine, scholars suggest that power-sharing constitutional arrangements may promote the kinds of cooperation necessary for achieving just outcomes for Palestinians and Israelis. Northern Ireland is a good example of what liberal values, political will and well-considered institutions can yield.While no system of liberal, democratic government is perfect, one could imagine what democracy in Israel-Palestine could look like. The country may be organised into four federal units: Gaza, the West Bank, the Galilee and Coast, and the Naqab or Negev. Two states will be majority-Palestinian and two states will be majority-Jewish, a likely necessary concession to the country’s legacy of ethnic conflict. Federal elections would distribute power on a proportional party basis, while each federal unit may exercise limited decision-making authority on certain matters. Mandatory national service required of all citizens could help forge a coherent, post-conflict identity rooted in common histories and experience. Trade with Europe and the Arab countries will help to secure the country’s prosperity while freedom of movement and association across the country may allow a more integrated identity to emerge in time.Critics may charge that this vision is utopian. And it is. Yet it is no more idealistic than the assertion that all men are created equal. Countries may not always adhere to their constitutional principles, yet those lofty principles serve a purpose. They act to guide jurors and legislators as they undertake their effortful, inevitably flawed work in pursuit of more just societies. Those efforts, it should be said, take many, many years to bear fruit. Yet our responsibility to our children requires that we take our first, perhaps halting, steps into our common future today.• Ahmed Moor is a Palestinian-American writer and recipient of the Paul \u0026amp Daisy Soros Fellowship for New Americans"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/60c0306a8b7b7120f03e1fdaba555b02e9705933/0_68_5700_3420/master/5700.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=950e2f644468aca64e5291888083d03f","title":"why cosmetic surgery on rise hours staring at ourselves zoom","story":"After months of video calls, there has been a global boom in demand for cosmetic surgery.

And what we are seeing staring back at us on the Zoom grid of doom isn’t pretty.The enormous teeth, the wan cheeks and lashless eyes, the bulbous chins and domed, probing noses. The slumped shoulders, low boobs and fleshy arms. In its low resolution inertia, every scheduled meeting is like the blooper reel from Paranormal Activity.

Instead of struggling to maintain traditional beauty standards – sharp bone structure, full lips, big eyes, clear brows, radiant skin – we should simply shave off any protuberances before the evil fish-eye lens of the laptop camera can pick them up and warp them.

The study examines how the bears will be affected under two different greenhouse gas emissions scenarios. The researchers found that under a business-as-usual emissions scenario, polar bears will likely probably only remain in the Queen Elizabeth Islands – the northernmost cluster in Canada’s Arctic archipelago – at the end of the century. And even if greenhouse gases are moderately mitigated, it is still likely that the majority of polar bear populations in the Arctic will experience reproductive failure by 2080.Scientists estimate that there are fewer than 26,000 polar bears left, spread out across 19 different subpopulations that range from the icescapes of Svalbard, Norway, to Hudson Bay in Canada to the Chukchi Sea between Alaska and Siberia. Polar bears are unable to find enough sustenance on land and rely on sea ice from which to hunt. They often stake out seal breathing holes in the ice, waiting hours for a blubbery meal to break the surface. But as that sea ice declines because of climate change, so, too, will the polar bears.“It’s been clear for some time that polar bears are going to suffer under climate change,” said Péter Molnár, a biologist at the University of Toronto Scarborough, and lead author of the study. “But what was not fully clear was when we would expect major declines in the survival and reproduction of polar bears that could ultimately lead to their extirpation. We didn’t know whether that would happen early or later in this century.”To figure out when bears might reach their critical physiological limit, Molnár and his colleagues estimated how thin and fat polar bears can be and modelled the animals’ energy use to derive the threshold number of days they can fast before cub and adult survival rates decline. Then they combined those thresholds with the projected number of future sea ice-free days to determine how populations will be affected in different parts of the Arctic.“Even if we mitigate emissions, we are still going to see some subpopulations go extinct before the end of the century,” Molnár said. This includes the polar bears in the vulnerable, southernmost ice areas of western Hudson Bay, Davis Strait, and southern Hudson Bay. “But we would have substantially more populations persisting by the end of the century, even with reduced reproduction, compared with a business-as-usual emissions scenario.”Of those studied populations, polar bears in southern Hudson Bay and Davis Strait in Canada are “very likely” to experience reproductive failure by 2040 in a scenario of unmitigated emissions. Polar bears in much of Alaska and Russia will be in serious trouble by 2080. And by 2100, it’s inevitable that these populations will experience reproductive failure, leading to extinction if countries don’t drastically reduce emissions of heat-trapping gases.“It’s important to highlight that these projections are probably on the conservative side,” said Steven Amstrup, chief scientist for Polar Bears International and a co-author of the study. The models, he explained, may assume a better-than-reality body condition of the bears at the start of fasting periods. And the team used a cautious baseline estimate for how much energy a bear uses to maintain its body condition. “The impacts we project are likely to occur more rapidly than the paper suggests.”Unlike other species threatened by hunting or deforestation, polar bears can only be saved if their habitat is protected, which requires tackling climate change at a global level. Previous research has shown that even if we reduce greenhouse gas emissions tomorrow, it will still take another 25 to 30 years for sea ice extent to stabilise because of all the carbon dioxide already in the atmosphere. It’s important that the public understand the urgency of the issue, Amstrup said. But a timeline for possible extirpation was also an important tool for managers in northern communities living alongside polar bears.“It shows where we would expect to see increased human-bear conflict,” said Andrew Derocher, a biology professor at the University of Alberta who heads the Polar Bear Science Lab and is unaffiliated with the study. Not all Arctic communities have programmes in place to deal with more polar bears in their localities. And there is a moral question of whether humans should help struggling bears.“With something like polar bears, where you’re not going to get their habitat back, it’s not clear we’re going to try to hold on to these populations everywhere. If we start to see a large number of bears on land dying of starvation, what kind of interventions would we get into?”Derocher said polar bear managers needed to work out whether they would provide supplementary feed for the bears, or relocate them to regions that still had ice.“You look at the fallout from one video of a starving bear. Well, imagine going to Churchill, Manitoba – a hub of polar bear tourism – and seeing 50 bears walking around like that.

He talks about how he coped with the early attention, working with Kevin Spacey, and why he loves playing bad guysHaley Joel Osment thought he was finished for the day. It was 1998 and the 10-year-old was shooting The Sixth Sense, directed by M Night Shyamalan. With 10 minutes left on set, they wanted to squeeze in a short scene. It required Osment’s terrified character, who, memorably, sees dead people, to confront a bloody ghost. Osment had to get into the right mindset, fast. The young actor threw himself against a door, again and again, until he was sufficiently shaken. “If they’d known I was going to do it, they probably would have stopped me,” he says of Shyamalan and the other adults on set. “It came to me spontaneously – and I guess it worked.”I see little of that intensity in the 32-year-old man facing me via Zoom. Still boyish-looking, despite a dark beard, Osment is upbeat and quick to laugh. He returned to his home town of Los Angeles last autumn, after 13 years in New York, and found this house a week before lockdown, when he was shooting a forthcoming series of Goliath for Amazon. After the extraordinary success of The Sixth Sense – a box office phenomenon, his performance lauded by critics and rewarded with an Oscar nomination, while his character’s most famous line quickly became a catchphrase – he has enjoyed a different kind of career lately. He works steadily, on screen but somehow under the radar, probably not recognised as the Sixth Sense kid by most of his audiences.In recent years, he has appeared on TV in What We Do in the Shadows, The Kominsky Method, Silicon Valley, Teachers and The Boys. Last year he had a supporting role in the Ted Bundy film Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile. Since lockdown, he says, there has been “endless opportunity for quiet reflection at home”, including on his time as a child star.Though his father, Eugene, was an actor (and ran a theatre on Santa Monica Boulevard), Osment fell into acting by chance, after being spotted at the age of four in Ikea. His first screen appearance was in an ad for Pizza Hut in 1993, which led to him being approached by the casting director for Forrest Gump. Forrest Jr was only a small part for five-year-old Osment, but his screen test with Tom Hanks still circulates on social media, thanks to their heartwarming double act – and Osment’s cuteness.Shyamalan had worried that Osment was too much of a “cherub” to cast in The Sixth Sense. But the boy was also serious-minded and precocious. For Osment’s final audition of three for The Sixth Sense, he wore a suit. The director has said he was moved to tears by the boy’s vulnerability and depth, especially in his delivery of the now-classic line: “I see dead people.”“I’d been working with it for such a long time, the material was really ready by the time I saw him,” Osment says. His dad had helped him to prepare for the audition and shaped his early career. “His relationship to the craft was so resistant to doing stuff that didn’t have a purpose and wasn’t quality work,” says Osment. “There’s always going to be plenty of opportunities to bail out for a big pay cheque … so to have someone like that, who really cared about protecting artistic value before I was old enough to understand what that meant, was such an important influence.”On set, Osment was also bolstered by Shyamalan and his co-star, Bruce Willis. “I don’t think I could have done it, had there not been that sense that they believed in me.” Although Shyamalan himself was only 28, and under pressure to deliver on his multimillion dollar script, he did not push that on to his cast, says Osment. “I remember him dribbling a basketball from his director’s chair between lighting changes. He just projected calm.”Willis, too, was convinced of the film’s success, telling Shyamalan that he had felt the same way in making Pulp Fiction. There was the sense that “we were building this story together”, Osment says. In those pivotal early years, he says he never felt manipulated, or negatively motivated to perform. “That’s why it’s still something that I love doing, almost 30 years later.”Then Osment found himself back at school, where “the big news of fifth grade” was Nintendo 64 and a new Star Wars film. It was an undeniable “shift in gear”, he says, but one that felt natural to navigate. He was not treated as a celebrity and because The Sixth Sense was classified as unsuitable for children under the age of 13, he says: “Most kids in my class didn’t even see it.”Osment’s younger sister, Emily, 28, had “a way tougher path” to fame, says Osment, playing Miley Cyrus’s best friend, Lilly, on the Disney Channel’s Hannah Montana. “That show was squarely aimed towards creating a mania in that age group. She had to deal with a lot more strange invasions of privacy, not being able to have a normal school life. And what exacerbated all of that was she had to be on social media. I resisted until I was, like, 27.”In 2006, aged 18, Osment moved to New York to study experimental theatre at New York University. His parents wanted him to go to college and Osment wanted the college experience. “I did work that practically nobody saw for a long time, which was not a great career move – but, ultimately, was important for me to figure out whether this was what I truly wanted to do for the rest of my life,” he says.In 2008, he made his Broadway debut, playing a heroin addict in a revival of David Mamet’s American Buffalo, to mixed reviews. Post-graduation, in 2011, a spate of oddballs and villains followed, from an obnoxious millionaire in the film Entourage to a greasy-haired Nazi in Kevin Smith’s Yoga Hosers and a virgin teacher in Sex Ed. “That was definitely a very fun period of playing a lot of bad guys,” says Osment. He agrees it might have been a belated rebellion against his angelic childhood image: in fact, Osment says, he grew a beard “to try to hide in public. That didn’t really work at all.”His public path through adolescence was “free of major indiscretion”, as the New Yorker approvingly put it. In 2006, driving while drunk, he overturned his car, for which he was fined, sentenced to rehabilitation and put on probation for three years. But that was the “terrible mistake” of an arrogant teenager in car-centric Los Angeles, says Osment. “It could not have had less to do with Hollywood.”The popular narrative of the child star may be the “spectacular blowup”, he agrees, “but I think the percentage of people having a positive experience working as children is much higher than most people imagine.” You just don’t hear about the child actors who “move on to something else that works for them”, or who have such long careers their youthful roles recede in the rear view, says Osment.“Being an actor, you can never count on things being smash successes all the time. I remember having that feeling with The Sixth Sense – like, ‘It’s not always gonna be like that.’” He hopes his next move will be behind the scenes, into writing and directing, which was part of his motivation for returning to Los Angeles, he says.Even as he begins the next stage of his career, he does not resent being asked about the past. “I’m lucky to have a positive relationship with those periods that can sometimes be difficult for other people.” When it comes to his early success, he says: “I feel like I’m always building on it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a21d06fb8a9aecfd719e45ac2b367905cda8a1de/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=67928f73a5e8dda2f936e260a37e68bd","title":"netflix top movies most streamed top 10","story":"The streamer has revealed its biggest ever original movies, cluing us in on what does and doesn’t work within its ever-growing libraryNetflix’s once heavily guarded vault of secret statistics has slowly opened up over the last couple of years, a gradual juicy reveal of viewer habits with some major caveats.This week after a quarterly earnings call, the site’s 10 biggest ever original film hits were revealed to Bloomberg, an intriguing dump of information that tells us as much about what isn’t included as it does about what is. Two things to note: the following stats refer to the first four weeks of release and while post-reveal, Netflix has now claimed its new graphic novel adaptation The Old Guard will reach 72m households within its first four weeks, it’s only been out for 10 days so it’s not being included here.While the success of the Chris Hemsworth-led Bangladesh-set action thriller Extraction is an impressive win for all involved (a sequel is on the way), it’s one that needs a certain amount of couching. The film, which sees the Thor star play a black market mercenary, was launched on 24 April this year, a date that has theatrically become known as the start of the summer season (last year Avengers: Endgame was released on the 22nd), a prime slot that this year, with cinemas closed, drove blockbuster-seekers online. Over a month into lockdown, with Netflix viewership inevitably soaring, the arrival of a snazzy new release was transformed into a major event. The combination of a star name and an action-heavy premise would surely have made Extraction a hit regardless but the scale of its numbers reflects an audience craving flashy escapism during a difficult time. It remains a huge turning point for Hemsworth, though, who has struggled outside of the Marvel universe (his many flops include Rush, Men in Black: International, Ghostbusters, Bad Times at the El Royale, Blackhat and In the Heart of the Sea) and together with the success of Chris Evans’ Apple drama Defending Jacob (reportedly their second-biggest show to date), it suggests that our more newly crowned A-listers would be wise to stick to streaming.Continuing what’s now a pretty glaringly winning formula of big stars matched with big action released at a time when audiences are extra eager for something to watch, is a win for Michael Bay’s frenetic franchise-starter 6 Underground. Led by Ryan Reynolds, who post-Deadpool has found himself to be not only a bankable leading man again but a reliably efficient one-man marketing machine, the film was mostly loathed by critics but at-home viewership was considerable, turning it into a major hit last December. His Twitter presence was a definite cause of his satirical superhero success and it also helped push this to big numbers in a month that’s now a desirable slot for the platform’s bigger projects.Last summer, as many of us bemoaned the fall of the movie star, with A-listers flopping on the big screen, Jennifer Aniston and Adam Sandler showed that their fans hadn’t disappeared, they were just staying home instead. Murder Mystery, a goofy comedy about a couple caught up in a conspiracy while on holiday, quickly became one of the platform’s biggest hits, easily outpacing Sandler’s other Netflix projects. The actor, who has since been met with his best reviews to date for Uncut Gems, signed a considerable deal with Netflix five years ago, arguably the first major big-screen actor to understand the long-term benefits of partnering with a streaming platform. Murder Mystery has been by far his biggest film with the streamer, a sign of the huge fanbase that Aniston carries with her, one that’s only grown since the second life of Friends.Another example here of movie star sway matched with action set pieces yet one supported by a tad more prestige than the other examples higher up on the list. JC Chandor, who found acclaim with Margin Call, All is Lost and A Most Violent Year, ironically decided to make his biggest film to date for Netflix, the sturdy Colombia-set heist thriller Triple Frontier, that used Ben Affleck’s A-list credentials to attract an impressive 63 million viewers last spring. Solidly entertaining and made with more panache than the average Netflix original, the film really did feel like a theatrical pic that viewers missed on the big screen but could watch at home instead. It’s also another reminder of how Affleck’s fanbase interacts with his work, coming just two years after his thriller The Accountant surprised pundits by becoming 2017’s most-rented film, both signs that, like many other stars on this list, the small screen might be the safest place for him in the future.The Wrong Missy, a critically loathed comedy devoid of big star names, has managed to scrape its way inside the bottom of the list thanks to the same major event that lifted three other titles: the coronavirus. Released on 13 May, two months into lockdown at a point when new films were starting to feel scarce, its 59 million viewers are less symbolic of the appeal of stars David Spade and Lauren Lapkus and more a sign of the stranglehold Netflix has had on what we’re watching this year. What many critics seem to agree on, though, is that the film works best as a decent showcase for the talents of Lapkus, a comedian known by most for her role in Orange is the New Black. Netflix has a strong track record of nurturing a stable of talent and it’s likely that we’ll see her in more of their upcoming comedies.Another quarantine success here but one that deserves a heartier pat on the back as The Platform is also the only foreign language film on the list, an impressive achievement given the streamer’s growing number of international offerings. So what attracted more people to a grim buzz-free horror than Alfonso Cuarón’s Oscar-winning Roma? The gory Spanish-language film arrived on 20 March without fanfare yet its tale of a dystopian future where people must fight over food to survive proved horribly well-timed. As the recent renewed success of Contagion has proved, many of us have been craving fiction that errs close to the reality we’re now faced with and while The Platform is a more extremist vision than most, it still offered enough claustrophobic paranoia to touch a nerve.The streamer’s nifty continuing attempt to resurrect the teen movie, after it mostly disappeared on the big screen, has led to a number of big successes and while on first glance, last April’s The Perfect Date might seem like an odd inclusion here, it’s one that requires some explanation. The previous summer saw Netflix score big with To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before, The Kissing Booth and Sierra Burgess is a Loser and while they might have ultimately reached a higher number (To All the Boys allegedly reached 80 million), this was over an extended amount of time. The release of The Perfect Date, starring Noah Centineo who appeared in two of the aforementioned teen hits, the following year came when he was now a Netflix star and when the teen comedy was a popular genre on the platform. The number is then reflective of its first month of release, as the film became part of sleepover movie rotation. It proves yet again that the platform can effectively make and sustain stars (Centineo now has more than 19 million Instagram followers thanks to streaming alone) although their sway outside of Netflix remains questionable."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f07826bd8d473d564b2724ac90c351b7af365fdd/120_0_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a806ac8ba6d264ac4e53ec21a6d4a2c3","title":"strasbourg 1518 review jonathan glazer","story":" The Under the Skin director’s short film – inspired by a mass-hysteria outbreak of dancing in the 16th century – speaks to our own feelings about lockdown‘How are you?” are the first audible words in this ferocious and headbuttingly confrontational short film from Jonathan Glazer: the answer can only be … not well. But strangely much better for this cathartic, declamatory spasm of protest, a dance piece for inidual performers devised by Glazer in collaboration with Artangel and Sadler’s Wells. It takes place in separate eerily unfurnished, dimly lit, socially distanced rooms and is choreographed to an overwhelmingly propulsive electronic score by Mica Levi, which left me jittery afterwards, like Chaplin coming off the production line in Modern Times.Glazer’s next full-length film is reportedly to be an adaptation of Martin Amis’s holocaust novel The Zone of Interest, but while this has been developing, he has been hitting us with short films for the BBC. The first was last year’s The Fall, an ambiguous nightmare of mob-rule execution or folk-horror ritual, and now there is this 10-minute convulsion of long-suppressed energy, Strasbourg 1518, disparately filmed during the Covid lockdown. It is reputedly inspired by the mass-hysteria outbreak of dancing in Strasbourg that year, one of the many such bizarre instances in Europe in the middle ages and early modern period, in which the collective unconscious of communities erupted in a psycho-bacchanal of protest against disease, misery and oppression. This film could as well be called UK 2020 or The World 2020. As an artefact, it brilliantly spoke to my own feelings about the lockdown, with dance being both symptom and cure, both deterioration and therapy, both constriction and freedom. Many people have been exercising in lockdown in precisely this desperate, ambiguous way.The dancers’ bodies lurch and lunge and swivel in their confined spaces, leaping and collapsing, clenching and undulating. One woman periodically lopes over to what looks like a barrel or butt of water (more suitable for a barnyard than a 21st-century interior, and perhaps it’s the one literal allusion to the world of its title) and washes her hands. A very Covid moment. Other dancers whirl in the same fierce way, periodically clashing against the wall like Westworld robots. There is little or nothing else to be seen in the frame but the dancers themselves, nothing but the bare room, though in one shot, the curtain is drawn back slightly, revealing what looks like a typically British urban street outside – maybe London – and the effect is very dreamlike. Eventually the editing quickens and becomes almost stroboscopic. And all the while Levi’s amazing score is sawing and pummelling at your head.You might compare Strasbourg 1518 to other movies on the mass-dysfunctional theme, such as Carol Morley’s The Falling (about collective fainting fits in a 60s British girls’ school) or Ken Russell’s legendary The Devils (about demonic possession approximately a century after the Strasbourg incident) but if it were not for the title, this subject matter might not in fact be obvious. The dancers here are isolated the Strasbourg dancers were communal. Yet that might be Glazer’s point – perhaps we are all communal now in our atomised way, due to social media and Twitter, that perpetually seething arena of volatile dispute, where Strasbourg dances of memes and quarrels and jokes can happen out of nowhere, with some people suddenly trending for no other reason than people are asking why they are trending.Of course, the other touchstone is the Powell and Pressburger classic The Red Shoes, inspired by the Andersen story about the little girl condemned to dance forever wearing the magic red shoes. Is that how we feel in our eternal, inner dance of rage against the Covid lockdown? Perhaps – and it’s a feeling touched on here. Yet Covid or not, mass hysteria or not, we are all condemned to wear the red shoes, all condemned to dance (quickly or slowly) to the end of our days. There’s a vivid flare of pure intensity to this film.• Strasbourg 1518 is available on BBC iPlayer."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af17bec751d5b0c7bc074490f8832b9057827a37/702_0_5424_3256/master/5424.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f381a7ed07e739deced5c3c8fef58411","title":"they wanted tandoori chicken australias slow embrace of regional indian cuisine","story":"India’s food has always been as complex and erse as the country itself. That variety is now being represented in Australian restaurantsIn an episode of the Netflix food documentary Ugly Delicious, the television host Padma Lakshmi is asked if she thinks Indian food is the most underrated cuisine in the world. “Indian food is really, really varied and regional,” she explains carefully. “People who have never been to India or know very little of India will only know north-western or Punjabi food. It’s always some vegetable or protein floating in brown or orange or red sauce.”For context, she has a south Indian background, but anyone who has ever gone to an Indian restaurant and asked for chicken tikka masala might feel a bit called out at this.Indian food, just like any cuisine, is influenced by climate, topography and agriculture, as well as centuries of trade. In north India, the temperate climate and wheat production means people make thick curries with dairy, nuts or a tomato base and eat it with bread. In comparison, the southern part of India is tropical or semi-tropical so the food centres around coconut, fresh chilli, curry leaves and rice-based dishes.These regional differences are rarely present in Australia’s Indian restaurants. Indian food in Australia, much like Lakshmi’s assessment of North American Indian cuisine, tends to be more north Indian (or Punjabi) cuisine.The Punjabi community were among the earliest wave of Indian immigrants to Australia and today Hindi and Punjabi are among the top 10 languages spoken at home in Australia. This meant that north Indian food became the default Indian cuisine, and it takes years to change that preconceived notion.When the husband and wife duo Vikram Arumugam and Preeti Elamaran opened their restaurant Nithik’s Kitchen in Balmain, Sydney in 2013, their customers had never heard of Chettinad food. “They wanted tandoori chicken or butter naan,” Arumugam says.But diners soon learned to embrace the restaurant’s south Indian flavours. “Our speciality is rice or idlis eaten with goat or fish curry,” Arumugam explains. “The food is always flavourful because we use tamarind, coconut and fenugreek.”The proliferation of dosas – a south Indian staple – are another indication of this shift. This typically rice-based savoury pancake is a versatile and healthy snack, and acts as a base for other ingredients like onions, egg, potato and even cheese. It is also suitable for people who are vegetarian or gluten intolerant. You can now spot dosa restaurants in most Australian cities. Dosa Hut is a particular success story – it opened its first outlet in 2007 and has grown to more than 20 franchises in Victoria, New South Wales, South Australia and Queensland.Arumugam notes that it has become much easier to obtain the specialty ingredients he uses both in his restaurant and as a home cook. “There was always ghee in Australia, but now I have choices in brands!”He makes an interesting point about the proliferation of choices. Products like curry leaves or asafoetida still require a trip to speciality grocers but mainstream supermarkets have started selling regional spice mixes and curry kits. Shoppers can now find Bengali coconut daal spice mix alongside the more common korma curry sauce. These pre-made mixes cater to both newer immigrants, whose regional food is underrepresented in Australian restaurants, and to curious non-Indian customers who are broadening their home cooking repertoires.As the range of Indian food grows in Australia, chefs have the liberty of defining their version of Indian food. Newer Indian restaurants, like Delhi Streets and Gopi Ka Chatka both in Melbourne, have done away with a regional focus and now present street food or “chaats” including bhel puri (puffed rice with assorted lentils and chutney) and pani puri (ball-shaped crispy shell filled with a mixture of tamarind chutney, potato, onion or chickpea) in a casual environment.This shift is also clear at higher end restaurants, including Sauma in Perth. Its owner, Gurps Bagga, describes his food as regional Indian cuisine with local Australian flavours. “Our food here is distinctly south Indian, a bit of Goan and Keralan-inspired but it is also innovative and local,” he says.For example, Bagga uses Western Australia’s hardwood sawdust mushrooms and cooks them with garlic, korma sauce, chilli oil and hazelnut truffle. “You can taste the Indian spices but I’ve added my own touch to it. You can call it modern, you can call it fusion. The important thing is that you think it’s tasty.”And that just might be the unofficial ethos of Indian food."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3758eab38c157d981a7c4df1d6095723bd2f81b9/0_162_5173_3103/master/5173.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d3f7178aaa004c784fe961033f8e35ea","title":"a dream to play in england west ham women sign france defender cissoko","story":"West Ham have made their fourth signing ahead of the Women’s Super League season, with the France defender Hawa Cissoko arriving from thee Division 1 Féminine side Soyaux.Matt Beard’s side finished eighth in the curtailed 2019-20 WSL season and are now building for next season and have already brought in Mackenzie Arnold (Brisbane Roar), Maz Pacheco (Reading) and Katerina Svitkova (Slavia Prague).“I know about the English league.

A top-four domestic finish is beyond them but a spot in fifth or sixth would guarantee participation in next season’s Europa League – if they need it they could still reach the Champions League by winning this season’s Europa League, which resumes next month with Wolves hosting Olympiakos in the second leg of their last‑16 tie. The first ended 1-1.This was Wolves’ 56th match in a campaign interrupted by the lockdown. They have occasionally looked flat since the restart and there were spells in this game when inspiration eluded them. But they won by producing the contest’s key moments of ingenuity.The first came four minutes to the end of a first half in which Palace’s woes were summed up by Sakho’s muscle injury and Jeffrey Schlupp firing wide after clever work by Wilfried Zaha. Wolves barely threatened, with Tyrick Mitchell, a 20-year-old left-back making his first league start for Palace, coping pretty well with Traoré.The cliche about needing either magic or a mistake to make the game interesting came to mind, and there was no doubt about which looked more likely. But suddenly Wolves broke through with a wonderfully constructed goal featuring an artful one-two between Matt Doherty and João Moutinho. The Irishman clipped the ball back from the byline to leave Podence with a simple header into the net.“He did well,” said Nuno Espírito Santo of Podence. “But there’s a lot of space to improve so let’s try to work to take more advantage of his incredible talent.”Podence flashed that talent again on the hour, conspiring with Traoré before Vicente Guaita saved the Spaniard’s shot. Eight minutes later Traoré showed his class by bursting between Mitchell and James McArthur on the right – nutmegging the debutant in the process – and then passing to Raúl Jiménez, whose scuffed shot ran to Jonny. The wingback spun and lashed the ball into the net from 10 yards.Soon after that Guaita had to bolt out of his area to deny Podence after a flick-on by Jiménez. But Palace never looked like depriving Wolves of a win that took them to a record Premier League points haul. “That pleases me a lot,” Nuno said. “The credit is to the players. It has been a long season – one calendar year for us – and this points total is a fair reward for us. Progress season-on-season is the idea. We are improving, building and looking for the next challenge. We embrace that.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f23dc8bde259bfc2dedbf95d515b42762891b6f5/625_719_2811_1687/master/2811.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fc39429df56e070a858276fae542e96a","title":"how we met i actually thought he fancied someone else","story":"Scott and Kate Wooderson, 44 and 38, met through an overland trip from London to Sydney in 2010. They live in Suffolk with their catThey set off in August and quickly built a friendship. As they travelled through Europe, the pair spent plenty of time together, but neither anticipated romance. “I remember thinking he was really shy,” says Kate. “And I actually thought he fancied someone else on the trip.” Scott had recently gone through a breakup, while Kate was in a long-distance relationship with someone back home that “wasn’t really working out”. She admits that she noticed Scott’s adventurous spirit and was “impressed” when he fearlessly tackled a bungee jump in Nepal. “Everyone else in the group was really scared and he just leapt off. I thought that was cool.”But it was not until they reached China in December that the dynamic between them began to change. “It was Kate’s birthday. I took her for a walk while the others went to buy her presents,” says Scott. “It was the first time we’d really been alone together and we were in this romantic spot next to a river lit by lanterns.” Although they both felt an attraction, they were not ready to admit their feelings. “In the end, one of our friends told me that Scott liked me, but we hadn’t actually told each other,” Kate says, laughing.They became a couple shortly afterwards, but the rest of the group did not find out straight away. “We’d been camping out in -40C weather and going without showers for days. Often we’d sleep all huddled up together or just crash in different rooms in pairs,” says Scott. “One day, we stopped at this lay-by in northern Laos and set up a two-man tent together. That was when everyone else realised that we were together.”After reaching Indonesia in April 2011, the couple flew to Sydney. “There was an option to continue by boat, but I get seasick,” says Kate. They spent the next five months travelling and working in Australia before returning to Scott’s hometown in Suffolk. It wasn’t long before they started to get itchy feet again. “In 2013, I got a job offer to work as a vet in New Zealand,” says Kate. “We moved within a month, arriving with nothing but a couple of suitcases. I love that Scott is always up for an adventure. We ended up sleeping on the floor for the first month.” He found work in a timber sawmill and they enjoyed exploring the country together.In August 2015, they decided to move home to be closer to their family. On the way back, they stopped in the US for a month-long road trip, where Scott proposed. “A year later, we hired a posh Airbnb to get married and then we had a party in the village hall for more people,” Kate says. “We had a truck-shaped cake and lots of our friends from the trip joined us.”The couple now live in Suffolk with their cat. Kate still works as a vet and Scott is an engineer. They spend their time walking, canoeing, seeing family, travelling on Scott’s motorbike and visiting car shows.“My mum always says that Scott calms me down and I jazz him up,” says Kate. “He’s so kind and lovely. He loves cats just as much as I do and he’s got a nice bum, too.” Scott says his wife is funny and more outgoing than him. “We both love to travel and we’ve had some incredible adventures together. We’ve been through highs and lows, but we love each other as much as ever.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e2ff657f1a85c1dc5fff6b041c79f475dcd945ce/0_0_600_360/master/600.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=6c5a7d91ef677e828d7f9ee61cad98f6","title":"q magazine demise signals the end of the old music press","story":"Q went where other titles were too cool to tread, championing old icons of pop and rock. But it was a victim of its own success – and a changing worldIt seems a strange comparison to make, but in its initial incarnation at least, Q magazine was as much a product of its era as Oz and the International Times seemed in the late 1960s, or the crudely photocopied pages of Sniffin’ Glue appeared at the dawn of punk.It was launched in October 1986, the product of a brilliant bit of trend-spotting by its founders, David Hepworth and Mark Ellen. Both had noticed not just that sales of compact discs were steadily soaring but that music fans – particularly those of a certain age – were using the new format’s arrival as an excuse to re-buy the highlights of their record collections: “They were reliving the time they’d first heard this music on vinyl and wondering what had happened to their old heroes,” Ellen later wrote.The music press wasn’t going to answer that question, having discarded their old heroes as irrelevant years before, in the wake of punk. What need had the NME for Paul McCartney or Pink Floyd when there were features on Stump, the Shop Assistants and Schoolly D to be written? But Q would. Their conviction in a market for this stuff was bolstered by the fact that its founders had presented the BBC’s coverage of Live Aid, an event at which rock’s old stagers – who knew exactly what they were doing, having already spent 15 or 20 years playing stadiums – almost unanimously stole the show from under the noses of pop’s young pretenders: it was Queen’s day, not Nik Kershaw’s.And so Q – its name a play on the act of “cueing up” a CD – rushed into the vacuum. Its early issues featured McCartney, Rod Stewart, Paul Simon, Elton John, Genesis and Eric Clapton on the cover. None of them exactly at their artistic zenith in the late 80s, but all still hugely successful, and all with richly entertaining histories to talk about. The interviews were respectful, but never fawning or hagiographic. Its founders had helmed Smash Hits in its early 80s purple patch, and something of that magazine’s irreverence, its belief that finding pop music hugely thrilling and completely ridiculous wasn’t contradictory, clung to Q’s tone.You could sneer at Q as uncool and lacking edge (“The magazine that says ‘Hey kids, it’s alright to like Dire Straits’,” chuckled the NME’s Steven Wells) but Q was sharper than the caricature suggested. It was smart enough to realise that soul veteran Bobby Womack had a hell of a story to tell – his name was emblazoned across the cover early on. And it occasionally bared its fangs, as in Tom Hibbert’s “Who the Hell Does ______ Think He Is?”, a series of virulent, pomposity-pricking interviews.Whatever you thought of it, Q was hugely successful throughout the 80s and 90s. Its covers from the latter decade offer an intriguing corrective to the nostalgia-burnished version of the Britpop era. They featured Blur and Oasis alongside artists who sold vast quantities but have subsequently been airbrushed out of the picture: Texas, the Corrs, Shania Twain, Simply Red. Its profile was further boosted by the Q awards, the annual event at which, in 1996, Tony Blair was introduced to Noel Gallagher: the first step on the New LabourCool Britannia love-in.It pulled in stars other titles could only dream of snaring: Q was the magazine where George Michael gave his first interview after his 1998 arrest for “public lewdness”, and where Radiohead made an exception to their post-Kid A media blackout. It also became immersed in 100 Best lists: the 100 Best Albums, the 100 Best British Albums, the 100 Richest Stars in Rock, the 100 Greatest Singles of All Time. That was a trend that was copied ad nauseam – the sense that Q was rather overdoing it was unmistakable by the time they came up with the 150 Greatest Rock Lists Ever – but others followed suit because it sold. Reading Q’s lists now feels like opening a time capsule of then-contemporary preoccupations: a lost world in which Kula Shaker’s K and Cast’s All Change were deemed to be up there with What’s Going On, Astral Weeks and the Velvet Underground and Nico.The magazine’s sales went into decline in the noughties, something it seemed incapable of arresting, no matter what it tried: sticking with tried-and-tested cover stars such as U2, Oasis and Radiohead alternating the usual suspects with covers featuring Beyonce, Kanye West, heavy metal artists and pop stars more lists. The issues were more than likely the same problems that plagued almost every music title – the rise of the internet (Q was hopelessly slow to claim its place on the web) the rise of pop stars either media-trained to blandness or who relied on everyday I’m-just-like-you charm, neither the source of gripping interview material. Certainly, its original USP was long gone, a victim of its own success. In 1987, no one in the music press other than Q wanted to speak to the stars of the 60s and 70s, but by the noughties, everyone did.In its final iteration, under editor Ted Kessler, Q became something like the opposite of the magazine it started out as: it was wide-ranging and hip, closer to one of the now-vanished inkies than the Q of old – one recent cover flagged up features on Waxahatchee, US Girls, Låpsley and veteran dub producer Mad Professor – and promoted female writers in a realm that had once been almost exclusively male. As a one-stop digest of what was happening in music, it was hard to fault, but it wasn’t enough to save Q.Without wishing to sound melodramatic, its closure seems to signal the final passing of the music press as we once knew it. What’s left are specialist titles, small operations surviving on small circulations and magazines that concentrate largely on the past. The latter suggests that the only people who still buy music titles in quantity are old enough to remember the music press at its height."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/35c47a8bf278a5ba79a7d268fc26d4380c1df6ed/0_64_1000_599/master/1000.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=40d6b6385e336a405a5727b2643abea2","title":"it was completely surreal jess cornelius on releasing an album and a baby at the same time","story":"The musician gave birth the day her single – about an earlier miscarriage – came out. Motherhood has underlined how important her art is to her identityAt 12am the night before releasing her new single, Los Angeles-based New Zealand musician Jess Cornelius felt her water break.The baby was coming two weeks earlier than expected. With amniotic fluid on her floor, she sat down at her computer to tie up loose ends.In what might seem an absurd last-minute flurry, she even made a final Instagram post from the hospital about the new song, Body Memory: “I was gonna write a whole thing about what the song is about,” she wrote, “but apparently I’m in labor or something”.It seems ironic, then, that much of Cornelius’s forthcoming album, Distance, is about her coming to terms with the idea that life as a touring musician had made motherhood unlikely.“I’d had opportunities in relationships where I potentially could have stayed in them and had children, and I didn’t,” she says. “I just thought ‘Well, I’m moving to the US to have this nomadic lifestyle, I’m not gonna have a baby anytime soon, the clock is ticking etc’ … I’d really come to terms with that idea of not having kids.”Cornelius moved to Melbourne from Wellington in 2000, eventually forming the synth pop group Teeth \u0026amp Tongue around 2008. After that band ended, she released her first solo EP Nothing Is Lost in 2017, a collection of simple guitar-backed songs that represented a stark departure.Distance, out this week, is a kind of 21st century amalgam of Karen Dalton’s delicate folk and 70s jam band Americana there are flashes of 80s pop-blues, and the woozy-yet-righteous Californian grunge of Hole’s Malibu.Cornelius recorded its songs after moving to LA in early 2018, in full-band arrangements that could be stripped back for easier solo touring. Peel away the synthesised strings, bass and drums on Palm Trees – a song about beginning her new life in LA – and you can hear how the power and conviction of her voice would be enough to carry the song.But Cornelius was forced to reassess her American touring plans when only three months after meeting her partner she fell pregnant, in a city she was still learning to call home.Ten weeks later the pregnancy ended in miscarriage, an experience she channelled into Body Memory – the single which came out the day that she gave birth.On Body Memory, Cornelius sings over a tinny pre-set beat and synthesised woodblocks from a budget Portasound keyboard. The dinky electronics lure you into a sneakily devastating song, which details the vast gulf of experience between parents after a miscarriage. “When we met I used to make you laugh  then we lost a baby and it broke my heart  now I find it hard, to be that funny now  I tried to tell you that I can’t rewind  I can’t walk backwards in my mind  ‘cause my body has a memory and it won’t forget.”Losing a baby solidified her resolve to become a mother, and Tui Pepper Cornelius-Hale was born in June. The birth had frightening moments, heightened by the face masks the couple, midwife and nurses were forced to wear amid a global pandemic – which Cornelius repeatedly tore off as her contractions came on strong.“It was the most painful thing I’ve ever experienced in my life. I just thought to myself, ‘This is ridiculous this is insane that this is part of life. What kind of sadistic design is this?’” says Cornelius. “She came out … like a little wrinkly grey old man. I put her on my chest and just descended to tears and it was completely surreal.”Tui is named after a native New Zealand bird whose white throat tufts and garbled but crystalline song are national motifs. Cornelius’s mum Raewyn Atkinson is a native bird lover and an accomplished ceramicist she’d nurture her kids during the day and her kiln, pots and glazes at night.Covid-19 forced Cornelius to record her own videos for the first time. The process helped her reconnect to an album largely written about the unlikelihood of her current situation.The video for Kitchen Floor, for instance, begins with a pregnant Cornelius anxiously staring into her bathroom mirror, picking up confidence as she walks the suburbs of LA, before dancing down a pandemic-deserted Hollywood Walk of Fame in a figure-hugging leopard print dress. It feels like a refusal to let motherhood dominate her life – and a commitment to bring Tui along for the ride.Since her daughter’s arrival, Cornelius has stopped worrying about counting Spotify streams and scanning reviews. Instead, the timing reaffirmed the importance of her work to her sense of self.“I feel really grateful that I’m putting out a record at this time, because it does give me this other aspect of my identity that I think so many people struggle with. I can feel it, your whole identity gets lost in being a mother, being a parent,” she says. “It’s so consuming that I can very easily understand feeling a real loss of self, a real loss of identity … we’re obviously all more than one thing and definitely more than just parents.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/41dbf6cb2953c82aabeaf15bafb52c97b48976c5/0_0_3491_2095/master/3491.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=41c2fc16e2a162be1ab3f0906f4b4450","title":"poland divided and right wing populists win again podcast","story":"A narrow win for the populist incumbent Andrzej Duda in Poland’s presidential election cleared the path for the right-wing Law and Justice party to pursue anti-LGBT policies and further assault the courts and free press. ’s Christian Davies reports from WarsawThe re-election of Andrzej Duda as Poland’s president this week was by the narrowest of margins and has sent liberals in the country into a tailspin.

Just a week after announcing he was barring Huawei from the UK’s 5G network by 2027 – the Chinese had apparently promised they wouldn’t do any spying in the next seven years – Dominic Raab was back in the Commons to make yet another ministerial statement. This time to indefinitely suspend the extradition treaty with Hong Kong and to impose an arms embargo on the territory.Try to think of it as “tough love”, the foreign secretary insisted. If we didn’t adore the Chinese so much and admire their progress this century then we wouldn’t be making such a fuss. But now we had such high expectations of them, it was only right that we submit China to the same level of scrutiny as we would any other country. Apart from the ones with appalling records of human rights abuses from which we made a small fortune flogging arms. Those could all be safely overlooked.“The UK is watching,” Raab said grandly, the vein in his neck throbbing with intent. Somehow he manages to look even more terrifying when he’s trying to sound reasonable than when he’s going full-on psycho. He had liaised on these sanctions with the UK’s Five Eyes partners and was hoping to achieve the same level of coordination with European allies. If only there was an organisation uniting 27 European countries that the UK could join, then it would have been a whole lot easier. Typical Europe. Never there when you really need it.Yet despite Raab’s best efforts to take a tough line with China, it still wasn’t enough to satisfy MPs from both sides of the house. Lisa Nandy, the shadow foreign secretary, damned him with faint praise. Dom had taken some decent first baby steps, the Labour MP said, but there was so much more he could have done. If the UK was so worried about Chinese involvement in sensitive areas affecting national security, then how come we were letting them build a couple of nuclear power stations for us? Raab stuck his fingers in his ears and pretended he hadn’t heard.Nandy was also surprised the government wasn’t more bothered about China’s treatment of the Uighur Muslims and wanted to know why Magnitsky sanctions had not been taken out against some known inidual offenders. Raab ummed and ahhed. It was all very difficult. No one cared more about the persecution – genocide was a terribly ugly word – of an ethnic minority than him. However, you also had to remember that China was the world’s second most powerful economy and so for the time being he would prefer to give it the benefit of the doubt. But he was definitely keeping an eye on the situation.This rather set the tone for the rest of the session. Conservative Tom Tugendhat chalked up the sanctions as a win for the foreign affairs select committee, which he coincidentally chairs, and wondered if Raab might care to consider some of its other, more hawkish, recommendations in relation to China. Others weren’t quite so keen to credit Tugendhat as they rather fancied taking some of the plaudits for the hardening of the line themselves. But a consistent theme emerged. It wasn’t sinophobic to take action against China’s human rights abuses and to be concerned about the Uighurs: it was what any decent country would do.By the end, Raab appeared somewhat bemused. It’s not every day he is the biggest dove in the chamber and you could sense him longing to go berserk and impose any number of sanctions on the Chinese. Just as a matter of macho pride. But he just about held it together till the close, though you wouldn’t bet against a pile of corpses being found in the Thames tomorrow morning as Raab tries to exorcise his pent-up frustration. Recess can’t come too soon for Dom.The same could also be said for Matt Hancock, who was also forced into making a Commons statement following Boris Johnson’s rather optimistic Santa Claus press conference last week saying the UK would basically be back to normal in time for Christmas. Presumably the prime minister still hasn’t got round to reading the report from the Academy of Medical Sciences that suggested the country could be facing a further 120,000 deaths over the course of the winter.Mattbeth looked defeated from the start as he tried to channel Boris’s mindless optimism. The track-and-trace system was working brilliantly because it had managed to track down 180,000 while missing an equal number of contacts. Realising that was the only even vaguely good news on offer, Hancock tried to claim the early reported successes of the Oxford and Imperial vaccine trials as a triumph for the government, rather than for the scientists. “We have a plan and it is working,” he said, fooling no one but himself. There was a time when Jon Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, used to do his best to boost Hancock’s confidence by offering him emotional support from the dispatch box. “You’re doing really well Matt. Honestly.” But even Ashworth hasn’t been able to keep up that level of encouragement in the face of repeated government incompetence, and so this time he just let rip with a long dose of honesty.The track-and-trace numbers were crap. The app was non-existent. Local authorities weren’t getting the data they needed. The government had ignored Sage advice. The chief nursing officer had been silenced by the government for not giving the thumbs up to Dominic Cummings’ Durham safari. There was no plan in place other than waiting on a miracle of a vaccine appearing. Wasn’t it time to level with the public?Over the last few weeks, Mattbeth has been getting progressively more tetchy. He’s done his best but it hasn’t been good enough. And even his best efforts have been undermined by Boris. He knows the government has been found out yet cannot bring himself to admit it. Because if he did then he might need to ask himself why he doesn’t have the self-worth to resign. Instead, time and again he allows himself to be trampled on. Hancock couldn’t contain himself. Rather than answer the questions, he attacked Ashworth for no longer being supportive. Just like Boris, he now mistakes reasonable scrutiny for a personal attack. The MPs in the chamber kept their heads down, trying to avoid making eye contact with the health secretary. It’s never comfortable to watch a minister breaking down in public."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5e34b27dabf8d1299c27bf2386ad01f02e02cd8a/0_122_4104_2462/master/4104.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=7ac771e09951157cadcaefa1a33b344c","title":"covid 19 what can sewage tell us","story":"It may be a respiratory virus, but studies have repeatedly found traces of Covid-19 in the faeces of infected patients.

They deserve a decent pay settlement too.“And the government should urgently announce a pay rise for social care workers, who put their lives on the line to care for others during this pandemic.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/52543a627b0182f5841030d47eef3ebe0c40a07c/209_153_4224_2536/master/4224.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c5d365baf3447003e54293f25a281295","title":"joe root hails mr incredible ben stokes after all round display in england win","story":"Joe Root said his players are “in the presence of greatness” and watching “Mr Incredible” at work following the all-round masterclass from Ben Stokes that set up a series decider between England and West Indies on Friday.England’s gripping 113-run final-day victory in the second Test was built on the sheer dominance of Stokes throughout, as contrasting scores of 176 and 78 not out with the bat – plus three key wickets – made the man of the match award a formality.Root, who now has a selection headache as regards the bowlers following six wickets for the returning Stuart Broad and five from the impressive Chris Woakes, admitted he is a lucky captain to have Stokes at his disposal.The England captain said: “From a team point of view, it would be very easy for us to not appreciate how good a performance this was this week because of the lack of atmosphere in the ground. But I think everyone understands that we are watching a player at the peak of his powers, at the peak of world cricket delivering time and time again. We have to savour that and understand we are in the presence of greatness.”As well as calling Stokes “the ideal senior player”, Root earlier hailed Woakes as “Mr Dependable” after the all-rounder became the third fastest Englishman to the double of 100 Test wickets and 1,000 runs in his 34th appearance. Only Ian Botham, 21 Tests, and Maurice Tate, 33, have been quicker.Asked how he would therefore describe Stokes, who has sustained the levels reached in 2019, Root replied: “Mr Incredible? I can’t think of a better one. He probably looks a bit like the cartoon character, too.”Stokes, who confirmed a late injury scare was down to general stiffness and he would be fit for the third Test starting on Friday at the same ground, looked to shift the praise on to Broad after his three-wicket burst with the second new ball on Sunday.It broke the game open for England and, after some pyrotechnics from Stokes as opener in the second innings, set up the day-five charge as West Indies were set an almost notional target of 312 in 85 overs. Stokes, who left Broad out of the first Test when stand-in captain, said it was great to see teammates leaving “the selectors scratching their heads” and players such as Dom Sibley, who made 120 in England’s first innings, make more progress.Jimmy Anderson, Mark Wood and Jofra Archer, who all played in Southampton, are all available for the third Test, the latter after completing five days of isolation and two additional Covid-19 tests following his unapproved trip to Hove last Monday.Archer was fined the equivalent of a match fee (£15,000) and given a written warning but Root considers the matter now closed for the fast bowler. Root said: “It was disappointing from our side of things but as far as I’m concerned he’s been through a disciplinary meeting, he’s very aware of the consequences of his actions and very remorseful. As a side and mates we’ve been there for him.“He’s aware he made a massive error but once the disciplinary has gone through, now it’s time for us to look at him being available to be selected.”West Indies, still able to claim their first series win in England since 1988, face headaches of their own. Their seam attack may need freshening up, while the opener John Campbell and Shai Hope have had disappointing series so far with the bat.Phil Simmons, their head coach, bemoaned the failure of his batsmen to reach three-figures and on Hope, who has four half-centuries in 39 innings since his twin centuries at Headingley in 2017, said: “I am concerned. We’ll talk about it.“We have to do something different. We must add to what we did in the first Test and subtract from the second Test. We had five half-centuries here but no one converted. Our bowlers have been doing their job – the batsmen have to stand up.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/04a6c27641e0255d477567281cf2a9f75ca121fb/0_55_4663_2799/master/4663.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1659e48c0a3ad4b213f8b234081a9eda","title":"nfl players to be tested daily after stars express disquiet over covid 19","story":"NFL players will be tested daily for the coronavirus for at least the first two weeks of training camp per the league’s new testing protocols.The NFL and the players’ union reached an agreement as rookies for Houston and Kansas City were set to report to camp Monday. Rookies for other teams begin arriving Tuesday. The decision comes a day after several prominent NFL players expressed disquiet at the lack of Covid-19 protocols in the run-up to the new season.Dr Allen Sills, the NFL chief medical officer, said more than one negative test is required before players initially enter the building to begin physical exams or any form of team activity.“There’s no finish line with health and safety and I think these protocols are very much living and breathing documents, which means they will change as we gain new knowledge about this virus, as we gain new knowledge about transmission, as we gain new knowledge about testing and there are new tests and new techniques that come online,” Sills said. “We very much anticipate that these protocols will change.”The NFL has sought input from other leagues that have already returned to action, including leagues outside the country. It’s not known how many positive tests would result in shutting down the football season.“These are complicated issues which involve a lot of factors,” Sills said. “But suffice it to say we very much look at it from a medical and public health standpoint, and we want to make sure that first and foremost we’re creating the safest possible environment for our players, for our coaches and our staff, but that we’re also operating within the safest environment for each one of our clubs’ locations, which means ongoing and regular communication with the public health authorities in those areas.”The league and the NFLPA already finalized protocols regarding team travel, media, and treatment response, and updated the facilities protocol to specifically address training camp based on recommendations from a joint committee of doctors, trainers and strength coaches formed by the league and players’ union.On Friday, the league sent players and teams an “Education Protocol” for camp which requires clubs to distribute joint educational materials and to conduct educational sessions for players, staff and family members.“Everything that we’re doing is centered around the concept of risk mitigation,” Sills said. “We know that we can’t eliminate risk, but we’re trying to mitigate it as much as possible for everyone. We know that this is going to be a shared responsibility.”Sills stressed the importance of responsible behavior away from team facilities. Unlike the NBA and NHL, the NFL can’t put its clubs in a bubble environment, so players and team personnel will have outside risk.“What’s good for players and what makes players and their families safer also makes coaches, staff and teams safer and, quite frankly, it makes our communities safer,” Sills said.The NFL’s testing will run through a national laboratory company. The league spoke with the CDC the White House task force a number of public health officials infectious disease experts and national laboratory medicine leaders to make sure its testing protocol would not have a negative impact on the country’s testing supply or the health care system.“We’ve received unanimous response across the board that it would not have a negative impact,” Sills said. “That’s a very important point to us, we take that responsibility very seriously. We’ve also discussed that at length with our testing vendor to make sure we are not having a negative impact on any of their business.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff49ec472721ddf4c5b266c50a731061fb532852/0_0_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c89570c7c4e56ffe793b26de06d030ae","title":"when the circus came to town and could not leave troupe spend lockdown in morecambe","story":"Five months on from being stranded, Big Kid Circus at centre of mystery after performers disappearLast week, Jhanys Corrales and Sandy Triana, two of the circus’s high-profile dancers from Cuba, disappeared. It had been a trying few weeks without a revenue stream, the performers became reliant on handouts from locals to get by.“We have been trying to do things to say thank you, everyone has been so good to us,” said the owner of Big Kid Circus, Biliana Kirilova, 49. “But Jhanys and Sandy didn’t want to take part – they had been finding it very hard in these days and just wanted this to be over.”A day before they went missing, she said, things became heated. The troupe, had put on free salsa classes as a way of thanking the local community for helping out, but after one session in the early hours, Kirilova heard raised voices. The next morning Corrales and Triana were gone.Those left behind describe the events leading to the disappearances and their own concerns about being marooned hundreds of miles away from home without end.Since then, there has been a plea on social media for their safe return and an urgent appeal from Lancashire constabulary, but no sighting of the pair. “We know they are safe now and they are still here in Morecambe,” said Kirilova, who runs the circus with her husband, Kiril. “I think … they just had enough of living like this.”The group, which is made up of several different nationalities including Romanian, Bulgarian, Cuban, Chilean and Moroccan as well as British, range from Alexandru, aged two, to his 91-year-old great-grandmother and former contortionist Doreen Enos.Most arrived in the UK a month before the start of the tour and would normally travel across the country performing in front of thousands of people. However, they became rooted to the Lancashire seaside town. Most of them were unable to claim government support without UK or EU citizenship. They became reliant on the charity of locals who began to donate food parcels and clothes. In return some members of the circus started volunteering at the local food bank.Michael Mota, a former hydraulic engineer from the central Cuban city of Camagüey and now a gymnast and skater, became emotional recalling the hardship of becoming stranded and the embarrassment of having to rely on handouts.“Mentally, it has been so hard. We are proud people and it has been hard for us to accept charity – we want to work for our money, we are not beggars.” The 31-year-old supports his mother and two children back at home in Cuba. “At first we thought it would only last for three weeks but then it went on and on and we started to struggle. We could not have survived without the people of Morecambe,” he said.Food parcels came first. Then came the clothes for the performers, who had only packed one suitcase each, and toys for the children. Meanwhile, officials also did their part, with Lancaster city ouncil providing the group with electricity, running water and rubbish collection.Olympia Posirca, the circus ringmistress, who is currently living in a caravan with her husband and two young children, Alexandru, two, and four-year-old Amalia, said her children had learned to ride on the scooters and bikes donated by Morecambe locals.“We were worried about how people would react – what if they didn’t want us here … sometimes we go to places and they switch our water off – but it didn’t happen. Every day people would walk past and bring us something: food, clothes. I’ve always liked Morecambe, had a fondness for it, but even more now. We’ve been so lucky,” the 31-year-old said.Posirca, who is originally from Rotherham, is the 14th generation of her family to be born into the circus. Her mother, Pam Enos, and 91-year-old grandmother, Doreen, have spent lockdown with the troupe, while her father, who is in his 70s, is stranded in Hungary, where he was working as a clown.Posirca said financial worries have cast the darkest cloud over thegroup. Without any government support the circus owners, themselves in financial dire straits, have been trying to pay them weekly but it has been nominal.“Kiril and Biliana have done as much as they can. They are like parents to many of us – they have tried, but there is only so much they can do. The funny thing is we pay tax but because we don’t pay rent, so we fall through the cracks for government support. It’s tough,” she said.“If it hadn’t been for the council letting us stay and the locals giving us food and clothes I’m not sure what we would have done. We are not lazy people, we all want to work but many are on restricted visas. Even so, they have been trying to give something back by volunteering at the food bank.”There is no indication of when they may be able to leave the UK, no clue as to the whereabouts of their missing friends but Kirilova is not giving up hope.From Wednesday this week the group is planning a series of free shows to repay the kindness shown to them by locals before moving on to Workington.

The Pixel Buds are true wireless earbuds that aim to be all things to all people with a hybrid design that’s neither fully open nor isolating.The £179 earphones are Google’s second attempt at Bluetooth earbuds, the first being not great. The new version dispense with the wire and adopt a tried-and-tested approach: earbuds that slot into a small and pocketable case.The buds are small and low-profile, similar in size to Samsung’s excellent Galaxy Buds+. They have a white touch-sensitive disc on the outside, with a small embossed G logo in the middle, and have both a traditional silicone ear tip and a silicone stabiliser wing to hold them in place.Unlike most earbuds with a silicone ear tip they don’t create the “plugged in” feeling, as they have vents in the body that equalise the pressure between your ear canal and the outside world for a more comfortable experience. Apple’s AirPods Pro do something similar.That means you get the benefit of the silicone ear tip, namely better sound quality and a more stable fit, but without the downsides. At least in theory.Putting them in is a simple: insert and twist until the wing holds them securely in place wedged against the inside of your ear. They are very stable and don’t protrude very far, fitting easily under hats (or masks).They were comfortable for me for up to an hour, before the wing dug into my ears enough to force me to take a break. Others who wore them found them comfortable for much longer.The case is one of the best. The earbuds clip in place via magnets and the lid shuts with a satisfying snap. It has both USB-C and Qi wireless charging, and can charge the earbuds up to 3.8 times.They last for just shy of five hours of continuous listening on a full charge, which combined with additional charges from the case adds up to 24 hours of playback. A 10-minute quick charge in the case adds up to two hours of listening.The earbuds discharge at different rates, dynamically swapping which one is in direct connection to your phone to even out power consumption. The battery only lasts 2.5 hours if used for calls.The case is made with some post-consumer recycled plastic, part of Google’s commitment to including recycled materials in all its products launching from 2022. Google will recycle all Pixel devices free of charge, including the Pixel Buds.The Pixel Buds support Google’s Fast Pair with Android devices. Open the case for the first time, or press the button on the bottom of the case if pairing with another device, place them near a phone and watch for an on-screen popup. That’s it. Microsoft’s Surface Buds support a similar function, with both Android phones and Windows PCs, as do Apple’s AirPods with the iPhone.The Pixel Buds are standard Bluetooth 5 earbuds, however, and will pair just fine manually with most devices, including iPhones, iPads, Macs, PCs etc. They connect to only one device at a time, but you can switch between devices without having to manually disconnect them first.Connection to a OnePlus 8 Pro, iPhone 11 Pro and several Windows 10 laptops was rock solid. But given the Covid-19 situation in the UK, I could not test them in congested areas.The controls are some of the very best, balancing sensitivity and prevention of accidental activation better than any other touch-control earbuds I’ve tested. Swipe forward or backwards to adjust volume. Tap once to pause or play, twice and thrice to skip forward or back a track, tap and hold to talk to Google Assistant or hear your notifications. Take an earbud out and the music pauses, resuming on reinsertion.The Pixel Buds are unique in that they blend the bass and full sound of a set of silicone tip earbuds with the open air awareness of earbuds such as the AirPods and Surface Earbuds.As such you get a good-sounding, full experience, excellent for everyday listening with reasonable bass and good separation of instruments and tones. They sound good with most music genres, producing fairly balanced sound that’s crisp when needed, with punchy bass and mids. They lack really deep bass, sounding a bit flat with Lindsey Stirling’s Crystallize, and lack a bit of subtlety for orchestral music.They sound on-par with Samsung’s Galaxy Buds+, but don’t quite reach the sonic highs of Sony’s (RRP) £220 WF-1000XM3.One thing they lack is any form of sound isolation. The vents that avoid the plugged-in feeling let in sound, which is excellent for awareness out on the street, but not for blocking out those around you. I could clearly hear someone in another room on the phone or a plane flying overhead. They are slightly better than the AirPods and Surface Earbuds, but not much, and aren’t anywhere close to the AirPods Pro which have similar vents but also noise cancelling.Call quality was good on both ends, coming across loud and clear in quiet spaces. But the lack of isolation let sound in on my side and the other end of the call could clearly hear background noise.It wouldn’t be a Google product without some sort of fancy Assistant integration. The Pixel Buds get the standard Assistant functions available with many other headphones, including the ability to read out your notifications, the time and alerts, plus tap and hold to talk to Assistant.But the Pixel Buds can also listen out for the “Hey, Google” wakeword, similar to Google’s smart speakers. This works well but I prefer to keep Assistant at a button press.Google Translate is the standout feature, which uses the app on your phone to translate your speech and others’ into and out of your language. For instance, you can speak in English and the phone will translate it out loud into German, while doing the reverse into your ears. Not a feature I could thoroughly test in lockdown, but an extension of an existing function of the Google Translate app that does work well.The Google Pixel Buds cost £179 in white. A black version will be available at a later date.The second-generation Google Pixel Buds are a significant improvement on the first with a fairly unique combination of an open-air-like fit with the full sound that requires a silicone ear tip.The combination will please those that hate the “plugged in” feeling of traditional earbuds, but don’t like the fit of Apple’s AirPods or Microsoft’s Surface Earbuds. Once in the Pixel Buds aren’t going to fall out.The sound is good, the touch controls are best in class and the battery life matches or betters rivals. Fast pairing is great, so is the optional Google Assistant integration. The earbuds are low-profile in your ear and the case is pocketable too. But they don’t offer much in the way of noise isolation, don’t have active noise cancellation and the stabiliser wing cannot be adjusted, meaning they weren’t comfortable for more than an hour at a time for me. They’re also more expensive than my current top standard true wireless earbuds, the £159 or less Galaxy Buds+.The Pixel Buds are a good set of true wireless earbuds that offer a fit and sound combination that is a little different from the rest.Pros: small, stable, open fit with eartip, good sound, good case, solid battery life, great gestures, Fast Pair, Google Assistant, USB-C, wireless charging, AACCons: not much sound isolation, no noise cancelling, can’t connect to two devices at the same time, no aptX, stabiliser wing not adjustable This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

After the BBC picked up #HoodDocumentary in 2016, Enterprice followed in 2018, then a small role last year in Jamie Demetriou’s consistently bonkers Stath Lets Flats on Channel 4, as an estate agent whose property boasted “no doors, just ropes”.Ewumi spoke rapturously this month about growing up on the likes of Hollyoaks and Doctors, as well as his love of Donald Glover’s Atlanta, with its occasional “wait, what?” moments in which disbelief is not so much suspended as discarded. It is heartening, then, to see him continue to marry the kind of storylines that would not be out of place in soapland (kidnappings, burglaries, medical crises) with a dash of Glover-style surreality – as well as his own playful, heart-filled writing – in this second series of Enterprice. Now re-airing in the Fleabag slot after premiering on iPlayer earlier in the year, the series sees him reprise his role as Kazim, one half of the fledgling south London delivery service Speedi-Kazz. While Kazim is all about the hustle, his business partner, the former medical student Jeremiah (Trieve Blackwood-Cambridge), is more cautious, his mum remaining constantly and loudly disappointed by his decision to drop out of university. Think of it as akin to a young, black Only Fools and Horses – but weirder. In the first series, the pair were almost ided by their different backgrounds and varying approaches to business, but now they are back – and stronger than ever. Kazim suggests hiring an underling for their business (“We’ll just pay them six wings and chips”). After all, he is, as he tells two thoroughly uninterested girls on a double date with Jeremiah, merely “trying to get Mummy out the ends and put her in a Benz”. When a waiter suggests he reconsider his choice of expensive wine, Kazim loudly accuses him of discrimination (“Us black people, we like to bring each other down”), before clocking the price and frantically searching for the cork.Jeremiah, meanwhile, is still pining for his ex, Layla (Thea Gajic), and, being a sentimental guy, paints her a portrait that looks like something a year 3 pupil might have created. It sets the tone for a series in which business and personal quandaries are constants. As in Atlanta, where invisible cars exist and Justin Bieber is black, there are many moments intended to make you go “Huh?” – not least an incident involving a fake doctor wandering into a hospital, which makes the NHS seem even more beleaguered than it already is. The addition of the brilliant Fatou Sohna as Simi, a schoolgirl who tricks the friends into abetting a burglary, leads to an intriguing plotline revolving around Hackney kingpin Mustafa (Dwane Walcott). Rather than painting the goings-on in the Fagin-esque gangster’s world as cartoonishly sinister, Ewumi adds a touch of social commentary the reason for Mustafa’s control over his estate is shown to be the help he offers to local people, who give him money in the hope that he will gee up the Home Office to look into their immigration issues. In return, he orders his gang to look after them. With a light touch, Ewumi also considers the plight of office cleaning staff and their awful bosses. Social struggles aside, Enterprice is the kind of series you can’t help but smile at in a later episode, the pair make a song to promote their business, to the tune of Biggie Smalls’s Juicy: “It was all a dream, Jeremiah and Kazim, we’re the Speedi-Kazz team, we deliver the goods you need to your front door … but we don’t deliver crack cocaine, no heroin, no crystal meth, no horse tranquillisers.” The later addition of a Nigerian love interest for Kazim, Ire, also allows Ewumi to incorporate his own background further, in joyous fashion. And then, of course, there is that endearing strain of soapiness. Although the boys’ business, love lives, stability, families and safety are all on the line at some point or another, with a string of highs and lows through these five episodes, one constant is their unbreakable bond. The final episode is titled The Mitchell Brothers, but this pair are far more lovely.

Timmy would fart in it to put us off’I was studying musical theatre at the ArtsEd school in London and got picked to join a dance troupe called Wacky Feet, for the Wide Awake Club pilot. I went on to do Seven Brides for Seven Brothers in the West End, then I heard that TV-am were looking for new children’s presenters. At the audition I sang The Chicken Song from Spitting Image waving a rubber chicken in the air. They must have thought, “She’s completely bonkers,” which was exactly what they were looking for. So I joined in 1986, at the age of 20. I was still doing Seven Brides. I had to be in TV-am by 3.30 in the morning, then do matinee and evening performances at the theatre. Oh, for the energy of youth.The Wide Awake Club had a team of five – Timmy Mallett, Arabella Warner, James Baker, Tommy Boyd and me. I’d never done live TV. I was told to look at the camera with the red light, but I didn’t realise the light moved, so in lots of the early shows I’m looking into the wrong camera. I got to work with just Timmy on WAC Extra on Sundays and Wacaday, which was the school-holiday version. He was such a character, massively popular. I remember doing a personal appearance at a festival with him. So many people came to see him, they had to close the road.The show was so much fun. We had huge creative freedom. We had a spelling game called Bonk’n’Boob with a contraption that looked like a ghetto-blaster with a hooter. If the kids spelled the word right, they got a bonk. If they got it wrong, it was a boob. I can’t remember the rules very well but I can remember the sound effects. We would sometimes start the show by sliding down a tube and arriving in shot in a heap. Timmy would fart in the tube to make us laugh and put us off.I think the Wide Awake Club and Wacaday are fondly remembered because not only were they a part of people’s childhood, there was very little other choice. In those days, there were only four channels. If you were watching telly at 7.30 in the morning, it was either us, the test card or something on BBC One. I’m pleased to say most people preferred us.TV-am started in 1983. Before that, telly only ran in the afternoon after all the educational programmes for schools. Having something on at breakfast time was really unusual and people tuned in to see what it was all about. Roland Rat had done the school holiday slot, but in 1985 he left for the BBC, on a Friday – and we started Wacaday the following Monday.For the record, my name came first. I wasn’t named after the mallet. We were in the office thinking of a new game. “How about word association? You know: orange – banana – apple – er? And if the contestant pauses or gets it wrong, you hit them over the head with a mallet. We’ll call it Mallett’s Mallet. You all right with that, Timmy?” I remember thinking: “Yeah, that’ll be fun – for a couple of months.”The first mallet prototypes were too heavy. Mallett’s Mallet is not inflatable but made of foam and the cover is regularly washed. Every time I get booked for a festival or a gig, the first thing they say is: “Don’t forget your mallet.” It’s probably bashed several million heads around the world. It travels in a black bag labelled: “Top secret.” Every time it goes through an airport scanner, they ask: “Is that what I think it is?” And I reply: “Can’t tell you. It’s top secret!”Michaela and I also presented WAC Extra on Sundays. We had a game called Singing in the Shower, which was like an early version of karaoke. I recently met Eddie Redmayne and he said: “Hello. The last time I saw you, I was on Singing in the Shower with my brother.” “How did you get on?” I asked. He said: “I lost. My brother won the Wham! album and the WAC pack. I was so jealous.”He could even remember the prizes! How lucky I am to have worked on a programme that was loved by a whole generation.• Utterly Brilliant!

Long-haulers surveyed in a coronavirus survivor Facebook group identified 100 different symptoms, including fatigue, pain, difficulty sleeping, heart palpitations, neuropathy, tinnitus, tremors, blurry vision and memory problems. A recent study in the journal Brain found an association between coronavirus and neurological and neuropsychiatric illness. A study in the journal Cureus documented 18 neurological abnormalities that can affect Covid-19 survivors, including headache, stroke, seizures, Guillain-Barre syndrome and muscular paresis.Here are the stories of three people who are coping with health issues in the wake of coronavirus.Karyn Bischof, 30, former firefighter and paramedic, Boca Raton, FloridaMy symptoms started around 15 March. When I was tested for coronavirus on 23 March, I’d had a sore throat, a fever, dry cough, shortness of breath and I’d lost my sense of smell. I felt like a freight train hit me. I honestly felt like I was going to lose consciousness. I’m a single mom and since schools were closed and I still had to work, I’d dropped my 11-year-old son off to stay with my dad, who lives two hours away. I was already anxious about being sick but being completely alone added to my anxiety. The second and third weeks after my diagnosis I mostly stayed in bed. Week four and five I returned to work and that’s when it hit me: this is not normal. I was experiencing what long-haulers call waves your symptoms come and go and you never know what they’re going to be.On top of all my symptoms, I feel like my healthcare providers aren’t taking me seriously. I’ve had to fight to get in-person appointments. When I did go to my pulmonologist’s office, he waved his hand at me and said: “You’ll be fine.” Before I read an article in the Atlantic about long-haulers I thought I was going crazy because I didn’t know anyone else was having these long-term symptoms. Since I read that article I joined Facebook groups for survivors. Knowing that other people are experiencing these bizarre, crazy symptoms has been huge for me.When I tested positive for coronavirus in early May, the emergency room doctor sent me home. But when my lips turned blue, I went back to the emergency room and I was admitted to the hospital. I stayed there for over a month, mostly in the ICU. I wasn’t on a ventilator but I wore a snorkel-like mask. It connected to a machine that blew air into my nose and felt like a hurricane.Since I was discharged in June, blood clots have sent me to the emergency room at least six times. I’ve stayed in the hospital, for observation, a total of around 10 nights.Because of fluid in my lungs, I have lung pain and coughing that interfere with my sleep. I’m clearing my throat constantly. The last time I went to the emergency room it was because I’d had chest pain for three or four days and it was severe to the point where I couldn’t sleep at night. Then all of a sudden, it shifted to my legs, and there was this massive amount of swelling. I’m 34 years old, I’ve never had edema, and I’m fairly active. I was like: “What the hell?” LaToya Henry, 43, public relations and communications specialist, Lathrup Village, MichiganI started with a low-grade fever and a cough. I had no appetite, and I couldn’t keep anything down. When I saw blood in my stool I went to the ER. A week after I started to experience symptoms I was at home with my parents, who I live with, and I felt really weak so I yelled for them to call 911. I went to the hospital in an ambulance. Two days later they put me on a ventilator. They took me off it after a week and I was discharged on 11 April.By then I’d lost a lot of muscle. I went home with a walker and extreme fatigue. Then I started noticing this buzzing sensation in my body, mostly in my lungs. The best way I can explain it is it feels like my body is trying to make energy but it can’t. At first, it happened a few times a day. Now it’s about once a week. My mucus was all kinds of colors. My doctor said to expect that, but I was still really surprised when it was the color of soot. I have never seen mucus that color. I called my doctor when it was black and he said not to worry. It was very disconcerting. I also had a severe eczema flare for the first time in at least eight years, which my doctor said was part of the healing process. I still have unexplained twitching in my arms and legs. I also have what I call “rona-insomnia”. I usually sleep from 11pm to 2am, I’m awake from 2 to 5am, and then I sleep until 8am.I had no pre-existing conditions and months later I’m still not totally back to normal. My balance feels off and I have intermittent chest congestion. I’ve also been diagnosed with an irregular heartbeat. On top of the physical symptoms, it’s mentally hard, too. I was so afraid I’d have to go back to the hospital. And the doctors tell you to expect you’ll have good days and bad days, but you really don’t know what’s normal. I feel like I email my doctors with so many questions, they’re probably sick of me by now.I want to tell people to please wear your masks.Interviews were edited for brevity and clarity."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/abf3db1a2eb2da0505be686295b33e8a057ee886/0_0_6192_3715/master/6192.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a0a71f2a488fa4eb46da67e556bc445e","title":"instagram what frog are you inside the latest way to waste time","story":"Quarantine has made us teenagers again, feverishly matching our names with various animals as well as Guy FieriA week ago, I opened my Instagram for the 10th time – OK, 20th, we’re still in quarantine – that day to an unexpected message from my friend. Splashed across the image of what appeared to be a frog in a pink tutu standing on its hind legs was my name, written in rainbow bubble letters.The time it took me to go from deeply confused by this image to consumed by the need to find more frogs was lightning fast: within minutes, I was scrolling frantically through the account it came from, @What_frog_you_are, determined to find frogs emblazoned with all my friend’s names.Frogs are not the only animals that have served as a canvas for the latest, mindless Instagram pastime: soon, I found accounts featuring pictures of cows and fish bearing a litany of names, offering a conveniently time-consuming activity for anyone bored enough to search for theirs.It is clearly a welcome respite these days. Over the next few days, my friends and I sent each other equally absurd pictures back and forth, from accounts like @Whatfoodyouare to @Whichguyareyou (Fieri, not Ritchie, though at this rate, that iteration may exist soon). These accounts, which have ballooned in number over the last week, are like the anti-BuzzFeed quizzes: you can’t optimize your way to the most flattering outcome. I keep asking myself, as I wait for my name to appear on a stock photo of a dog: why do I care if my name is next to a border collie or a bulldog? And yet I can’t look away – and I really want it to be a border collie. It seems that, in quarantine, we’ve all regressed to teenagers: finding joy in the simple fact of putting our names on things.Mallory, the 19-year-old behind @Whatdogyouare, says her inspiration for the account came from seeing a friend run a cat version. (“I’m a dog person,” she offers.)Since opening the account on 9 July, Mallory has grown to 122,000 followers and counting. On 11 July alone – the day after I received the tutu-clad frog – she gained 54,000 followers.“Everybody loves to feel special,” said Alexa, the 19-year-old who runs @Whatfoodyouare and says she was inspired by Mallory’s account. “I thought, ‘What’s one thing everyone loves?’ The first thing is dogs, so I chose the second-best: food.” By using photos of everything from donuts to crab legs, Alexa has married the internet’s longstanding obsession with food with its latest fixation with names on things.For anyone with a name commonly forgotten by souvenir keyrings, these accounts take requests – with stipulations. Some prioritize those who donate to charities, like Kayla, the 20-year-old creator of @What_cow_are_you a cow lover who lives on a farm, she first looks at requests from people who give to World Animal Protection. Jordan, the 20-year-old behind @What_harry_styles_are_you asks that requesters follow the account, as well as the personal accounts of her and co-creator Lauren.For Jenna, Victoria and Alex, all in their late 20s, there was only one celebrity they wanted to pay homage to: Guy Fieri. “This account is a public representation of what our texts to each other already look like,” says the trio. That strategy seems to work: Guy Fieri follows them.Inevitably, brands like the skincare company Starface have hopped on the trend, which all but spells the end of this meme’s lifecycle. (At the time of writing, @What_frog_you_are seems to have been deleted.) For now, we can enjoy this entertaining, albeit strange escape from quarantine – thanks to the fast work of the meme creators.While the speed at which these accounts publish suggests the work of AI or bots, every person I interviewed claims to create the images themselves. Time-consuming? Probably. But at least they don’t have to worry about coming up with an answer to what did you accomplish in quarantine. Mine will be having found my name on all these accounts – equally impressive, no?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db482cc283adcd9f00acdcfc176aa66976e65e0f/0_195_5624_3375/master/5624.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0256a0f60821786656f3bd9d85007bcb","title":"face coverings show us your homemade masks","story":"Shoppers in England will have to wear face masks from 24 July.

The nickname stuck.Yet this morass has just produced a shiny success: a Covid-19 contact-tracing app that is popular and appears to work.Since launching on 6 July, the Covid Tracker app was downloaded 1.3m times in eight days – the fastest-downloaded app per capita in Europe – and has started picking up cases of infection.“We’ve been delighted by the take-up rate. It’s gone beyond the initial hopes,” said Colm Harte, the technical director of NearForm, the company that made the app for the Health Service Executive (HSE).The app uses a phone’s Bluetooth signal to exchange a digital handshake with another device also running the app when users come within 2 metres of each other for more than 15 minutes. The anonymous keys are stored in a log on the phone, which health authorities may ask users to upload if they are diagnosed with Covid-19. The log can then be used to track unnamed contacts, who are alerted about possible infection.NearForm made a similar app for Gibraltar, which launched last month, and one for Northern Ireland, due to launch within weeks. “It’s the same core platform. It’s built on the Irish solution,” said Harte.“An Irish solution to an Irish problem” is a derisive term in Ireland for attempted fixes that are daft or quixotic. In this case, though, there seems no need for self-deprecation.Ireland has made a tool against the pandemic not only for Ireland but for part of the UK and for a British overseas territory – while Britain flounders in its own attempt to produce an app.The NHS Covid-19 app was meant to roll out in England in May. That slipped to June. Last month, officials ditched the app in its original form and backed an alternative designed by Apple and Google. The government said it might launch in winter.The Irish are not crowing. Authorities originally hoped to launch the app in March, only to encounter complications. And its effectiveness remains unclear. “It still has to prove its mettle,” said Seán L’Estrange, a social scientist at University College Dublin who has studied tracing.Even so, the take-up rate is impressive, said L’Estrange. “What that shows is the credibility of the app, the confidence in the initiative, and the enthusiasm for participating in the collective project to contain the virus.”The €850,000 (£773,000) price tag is “dirt cheap” given that the average cost of identifying each case of infection is €42,000, said L’Estrange. “Even if it fails to produce the goods, little has been lost.”This suggests Ireland’s health system, plagued in normal times by bloated management, turf battles and duplication, can do well in a crisis.“The whole of the organisation attuned itself and focused on coronavirus,” said Fran Thompson, a HSE spokesperson. The pandemic allowed the HSE to shortcut the regular tender process and select NearForm in mid-March. “It probably saved six to eight weeks,” said Thompson.NearForm employs 150 people and builds software mostly for private clients. It is based in a former council office in Tramore, a seaside town in County Waterford, but has international pedigree, with developers scattered across 21 countries. Clients include Condé Nast, Intel and Microsoft.Following Singapore’s lead, NearForm’s developers raced to build a centralised app that used smartphones’ Bluetooth connectivity to trace people who come into close contact with infected people.By April, they had a version but were struggling with Bluetooth. It worked with Android but Apple’s iPhone operating system sent apps to sleep when unused and Bluetooth could not activate them.“We quickly hit the same problems as other countries,” said Harte. A centralised system also raised alarms about storing data and breaching privacy.Then Apple and Google came together and offered an app that would support public health apps and let Android and iOS phones connect even while locked. Their decentralised version held no data in a single official database, alleviating privacy concerns.The Irish were among the first to grasp Silicon Valley’s offer in late April. “We got in early and it was full steam ahead. It allowed us to move on,” said Harte.Britain, meanwhile, persisted with attempts to make a customised app until last month when it made a U-turn and embraced the model preferred by Apple and Google.NearForm claims to be the only company to have built apps with interoperability across borders and jurisdictions – Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, and Gibraltar and Spain.Using the same source code and supplier should facilitate a coherent all-Ireland response to the pandemic – a decision that raised no political problems at the Stormont assembly.Thompson credits Ireland’s fast take-up rate to the population’s trust in government, desire to do the right thing and good user experience based on consultation and behavioural research.Stephen Farrell, a computer scientist at Trinity College Dublin who has studied contact-tracing technology, said the app’s impact on the pandemic may remain unclear. “I’d not be surprised if we never end up with a definitive answer to that.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d9f6009b5aa3797a8ea0cfe76d27a52bee9ad702/0_67_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fe3c4a19a9f49f8fa4e3ed61e1c02175","title":"german coronavirus experiment enlists help concertgoers tim bendzko","story":"4,000 music fans to attend gig as part of study into how virus spreads in large gatheringsGerman scientists are planning to equip 4,000 pop music fans with tracking gadgets and bottles of fluorescent disinfectant to get a clearer picture of how Covid-19 could be prevented from spreading at large indoor concerts.As cultural mass gatherings across the world remain on hold for the foreseeable future, researchers in eastern Germany are recruiting volunteers for a “coronavirus experiment” with the singer-songwriter Tim Bendzko, to be held at an indoor stadium in the city of Leipzig on 22 August.Participants, aged between 18 and 50, will wear matchstick-sized “contact tracer” devices on chains around their necks that transmit a signal at five-second intervals and collect data on each person’s movements and proximity to other members of the audience.Inside the venue, they will also be asked to disinfect their hands with a fluorescent hand-sanitiser – designed to not just add a layer of protection but allow scientists to scour the venue with UV lights after the concerts to identify surfaces where a transmission of the virus through smear infection is most likely to take place.Vapours from a fog machine will help visualise the possible spread of coronavirus via aerosols, which the scientists will try to predict via computer-generated models in advance of the event.The €990,000 cost of the Restart-19 project will be shouldered between the federal states of Saxony and Saxony-Anhalt. The project’s organisers say the aim is to “identify a framework” for how larger cultural and sports events could be held “without posing a danger for the population” after 30 September.While some German states, such as Saxony and Brandenburg, have relaxed social-distancing restrictions to the extent that medium-sized indoor concerts are allowed to go ahead, concerts with more than a thousand attendees remain banned across the country until at least the end of August.New Zealand, which managed to control the spread of the pandemic at an early stage, allowed 20,000 rugby fans to crowd into a stadium in the city of Dunedin this weekend. An estimated 6,200 spectators attended US president Donald Trump’s campaign rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, on 20 June.Elsewhere, musicians and sportspersons face a precarious future as the fear of “super-spreader events” makes many governments reluctant to allow large gatherings in enclosed environments.“We are trying to find out if there could be a middle way between the old and the new normal that would allow organisers to fit enough people into a concert venue to not make a loss,” said Stefan Moritz, the head of clinical infectious diseases at the University hospital in Halle and the experiment’s coordinator.To stop the Leipzig experiment from becoming the source of a new outbreak, signed-up volunteers will be sent a DIY test kit and have a swab at a doctor’s practice or laboratory 48 hours before the concert starts. Those who cannot show proof of a negative test at the door will be denied entry.By midday on Monday, 775 volunteers had signed up for the concert with Bendzko, a soul-pop singer whose 2011 debut album sold 500,000 copies in Germany.At the Leipzig concert hall, a seating-only venue that has held sports events as well as concerts by Bob Dylan and Britney Spears, they will be asked to act out three different scenarios.In the first scenarios, the audience will attend the concerts as they would have done in pre-virus times, entering through two main entrances before taking their seats. In the second, “optimised” scenario, the crowd will enter through eight entrances to facilitate less mingling, and every second seat on the stands will be blocked.In the third, strictly socially distanced scenario, only 2,000 spectators will be allowed to enter the 12,000 capacity venue and be seated at a 1.5m distance from each other.The scientists behind the concert say they hope to search through the mass of data in just over a month and present their findings in early October."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/252e5f39dd694a78f8a398a1526c41c6764814a7/0_87_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=d6ca4f0abd9fcde6cba4f160c743430e","title":"oxford coronavirus vaccine triggers immune response trial shows","story":"Early results also indicate vaccine is safe, raising hopes it could help end pandemicHopes for a vaccine to address the global spread of coronavirus have been raised after Oxford University’s experimental version was revealed to be safe and to generate a strong immune response in the people who volunteered to help trial it.After intensive research, Prof Sarah Gilbert, from Oxford’s Jenner Institute, said they were more than happy with the first results, which showed good immunity after a single dose of vaccine.“We’re really pleased that it seems to be behaving just as we thought it would do. We have quite a lot of experience of using this technology to make other vaccines, so we knew what we expected to see, and that’s what we have seen,” she told the .The prime minister, Boris Johnson, called the results “very positive news”, adding: “There are no guarantees, we’re not there yet and further trials will be necessary – but this is an important step in the right direction.”The health secretary, Matt Hancock, said: “Very encouraging news. We have already ordered 100 million doses of this vaccine, should it succeed.”Gilbert and her colleagues, who once said they could have a vaccine by September, will not predict when it might be available. “None of us have a crystal ball,” she said. The lockdown that began in the UK in late March drastically cut the amount of coronavirus in circulation, which saved lives but also made it difficult to trial vaccines.The results published on Monday of a study involving more than 1,000 healthy volunteers – half of which had the vaccine while the other half were given a meningitis vaccine – in the Lancet medical journal are preliminary. The effect of the vaccine was measured by the amount of antibodies and T-cells it generates in the blood of the volunteers – not in any response to the virus itself.Large-scale trials have begun in Brazil and South Africa, however, where infection rates are still high and it will be possible to assess whether vaccinated iniduals are less likely to get Covid-19 than others.The results were “a really important milestone” on the path to a vaccine, said the study’s lead author, Prof Andrew Pollard. They showed the vaccine was very well tolerated, he added. “We are seeing exactly the sort of immune responses we were hoping for, including neutralising antibodies and T-cell responses, which, at least from what we’ve seen in the animal studies, seem to be those that are associated with protection.”The problem is, he said: “We just don’t know what level is needed if you meet this virus in the wild, to provide protection, so we need to do the clinical trials and to work that out.”Hopefully researchers would find out from the trials to come, added Pollard, which would help all vaccine developers.“We don’t know what high is. We’ve got immune responses that we can measure, we can see the virus being neutralised when the antibodies are tested in the laboratory, but we don’t know how much is needed. I mean it’s encouraging but it’s only the first milestone on this long path,” he said.Ideally the vaccine would protect against any infection, but scientists already accept it may reduce the severity of the disease instead, meaning people would be less likely to become very sick and die.The volunteers have been followed up for eight weeks so far after immunisation. A further question is how long any immune response will last – if for only six months or a year, people might need regular booster shots.Gilbert said the work so far suggested that would not be a problem. The vaccine is delivered through an inactivated chimp adenovirus, similar to one that causes the common cold in humans. There have been concerns that the immune system might recognise and reject the adenovirus in people given booster jabs.“We actually show in the paper that there are some antibodies that develop against the vaccine vector itself – against the adenovirus - it doesn’t stop the vaccine from boosting,” she said.There are also big questions over whether it will work in older adults – flu vaccinations do not give as much protection to older people, whose immune systems function less well than younger people’s. The trial participants were between 18 and 55 years old. The risk of dying from Covid-19 rises dramatically with age from about 65. Safety trials have already begun in two groups of older adults, said Gilbert – one group aged 56 to 69 and the other over-70s.Pollard said the vaccine was designed to stimulate both parts of the immune system. “The immune system has two ways of finding and attacking pathogens – antibody and T-cell responses. This vaccine is intended to induce both, so it can attack the virus when it’s circulating in the body, as well as attacking infected cells,” said Pollard.“We hope this means the immune system will remember the virus, so that our vaccine will protect people for an extended period. However, we need more research before we can confirm the vaccine effectively protects against Sars-CoV-2 infection, and for how long any protection lasts.”Others scientists gave a cautious welcome to the published study – and to a second paper published in the Lancet which showed trials in Wuhan of a vaccine developed in China on a similar basis, using a human adenovirus vector, showed it was also safe and generated an immune response.Alex Harris, the head of global policy and advocacy at the research charity Wellcome Trust, said the Oxford result was “just one crucial step but it’s very encouraging, and builds on the incredible global research effort during this crisis. To see promising results from several candidates in months is remarkable, but we must also be prepared for some candidates to fail in the later stages and be realistic about timeframes for manufacturing and rollout.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/49e332a90f1e28df922933a6677f85812880890b/0_8_2659_1596/master/2659.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=18d875a8e6d80ddd01718f1fd50f04c8","title":"jordan could look positively on one state solution if palestinian israeli rights equal","story":"Prime minister Omar Razzaz says Israel’s annexation plan would destabilise regionJordan’s prime minister has said his country could view positively a “one-state democratic solution” to the Israel-Palestine dispute, as he warned that Benjamin Netanyahu’s plans to annex parts of the West Bank could unleash a new wave of extremism in the Middle East.Omar Razzaz told the  that the Israeli prime minister’s annexation policy would be “ushering in a new apartheid state” that could be a radicalising force and further destabilise the region.“The way we see it, anything short of a viable two-state solution is going to push not just Jordan, not just Palestine, not just Israel, but the region and the world into chaos,” he said in an interview in Amman.But in a sign of the ailing status of the decades-old two-state formulation, Razzaz said Jordan could view favourably the creation of a single Palestinian-Israeli state, provided it gave equal rights to both peoples.Israeli leaders have traditionally eschewed any kind of one-state solution, fearing that the Palestinian population would eventually eclipse the Jewish one and threaten Israel’s religious identity. But the idea has grown in popularity among Palestinian activists as the prospect of establishing their own state has dimmed.“You close the door to the two-state solution, I could very well look at this positively, if we’re clearly opening the door to a one-state democratic solution,” Razzaz said.“But nobody in Israel is talking about that, and so we cannot just sugar-coat what they’re doing. Who’s talking about the one-state solution in Israel? They’re talking about apartheid in every single sense.“I challenge anybody from Israel to say yes, let’s end the two-state solution, it’s not viable,” he said. “But let’s work together on a one-state democratic solution. That, I think, we will look at very favourably. But closing one and wishful thinking about the other is just self-deception.”Razzaz’s comments signal greater openness to a one-state solution than previously expressed by the Jordanian leadership, albeit on a condition that Israel is unlikely to accept in the short term. They also give a possible preview of what Amman and other capitals might push for as a solution to the Israel-Palestine dispute if the annexation goes ahead.Led by its ruler King Abdullah II, Jordan has been an active and vocal campaigner against the annexation plan, arguing that it spells the end of the idea of creating an autonomous Palestinian state incorporating the West Bank, Gaza and parts of East Jerusalem.“We are against unilateral actions,” Razzaz said. “We are against annexation. We are against any steps that are not within an overall scheme that leads to a two-state solution. Short of that, if we’re not going towards a two-state solution, let us know what we’re going towards, what kind of one-state solution we’re going towards.”Jordan views the issue in existential terms, fearing that the death of the two-state solution could open the door to the possibility that it absorbs parts of the West Bank and its population – a popular idea on the Israeli far right that has gradually become more mainstream.Netanyahu has long opposed a full-fledged Palestinian state. In 2009 he agreed in principle to the possibility of future negotiations that may lead to a “demilitarised Palestinian state”. But since then he has repeated that Israel would always maintain full security control over the West Bank.Jordan and Israel signed a peace treaty in 1994 in the wake of the Oslo accords that became the foundation for years of failed negotiations for a Palestinian state. The armistice deal is unpopular among Jordanians but has proved durable because of strong security cooperation between the two countries. Its 25th anniversary passed last December without formal commemoration by either side.King Abdullah has said Jordanian relations with Israel are at a low point and that the annexation plans puts the two countries on a path of “massive conflict”. But he has stopped short of threatening to abrogate the treaty, a move diplomats in Amman and analysts regard as unlikely.Razzaz claimed annexation would enshrine a South Africa-style apartheid system that was already being practised against Palestinians inside Israel and in the occupied territories.“South Africa was not a problem for its neighbouring countries South Africa was a problem for the world. If Israel continues on this track, it’s going to be a problem for the world,” he said.Razzaz, a Harvard and MIT graduate and former World Bank director, has helped to steer one of the world’s most successful Covid-19 responses, with 11 deaths in Jordan from the virus since the beginning of the outbreak and no current community transmission, according to health officials.Oliver Holmes contributed to this report"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/243689fd549c7a921b95ed63e9367f4417682bb5/1036_88_3592_2155/master/3592.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8eb46483c861a6ecb7f04456c8270bf1","title":"great outdoors life moves outside during pandemic in pictures","story":"From art to religion, coronavirus has forced educational, cultural and social life into the open air on an unprecedented scale across the world"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/95b487f6298ae93d44202b825f8a670866569fed/0_126_1242_745/master/1242.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f518095e322503bde96d36abf69c4f3b","title":"four young artists reveal how they express their unique voice in pictures","story":"As part of  Labs’ collaboration with Levi’s and young people with something to say, Gen Z illustrators and photographers discuss what informs their work‘We need a more erse understanding of the world’“I use my art to celebrate the lips, noses, hair and skin colour of women from black and mixed-race communities who have become stigmatised and criticised by society,” says illustrator Vicki Jones. “I believe everyone is beautiful and worthy of greater acceptance. I want other black and mixed-race people to see someone who looks like them, and for our white allies to see people who aren’t like them. It gives us all a more erse understanding of how the world is.”‘We have to question body image issues’“I had a problematic relationship with food and body image, and so did most of my friends,” says photographer Fanny Beckman. “Did you know that more lives are lost to eating disorders than any other mental health condition? Women of My Generation is a multimedia project which combines photography and a podcast to question beauty standards, and dismantle our body image issues. I want to prove that it is, beyond doubt, possible to feel confident regardless of body size, sexuality, ethnicity or socioeconomic background.”‘Look closer, and a new level opens up’“My illustration style is lowbrow, cartoony, so it might not strike you that there’s meaning beyond the skateboarding-style graphics,” says illustrator Chris Martin. “But I’m hoping to communicate bigger issues in my drawing. As with the Cambridge Analytica scandal, there are unseen forces at work. Forces we don’t see straight away, but which create a deeper tension. There’s always another level to what we first think we see.”This is what confidence looks like“I use my voice to empower women and celebrate the ersity I see in my home city, London,” says photographer Milli Ahern. “I use bright saturated colours to project strength and confidence – a confidence that I didn’t feel myself, growing up. I was bullied about my appearance as a teenager. But that experience actually gave me strength as it led to me learning about photography, which allowed me to find my voice and highlight the beauty in ersity. Everyone needs to be seen and heard.”At the heart of the Your Voice. Your Way campaign is a zine, paid for by Levi’s, celebrating voices outside the mainstream. Created jointly by the four incredible artists showcased here and four talented writers, it proves the power of expressing yourself."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0f8ef8771d704bcada862904664df8501847e82e/0_0_1335_801/master/1335.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=227ac5f420b32dbae7c8172587057313","title":"a platform for the unheard the brand the zine and what it all means","story":"For the young creatives involved, deciding to apply to be part of a project to create a zine in collaboration with  Labs was easy. But why did Levi’s want to get involved?“Your Voice. Your Way is a celebration of imagination and identity,” says Yasmin Sinfield, brand marketing manager for Levi’s. But why does a brand best known for its denim care about amplifying unheard voices?“We believe we have a responsibility to support erse voices and make a stand against injustice – not just at this pivotal moment in history, but consistently,” she says.“As a brand Levi’s has a strong heritage of amplifying marginalised voices, and this zine has been in development for over a year. We’re committed to giving unheard voices a platform.”Levi’s, says Yasmin, has four core values: integrity, courage, empathy and originality. They serve as a reminder for the company to focus on what matters and to keep having important conversations. But what does that actually mean? And how does amplifying young voices contribute to those important conversations?“We’re doing our best to champion erse voices from the younger generation,” says Yasmin. This campaign wasn’t created to serve a financial purpose, but as a means to connect with, and rouse the voices of, this generation. Over the years, Levi’s has demonstrated its commitment to investing a portion of its annual earnings into communities. Take the Levi’s Music Project, for example, which connected global artists such as Alicia Keys and Skepta to young people to help them “champion their voice through music”.Levi’s also helped young LGBTQ+ photographers raise their voices, partnering with LGBTQ+ museum Queer Britain in celebration of Pride 2019 in the UK. The collaboration kicked off with a curated photography exhibition in London’s Covent Garden called Chosen Family. Levi’s truly believes that this zine is vital and authentic. From the company’s beginnings in 1853, it set out to enable people to express their iniduality. Now, Levi’s wants to work with us to empower our generation.Being courageous is about far more than building your own confidence. By raising your voice, you could inspire countless others. In this zine, Levi’s provides a platform for young voices because, says Yasmin: “Small changes spun together can create something much bigger that makes a real difference.”This zine isn’t the first Your Voice. Your Way project. Last year, the focus was on musicians from the Levi’s Music Project who had all faced barriers to achieving their dreams, but had transformed their lives by having courage in their own convictions.Musicians can make themselves heard when they perform, but there are so many people who don’t have a platform. “In a world where it seems like everyone’s talking over each other, it can be hard for young people to use their voices in their own way, because they don’t know where or how to do so,” says Yasmin.Levi’s thinks brands can provide a place to start, to platform emerging creatives and commit to listening to young voices. The partnership between Levi’s and  Labs has enabled us to set up and support a network of talented young creatives, bringing us together with mentors who will continue to encourage us.If you invented blue jeans, you have a good idea of what it means to be original. Levi’s had a practical purpose: its jeans were first created in 1873 to satisfy a need from workers who needed durable trousers those jeans evolved into one of the world’s most iconic fashion items. Now, our needs are more nuanced than durable workwear. Levi’s hopes Your Voice. Your Way will provide a “blank canvas for self expression”.When they told us we could create this zine our way, they meant it. We’ve had support but, ultimately, we called the shots. By giving us the opportunity to choose what stories to cover, we’ve had real creative freedom. We took the challenge to share our inidualism."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e66095eef528002831fac4e99023fe4cd7c16d3d/0_0_4480_2688/master/4480.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0cb5a9af8f4ac55c3e0eaa2de5753670","title":"gen z on challenging stereotypes i only saw muslim women on arabic channels","story":"Writer Ayat Mohamed is 18 and, like all of us, she’s an inidual with many aspects. So why is it so hard for her to find people to identify with in the media?I’m a Gen Z Muslim woman with immigrant parents and I don’t fit many stereotypes. Other stereotypes fit me alarmingly well: I think rice is one of God’s greatest creations, I talk too much, I care about my hair too much – which is even worse as nobody outside my household sees it.I also care about climate change, animal exploitation, mental health, respect, feminism and more. I’m multidimensional, and I don’t see myself represented enough.Representation has the power to implant views and stereotypes into mainstream consciousness, for better or for worse. We all need role models and there are lots of us who are being let down.It’s up to all of us to fix that. Starting now. Here, five people reveal how they’re breaking boundaries in race, mental health, body image, religion and age representation ...Malin Andersson“Mental health representation will make us all stronger,” says Malin Andersson, a mental health advocate and TV personality.I talk about grief, depression, body positivity, and domestic violence on my Instagram to open up those conversations. I get about a thousand messages a day from people saying I’ve helped them, so I know I’m raising awareness.Speaking up, especially when you show your vulnerability, can make people feel less alone and encourage them to share their experiences too. The more we talk about mental health issues, the more we take away their shame and stigma. We create space to be ourselves without being scared of what others will think. I hope this will lead to better representation of mental health issues.Dr Fatumina Said Abukar“I experienced racism because of a lack of representation,” says Dr Fatumina Said Abukar, an award-winning UCL scientist, model and Stem ersity advocate.I grew up in a small village where my family were the only people of colour, and I experienced a lot of racism.People threw eggs at me and beat me up, and I faced racial slurs. I’m frustrated when I walk into ersity shoots and I’m the only person of colour. When you only have one token figure it’s impossible for them to represent their whole community. This can lead to them being attacked by their own community if they do or say something wrong. I want to see different types of beauty in the media.Stephanie Yeboah“If I’d seen someone who looked like me, I would’ve had less self-hate issues,” says body positivity blogger Stephanie Yeboah.“I grew up feeling uncomfortable in my own skin. I’ve always been into fashion, but I felt like I had to hide that because there were few plus-size-friendly shops. I hated myself and dieted constantly. After university, I went to New York and met a group of women who were all bigger than me – yet confident and effervescent. Inspired, I posted a full-length picture of myself on social media.I was shocked at how positive people were. This generation is so lucky to have role models like Lizzo – I would’ve had less self-hate issues if I’d seen her when I was growing up. The body positive movement was created to celebrate women whose bodies aren’t seen by society as beautiful, so I’d like to see more variety of body shapes in the media.Zaynab Shaikh“Muslim women need better representation in fashion,” says hijabi model Zaynab Shaikh.Muslim women aren’t represented enough. Take fashion: few fashion brands care about Muslim women who want to dress modestly. Shopping is difficult because everything is too tight, sheer or has cut-outs. Just: no.Now, young people ask me how they can start modelling, which is so nice because when I grew up I only saw Muslim women on Arabic channels.Zahra Mohamed“Young people deserve people who look like them,” says Zahra Mohamed, Ayat’s 15-year-old sister.Representation affects young people and the adults we become. I have an issue with adult actors playing teens on screen as they create unrealistic expectations of how we should look, which has led to a rise in eating disorders, depression and anxiety.I like TikTok because it’s full of normal people. Instagram is full of heavily filtered influencers who I can’t relate to. It’s not fair that teens have to obsess over their appearance.

Dawn Bateman grew up on the remote and beautiful Horn Head near Dunfanaghy in Co Donegal, attending Holy Trinity National School and later Pobalscoil Chloich Cheannfhaola in Falcarragh. Today, Bateman and her husband, Chris, manage a 2.3 million acre farm in Australia’s Northern Territory and their children, Samy (4) and Pippa (3), are embarking on a very different educational experience.The nearest town, Katherine, is a six-hour drive away, and the family rarely visit. “We get all of our supplies delivered to Cape Crawford, a little roadhouse. A truck comes twice a week on a Wednesday from the food stores and on Friday with general freight. So we get everything pretty much delivered there or via mail plane once a week. We’ve got an airstrip on the property,” Bateman says. Samy started school this year and, like hundreds of other children living in remote areas across Australia, he is enrolled in a branch of the School of the Air (Sota). The school itself is in Mount Isa in Queensland, about a nine-hour drive away, but all of its 155 students learn remotely. The first of these schools was set up in Alice Springs in 1951 to provide accessible education for isolated children in outback regions of Australia, initially using high-frequency radios. Today, classes are conducted online, with follow-up activities done at home with the help of parents or tutors. For now, Samy’s classes are part-time and largely play-based. “It’s almost like a Zoom meeting...it’s pretty fun getting a heap of four-year-olds together,” Bateman says. “It’s like mustering cats but it’s good for him to talk to other kids.”Next year, when Pippa starts school, the couple will look into getting a tutor. “I know next year it gets a bit more serious and they have their on-air classes and they have set modules they have to complete. They have to do exams and it’s the same curriculum as the other schools. It definitely is difficult and that’s why people employ a governess, as it’s really a job in itself.”SocialiseBateman says she goes the extra mile to make sure her children socialise despite living in a remote part of the country. “You just have to do your best and get them mixing as much as possible.”She says many isolated children cannot participate in school sports or learn to swim as they’re so far away from any facilities. But a rural parents’ organisation has set up an annual sports camp so their kids can have that opportunity. “They do everything they do tennis, they do soccer, they do dance, they do gymnastics and they jam it all into a week. The kids are fried by the end of it.”Bateman says she also takes Samy and Pippa to rodeos in the winter, which is from June to August in Australia, to socialise with other kids but many were cancelled this year due to Covid-19 restrictions. “I didn’t think I’d miss them as much, but I most certainly did.”GovernessAishling Murphy moved from Wexford to Brisbane six years ago. After a few months in the city, she moved to outback Queensland and worked on a cattle station as a tutor, or governess as they are often referred to. Her role was to help the children on the property with their online education and school work. “If there was cattle work to be done we would go out and do it and school would happen when we got back. It kind of changes around the life timetable of home,” Murphy says. She now works as a teacher in a rural primary school, with just 16 students. When schools across Queensland closed for five weeks in April due to the pandemic, her experience as a tutor helped her to understand the balance parents at home had to find when trying to juggle work and overseeing the education of their children.“Most parents won’t have a background in education. I think they need to not be hard on themselves...Sometimes it just doesn’t flow,” Murphy says. “We were very lucky in that all of our kids had laptops and the kids were quite skilled on the computers already. We use the likes of Blackboard Collaborate. It’s like Skype and all of our distance education schools would use that for web conferencing with the kids.” Homework is sent to parents and children with explicit instructions, checking in with parents and then letting students talk to each other at the beginning of a lesson helped navigate the new way of learning. “Kids just want to talk to each other. I would have seen it too when I was a governess and during the first five minutes of the session we just let the kids talk. They want to get that out of their systems,” Murphy says.

Officials say that rather than freeze rents at their current level, they want to see them come down, as the collapse of Airbnb bookings frees up capacity, especially in Dublin.The Cabinet held a meeting via teleconference on Monday evening. Mr O’Brien said it was “well-known that the rent freeze could not be extended indefinitely.“So it is important we have strong legislation, which combines targeting those who are most vulnerable with longer term measures to address rent arrears, in place prior to the Dáil recess,” he said. But Sinn Féin has sharply criticised the Government for the uncertainty, and People Before Profit TD Richard Boyd Barrett said that people were already being threatened with eviction yesterday.Sinn Féin housing spokesman Eoin O Broin criticised the last minute nature of the announcement, just hours before the existing freeze and ban elapsed. “I have to say, if this was a deadline affecting banks, insurance companies, large developers, there is no way in hell it would be left to the 11th or 12th hour. This would have been resolved weeks ago. So I think it’s a shambles. It doesn’t augur well for the new minister. What we need to see is the extension until October at the least . . . and if additional legislation needs to be brought in, we’re open to discussing that with the minister,” he said.Mr Boyd Barrett said that he had been contacted by constituents whose landlords where threatening to evict them as soon as the ban on evictions lapsed. Attorney General Paul Gallagher has advised ministers that the legal underpinning for the rent freeze and the eviction ban – which have been in place since the pandemic hit, but are due to lapse today – is uncertain and could be open to challenge in the courts.Officials are understood to be preparing new legislation to put before the Dáil and Seanad before the end of the month which will clarify the powers of the Government to impose the measures, which will then be extended until the autumn.Sources briefed on the subject said that the Attorney was “exceptionally worried” about the possibility of a legal challenge to the rent freeze by commercial landlords, though it is understood that there are currently no such legal actions anticipated or before the courts. Mr O Broin was highly critical, however of the advice from Mr Gallagher. “One of the problems is the Attorney General they’ve appointed,” he said.He said that “most of the country’s leading scholars on constitutional law” took a less restrictive view of property rights in the constitution than Mr Gallagher apparently does.He said that Fine Gael and Fianna Fail had appointed Attorneys General who take a much more “conservative with a small c approach to property rights”.He said that within three weeks of taking office, “Fianna Fail’s housing minister is having a blazing row with Fianna Fail’s Attorney General over whether or not they can protect renters. That worries me about where this government is going to go particularly with this Attorney General’s advice”.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"Countries face a rapid ageing of their populations which will place enormous strain on their societiesOne Change: From plastic bottles to paper bags, our huge reliance on throwaway items needs to changeNational Economic and Social Council sets out actions needed for sustainable recovery"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Michael Viney: A predator denning in parks, gardens and wasteland gets mixed responsesA beefed-up, independent National Parks and Wildlife Service would be just the ticketMichael Viney: Wild grasses have loved the mood swings of our climate this yearAnother Life: As one of many of the world\u0026rsquos declining seabirds, puffins are now receiving much more necessary and serious attentionAnother Life: A new book on the founders of the Tyler Prize shows their political influenceAvian science journal Ibis reports \u0026lsquogreat conservation concern\u0026rsquo about the speciesAnother Life: Dairy farmer Bruce Thompson examines impact of worming drug on beetlesMichael Viney: Crumbling hilltop trig pillars\u0026rsquo played key role in the mapping of IrelandAntipodean flatworms pose risk to indigenous variety which could have severe knock-on effectsAnother Life: Some floaters circle territories and sneak the odd \u0026lsquoextra-pair copulation\u0026rsquoMichael Viney: Plant intelligence rests in the ways by which they solve their problemsA Life on Our Planet is a terrifying catalogue of our self-sabotaging transgressionsGreys carry squirrel-pox virus which is fatal to Ireland\u0026rsquos native redsAnother Life: The disappearance of this bird from cities has prompted much researchRobinson has followed Mair\u0026eacutead, his wife and collaborator, into the list of Covid-19 fatalitiesWill Covid-19 begin a resurgence of the 1970s withdrawal from growth-driven capitalism?Greater industry involvement required if bovine TB to be eliminated by 2030 targetMichael Viney: Camera traps are now used as a regular part of hare monitoringMarine life with very specific habitat needs threatened in the face of sweeping changeThree terrapins as pets seems a bit ambitious considering their needsThe list of causes of damage is long, making it hard to know where to start"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

File photograph: Getty Healthcare workers may have failed to declare symptoms of coronavirus out of fear of losing additional overtime or premium payments, an Oireachtas committee will hear on Tuesday.In a submission to the Oireachtas committee on the pandemic, trade union Siptu said the decision of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform not to permit employers pay their staff as per their roster if they were put on Covid-19 related leave, “resulted in significant financial disadvantage being incurred”.The union believes this may have resulted in staff not declaring symptoms to their employer if they knew it would put them off duty for at least 14 days, resulting in loss of overtime and premium pay. Siptu-represented grades within the health service rely on earning premiums to meet financial responsibilities, the union said.“Our members cannot afford to live on basic salary therefore mechanisms which are introduced, which result in financial penalties, are subject to a real outcome of potential non-disclosure and a failure to have effective detection systems in place,” the union said in its submission.The committee will hear on Tuesday from trade unions and the Health Service Executive about the 8,300 healthcare workers – almost a third of all known Covid-19 cases in the State – who have contracted the disease. RostersIn a separate submission, the Irish Medical Organisation has warned that adequate roster arrangements must be put in place to cover workers absent with the virus or who are excluded as potential close contacts of a case. The union said it was told by the HSE that “there was no jurisdiction on the public health service to enforce necessary protections for staff employed by a contractor but providing service on a HSE site”.Siptu maintained that the Government will not provide a death-in-service gratuity in respect of health service contract workers who died after contracting Covid-19 while on duty. The State’s acting chief medical officer Dr Ronan Glynn on Monday night warned employers and workers to adhere to public health precautions after expressing concerns about outbreaks in workplaces.Dr Glynn described the workplace, and particularly shops, services and supermarkets, as the “new front line”. The medic used Monday’s National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) briefing at the Department of Health to remind workers to keep a physical distance from colleagues. He used the example of the “first significant cluster on a construction site to date” – located in Dublin city centre where more than 20 cases have so far been identified – to warn employers about the continuing risk from the virus. He reported no new deaths from the disease and six new confirmed cases.Rachel Kenna, chief nursing officer at the department, urged the public to follow public health advice because healthcare workers were not prepared for a second Covid-19 wave in the winter.“They are tired they are not ready for another four months like we have just gone through,” she said. The Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation (INMO) has told the Covid-19 committee that almost two thirds of nurses who have recovered from Covid-19 were still experiencing post-viral fatigue.Meanwhile, senior Government sources said the publication of the so-called “green list” of non-quarantine countries is likely to go ahead this week, after discussions at Cabinet. While there is growing caution in Government about any relaxation of coronavirus restrictions, and some senior figures argued to postpone the publication of the list, it is expected to go ahead but with a much reduced list of countries. One senior source said there was “not a chance” of Spain, France and Italy being included on the list, though another source said he expected Greece to be included.Public opinion research carried out by the Department of Health suggests a high degree of public caution about lifting restrictions, with public concern about the virus rising steadily for the last month and now at the same levels that were last registered in April. Government sources continue to say the reopening of schools in September remains a priority Minister for Education Norma Foley is due to meet teaching unions on Tuesday for discussions on the reopening plan.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4309253.1595279083!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"i don t agree with it limerick publican ordered to cease trading","story":"Gardai called to a Limerick publican, who opened despite government guidelines not to, and asked him to cease trading as a wet house while reduced coronavirus guidelines remain in place,  Video: David Raleigh\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tGardaí arrive at Whelan’s Bar in Newcastle West, Co Limerick.  Photograph: Brendan Gleeson Limerick publican Gearóid Whelan and several of his regulars launched a short-lived rebellion against rules allowing only pubs serving food to open.Nearly 50 customers passed the doors of Whelan’s Bar on Maiden Street, Newcastle West, after it opened at 10.50am on Monday – proof, said Mr Whelan, that pubs can operate safely, even in a time of Covid-19.Pat Reidy, from Ardagh, was one of the first in “to support Gearóid”. Reading a newspaper in his socially-distanced chair, the 62-year old said the ban on non-food pubs is “an injustice”.“I think it is great the Whelan’s took the stance on this. A big mistake has been made by the Government, and I hope they look at this and move on from it,” Mr Reidy added.Mr Whelan’s 69-year-old mother Pauline, a nurse in a local care home, greeted customers, directed them to sanitizing gel, collected their names for contact tracing, and took temperatures.“They’re all very delighted and very supportive of us to be able to open our door after four and half months,” Mrs Whelan said.She said it was an emotional day, after being closed for more than four months: “We run a very good house, never any trouble, and we have very good clientele, there’s no messing tolerated in this premises.”Mr Whelan’s father, Pat (72), who has pulled pints in the town for 55 years, supported his son: “I think he’s done the right thing, he’s not breaking any law. The pubs have been unfairly treated.”‘A chance’Reflecting the views of many rural publicans, Mr Whelan said: “Just give us a chance, let us prove that we can do this, that’s all we ask, just a fair level playing field.”At 1pm gardaí entered the premises and requested Mr Whelan to close, handing him a copy of the regulations that require pubs not serving meals costing €9, or more, to close.“I’m complying with their advice and I’ve closed my doors,” Mr Whelan said. “I don’t agree with it... We are doing nothing wrong, there’s nothing illegal going on.”Asked if gardaí had said he could face penalties if he stayed open, he replied: “Let’s just say I was advised to close, yes, long term it might not be the best for me to stay open.”“I’m disappointed, gutted, but all I wanted to show was that we can do this. Everyone that was here this morning saw we can offer a Covid-safe, socially-distanced, enjoyable atmosphere, for a couple of pints,” Mr Whelan said.Local Jamie Mullane (19) said: “We came in to support Gearóid, he’s sticking his neck out on the line, opening up the pub when no one else would.“How can thousands come in through the airports and a couple of locals can’t come down to the pub. There isn’t much difference in us having a meal here, and how is that going to spread the virus more than just having a pint?”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Culture of staff working when ill contributed to larger outbreaks, says IMOState\u0026rsquos chief medic warns that workplaces are \u0026lsquonew front line\u0026rsquo in fight against the virusResearch by Department of Children noted creche fees among highest in EuropeIrish Medical Organisation calls for State to stockpile PPE in event of second waveMinisters and officials continue to put final touches to \u0026lsquoJuly jobs\u0026rsquo plan expected later this weekLink between oral and general health \u0026lsquocompletely overlooked\u0026rsquo, says leading dentistGear\u0026oacuteid Whelan says he opened premises to prove he could offer \u0026lsquoCovid-safe\u0026rsquo serviceAttorney General says the measures - set to lapse today - could be open to legal challengeActor says he \u0026lsquoenabled bigots\u0026rsquo with online comments relating to MinisterSix new cases but no further deaths reported in Republic on MondayTrial is first in Courts of Criminal Justice since lockdown and social distancing applies\u0026lsquoVulnerable\u0026rsquo child subjected to campaign of rape and exploitation over three yearsImre Arakas jailed in 2018 for his role in a Kinahan cartel murder plotLegal action taken against Hiqa over regulator\u0026rsquos restriction on multi-bedded roomsO\u0026rsquoNeill seeks all-island alignment as Foster urges \u0026lsquorespect\u0026rsquo for Common Travel AreaBurglary of house in Walkinstown took place in 2016Work at site in capital closes after 20 workers test positive for coronavirusInmates unable to secure drugs during lockdown are now at risk of overdosingThe grant will be used for the design phase of the upgrade of the Kildare rail lineInland Fisheries Ireland said protection of salmon remains \u0026rsquohighest priority\u0026rsquoStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4308913.1595257554!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"first human trials of oxford covid 19 vaccine suggest it is safe","story":"An experimental coronavirus vaccine being developed by AstraZeneca and Oxford university was safe and produced an immune response in early-stage clinical trials.  Video: Oxford University Reuters\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tResults of phase 1 trials suggest the vaccine triggers two types of immune response. Photograph: EPA The first human trials of a Covid-19 vaccine being developed by researchers at the University of Oxford suggest it is safe and triggers two types of immune response.It stimulates production of antibodies – proteins that can bind to the virus, preventing it from entering cells and flagging it to immune cells, and “killer” T cells – white blood cells that attack infected human cells, according to phase 1 trial results published by The Lancet on Monday.Trials involving some 1,077 people showed the injected virus led to them making antibodies and white blood cells that can fight coronavirus, and did not prompt any serious side effects.It is too soon to know if this is enough to offer protection and larger trials are under way involving 30,000 people.However, with Covid-19 cases continuing to accelerate, the findings will be greeted with relief around the world as it suggests the vaccine is able to elicit the right type of immune response though more research is necessary.Common coldThe Oxford vaccine being developed with AstraZeneca pharmaceutical company is a weakened version of a common cold virus (adenovirus) that causes infections in chimpanzees, that has been genetically changed so it is impossible for it to grow in humans.“We are seeing very good immune responses, not just on neutralising antibodies but of T-cells as well. We’re stimulating both arms of the immune system,” said Prof Adrian Hill head of Oxford’s Jenner Institute.The US biotech company Moderna released results last week from an early-stage test that showed its vaccine raised levels of antibodies that fight the virus.Although stimulating production of neutralising antibodies does not prove a vaccine will be effective, it’s considered an important early step in testing.“We want other companies to have vaccines that work as well because the world will get more vaccine sooner,” added Prof Hill. “We just feel there is an advantage of having both arms of the immune system stimulated well. We’re very encouraged...I think we’re a bit more confident it should work this week than last week.”The Oxford vaccine elicited neutralising antibodies after a single dose, confirmed the Irish scientist, which may be an important advantage in quickly raising immunity.“I don’t read that clearly in the Moderna data,” he said. “I think they need two doses to see plausibly protective neutralising antibodies.”Large trialA large trial is set to begin this month that will test Moderna’s vaccine in a two-shot regimen.AstraZeneca will also prioritise a two-shot regimen, Dr Hill said, as “it gives higher titres of antibodies, which is important going forward”.An antibody titer is a test that measures the amount of antibodies in blood.The Oxford team still hopes its vaccine could be ready by September. The next big steps will be an appraisal of the protection it provides.The two key questions will be whether the immune response can protect against severe disease, and if so, for how long. The UK government has already ordered 100 million doses of the vaccine.One issue, however, relates to recent studies which found antibodies in people who have had Covid-19 drop off over a three-month period after infection. A key question is whether the same drop off is seen in antibodies triggered by a vaccine.Both the Moderna and Oxford vaccines triggered an immune response in a different way to natural infection, meaning this would not necessarily be expected.But even if antibodies do wane, the body might still be able to produce them much faster next time, while T-cell response tends to last longer and so might offer longer-lasting protection.The duration of antibody and T-cell responses is different for every vaccine and cannot be predicted accurately. It is also different for any natural infection, so the scientists have to wait and see how long our volunteers carry antibodies and T cells specific for Sars-CoV-2.A Covid-19 vaccine developed by CanSino Biologics and China’s military research unit has also shown to be safe and induced immune response in most of the recipients, researchers said on Monday.Meanwhile, Britain has signed deals to secure 90 million doses of two possible Covid-19 vaccines from the Pfizer and BioNTech alliance and French group Valneva.It now means the UK has purchased close to 200 million doses – more than enough to immunise its total population, though two doses per person are likely to be required to boost protection.

File photograph: Niall CarsonPA Minister for Children Roderic O’Gorman has accepted an apology from actor John Connors following his “wrong and unfair” involvement in a homophobic campaign against the Green Party politician.Earlier this month Mr Connors, a prominent Travellers’ rights activist, had called for Mr O’Gorman’s resignation after far-right Twitter accounts had reposted a photo of him with British LGBT activist Peter Tatchell at Dublin Pride in 2018.Mr Connors had said allegations about the newly appointed Green Party Minister and his association with Mr Tatchell should be “the political scandal of the year”.The actor accused the Green Party of inviting Mr Tatchell to take part in Pride and highlighted the campaigner’s past efforts to lower the British age of consent to 14.However, Mr O’Gorman said the Green Party had not invited Mr Tatchell to take part in Pride, but that he had been invited to Ireland by another group involved in the festivities.Saying that he had met Mr Tatchell at Dublin Pride for “the first and only time”, Mr O’Gorman said he had become the victim of a “far-right social media pile-on” that used misinformation to play on child protection concerns.Defending his conduct, Connors had initially said Mr O’Gorman was “playing the victim card and claiming homophobia” and that people were being branded as far-right for “being anti-paedophilia”.However, in a statement posted on Twitter on Sunday night, Connors said he wanted to apologise to Mr O’Gorman for his comments that had been “so wrong and unfair on every level”.“I allowed myself to lead and be part of an online frenzy that cast hurtful and false assertions on his character and pursued him in the most unfair way,” he declared.Homophobic backlashMr Connors said he had “battled bigotry my whole life and my deranged pursuit of Minister O’Gorman played a huge part in the homophobic backlash he received from the very bigots I despise”.Saying past tragedies had taken “its toll on my mental health”, Mr Connors said this “in no way” excused his actions: “Looking back I’m sick to my stomach”.He said his own “misguided anger led me to appear to feed an army of trolls and support groups whose views I find repugnant, whose politics are rotten and whose methods are ugly”.“I find myself in a position where I seem to have sided with the very people whose politics I most despise. I have been politically naive. I did not fully inform myself of their views and l am truly horrified that I have in any way enabled them.”Replying, Mr O’Gorman said on Monday that he “very much” appreciated the apology and considered the matter fully resolved. “Take care of yourself, John,” he said.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4309200.1595275532!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"what green list ministers grapple with opposing forces in holiday crux","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tConcerns about the dangers of overseas visitors bringing further infections to Ireland have grown as the lockdown has eased and tourism has restarted.  Photograph: Getty ImagesMinisters and senior officials are trying to chart a path through the coming weeks of the holiday season – one that deals with public health concerns about importing Covid-19 and yet keeps Ireland open for business.Concerns about the dangers of overseas visitors bringing further infections to Ireland have grown as the lockdown has eased and tourism – domestic and foreign – has restarted.The Government is due to announce a “green list” of non-quarantine countries this week, but there have been political and public health calls to tighten the restrictions, not ease them.Meanwhile, the acting chief medical officer, Ronan Glynn, speaking at a National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) briefing, warned of the danger of new clusters emerging in workplaces and public places.The Government is increasingly cautious about any list of “safe” countries, or measures, such as reopening the pubs as normal, which would give the ailing tourism economy a boost.However, senior sources also rule out draconian travel and quarantine restrictions. There is little chance that airlines will be told not to fly, or that arrivals will be brought to the Citywest Hotel and kept there for 14 days.The rationale is both practical and symbolic. Firstly, there would be a huge enforcement issue, especially when the case of cross-Border traffic and visitors from the rest of the UK are\u0026nbspconsidered.Meanwhile, voices caution that such a move would send out a disastrous message for a country that relies on overseas trade. “We are one of the world’s most open economies,” says one senior source. “We can’t just shut that down.”The Department of Foreign Affairs has warned about the impacts on foreign direct investment if the Government were to drastically reduce international travel or enforce a mandatory supervised quarantine.Yet the Government is also conscious that the public is increasingly nervous. Opinion research for the Department of Health shows that worries about the virus have been rising steadily for the past month. It is where it was at the end of April. Strikingly, more people now believe that the worst of the virus is “ahead of us” (38 per cent) rather than “behind us” (33 per cent).This is the first time since the end of April that there are more pessimists than optimists on this question. A huge majority of people (78 per cent) believe that a second wave is likely or very likely.Public supportShould the Government choose to reimpose some of the lockdown restrictions it seems there will be public support – almost half (48 per cent) say they would favour more restrictions, with just a third (33 per cent) not in favour.Nearly two-thirds of people (65 per cent) say the response so far has been appropriate, while 31 per cent say it has been insufficient. Only 4 per cent say the restrictions have been too extreme.What does all that mean?The Government is faced with pressures from each side – pressure from the tourism industry and associated lobbies to reopen quicker, and pressure from public health authorities to slow down.The public is on the side of the public health experts, such as \u0026nbspGlynn. Most likely the Government will try carefully to pick out a compromise path in the weeks ahead.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Many cities and states locking down again as new infection figures hit record highsChina warns it will deliver \u0026lsquoresolute response\u0026rsquo to any move by UK to sanction officialsDozens missing as overflowing Brahmaputra River damage crops and triggers mudslidesMore than 150 people have died or are missing in flooding and landslidesTwo other teenagers who ate meat from same infected animal being treated with antibioticsAlmost 4cm-long nematode roundworm is thought to have come from raw fishThousands displaced after heavy rains trigger flash floodingMove after Japan\u0026rsquos capital records highest daily cases \u0026ndash 224 \u0026ndash since pandemic beganInfluential sister of Kim Jong-un says meeting makes no sense without reward for PyongyangMayor was reportedly subject of criminal investigation into sexual assault allegationsBilateral military deal driven by Tehran fury at bombs and arson blamed on US and IsraelBeijing calls on Australia to stop interfering following response to China imposing new security law in territoryGlory to Hong Kong, deemed to contain \u0026lsquostrong political messages\u0026rsquo, can no longer be sung or playedMost deaths have come from hardest-hit Kunamoto prefecturePM\u0026rsquos image undamaged as Bharatiya Janata party proves adept at deflecting blameFor three decades the armies of the two most populous countries have been patrolling a disputed border in the HimalayasDozen people missing on southwestern island of Kyushu as government pledges to boost rescue effortsArmy deployed to patrol the NSW and Victoria borders, closed for first time in 100 yearsFlooding and mudslides on Kyushu force hundreds of thousands to evacuate homesGlobal wrap: Subcontinent overtakes Russia, as border between Australian states to closeStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"Hopewell Chin\u0026rsquoono seized as part of a crackdown on anti-corruption protestersIsraeli prime minister still awaiting final approval from Washington for implementation of controversial planGovernment under pressure as initial lifting of restrictions now seen as having been too rapidEndeavour intended to stoke Arab and Muslim pride over rich heritage of discoveryCases confirmed in doctors and nurse with concern virus will move fast through campsHealth officials say country in \u0026lsquodangerous place\u0026rsquo after early success in curbing epidemicSpeculation grows that \u0026lsquofire\u0026rsquo may have been deliberate attack on facilityIsrael\u0026rsquos move on West Bank and Trump peace plan blocked by Palestinian rivals\u0026lsquoDefender of Israel\u0026rsquo Boris Johnson says move would be \u0026lsquoviolation of international law\u0026rsquoPlan to annex parts of West Bank condemned by UN commissioner as \u0026lsquodisastrous\u0026rsquoSome 9.3m Syrians are now food insecure, an increase of 1.4m in past six monthsSeparatist insurgents from Balochistan province claim responsibility for attackNo group claimed responsibility for the attack and Taliban has denied involvementThousands of children could die from preventable diseases because of dire state of healthcare, UN warnsArab world unites in opposition and warns of dire consequences if annexation proceedsOnly under-65s can take part and pilgrims will be quarantined before and after pilgrimageWorld community urged to reject move to intensify \u0026lsquoprofound human rights violations\u0026rsquoAmple evidence uncovered of movement\u0026rsquos widespread persecution of Yazidi minority and other ethnic minoritiesSarah Hegazi\u0026rsquos simple gesture at a concert led to outrage, persecution and heartbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4307074.1595229388!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"flare up in iraq oil well flames darken lives of locals","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFlares from oil wells light the night sky in Nahran Omar in Iraq. Photograph: Ivor PrickettNew York Times The men of Nahran Omar, a village in the heart of southern Iraq’s oil country, filed into a Shia shrine clutching envelopes with X-rays, medical reports and death certificates.They had come to describe the misery they say is caused by the burning gas and chemicals spewing out of the oil wells in their village. Each one had a sick son or a dying wife, an ill brother or sister.“Imagine that in the town you come from every family has someone who has cancer,” said Khalid Qassim Faleh, a local tribal leader. “This is the situation in Nahran Omar.”The chemicals in the air – in Nahran Omar and other oil towns across southern Iraq – come from the smoky orange flames atop the oil wells, burning away the natural gas that bubbles up with the oil.Many countries have reduced the practice, known as flaring, in part because it wastes a precious resource. The amount of gas Iraq flares would be enough to power three million homes, according to the International Energy Agency. But flaring also produces chemicals that can pollute the air, land and water.It has been shown to worsen asthma and hypertension, contribute to the incidence of some cancers and speed climate change. Iraq, however, still flares more than half the natural gas produced by its oil fields, more than any other country except Russia.The practice contributes to Iraq’s bizarre energy paradox: a country with some of the world’s largest oil and gas reserves faces a chronic power shortage and frequent blackouts. To feed its gas-powered electricity plants during the long, hot summers, it has to import gas, which it buys primarily from Iran.Wasted resource“Iraq could be self-sufficient,” said Ali al-Saffar, the head of the Middle East and North Africa ision of the Paris-based International Energy Agency. “Instead it’s in a league of its own: it is unique because it flares gas at the same time that it imports it.”As Iraq’s economy craters under the twin assault of collapsing oil prices and the coronavirus pandemic, it can ill-afford the several billion dollars a year it spends buying gas from Iran. The purchases also undercut US sanctions on Iran aimed at preventing it from selling oil and gas.Iraqi officials acknowledge the need to reduce flaring but say that efforts to build expensive plants and pipelines to recapture gas from oil wells have been hindered by war and now by the dire economy. After the Islamic State terror group seized a third of the country in 2014, the battle against it required every bit of government revenue for several years.In the last six months, crashing oil prices have deprived the government of its main source of revenue and the coronavirus pandemic has shut down much of the economy.“So, okay, we respect people’s criticism,” said Iraq’s former oil minister, Thamer Ghadban. “But let them come here and try to operate oil and gas plants under these circumstances.”For years, recapturing the gas was not a priority, given the country’s seemingly endless oil supply and, until recently, fat oil profits. But that is changing, officials say. After years of delays, Iraq opened a large recapture plant in Basra in 2018 at a cost of an estimated $1.5 billion, according to oil industry experts. But the plant is only a first step: it recovers a little more than half of the gas from three large oil fields. There are 15 oil fields in Basra province alone.The oil ministry announced plans last month to develop plants that would recover most of the gas that is now flared in southern Iraq. Ghadban said the projects would be operational in two to three years. International energy experts say that given Iraq’s economic troubles, those projections are wildly optimistic.Dante’s infernoFlying into Basra at night looks like a descent into Dante’s inferno: spires of flame cast pools of orange light in the darkness. A sizzling city – summer temperatures regularly the high 40s – of nearly three million people in Iraq’s southeastern corner, Basra and the surrounding province hold 60 per cent of Iraq’s proven oil reserves. But it was not the temperature that startled listeners of a morning weather forecast last August.“We are sounding the alarm,” the weatherman said in what has become a familiar refrain. “Today there are poisonous gases in the skies of southern Iraq that can harm people. The poisonous gases are a result of oil and car exhaust.”Gas flaring is not the only cause of pollution in the oil-rich southeast. Petrochemical plants, aging sewage plants, uranium from degrading weapons and materiel from recent wars all contribute to what Shukri Hassan, a professor of environment at the University of Basra, calls “a cocktail of pollutants”.“The air quality is really bad, water quality is also very poor, and there are many problems with the soil,” he said. “All of that makes Basra not a livable place.”Flaring also wreaks havoc on the environment. Iraqi flaring releases as much as 30 million tons of carbon dioxide a year, nearly 10 per cent of the flaring emissions of the greenhouse gas worldwide. At the same time, flaring wastes clean-burning gas Iraq could use in its power plants, increasing its reliance on dirty oil-based fuel and compounding the environmental damage.Iraq has decent environmental laws on the books, but no one enforces them, said Ali Shaddad al-Fares, a local builder and entrepreneur who heads the provincial council’s oil and gas committee. “The oil companies have committed to protect the environment but there is no government enforcement. It is their job to protect the people, but they aren’t doing it.”Special hellAn hour outside of Basra, the village of Nahran Omar offers a glimpse of the special hell of life amid an oil field. The village, population about 1,500, comprises three hamlets along the banks of the Tigris river as it widens out before emptying into the Persian Gulf.The government found oil and built the first well there in the 1960s. Today five wells dominate the eastern end of the village.The wells pump out a mix of oil, water and gas, primarily methane. The oil is channelled into tanks and pipelines to the port at Um Qasr. The oil-tainted water drains into a pond on the village’s outskirts, killing any life there. Nothing lives in the water, no grasses or plants grow nearby, even the desert birds avoid perching too close to it.Flaring is just a cheap way to get rid of the methane, which would otherwise be an explosive hazard. Many oil-producing countries, including the United States, flare gas, but rarely close to homes. In Nahran Omar, the flares roar day and night, kicking out so much heat that the faces of people who live nearby look permanently sunburned.The leaves of nearby trees curl brown on the sides that face the flares. Children born in Nahran Omar in the past decade have never known silence nor seen a dark night sky because the flares cast an unending, brilliant light over the surrounding landscape.“We cannot breathe here,” said Beshir Aude el-Jabber, the village mukhtar or community leader. “If you want to breathe, you have to drive away from our village. For the children it is especially hard, their lungs are small. For the old people too, it is hard because their lungs are weak.”The flares produce what the locals call oil rain, an oily precipitate made from the amalgam of water and hydrocarbons that do not completely burn during flaring and which, as it cools, absorbs water in the humid atmosphere. The breezes off the nearby Tigris carry the brew to nearby houses.“The oil rain from the flares destroyed our gardens and we cannot plant anymore,” el-Jabber said. “Sometimes when we get up early in the morning we see the oil rain on our clothes that were hanging out to dry for the night and our cars are spotted with it.”Oil is splattered on the corrugated metal roofs like pointillist paintings. The only way to remove it is with diesel fuel, Jabber said. Most families have a member who has had cancer. “My son died five years ago of lymphoma,” said Abu Beshir Nasir Shreggi (58), a teacher. “He was an athlete and very strong. He was like all the kids, he liked soccer.” He pulled out his cellphone and showed a photo of a boy in a yellow soccer jersey.When his son got sick, Shreggi said he complained to a member of the provincial council, who suggested he send his son abroad for treatment. Shreggi laughed ruefully. “That would cost $50,000 and no one is going to give me the money,” he said. “And so my son is dead.”Cancer clusterEpidemiologists say there is a relationship between intensive petroleum production and some cancers, but in a place like Basra, with multiple sources of pollution, it is hard to draw conclusions about causality. The mix of hydrocarbons in oil rain can be carcinogenic, said Dr Marilyn Howarth, a senior fellow at the University of Pennsylvania’s Centre of Excellence in Environmental Toxicology. “The oil itself can contain traces of heavy metals, arsenic and radioactivity, which could be a source of lung cancer,” she said.The byproducts of oil production can contribute to the risk of leukaemia, lymphomas, myeloma, and kidney and bladder cancer, said Dr Otis Brawley, a professor of oncology and epidemiology at Johns Hopkins. Oil workers may also be exposed to known carcinogens like asbestos, he said.The Basra office of the ministry of health says that the rates of cancer in southern Iraq are only marginally higher than those elsewhere in the country – “about the same as for the rest of the region”, said Dr Abbas Tamimi, the head of the Basra health department.But he acknowledged that cancer deaths are underreported because of stigma attached to having cancer. Still, the number of cancer cases in Nahran Omar seems high by any standard, according to local politicians like Fares of the provincial oil and gas committee and cancer experts at Basra Hospital.Jabber, the mukhtar, who has kept a meticulous table of local cases, said that in the last six years, 54 residents have died and another 33 are suffering from some form of cancer. That means about 6 per cent of the population has got cancer in that period.About half of those who died were under 25, according to his records. In several instances, two people in the same family died of cancer. The most prevalent cancers in Nahran Omar are lymphoma, kidney cancer and breast cancer. Brawley, who is familiar with some of the contaminants in southern Iraq, said that Nahran Omar “sounds like a cluster” but that without comparative studies it would be difficult to say whether cancer rates there are higher than normal.Toothless finesThe villagers have turned to government and quasi-government agencies for help to no avail. Among them: the Basra Oil Co, a state-owned enterprise that has a majority share in all oil production in southern Iraq the provincial council’s oil and gas committee, which was recently eliminated and the Basra branches of the ministry of health and environment.Senior officials at each of those institutions acknowledge that flaring wastes energy and degrades the air quality. The environment ministry, which five years ago was merged with the health ministry, has levied numerous fines against Basra Oil for a variety of violations including flaring beyond the legal limit. But the company acknowledges that it is cheaper to pay the fines than to build another recapture plant, which can cost $1 billion or more.“The ministry of environment imposed many penalties against us, but it’s not easy to develop environmental protections because it requires so much investment,” said Khalid Hamza Abbas, the company’s senior chief engineer. “We have a plan to treat the gas, if we have the budget.”That is a big if. Iraq is now running a $2.5 billion deficit per month. And the plan would do little for the village of Nahran Omar. No recapture plant has been proposed for the five oil wells there. Despite the pollution and illness, no one there wants the oil wells to close.When residents demonstrated against Basra Oil in 2018 it was to demand more jobs for local residents. The company hires very few locals once the wells are built. ‘We want you to employ us, to employ our sons,” Faleh, the tribal leader, said at his home on a sweltering evening. It was hot and sticky inside, and the electricity had gone off – a reminder that despite the oil and wealth being produced there, many locals see few benefits.Faleh struggled to explain his feelings: he suffers from breast cancer and expects that he will die of it in a few years. But if the oil wells are killing villagers, he said, at least the industry could provide a livelihood. “You see our lives are over,” he said. “We want to do something for our children.” – New York TimesStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com\"/polopoly_fs/1.4192672!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_940/image.jpg","title":"us democratic","story":"The process to choose the Democratic nominee to take on Donald Trump in November’s US presidential election is well under way.States across the country are in the process of choosing\u0026nbsptheir preferred candidate, either through a primary contest or a caucus.

It was unbelievable.Tracey Steadman, a district nurse from Derbyshire, is on holiday in Bournemouth with her three children, who are aged 18, 14 and 13.She said there was no sudden explosion but that she heard several pops once the fire was underway.Mrs Steadman, 48, said: I didn\u0027t hear a bang or anything like that. I just turned around and saw a huge plume of smoke.There were flames erupting from one hut and people were forced to leave their possessions on the beach to get away safely.There was no time to pack up things like wind-breaks, people just had to abandon them on the sand.I saw a few of the other huts catch fire and the wind blew the flames onto the hill which went up so quickly.Thankfully we were about 160ft away but the fire was absolutely huge.The police arrived within minutes but unfortunately the fire brigade were slightly behind them so by the time they got there, the hill was already in flames.Firefighters had to climb onto the hill to try and put it out and after that there was just a huge amount of smoke.The fire started about 400 yards west of Bournemouth Pier and just beneath the Highcliff Marriott Hotel.Three beach huts have been destroyed.Police cleared a section of the beach while at least five fire crews tackled the blaze.Presently, a fire engine with a cherry picker is spraying the hill with water.There are not believed to be any injuries.One eye witness, who did not wish to be named, said: Three beach huts caught fire then the fire spread quickly to the cliff.The flames were very thick and someone in a beach hut near to where it happened rushed out carrying their gas canisters to avoid a possible explosion.There were three fire engines tackling it on the beach front and two up top from what I could tell.They seem to have got it under control but it was quite alarming.A spokesman for Dorset Police said: We were called at 3.53pm to reports of a beach hut near to the West Cliff lift on Bournemouth\u0027s West Cliff. The fire has spread to nearby beach huts and is moving up the cliff.Members of the public are being advised to avoid the area.The fire service is dealing with the incident. A cordon is in place for the safety of members of the public and officers are at the scene to assist with the closures.A spokesperson for Dorset and Wiltshire Fire and Rescue said: Dorset \u0026amp Wiltshire Fire and Rescue Service is currently dealing with a fire on West Undercliff in Bournemouth, affecting three beach huts and approximately 100 square metres of heath on the cliff face.We were called to the scene at 3.51pm and have fire crews in attendance from Redhill Park, Springbourne, Westbourne and Christchurch, together with the aerial appliance from Westbourne. Additional crews are en route.The fire is causing significant smoke across the promenade and across West Hill Road. People are asked to stay away from the area, and to keep doors and windows closed as a precaution.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus vaccine could ready end year 50000 people can take","story":"A Covid-19 vaccine could still be ready by the end of the year if scientists can get 50,000 people in trials in the next six weeks, experts have said.Oxford University published the first human trial results on Monday, showing that its vaccine against coronavirus is safe and produces an immune response.Initially, it had been hoped that a vaccine might be ready by September, but the number of Covid-19 cases plummeted in Britain after lockdown, meaning the chance of getting infected dropped substantially and making it difficult to test a vaccine.Researchers were forced to move trials to South Africa and Brazil.However, Professor Adrian Hill, the director of the Jenner Institute at the University of Oxford, said a jab could yet be ready by December if enough people could be recruited for trials by the beginning of September. It\u0027s possible there will be a vaccine being used by the end of the year, he said. What that needs is enough cases, probably about 50,000 people to be in trials by six weeks time, including the very large US trial and to have an adequate incidence, and of course the vaccine has to work.But, you know, if it worked by early November – and it might be a little before that – you might have emergency use authorisation in a month, and then you would be deploying in December.Matt Hancock, the Health Secretary, has called for an army of volunteers to take part in vaccine research as the Government launched a national registry to sign up for trials.  The Department of Health is hoping that 500,000 people will register by October, and at least six vaccine teams from across the world are already keen to begin trials in Britain.Mr Hancock said: A safe and effective vaccine is our best hope of defeating coronavirus and returning to life as normal.We have some of our best scientists and researchers working on this, but members of the public have a vital role to play too. So I urge everyone who can to back the national effort and sign up to the NHS Covid-19 vaccine research registry to help find a vaccine as soon as possible.The Government is hoping to carry out trials in Covid-19 hotspots such as Leicester, where there is still a high level of disease in the community.  Kate Bingham, who chairs the Government\u0027s Vaccines Taskforce, said: We\u0027re finding a big appetite from laboratories to come and run their vaccine trials here.We\u0027ve got real-time data to inform us where there are spikes of disease transmission and want to recruit people in those areas as that will be the quickest way to see if a vaccine works. I\u0027m slightly amazed it\u0027s never been done before, and no other country is doing anything like this.The Oxford vaccine is still ahead in the race against Covid-19. Initial results published in The Lancet on 1,077 British adults showed that the jab produced strong antibody and T-cell responses, which may improve further after a booster jab.No serious adverse events were reported, and minor side effects could be controlled by paracetamol, the study showed.The Oxford team is one of 23 laboratories around the world working on a vaccine. Professor Sarah Gilbert, the lead researcher said: It\u0027s a really important day. It\u0027s a really important milestone. There is still a long way to go. We still need to see how the vaccine responds in older people, but we\u0027ve got both arms of the immune system engaged. The difficulty we have is that we don\u0027t know how strong that immune response needs to be.The Government has already announced funding for 100 million doses of the vaccine from AstraZeneca, and a further 90 million from the BioNtechPfizer alliance and Valneva. The first doses will go to frontline workers and vulnerable groups such as the elderly, people with illnesses and black, Asian and minority ethinic (BAME)  groups, who have been disproportionately impacted by the pandemic. Dr Teresa Lambe, general investigator on the Oxford trial said: We\u0027re super-excited to see these results out.  This is one step along the way of a long journey. There is lots more to do and we\u0027re excited to do that, if a bit tired.Boris Johnson, the Prime Minister, also congratulated the Oxford team, writing on Twitter: A huge well done to our brilliant, world-leading scientists \u0026amp researchers at Oxford University.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"experts hail results human trials potential covid vaccine really","story":"The eyes of the world were turned on Oxford University on Monday as the results of the first human trials of a potential Covid-19 vaccine were published. The British team is the furthest ahead of the 23 laboratories racing to find a way to prevent Covid-19, which has killed more than 610,000 people around the world since December.Experts hailed the results as a really important milestone which kept alive the hope of a vaccine being rolled out before Christmas. The vaccine trial, involving 1,077 healthy Britons, began on April 23 and ran at five hospitals across the UK until May 21.  It is still ongoing, but scientists have spent the past few weeks crunching the data.The volunteers were split into four groups, and either received the Covid-19 vaccine or a safe meningitis vaccine. One group was also given an extra dose at 28 days to see whether a booster was needed.The results seem compelling.  T-cell response began to grow in those receiving the vaccine and peaked at day 14, while neutralising antibodies were found in 91 per cent of the participants 28 days after vaccination. The booster group had a far greater immune response. It also seems the vaccine is safe. There were no serious adverse reactions, and side-effects were confined to fatigue, headaches, pain at the injection site and temporary flu-like symptoms including muscle ache, malaise, chills, feeling feverish and high temperature.The trial showed that taking paracetamol could allay most of the effects without impacting the efficacy of the vaccine. The Oxford team now needs to find out whether the vaccine actually prevents people from developing Covid-19, or at least serious conditions. A phase three trial to test just that is under way, and more than 10,000 people have so far been vaccinated. There are also new arms to find out if the jab is safe for elderly people and those with comorbidities.So far, only healthy people have tested the vaccine – but it is arguably the vulnerable and old who will benefit most, meaning it has to be safe for those groups.Professor Andrew Pollard, the study\u0027s chief investigator, said: These are very encouraging results. What they show is a really important milestone on the path for development of the vaccine. We have, first of all, a vaccine which is very well tolerated by more than 1,000 volunteers, and secondly we are seeing good immune response – exactly the sort of immune responses we were hoping for.We are now moving rapidly forwards to try to evaluate whether the vaccine actually protects the population.The hunt for a Covid-19 vaccine actually began years before anyone knew the disease existed.After the Ebola outbreak in 2014, the World Health Organisation (WHO) realised that a global pandemic was on the cards and called on scientists around the world to think about therapies for a deadly Disease X.Dr Sarah Gilbert and the Jenner Institute at Oxford University were one of the teams to answer the call, working on vaccines for both Ebola and Mers (Middle East respiratory syndrome).However, in both cases, the vaccine production process took so long that the diseases were dying away before the treatments were through trials. So when Oxford scientists first heard about the virus cases emerging in China, they determined that, this time, the process must be quicker. The team realised their model for a Mers vaccine should also work for Covid-19, and so were able to get going immediately after Chinese scientists sequenced the virus in January. For the Mers vaccine, the virus was fused with a harmless chimp adenovirus (a common virus), to create a Trojan horse that would trigger an immune response. The process is far quicker than making traditional vaccines from a weakened or inactivated form of the virus, which usually takes around five years.The Mers vaccine has been successful in trials, and the virus shares a similar spike protein with Covid-19, which is critical to infection, meaning scientists were hopeful the process would also work for coronavirus.Oxford University already has its own vaccine manufacturing facility, so was able to quickly produce a drug ready for initial trials. By February 17, the first successful tests were carried out, allowing the team to move to primates by March.By mid-April, testing in monkeys showed the vaccine was not only safe but also offered some protection. Six monkeys had been vaccinated and exposed to a huge load of the virus 28 days later. None of the animals developed serious disease.At the end of April, the Oxford team had started their human trial on more than 1,100 people.Originally it was hoped that results would be available in May, but the trial was hindered when Covid-19 cases plummeted after the UK lockdown. In early June, the team began trials of the vaccine in Brazil and South Africa, where cases were rising quickly. The Government has moved quickly to ensure that the pharmaceutical industry is ready to produce millions of doses if a vaccine is proved safe and effective. On March 23, the day Boris Johnson announced the lockdown, the Government revealed a grant of £2.2 million to support the Oxford team, and a month later AstraZeneca came on board, agreeing to be responsible for global distribution and manufacturing. In May, Alok Sharma, the Business Secretary, said the UK would be the first country to get a vaccine should trials be successful (see video above), and announced an extra £84 million in funding to accelerate British research, promising that 100 million doses would be available. The Government also announced, on Monday, funding for a further 90 million doses from the BioNtechPfizer alliance and Valneva. The experts are hopeful that if enough people are recruited in the next few weeks, efficacy could be proven by November, and regulatory approval granted by December. It means that, within a year, British scientists may have found a solution to one of the world\u0027s biggest problems, heralding a merrier Christmas and a happier New Year.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"keeping schools open had no impact contagion swedish study suggests","story":"Shutting down primary schools may have been unnecessary as a Swedish study suggests that keeping them open had no impact on contagion.There was no measurable difference in the number of coronavirus cases among children in Sweden, where schools were left open, compared with neighboring Finland, where schools were shut, the research showed.A working paper, published by the Public Health Agency of Sweden and the Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare, compares the two countries’ approach to education during the pandemic.Sweden and Finland adopted very different strategies to tackle Covid-19, with the former choosing to avoid a full-blown lockdown and the latter imposing tough social distancing.But there was no difference in the overall incidence of the laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 cases in children aged between one and 19-years-old in the two countries, indicative data from the study shows.Finnish children returned to school in May after two months of remote learning and national infection rates have continued to decline since then. Contact tracing in primary schools in Finland found hardly any evidence of children infecting others, according to the research paper. A Swedish comparison of cases among daycare and primary school staff, found that there was no increased risk for teachers, compared with risk levels in other professions.Schools in England closed on March 20 for all but the children of key workers and the most vulnerable youngsters.Pupils in Reception, Year One and Year Six were allowed to return from June 1, but many will have been at home for six months by the time the new academic year begins in September.A report published earlier this year found that more than two million children have done virtually no schoolwork during the lockdown.Yesterday Aldi announced that it is launching cut-price home tutoring packages. The budget supermarket chain is hoping to appeal to parents who are worried that their children have fallen behind while schools have been closed.Hanna Nohynek, chief physician at the infectious diseases unit of Finland’s health authority and a co-author of the Nordic research, said that children get sick with Covid-19 much more rarely and less severely.” She said that children’s role in the transmission needs further study but added: It would appear that their role in transmitting Covid-19 isn’t at all as big as with other respiratory infections, such as influenza. Meanwhile, an epidemiological study from South Korea found that children between the ages of 10 and 19 are more likely to spread the coronavirus within a household than younger children or adults.The findings, released on the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention website, come as countries across the world grapple with the heated question of how and when to reopen schools amid fears of a resurgence in cases when students return to the classroom.The researchers traced and tested more than 59,000 people who had contact with 5,706 South Korean Covid-19 patients between January and March and found that, on average, 12 percent of household contacts tested positive for the virus. For people who lived with infected older children, 19 per cent tested positive for the virus within about 10 days after the initial case was detected, the highest rate of transmission among the age groups studied.Children under the age of 10 spread the virus at the lowest rate, though researchers warned that the figure may have been impacted by school closures and could change when they reopen.A Department for Education spokesperson said: “The decision to ask schools to close to the majority of children was taken to reduce the transmission of coronavirus, in line with scientific and medical advice at the time.“The circumstances have now changed. The prevalence of coronavirus has decreased, our NHS Test and Trace system is up and running and we are clear about the measures needed to keep children safe.“We also know that getting back to school is vital for children’s education and wellbeing, so we are now doing everything we can to ensure all pupils can return to the classroom from September.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"prepare november nightmare covid testing deficiencies arent","story":"Boris Johnson was quite right to say at the weekend that there should be no return to a national lockdown, even if Covid-19 makes a comeback in the UK. His comparison of lockdowns to a nuclear weapon has force – such a policy should only be a measure of last resort, and its use indicates the failure of all other policies. Nevertheless, more still needs to be done to be sure such a weapon does not have to be deployed before Christmas comes.The evidence is mounting of the massive human cost of the lockdown of recent months. Yesterday, this newspaper documented how 200,000 additional lives could be lost from other causes due to delayed healthcare, with more than two million fewer cancer tests taking place than in the previous year. The British Heart Foundation has found that almost half of adults with heart and circulatory diseases have found it harder to get medical treatment.The consequences for employment are devastating, although mitigated so far by the Government’s furlough scheme. With payrolls already falling by over 600,000 and unemployment widely expected to rise beyond two million, any new widespread lockdown would bring the most serious destruction of jobs since the 1930s.These tragic costs are just those aspects we can measure. The psychological toll, in mental health and severe disruption of a formative year in the lives of young people, cannot be quantified. Nor, for now, can the unknown effects of the Bank of England pumping out so much money into a contracting economy – welcome now, but quite possibly creating inflation or unsustainable debt in the future.Yet if a second national lockdown ought to be unthinkable, we also have to face the uncomfortable fact that the virus is not remotely defeated, here or abroad. Worldwide it is spreading more quickly than ever, and places that thought they had beaten it like Australia and Hong Kong are struggling with surging new outbreaks. Some US states have brought a new crisis upon themselves by returning to normal on the basis of wishful thinking rather than having an alternative plan for protecting their citizens. With science and common sense suggesting that autumn will bring both the climate and indoor habits that allow the virus to thrive, Britain and the rest of the northern hemisphere have to be braced for an extremely difficult time by November.Of course, the good news is that medical science will probably save the situation eventually. For me, the only cheering aspect of the crisis has been hearing from scientists at Oxford University, often very enthusiastic and positive about what the treatments or vaccine they are working on can achieve. When some of the cleverest people on the planet get so excited it’s hard to be depressed about the long term, and it is entirely possible that, over the course of 2021, some combination of vaccines, anti-viral and anti-inflammatory drugs will allow humanity to declare victory over this virus.Such a scientific triumph is, however, unlikely to save us all from a tense and difficult autumn, in which the dangers of a resurgence will continue to prevent people from having the confidence to go out and spend their money. Governments, including in Britain, face their most difficult period yet in the coming months. There will be a wave of job losses, with desperate calls to add further to the hundreds of billions of pounds already spent. On the other hand, there will be spikes in virus transmission that will bring alarm and public fear of returning to normal. In some countries there will be disorder and political upheaval in the US the most bitter and isive of elections. It will be like walking a tightrope in the middle of a tornado, with the wind blowing in every direction at once.Ministers are clearly very conscious of this approaching nightmare – this is why they are encouraging people to eat out and take holidays in Britain, subsidising work for young people, and trying to make the track-and-trace system work. And yet there is still a gap, which is the mobilisation of all necessary resources to make possible the regular, mass testing of the majority of the population. I have made the case for it before in these pages, and make no apology for returning to it. Jeremy Hunt and Tony Blair have made the same argument: mass testing, using tests still being developed but which could give results at the point of use, might be the only way to spot new outbreaks quickly enough and give people the confidence to go back to the office, the airport and big indoor events.Anything less ambitious than this will always be at risk of falling short. Only 22 per cent of people who test positive for Covid-19 report having symptoms on the day of their test, which shows that if we rely on people feeling ill before having a test, asymptomatic people will be likely to spread it. To be fair, the Government is making hopeful noises about mass testing. It intends to be carrying out millions of tests a day by October and is supporting a major trial in Southampton of a new saliva test, to be carried out weekly and at home.When I wrote about this last month, however, I received many messages from British companies saying that their own inventions of new, simple tests were not being taken up. One small firm, which is developing a one-minute test, said it “had found it very difficult in the UK to get support for our technology, although we have strong interest in the US”. Another, developing the technology to give a quick result from a test costing a few pounds each time, said it had “been highly frustrated trying to find a way forward….if we had had the Government’s support back in March we could now be giving results within 10 minutes throughout the entire country”.I am not a scientist and I do not know whether these or other firms have the answer. But I do know that there are a great many British bio-medical firms out there who have not felt fully mobilised in this effort. It is time to have a senior minister solely responsible for testing with the power and mandate to utilise the ingenuity and skill of many small firms, and to make mass testing a priority.

It currently stands at around 5.5-times greater.The disparity between England and Scotland\u0027s infection rates was highlighted in a recent report by the Independent Sage group, which attributed it to the differing containment strategies of each nation.In Scotland we\u0027ve seen such a clear strategy, clearly articulated, elimination is the aim and all objectives are geared towards driving things as low as possible, Professor Stephen Reicher told a briefing last week.In England, the UK government hasn\u0027t been clear about the strategy, we don\u0027t see any particular strategy, some people talk about herd immunity by default, but nothing has been articulated at all.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

If we want to vaccinate lots of people (we) will need several vaccines.”Scientists and medical researchers across the UK have meanwhile welcomed the “very encouraging” results from Oxford University and AstraZeneca.The speed at which the trial has been conducted has also been praised, with the preliminary results suggesting the vaccine is safe and causes few side effects.Professor Fiona Watt, executive chairwoman of the Medical Research Council, which helped to fund the trial, said: “It is truly remarkable how fast this vaccine has progressed, with our support, through early clinical trials, and it is very encouraging that it shows no safety concerns and evokes strong immune responses.“There is a lot that we don’t yet know about immunity to the virus that causes Covid-19.“However, it seems that both antibody and T cell immunity are important, and this vaccine triggers both responses.“The much anticipated next milestone will be the results of the larger trials that are happening now to find out if the vaccine will protect people from the virus.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The company has also left the door open to profiteer from this publicly-funded vaccine after the pandemic, when the need for vaccination may still exist.“This vaccine has been paid for by the public purse and if it ultimately proves to be safe and effective, it should be a global public good and openly licensed.”AstraZeneca’s vaccine is among the leading candidates currently being developed, with about a dozen others in the early stages of human testing or poised to start, mostly in China, the US and Europe.The American biotech firm Moderna, based in Massachusetts, was the first to announce that its vaccine candidate had produced an immune response within people.The company said in May that the levels of antibodies developed by participants in its phase one trial mirrored those seen in patients who have recovered from the virus.BioNtech and Pfizer have also delivered positive results from early trials into their MRNA-based vaccine.An ideal vaccine against Sars-CoV-2 should be effective after one or two vaccinations and work in target populations including older adults and those with other health conditions, researchers say.They add that it should confer protection for a minimum of six months, and reduce onward transmission of the virus to contacts.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The pandemic did for us and there was nothing more to it than that.”In his editor’s letter, Mr Kessler wrote that the problems the magazine had faced in a declining print media market were exacerbated by the Covid-19 outbreak.“We’ve been a lean operation for all of my tenure, employing a variety of ways to help keep our head above water in an extremely challenging print market,” he wrote. “Covid-19 wiped all that out.”Kanye West’s campaign rally condemned by stars including 50 CentEmma Donoghue: ‘I’ve been very out from the start’How films like Saint Frances are finally getting abortion rightHe added: “I must apologise profusely for my failure to keep Q afloat.”Q’s owners Bauer Media said in June that the magazine was one of the most high-profile titles to face closure amid uncertainty in the print market. It said that it had reviewed its titles, which include Empire and Grazia, and apprehensively considered selling or closing a number of them.Q, which was founded in 1986, has long been a newsagent mainstay and one of the most famous print titles devoted to music in the UK.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

SevenIt wasn\u0027t until the arrival of Austin Powers sequel The Spy Who Shagged Me that Mike Myers\u0027s comic creations were fully wedged into the hearts of film lovers.

TwoCapping off not only your own franchise but a decade-long series consisting of 22 films is no mean feat – and yet Avengers: Endgame balanced all the playing pieces to do so with gargantuan success. How many years between sequel and original? Seven437 Back to the Future Part II (1989)The first sequel to Robert Zemeckis\u0027s Back to the Future is an amusing adventure that sees Marty McFly (Michael J Fox) travel... well, back to the future, to prevent his own son from sabotaging the family legacy. How many years between sequel and original? FourIt was the addition of both Michelle Pfeiffer and Danny DeVito – as Catwoman and the Penguin, respectively – that made Tim Burton\u0027s sequel Batman Returns an even more memorable watch than the original. How many years between sequel and original? ThreeEach instalment of Richard Linklater\u0027s Before trilogy is as good as the last. But, if there is a peak, it surely arrives with number two – Before Sunset – which reunites would-be lovers Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and Celine (Julie Delpy) nine years after they first met in Before Sunrise (1995). How many years between sequel and original? NineThere\u0027s a blistering chase sequence midway through The Bourne Ultimatum involving Matt Damon\u0027s amnesiac spy and journalist Simon Ross (Paddy Considine). It\u0027s adeptly directed by Paul Greengrass – here at the top of his game – and is all the proof you need that the original trilogy improved with each new film. How many years between sequel and original? Five837 Bride of Frankenstein (1935)Depicting Mary Shelley\u0027s classic creature as a pleasant guy just looking for a companion, Bride of Frankenstein is one of the greatest monster movies, let alone sequels, in cinema history. How many years between sequel and original? FourBatman Begins may have been the perfect origin story for the caped crusader, but nothing could have prepared film fans for the classic its sequel would become. Christopher Nolan intelligently crafted The Dark Knight into one of the greatest follow-ups ever made, with several standout action sequences and an untouchable performance from Heath Ledger as the Joker. One for the ages. How many years between sequel and original? Three1037 Dawn of the Dead (1978)George A Romero ditched the entire cast of Night of the Living Dead for its first sequel, Dawn of the Dead, which showed the effects of the zombie apocalypse on a much larger scale than depicted in the black-and-white original. One of the most entertaining horror films ever made.  How many years between sequel and original? 10The glory you feel watching Hellboy II: The Golden Army comes from the knowledge that you\u0027re watching a studio allow Guillermo del Toro to do whatever the hell he wants. A scintillating oddity of a follow-up that surpasses the 2004 original within minutes. How many years between sequel and original? FourNot so much an improvement on the first as one that rips up its rule book completely: Sam Raimi took the character of Ash (Bruce Campbell), who viewers first met in influential 1981 horror The Evil Dead,\u0026nbspand placed him in the heart of what is essentially a slapstick comedy. How many years between sequel and original? SixAfter the lacklustre fourth instalment, Fast \u0026amp Furious 5 was the reinvention the series desperately needed. Bringing in Dwayne Johnson as the bad guy was a genius stroke and the final set-piece – a car dragging a bank vault through the streets of Rio – remains as entertaining as anything the long-running series has ever done. How many years between sequel and original? 10The Godfather Part II set the highest benchmark for what sequels should be, but so rarely are – a crucial chapter in a saga. The film won Robert De Niro an Oscar for his efforts, playing the same role Marlon Brando won an Oscar for two years before. This, alongside another film on this list, is one of two sequels to ever win Best Picture (keep scrolling to find out the other one). How many years between sequel and original? Two1537 The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966)The fact that Sergio Leone had barely any money to make The Good, the Bad and the Ugly – the third film in his Man With no Name trilogy – fortuitously led to the casting of the relatively unknown Clint Eastwood. Leone\u0027s film, beautifully soundtracked by Ennio Morricone, is a masterwork that proves less is more: its most classic dialogue-free scenes derived from the fact that Leone had no time to shoot dialogue. How many years between sequel and original? Two1637 Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (2004)Gone was the warm glow of Hogwarts in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. Alfonso Cuarón\u0027s adaptation of the JK Rowling novel proved the franchise could win widespread acclaim, as well as ticket receipts, if put in the hands of interesting directors. How many years between sequel and original? Three1737 How to Train Your Dragon 2 (2014)Could How to Train Your Dragon endure as one of the most beloved yet underrated franchises of all time? Quite possibly – and its first sequel, which features breathless flight sequences and animation to marvel at, is solid evidence of this. How many years between sequel and original? FourDespite essentially rehashing the plot of the first film, The Hunger Games: Catching Fire is a bolder, more exciting and, yes, deadlier outing for Jennifer Lawrence\u0027s heroine Katniss Everdeen. How many years between sequel and original? One1937 Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989)If Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade isn\u0027t better than series opener Raiders of the Lost Ark, it\u0027s certainly as good. This is thanks to the addition of Sean Connery\u0027s Henry Jones Sr – the father of Harrison Ford\u0027s whip-cracking archaeologist. How many years between sequel and original? EightPerhaps it was down to relief that Iron Man 3 was so revered by critics (lest we forget Iron Man 2 is one of Marvel\u0027s biggest duds). But, Robert Downey Jr\u0027s third solo outing as Tony Starl boasts enough laughs and thrills, not to mention a doozy of a twist, that earns its placement on this list. How many years between sequel and original? FiveLethal Weapon 2 takes what made the original so fun – the wit and twist-filled action – and amps it up as far as it can possibly go. That it throws in Joe Pesci for good measure just makes the results even more sizzling. How many years between sequel and original? TwoLogan rectified the mistakes of Wolverine\u0027s earlier standalone films thanks to James Mangold\u0027s decision to place the character in a far grittier film than he was used to (it was rated 15 in the UK). The result remains a perfect send-off to one of X-Men\u0027s greatest characters, who first played the role in 2000.How many years between sequel and original? 17Gareth Evans\u0027s sequel to The Raid is more of the glorious same, only – somehow – more ambitious. Two hours and 30 minutes of breathlessly-paced fight sequences that\u0027s unlike anything caught on film before. How many years between sequel and original? Three2437 The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (2003)The second sequel to ever win Best Picture is all about the payoff. While each film in Peter Jackson\u0027s Lord of the Rings trilogy delivers in what it needs to, this final chapter balances all the plates to dish out an epic conclusion that surely would have been everything JRR Tolkien wanted from an adaptation of his classic novels. How many years between sequel and original? TwoNobody could have predicted quite how breathlessly entertaining Mad Max: Fury Road would be. George Miller\u0027s dystopian chase film refuses to relent from the very first second and is just as entertaining with every watch – and far superior to the Mel Gibson original, which was released in 1979. How many years between sequel and original? 36There has never been a bad Mission: Impossible film. However, since Christopher McQuarrie stepped into the fold as director, the series has taken just as many audacious leaps as its lead star, the stunt-loving Tom Cruise. Fallout is a multi-layered, twisty action film that will undoubtedly go down as a franchise classic. How many years between sequel and original? 22All it took was the spirit of Christmas for the Griswolds to get the film they deserved. Chevy Chase heads up this one liner-filled festive treat that\u0027s probably the only Vacation film worth your time. How many years between sequel and original? FourOne critic described Paddington 2 as the Godfather Part II of Peruvian Bear movies and they were not wrong. The sequel somehow manages to convey more charm than the original – which in itself is extremely charming – and has the benefit of starring Hugh Grant as a villainous actor named Phoenix Buchanan. A delight. How many years between sequel and original? ThreeAll eyes were on Shrek 2 thanks to the unprecedented success of the fantastic original, which was released in 2001. What people didn\u0027t expect, though, was that the follow-up would be just as hilarious and even more enchanting. How many years between sequel and original? ThreeSam Raimi managed to outdo himself with Spider-Man 2 (the first one remains a superhero standout) with help from Alfred Molina\u0027s Doctor Octopus and some nightmarish scenes in which the Evil Dead filmmaker delves into his bursting bag of horror movie tricks. How many years between sequel and original? Two3137 Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan (1982)By placing the emphasis on character as opposed to action, Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan righted the wrongs of the classic TV show\u0027s first big screen adventure, a dud that was released in 1979. The result is a staggeringly improved follow-up. How many years between sequel and original? thREEThe Empire Strikes Back would make this list for its twist alone, which ranks as one of the greatest in cinema history, but the film also represents so much more.

Three3337 War for the Planet of the Apes (2017)With War for the Planet of the Apes, Fox\u0027s closing chapter of the rebooted trilogy, Matt Reeves delivered a near-faultless arthouse film parading as a mo-cap monkey-filled blockbuster. How many years between sequel and original?  SixIt would have been easy to chalk up 10 Cloverfield Lane\u0027s acclaim to the fact it was a secret up until a month before it was released. The fact remains, though, that this spiritual successor to 2008 found-footage thriller Cloverfield is a gruellingly tense chamber piece that\u0027s even more nail-biting than the first. How many years between sequel and original?

How many years between sequel and original? SevenWhen Taika Waititi took the keys to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, he walked away with one of its greatest films: Thor: Ragnarok.

Take a walk at Virginia WaterSharing the full story, not just the headlinesThis spectacular destination is only part of a vast, aristocratic pleasure ground of woodlands, parks and meadows that would take weeks to fully explore on foot.The 4.5-mile circuit of the lake takes you past an eclectic mix of attractions, including an ornamental cascade waterfall, Roman ruins brought from Libya and an authentic 100ft-high totem pole gifted by British Columbia.With so much space, there is plenty of room for a secluded picnic too.See windsorgreatpark for more information.2. Cycle the New ForestWhether you discovered a love of cycling thanks to the lockdown or have been a convert for many years, the traffic-free and waymarked trails of the New Forest make it an enticing spot for all levels of rider.If you want to leave your wheels at home, there are plenty of local bike-hire options, which can also provide advice on the best routes for your party – from easy family jaunts to long-distance challenges.See thenewforest for information on cycling routes.3. Hike through the Chilterns Stay safe and have fun with this important travel guidance:Only travel in a car with members of your household andor support bubbleAlways wear a face covering or mask on public transportWash your hands before putting on your face covering and after you’ve taken it offWash your face covering dailyWhere possible, leave the car behind and reach your destination by walking or cyclingChef Tom Kerridge on reopening his Michelin-starred pub safelyAn area of outstanding natural beauty with rolling hills (such as Coombe Hill, above, the highest vantage point in the area), the sparkling chalk streams and ancient woodlands right on London’s doorstep sounds too good to be true, but the Chilterns offer precisely that.With over 300 square miles of scenery and attractions to absorb the crowds, a quiet route is also a walker\u0027s goal. The Chilterns Conservation Board and Chiltern Society have developed a series of 23 walks across the Chilterns which are social-distance-friendly, taking in hill climbs and gentle ambles.Visit chilternsaonb.org for more details about their social-distance-friendly walks.4. Kitesurf at Camber SandsCamber Sands has over two miles of beach to absorb the post-lockdown crowds. The eastern end, marked with black and white flags, is reserved for activities such as kitesurfing, and there is plenty of space for novices to learn how to handle a power kite on land or water.An introduction from The Kitesurf Centre covers the fundamentals and can be booked as one-to-one coaching, as a single group from the same household, or in groups of up to three people from separate households.The nearest train station is in Rye, four miles away. A six-hour introduction to kitesurfing course starts at £99, minimum age 12. See thekitesurfcentre for details.With the pools closed and the seaside crowded, many swimmers are looking elsewhere to take a dip. Far from the chlorinated confines of the local swimming bath, a fresh water reservoir, lake or river can be an exhilarating alternative, but there are many safety issues to consider before getting wet in the wild, so make sure you read up on the hazards first.​See outdoorswimmingsociety for advice and a directory of open-water swimming lakes to explore.6. Learn to jet skiThe beaches could be busy, but you can leave the crowds in your wake after completing a Royal Yachting Association (RYA) personal watercraft course that, in just one day, provides you with all you need to safely helm a jet ski inland or on the coast.There are plenty of places in the UK that can teach you – such as Jetski Safaris in Poole – and no experience is necessary.Visit jetskiandpowerboattraining for more information. Single-person RYA proficiency course for jet skis from £180.7. Ride on an Olympic bike trackThe Hadleigh mountain bike track hosted the London 2012 Olympics and has evolved since then into one of the premier cross-country destinations in the UK.Hadleigh Country Park also provides one of the largest green spaces in Essex, with plenty of opportunities to explore the coast from Southend-on-Sea to Benfleet. The nearby castle ruins offer panoramic views of the River Thames and Kent on the opposite shore.Leigh-on-Sea or Benfleet stations are the closest to the country park. It’s a 10 to 20-minute ride from there to the track. See explore-essex for details.Meet the kayaking instructor...Having been cooped up during lockdown, it’s safe to say that large numbers are wanting to experience the great outdoors like never before now businesses are reopening.“We\u0027ve been ridiculously busy,” says Adrian Fall, below, owner of Brighton-based The Kayak Coach. “People have been so excited about being on the water.”Fall\u0027s passion is teaching people how to kayak, canoe and paddleboard – then leading them on trips up Sussex\u0027s beautiful estuaries and rivers.He set up The Kayak Coach almost 12 years ago and has just taken on two extra staff to add to the three he already employs teaching and guiding on the water: “I love being outside and now\u0027s the time to meet people again and introduce them to the sport I love,” he says.Reopening the business required important changes, as per Government guidelines. Group sizes have been reduced from eight to five to comply with social distancing – “It\u0027s actually a nicer experience for everybody,” Fall adds – and all equipment (boat, buoyancy aid, helmet) is cleaned and sterilised after each use.A one-way system has also been added to its training centre at Ashurst. “We\u0027ve made changes to what we do. But we\u0027re almost back to normal in terms of what we can offer,” Fall explains. Additionally, barrels of water are provided for sailors to wash their hands before and after each session. Fall admits that the past three months of enforced closure have been tough for the business and lovers of the outdoor life, but that people are “having to look locally because they\u0027re not going to France or America”. He adds: “They didn\u0027t know we were here, but they\u0027re excited about accessing the river on our doorstep.”See thekayakcoach for more detailsTo help plan your trip visit Know Before You Go Please keep in mind that England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland currently have different guidelines, advice and timelines for reopening tourism. So do please make sure you check the respective official sources for information before you travel.Want to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

All money raised from the auction will go to The Independent’s appeal partner, The Felix Project, London’s largest food surplus distribution charity. Our campaign has so far raised £7.5m towards our £10m goal which includes a pledge to open London’s largest community kitchen to tackle food poverty.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHighlights from the Sotheby’s Help the Hungry auction include a drawing from Tracey Emin, a series of three etchings by Anish Kapoor, Mark Wallinger’s “Ghost”, and Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s “We Have Only Got Each Other” placard.British-Nigerian artist Yinka Shonibare also joins the catalogue with his “Unstructured Icons - Aristocrat I” alongside a pair of polished steel reliefs by Michael Craig-Martin and a floral plate by Chinese artist Ai Weiwei.   How to support our campaignSotheby’s senior director Oliver Barker said: “We are grateful to the artists who have generously contributed their works and we’re looking forward to channelling part of the excitement of our major sales in London this month into a cause which will provide food and comfort to the capital’s most vulnerable.”  Evgeny Lebedev, proprietor of The Independent, said: “We are delighted to be raising money with Sotheby’s and some of the world’s leading contemporary artists to help build London’s biggest community kitchen that will continue to feed those in need for years to come.”The Felix Project distributes nutritious food that would otherwise go to waste to 350 frontline charities, schools and holiday programmes in London.Founder Justin Byam Shaw said: “Although our food is surplus and donated to us and we have over 1,500 volunteers, our costs are still spiralling. “The coming unemployment crisis means we are in this for the long term. This new community kitchen will provide a high-quality meal for homeless Londoners, cooked by great chefs using surplus food.” Turner Prize-winning artist Mark Wallinger said: “I am delighted to contribute to help raise funds for The Felix Project, a fantastic charity that does such vital work in providing food for vulnerable people throughout London, work that is ever more necessary in our current crisis.”Sotheby’s Help The Hungry Auction will go live on 20 July and will run until 30 July.Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Leicester may have been the first, but it was never going to be the last. After a recent spike in Covid-19 infections, Blackburn with Darwen has become the second local authority to have taken preventative action and tighten certain restrictions as the country continues to grapple with the coronavirus pandemic. The Lancashire council has not gone as far as its East Midlands counterpart in imposing a lockdown – residents have instead been told to limit the number of people they accept into their homes, and to wear face coverings in all enclosed public spaces – but the leaders and people of this northwestern region know what is waiting around the corner.“We do not want to end up like Leicester,” councillor Paul Marrow tells The Independent. “It’s all about being proactive, which is the approach we’ve taken.” Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesFor now, the resurgence of the virus in these parts appears small by comparison. Whereas Leicester recorded roughly 155 cases per 100,000 people prior to its lockdown, Blackburn with Darwen has, to date, reported a peak rate of 47 infections per 100,000. But all fires start from a single spark – and authorities here are doing what they can to put out the growing flames.Focus has turned to the danger of household transmission across Blackburn and its neighbouring towns. Unlike in Leicester – where officials have struggled to pinpoint the source of the city’s outbreak – local health authorities for Blackburn with Darwen have managed to develop a clear picture of the way in which the disease has spread within the region.“It seems to be household clusters where a person who has been infected may not know it, they may be asymptotic they return home and then pass it on to four or five family members,” Denise Park, chief executive of the local council, said.“We do have a higher than average number of large households – five or more people – so we’ve been looking at that. The most recent data testing shows that the majority of cases are from our south Asian heritage communities.”What are the UK lockdown rules now?How to ease yourself back into socialising once lockdown liftsThe new lost generationWhich countries are seeing a second wave of coronavirus?How to wear a face mask safelyAround a third of Blackburn with Darwen’s 148,000 population are from ethnic backgrounds, with a large Pakistani and Indian heritage population, and according to Professor Dominic Harrison, the council’s director of public health, 97 of the 114 cases recorded across the past two weeks derive from these minority groups. To help protect these communities, and prevent the situation from escalating across the region, authorities have tailored their measures accordingly, telling people they can now only accept two visitors into their homes beyond their immediate families.“With it being household transmission, we didn’t think a Leicester-styled lockdown was the right answer,” explains Ms Park. “It’s about being targeted with the action we take.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailThe response of Prof Harrison and his team has so far been met with positivity and optimism, on account of its specified and proactive nature. “Dominic Harrison has been absolutely on the ball with Covid-19 and he’s doing his job very well, keeping a good eye on the local community,” Gabriel Scally, a member of the Independent Sage board and professor of public health at the University of Bristol, said.“I think the council is handling it extremely well. This is the sort of approach that will work well nationally, because it’s generated by the local community, their representatives and the director of public health – trusted figures that the people can be sure they’re acting in the interest of the towns and the population.”It’s rare praise in these troubling and ided times, when the overwhelming narrative of the Covid-19 pandemic has been one of chaos and confusion. And there’s certainly hope to believe that the strategy adopted by Blackburn with Darwen proves effective.Leaning on the side of caution, authorities have announced that the current measures – which also recommend against hugs and handshakes – will be in place for four weeks before the council considers easing them. In the meantime the region’s caseload is expected to rise due to increased testing, says Ms Park, but after that it’s hoped the numbers will drop again.The story of Leicester’s lockdown – and the lessons to be learntAnd thankfully, access to data has not proved an issue, as was the case with Leicester. Ms Park said that the information provided by the local government to Prof Harrison has contained details on ethnicity, postcodes and ages, ensuring authorities have the means to develop a more comprehensive understanding of what’s going on in and around Blackburn.Additional testing units have been deployed in the local community, allowing more people who are carrying the disease but not displaying symptoms to get easily tested. “Let’s not wait till people have got symptoms,” says Ms Park. “Let’s do asymptomatic testing, do some case finding and then say to people they need to isolate.”Equally, the council has said that footways in the centre of Blackburn will be widened, to further promote social distancing, while some parking bays will be removed to help separate people queueing for takeaways and pubs. Council workers have meanwhile been visiting local religious and community centres to spread the message, and providing advice to smaller shops as to how they can protect their customers.Still, for all the encouraging work of the council, and the sense of “stoicism” that it has drawn from the local population, as Mr Marrow put its, the situation in Blackburn and Darwen has not passed by without the dangerous, racist rhetoric which marked many conversations concerning Leicester and its outbreak.“The danger is people see the data and say it’s one section of society to blame, and that is absolutely not what we’re saying,” councillor Saima Afzal said. “There are are a cocktail of factors at play here.“We are aware there are problems in the south Asian wards but I want to make it clear that they are not less or more likely to follow the rules. That’s not what my experience shows. From what I’ve seen and images I’ve been sent, there are groups gathering from a whole range of backgrounds.” She warned against analysing the statistics inaccurately as “they can be twisted any way you want to portray them”.Against this backdrop of tension, Blackburn with Darwen holds its breath as it takes another step into the unknown. Lessons have clearly been learnt from the Leicester episode, with the Lancashire council well poised to fight the virus, but there’s still a long way to go for the region.Blackburn with Darwen\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.For a town already caught in a slow and painful state of decline, the coronavirus pandemic has brought Blackburn to its knees. Decades of de-industrialisation and growing economic deprivation have left the area struggling to find its purpose – while larger, more prosperous neighbours have reinvented themselves – but the economic damage wrought by Covid-19 could prove to be the final straw.“We’ve been here for 32 long years,” said Maria Elder, the owner of Sudell Sandwiches, a small cafe in the town centre. “Lots of loyal customers over the years. We’d serve students from the college too. We even had a contract with the police to feed the officers when the football was on. That’s all gone, for now at least. We’re barely coping.”The worry for Ms Elder and other independent businesses is what a second lockdown would mean for the town. After a recent surge in cases, Blackburn finds itself walking a dangerous line. The region’s seven-day rate currently stands at 47 infections per 100,000 people and is expected to rise in the coming days.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesAuthorities have already tightened restrictions this week, urging residents to limit the number of visitors to their homes and to wear face coverings in enclosed public settings, but the plunge back into full lockdown would likely drive many companies to the point of no return.“I think it’d shut us down,” said Ms Elder. “People are extremely scared and worried, because there’s a lot of places that only opened on Monday – beauticians, hairdressers. And it’s still very quiet.What are the UK lockdown rules now?How to ease yourself back into socialising once lockdown liftsThe new lost generationWhich countries are seeing a second wave of coronavirus?How to wear a face mask safely“We’ve been here a long time, we’re an established business, but it has seriously impacted us, it really has. I’ve had to lay off one girl as a result.”Asad Jalil, who has run a dry cleaning shop in the town centre since 1989, said a second lockdown would push his business “over the edge”.“If there’s another lockdown for two or three weeks, it’s going to make it worse. People are already scared. There’s not enough money for going out, buying new stuff, people are making do with what they’ve got. “I can’t see my business returning. I doubt I’ll be here next year. Many of my usual customers are at home, working in their pyjamas. They don’t need to go into the office anymore. They don’t need to get their suits cleaned. I only came back yesterday but I don’t think it’s going to pick up again.” No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailSome businesses never made it to the end of lockdown, laid low by the sudden arrest in economic activity across the country. Although trade has been good for Anna Green and Emily Yates since they reopened their salon earlier this month, they are one of the few to have come through this period of turbulence.“In this building alone, there’s one room empty next door and upstairs there’s six empty,” Ms Green said. “They’ve had to fold. It’s not the most affluent of areas. A lot of people have packed up and gone.”The pandemic has only added to Blackburn’s problems. The local council has seen its spending power decline by nearly one-third since 2010, losing out on tens of millions of pounds, while the region has one of the lowest life-expectancy rates in the country.Some buildings in the town centre have stood empty for 10 years or more. Unwilling to take a risk on Blackburn and its struggling economy, business has been turning elsewhere in the northwest.“Blackburn was a booming town,” said Mr Jalil, the dry cleaner owner. “People used to flock here from all around, but now they don’t even bother. They either go into Bolton or Preston. There’s no footfall in Blackburn anymore.”Deprivation is also a serious and growing issue. Last year, the charity End Child Poverty revealed that half of all children in Blackburn lived in poverty, with this rate up to two-thirds in the ward of Bastwell.Nonetheless, stoicism runs deep in these parts. Residents are aware that everyone has a role to play in getting through the pandemic.Blackburn holds its breath after recent spike in Covid-19 cases“Everyone is putting on face masks, all our customers are taking it on board,” said Marcus Gannon, director of Hobkirk Sewing Machines, which can trace its history in the town back to 1903. “No one has got anything against it. They all appreciate it. And in a way, it gives customers who want to come in here the confidence to do so. People are just getting on with it.”Ms Elder, the cafe owner, echoed these sentiments, saying that “the majority of people are now wearing masks” and abiding by the rules – at least in public. “Everyone is taking it seriously,” she said. “I think the new restrictions are a good thing but we’ll have to see how it goes.”The council has also been working hard with small businesses to ensure they can operate under the current system. “I know some of our officers have been out and helped put the new guidance in place,” said Saima Afzal, a councillor. “Everyone has been really proactive. I think we’ve got a really resilient community in Blackburn so they are carrying on.”“My company has been here for 100 odd years,” said Mr Gannon. “I want it to be here another 100 years.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.The coronavirus pandemic has taken a toll on the health of the nation’s relationships, according to research which suggests bonds between couples, friends and colleagues have all been strained by the UK’s lockdown.One-fifth of people feel friendships with others outside of their household suffered in the last four months as social distancing kept people apart, UCL’s Covid-19 social study found.But the lockdown seems also to have impacted on those who live together, with 20 per cent of respondents saying friendships with their housemates were now worse. Couples fared little better, with 18 per cent reporting their relationship with their partner had suffered since March.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesRelations between co-workers deteriorated the most as many UK workplaces adjusted to remote working and video conference calls. One-quarter of people surveyed for the non-peer reviewed observational study said they were getting on worse with colleagues since the start of lockdown.“Our study shows that lockdown measures are having a significant toll on people’s relationships, both with people locked down together and those who have been unable to see each other over the lockdown period, said Dr Daisy Fancourt, a professor of psychobiology and epidemiology at UCL.What are the UK lockdown rules now?How to ease yourself back into socialising once lockdown liftsThe new lost generationWhich countries are seeing a second wave of coronavirus?How to wear a face mask safelyShe added: “This is especially true of people with diagnosed mental health issues and younger adults, as well as those with lower household incomes, key workers, those living along and those living with children, all of whom may be facing greater financial or mental pressures which have been exacerbated during the lockdown period.”Worsening relationships were most common among younger adults. Of the 12 per cent of people who reported the breakdown of a relationship, most were aged under 30 and the fewest were over 60.However, researchers found relationships between neighbours had improved since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, particularly among people aged between 30 and 59.  Cheryl Lloyd, head of education at the Nuffield Foundation, which is funding the ongoing study, said the finding “suggests a resurgence in community spirit” during the pandemic.But she added it was “cause for concern that the survey also show that people who are more vulnerable - those on lower household incomes and those with diagnosed mental health issues - are more likely to report worsening friendships and relationships during lockdown”.Launched the week before the UK entered lockdown on 23 March, the UCL study is the largest into the UK public’s attitudes, health and wellbeing during the coronavirus pandemic.Researchers found complete compliance with lockdown measures continued to fall over the past fortnight, particularly among young adults. But 90 per cent of all adults and 80 per cent of under-30s said they were still complying with most rules.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Several areas in England are experiencing a surge in new coronavirus cases, with places in the North West appearing most at risk to a second wave of infections similar to the one seen in Leicester.The latest figures from Public Health England reveal Bradford and neighbouring Kirklees in West Yorkshire have seen high numbers of daily confirmed cases in recent days.Higher infection rates in Leicester prompted the government to introduce a local lockdown just weeks after nationwide containment measures first began to ease.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesFollowing Leicester’s lockdown last week, epidemiologist Professor Neil Ferguson warned that more localised lockdowns in the UK are “inevitable”.The former government adviser said that an estimated 8 per cent of the UK population has so far been infected, and that the pandemic is still in its “early stages”.Leicester remains the worst affected area in England in terms of cumulative case rate, with more than 1,000 people per 100,000 residents having been infected by Covid-19.Other areas to have experienced similarly high case rates include Ashford in Kent and Barrow-in-Furness in Cumbria, however both places have seen new cases fall substantially since May.The rate of new coronavirus infections in Ashford began to flatten off in early June, according to data collected by PHE. By contrast, daily cases in Leicester appeared to accelerate at around the same time.A similar surge occurred in Kirklees, despite the curve initially appearing to flatten one month ago. The number of new daily cases consistently fell below 20 in the first week of June, before spiking to more than 40 on 11 June.In Bradford, the number of new cases fell significantly in late May, before rising again throughout June. Unlike Kirklees, however, the rate of new infections appears to be once again slowing.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

At a time when Londoners from all walks of life are struggling due to the impact of coronavirus, the importance of love and care from others has been magnified tenfold.The phrase comes from a work made by the artist Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith – one of several fantastic lots in an auction kicking off today at sothebys to support The Independent’s Help the Hungry appeal.Over the past four months we have raised more than £7.5m for food redistribution charity The Felix Project – a cause for which we have pledged to raise £10m as well as to open central London’s largest community kitchen.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe auction is an opportunity to get your hands on works by some amazing artists – more likely to be seen on the walls of a museum than your living room. They can also be viewed at Sotheby’s, 34-35 New Bond Street.Ceramic has been a recurring motif for Ai Weiwei (a 1995 series of photographs showed him dropping a Han dynasty urn) and he has often used porcelain, for centuries a secret formula known only to Chinese makers. Flowers, too, are significant – when his passport was taken Ai put a bunch of fresh flowers in a bike basket outside his studio every day until he was able to travel freely. This small plate holds a great deal of meaning.Yinka Shonibare deconstructions of icons of western power couldn’t be more current. This elegant woodcut print, using vivid Batik textiles, transposes animal masks from Mali onto the faces of English aristocratic figures enriched off the back of colonisation and slavery. The patterns of textiles overlay the repeating patterns of power and show how history’s long fingers reach into our present.Unfailingly optimistic, Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s work is always a call to care. He’s known for his colourful and impassioned but peaceful slogans (“Make Art Not War” seems like a good standard to live by) and his advocacy of art as a tool for education and understanding. We Have Only Got Each Other quotes his late mother, the artist Deirdre Borlase, spoken in response to the isions revealed during the Brexit campaign — but its universal meaning is clear.I’m a sucker for a good drawing – I’ve always felt that even at 500-odd years distance, it’s the form that brings you closest to an artist the sweep of a human hand that has just left the page. After many years of deeply mining her own emotions and experiences in her work, Emin is an artist at the height of her powers. Her raw, almost agonisingly expressive draughtsmanship gets me every time and this little sketch nails the feeling of having a really good cry.These three etchings – a supremely generous donation from Anish Kapoor, more usually known for the interactive theatricality of his large-scale sculptures – exude a quiet drama. Their simplicity belies their seductiveness velvety and intense, they draw you in, never quite revealing their secrets.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Wallinger was inspired by X-rays of Old Masters, which he thinks of as akin to spirit photography: “The revelation of the invisible, supernatural life of a painting.”A reminder of the pre-lockdown era, when we were able to wander the Hayward Gallery and bathe in the sea of pulsating colour that was Riley’s superb exhibition. This screenprint is from a series that vibrates right off the paper (Tate owns an edition of Elongated Triangles 5, so you’ll be in good company if you get your hands on this one).The essence of things is what Michael Craig-Martin seeks in his work, and colour is part of seducing the viewer to really look at the objects that make up our world. These sculptural reliefs in polished steel come from a series that pays homage to designers and architects whose vision has shaped what we think of as “modern”.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.England’s chief nursing officer has confirmed she was “dropped” from a No 10 coronavirus press briefing in June after warning Dominic Cummings should follow the lockdown rules that apply “to us all”.It comes after The Independent revealed last month Ruth May had been due to appear alongside Matt Hancock, the health secretary, but was ditched after failing to offer support to Boris Johnson’s senior Downing Street adviser.In her first public comments on the incident, the chief nursing officer confirmed the report and said it was “regular occurrence” that expert colleagues advising the government had also been stood down from daily briefings during the pandemic.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesSeizing on Ms May’s comments, Labour said it was “scandalous” that England’s most senior nurse, who appeared at various briefings before being dropped, was silenced because “she wasn’t prepared to parrot Downing Street spin” in relation to Mr Cummings.The decision to drop Ms May came two days after England’s deputy chief medical officer Jonathan Van-Tam sparked headlines by saying that lockdown rules “apply to all” when asked about Mr Cummings during the televised Covid-19 press conference.

I do know though that I was prepared to go into No 10 at a later date.”On whether she was asked to defend the prime minister’s senior adviser, she replied: “As with all press briefings we talk about lots of these preparation questions, and yes, of course I was asked about lockdown and rules to lockdown.”The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I notice that at the top of the No 10 Twitter feed I see one of her tweets pinned.”The Independent report in June revealed that hours before the briefing on 1 June, Ms May was immediately dropped from the press conference after failing to give support to one of the prime minister’s most senior advisers. A second source added: “JVT was the first to publicly push back on TV. Everyone is being asked to support the government’s positions prior to the press conference. If they don’t they get dropped. First it was Dominic Cummings, then easing lockdown and now the R-rate and the two-metre rule.”The gagging of chief nurse Ruth May does not inspire public trustReacting to Ms May’s comments on Monday, Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, said: “It is scandalous that the nation’s most senior nurse was silenced at the height of the pandemic because she wasn’t prepared to parrot Downing Street spin about Dominic Cummings’s blatant rule-breaking.“As the chief nursing officer indicates, it’s unacceptable that there was one rule for Johnson’s elite friends and another for the rest of us.”Ed Davey, the acting leader of the Liberal Democrats, added: “Boris Johnson is happy to hide behind experts when it suits him, but we now know that as soon as they don’t stick to his script he gags them. This is why we need to see the timetable for the independent inquiry he agreed to last week, so we can get the truth out in the open.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The “immediate and indefinite” suspension follows similar steps in the US, Canada and Australia, because of concerns about China’s crackdown in Hong Kong.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesIn a Commons statement, Mr Raab went further by announcing a ban on sales of “potentially lethal weapons” to Hong Kong, extending an embargo in place with mainland China since 1989.The security law was “a clear and serious violation of the UK-China joint declaration and with it a violation of China’s freely assumed international obligations”, he told MPs.PM says UK must ‘engage with China’ and hints sanctions unlikelyThe extradition ban would not be lifted without “clear and robust” guarantees that it would not be “misused under the national security legislation”.“The UK is watching and the whole world is watching,” the foreign secretary said.The announcement was welcomed by Tom Tugendhat, the Conservative chair of the Commons foreign affairs committee, but he urged Mr Raab to go further.He questioned there being “no announcement on the abuse of the Uighur Muslim population in western China”, or on the position of British judges sitting on court of final appeal in Hong Kong.Created with Sketch.

And we are going to be tough on some things – but also going to continue to engage.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

As well as two Michelin-starred pubs – The Hand \u0026amp Flowers and The Coach – he also opened a traditional butcher and founded Pub in the Park, the biggest food and music festival tour in the UK.During lockdown, staff from Kerridge’s businesses were volunteering to help a new charity called Meals from Marlow which delivers free food to NHS staff, key workers and people in need. This started small in early April and with support from over 1,000 donors, it recently ended up serving its 75,000th meal.From 4 July, both The Hand \u0026amp Flowers and The Coach have reopened fully in Marlow to welcome back hungry diners.7 great summer days out for the familyThe team have prepared a comprehensive Covid-19 policy document with a number of measures to protect the health and safety of guests and staff. Measures include daily staff temperature checks, hands-free antibacterial gel dispensers, one-way systems, private sole-use of bathrooms, cleaning touchpoints and toilets every 20 minutes, and even sanitising deliveries.Kerridge is also working with a company that provides protection against a wide range of pathogens, including Covid-19, using a sanitising treatment applied through fogging machines to provide an even coat on all surfaces, followed by manual application to hot spots, such as door handles.Form a bubble with a one-adult householdVisit your local salon, restaurant or bar, following UK Government guidelinesMeet in private gardens with up to six peopleTravel on public transport without a face covering or maskShare a car with people outside of your householdFor more information, visit gov.ukcoronavirus“Welcoming, safeguarding and taking care of others is at the very heart of what we do, says Kerridge. The last few months have been such a challenging time and we have been eagerly waiting to establish a little normality back into everyone’s lives, and get back to what we do best – providing great hospitality and food.”Kerridge\u0027s pubs have also been altered to make sure that spacing is as per UK Government guidelines. Partitions have been placed to ensure people have privacy and are able to enjoy their experience in the same way as before.Following the success of Meals from Marlow, it has now become a permanent charity and is set to provide 30,000+ meals a year to local people. “I know the people of Marlow are a very generous group but I’m astonished by the speed and the level of kindness, says Kerridge. Thank you, Marlow, I’m proud of you.”Colin Steele and Jade Windsor, pub landlords of the Falcon InnColin Steele and Jade Windsor, pictured below, took over the Falcon Inn five months before lockdown, restoring the pub as a community hub at the heart of the village of Fawley, Hampshire. After coronavirus threw a ner in the works, they were eager to reopen last weekend. “We have social distancing, hand sanitisers and a booking system, so our locals get a guaranteed spot,” says Windsor.The couple made the most of the lockdown by revamping the pub, painting the interiors and outside fencing, and putting up a pergola in the garden for some weather protection. “Because of lockdown we had the time to give the garden the love and attention it really needed,” says Steele. “Painting the fence outside has meant that we\u0027ve been able to interact with the village as they walk past. We\u0027ve been trying to bring that community spirit back.” To keep business going, they opened their car park for plant sales and teamed up with local company HMS Spirits to serve takeaway cocktails on Friday nights, which they will continue on weekends throughout the summer. “It kept us doing what we love, says Windsor, and keeping in contact with our customers.” They also recruited a chef with the goal of making back some of the lost income from closure and the now-reduced capacity that allows for distancing. Where they once accommodated 150 inside, now they can host 40. The team have ramped up hygiene measures: doors are wiped every half hour screens at the bar and face shields protect staff. Additional outdoor seating means that everyone is seated, and a new app will enable customers to order food from their tables. “We\u0027re a family-run business and everyone just wants us to succeed,” says Steele.Windsor adds: “I\u0027m sure we will come across a few issues, it’s something that no one\u0027s ever had to deal with before. I want my pub back the way it was more than anyone, but we\u0027ve all got to deal with it together.”Sarah Bentley, owner of The Cutting Room unisex salon As a small village salon that’s been open for 16 years, it’s little wonder that The Cutting Room’s loyal clientele had been keenly anticipating its reopening after temporarily closing back in March.A tight-knit team with great customer relationships, Bentley and her employees were excited to get back to a sense of normality. After a meeting last week, they felt reassured about the safety precautions put in place for their return. “It was a bit of relief coming back from staff training and just seeing everybody’s face light up and looking forward to being back,” she says. “We’ve had Zoom meetings discussing all the guidelines.”The salon may have been closed, but plenty was going on in the background to ensure that the premises and the team were as prepared as possible for a safe reopening.For example, they worked hard to keep customers informed about changes to their haircutting experience: as well as the salon now being appointment-only, clients have been informed that they are not able to enter the premises before their appointment, as well being asked to wear a face covering.“Because we are such a small salon, we have screens up between all our sections,” Bentley explains, adding that their booking and payment system has been made completely contactless.Though refreshments or magazines can no longer be provided, The Cutting Room has set up its outdoor space for clients to sit in a socially-distanced manner.The Cutting Room\u0027s kit used has also changed: “We’ve got disposable gowns, towels – everybody’s got all their completely own equipment it’s all labelled in their name – their own trollies, Bentley adds.Ultimately, safety is The Cutting Room’s number-one priority. “It’s there to keep us and the clients and my staff safe – and if I felt that they weren’t safe, I would shut the salon tomorrow,” Bentley says. “Everybody’s health comes first.Keeping you safe: a selection of guidelines for UK businesses All businesses are required to be Covid-19-secure in order to help protect their staff and customers. Here are some of the guidelines that salons, pubs and restaurants have been provided with:All businesses will have conducted a risk assessmentThorough and enhanced cleaning facilities will be available for staff and customersBookings will be limited to ensure social distancing and risk mitigationCustomers will be provided with guidance prior to their visitWorkers in continuous close contact to clients, such as hairdressers, will wear visors to promote safetyStaff will be split into teams or shift groups where possible to limit contactIndoor and outdoor seating will be reconfigured to maintain social distancing guidelinesStaggering entry times and introducing one-way systems throughout venuesContact between kitchen staff and front of house staff will be minimisedTo find out more about business guidelines, visit gov.ukguidanceworking-safely-during-coronavirus-covid-19Want to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

But when coronavirus hit in March, Ireland’s biggest sportswear brand had to break the habit of a lifetime and sack its entire 750-strong workforce at its Strabane factory due to the lockdown.With sports events cancelled or postponed, orders from teams and retailers vanished.However, the company was thrown a surprise lifeline when, a day after announcing the layoffs, the Western Health and Social Care Trust approached O’Neills on a Friday about fulfilling a shortage of scrubs to safeguard frontline NHS workers.Factory staff spent that weekend making sample scrubs. By the Monday, O’Neills had secured an order for 10,000 sets of maroon tops and trousers for GPs at a coronavirus testing centre at Altnagelvin Area Hospital, Londonderry.As a result, the company rehired 150 workers immediately. It has since brought back more than 400 staff overall as orders from other health trusts across Northern Ireland grew, with the remaining 350 employees being furloughed.The company now produces some 10,000 sets of scrubs a week. Managing director Kieran Kennedy, a veteran of 41 years at the business, says employees have been supportive of the switch from making sporting goods.“We are a close-knit community in Strabane. Many employees know people who work in the NHS and they want to give back,” he explains. “We could either feel sorry for ourselves or be productive and take a bite at the cherry. Without the NHS orders, we would have had no sales and no cash flow. The scrubs kept the show on the road.”Kennedy says the move outside the company’s traditional business area has been relatively easy. For instance, O’Neills had stockpiled a six-month supply of yarn – the raw material for the scrubs and other clothing – from China to hedge against Brexit uncertainty. The company knits the scrubs at its Strabane factory, then dyes and coats them with anti-viral substances at its production plant in Dublin.Workers on the factory floors are social distancing, as well as wearing face masks, sanitising their hands and having their temperature checked.Kennedy is upbeat on the company’s future prospects, noting that big sporting fixtures are returning, which should boost sales and enable him to rehire more workers. But for the foreseeable future, Kennedy plans to continue producing protective gear – an unexpected new revenue stream.   The gift shop owner donating Happy Bags to localsWhen Sarah Lloyd Williams, pictured above, had to temporarily close her quirky little gift shop in Frome on 22 March, she had no idea what she was going to do with the time ahead.At first, Lloyd Williams relished the opportunity to spend every day with her dog, Chester, taking him with other dogs out for walks. However, by nature, she is a hands-on person and soon realised she needed to find something to fill her time other than dog walking and cleaning.She had found out that someone local to her had been having a hard time. “I knew this lady slightly and wondered if there was anything I could do to help, Lloyd Williams explains. I didn’t feel that I knew her enough to contact her offering assistance, so instead I decided to leave a little gift on her doorstep.” She called it a Happy Bag, containing a copy of The Happy Newspaper (a quarterly newspaper by Emily Coxhead containing nothing but good news), a chocolate bar, bath bomb and a little note.This good deed went down very well: the recipient messaged Lloyd Williams to ask if she could buy a Happy Bag for her friend. “I didn’t want any money, Lloyd Williams explains. This was something small that I could do with items that I already sell in Figgins, so I delivered a Happy Bag to her friend and it went from there.”She ended up delivering a number of bags in the local area and it led to doing a few other little things for people, such as picking up medicines, shopping and more dog walking.For Lloyd Williams, this became a lovely way to connect with people that she barely knew, or had never met before, and it made lockdown much easier to navigate: “Giving away some Happy Bags certainly made me feel much happier. It’s a tiny thing, but sometimes that’s all it takes to make someone’s day,” she says.Figgins has now reopened, with Lloyd Williams taking steps to make sure her shop is safer with a screen, hand sanitising stations, floor stickers and limiting the number of people in the shop at any one time. Lloyd Williams is also donating a Happy Bag every week to someone in the local community.At the start of lockdown, Andy Hibbert, above, transformed his car-sharing business.Launched in 2017, Car \u0026amp Away had enabled holidaymakers to rent out their cars from Gatwick and Bristol Airports while they were away, but when the coronavirus forced airports to close, business plummeted.The CEO from south west London quickly decided to use the business\u0027 existing assets to help key workers and launched a new service: Karshare.“We had this burgeoning desire for people to rent their car from home because it was sat there doing nothing,” Hibbert explains. “But then Covid came along. As a business we were stranded. We thought: this is ridiculous. We have all the systems in place to enable us to share cars. Why don\u0027t we launch the car-sharing concept where owners donate their cars to critical-care workers and people who are supporting the most vulnerable in our community?”At the peak of the pandemic, travelling by car minimised viral spread on public transport and limited key workers’ exposure, while making their journeys easier at a stressful time. Karshare encouraged members of the public in Bristol, Brighton, London, Manchester and Leeds to donate their cars for a week to NHS staff and volunteer organisations. The cars were then deep cleaned and matched to local key workers in need of transport.Insurance and road coverage were provided for free, and the owner received a full tank of petrol as a thank you.Impressively, 700 cars have since been donated – including to 31 London NHS trusts – with a total 19,000 days of use. Leasing company ALD donated 30 new cars in Bristol. “We were overwhelmed initially about the donations,” says Hibbert.One key worker who benefited was Michaela Morris, deputy chief operating officer at the NHS Nightingale Hospital London in Docklands. “She was put into a hotel and told she needs to be on call 247, so we quickly found her a car,” says Hibbert. “It’s remarkable that she has been able to continue that work because of the generosity of the public.”Karshare also helped a care worker who had only been able to reach a couple of vulnerable patients a day on his bicycle. When he was loaned a car he could reach up to 11 – and save more lives.While Karshare is now focusing efforts on making the business profitable again, it is also inviting donations to critical workers and will ask for contributions to cover the insurance. Karshare is also being extended to the wider community, allowing people to rent their cars from home.“There are financial pressures for people,” adds Hibbert, “yet they\u0027ve got an asset on their driveway that could really help.”The distillery that swapped gin for hand sanitiserIn the midst of a global pandemic, constrained by lockdown, a fledging gin brand was surrounded by alcohol with no bars open to supply. But reports of hand sanitiser shortages hit the headlines and gave the team an idea.Sean Roche launched Aintree Gin in December 2019. An organic, craft spirit, it takes its name from its home in Merseyside – a village renowned for its famous racecourse which hosts the historic Grand National.By spring, Roche and the team had introduced the gin to over 30 establishments around Liverpool. They were gearing up for the steeplechase, but lockdown put paid to their plans. “As soon as everything started to shut … all of our income went down to zero,” Roche says.Realising online sales would be key, the team started building a website – then they had a brainwave. “News reports started to regularly mention how shortages of… alcohol-based sanitiser were putting NHS and care workers at risk,” says Roche. “We knew that because we were already using pure alcohol to make our gin, we could change our production line to make sanitiser.”Their first batch was ready within weeks. Word got out and, soon after, they were inundated with requests from care homes, hospitals and more, Roche recalls.Volunteers were recruited and more than 600 litres were donated in six weeks. But as supplies ran low, and with no money coming in, the enterprise became financially unviable. “We had two choices,” says Roche. “Stop – or start selling something.”Opting for the latter, new containers were ordered and labels designed so the sanitiser could be sold online. They started offering a range of PPE products too, from face shields to masks. “This created a revenue stream that allowed us to continue,” adds Roche.A PPE pop-up and free hand sanitiser stations at an Asda store followed. “We donated more than we made in profit over the period,” Roche admits.Today, sales are going strong. As businesses look to reopen, many are turning to Aintree Gin for their sanitisation requirements – and also the brand’s primary product. They now aim to supply as many bars and restaurants as possible, and get into supermarkets as well.To read about more inspiring GREAT stories, visit greatbritaincampaigninspirationsWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Help is desperately needed to support wildlife rangers, local communities and law enforcement personnel to prevent wildlife crime. Donate to help Stop the Illegal Wildlife Trade\u0026nbspHEREThe Independent employs reporters around the world to bring you truly independent journalism. To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Boosting businesses that protect nature but also bring benefits to people and governments is the best way to prove the value of conservation in Africa, two of the continent’s leading economic thinkers have said.  The economic value of every acre of land in countries with some of the world’s fastest growing human populations needs to be proven, they say. Quick wins like logging or farming have so far won out over conserving wildlife habitats.  But nature-based businesses can compete against extractive industries if governments and people grasp their economic as well as ecological benefits, according to Fred Swaniker, a Ghanaian entrepreneur and education pioneer, and Clare Akamanzi, the head of the Rwanda Development Board. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThat will help protect wildlife species, conserve habitats that provide clean air and water, and keep human development distant from animal species that carry deadly diseases, they said.The pair took part in the second in a series of webinars hosted by The Independent as part of its Stop The Illegal Wildlife Trade campaign, in partnership with international conservation organisation Space for Giants. “Poverty in Africa is often so high we can’t do conservation for conservation’s sake,” Mr Swaniker said. “We need to show people how nature benefits them and how it’s the pathway to the prosperity that they need.” Conservationists warn of poaching pandemic due to coronavirus crisisHis African Leadership University’s campus in Kigali, Rwanda, was dedicated to mentoring a new generation of young Africans aiming to transform conservation into a growth sector. “As an economic sector this is one that has tremendous unfulfilled potential,” Mr Swaniker said. “As we look at developing Africa we can’t just copy the rest of the world, we have to look at what we as Africans have that is unique to the continent. One of the things that we have that is a true competitive advantage is nature, some of the unique bioersity in the world that can therefore really be leveraged for growth.” Rwanda has transformed itself into one of Africa’s fastest-growing and modernising economies. That growth has in huge part been driven by wildlife tourism, Ms Akamanzi said. Tourism and conservation contribute 7 per cent of Rwanda’s GDP and bring in more foreign business than any other sector, she said. Tourism investors had opened the way for other enterprises to follow.

Lehr, of the Center for Strategic and International Studies told the Times. “These are coercive quotas that cause people to be put into factory work when they don’t want to be – and that could be considered forced labor under international law.”The Times analysed videos, photos, government documents, satellite images and shipping data which it says directly links Uighur labour to PPE factories that are shipping supplies to the US and other countries around the world.It highlighted a Chinese government broadcast showing around 50 workers arriving at the Tianshan textile factory in Xinjiang, preparing to start their new positions.“But behind this propaganda is a hidden story, about a longstanding and highly controversial government labor program that experts say often puts people to work against their will,” the Times report states.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He added: What we wont do is completely abandon our relationship with China, China is going to be a giant factor in our geopolitics, weve got to have a calibrated response. Were going to be tough on some things but also continue to engageon others. The move follows the US, Australia and Canada scrapping extradition agreements to Hong Kong.It comes as tensions between the UK and China escalated after the Government banned Huawei - the Chinese Communist party owned telecoms giant - from the G network in Britain. This included suspending Britains extradition to Hong Kong after national security laws meant those sent back could be hauled in front of Chinese courts and jailed in China. The Government claims the change violated the Sino-British Joint Declaration.The declaration was supposed to guarantee Hong Kong freedom from Chinese rule under the one county, two systems model for  years after the handover of the former British colony in .The law prohibits what Beijing views as secessionist, subversive or terrorist activities or as foreign intervention in Hong Kong affairs.Pro-democracy leader Nathan Law fled to the UK after the law came into effect this month. He told The Sunday Times he was afraid he may never be allowed to go back to Hong Kong. A -year-old girl waving a pro-democracy flag in Hong Kong on the day the law came into effect was among  people arrested under the legislation. The law grants police massive powers to conduct searches without warrants and order internet service providers and s to remove messages deemed to be anti-China. The Government has already taken strong action, offering three million Hongkongers eligible for a British Nationalpassport a path to UK citizenship. The Chinese ambassador to the UK Liu Xiaoming warned Britain not to enter into a tit-for-tat confrontation or follow the US in its sanctions on Chinese officials over alleged human rights abuses of Uighur muslims in Xinjiang. The law will criminalise any act of subversion, terrorism or collusion with foreign forces.The heaviest penalty that can be imposed is le in jail, the editor in chief of the Global Times newspaper claimed after citing those who have seen the draft of the law.Under the law, damaging public transport can be considered terrorism and those found guilty will be banned from standing for public office.Some trials will not be held in public while iniduals can be wire-tapped and put under surveillancethey are suspected of criminality.Beijing is also set to establish a security office in Hong Kong with its own law enforcement personnel and with the power to send some cases to mainland China to be tried.Beijing will further have power over how the law should be interpreted and Hong Kong will have to establish its own national security commission to enforce the laws, with a Beijing-appointed adviser.Mr Raab played down suggestions sanctions against officials could be brought in under the UKs new human rights scheme which can impose tough restrictions on abusers - including travel bans. He insisted that Britain wanted a positive relationship with China. Chair of the defence select commit Tobias Ellwood called for a reset of our entire foreign policy to fight back against Chinese aggression. He told BBC Radio s Westminster Hour programme that Britain had been duped over the couple of decades by China and needed to hit back with a firm hand. He said: “I really want to see a reset of our entire foreign policy, bearing in mind that we are sliding towards a cold war, we can’t do this on our own, we need to work with our allies.”“We turned a blind eye to what was going on with the Uighur population, we turned a blind eye to the uneven trade situation whereby Chinese companies could operate quite liberally within the UK and where but our companies couldn’t operate within China and now I think it’s time to say enough is enough.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He told MPs: The UK is not just developing world leading vaccines but also putting more money into the global hunt for a vaccine - whoevers vaccine is approved first so the whole world can have access.

But Chairwoman of the UK Vaccine Taskforce Kate Bingham cast doubt on whether the Oxford vaccine would be ready by the autumn, as previously hoped.She told BBC Radio  she remained hopeful but admitted that academics are unlikely to get enough data to prove it works until the end of the year.The vaccine developed by Oxford University was led bySarah Gilbert, professor of vaccinology at the Jenner Institute.Professor Gilbert has previously said she is per cent confident the vaccine her team is developing could be ready by September.Chief Scientic Advisor Patrick Vallance has previously said it is not a sure thing the UK will get a vaccine at all - but that treatments for coronavirus could improve, meaning it would no longer be lethal to those most vulnerable.   To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Quick-witted, smart, self-deprecating, incredibly likeable and a bit odd-looking. A man who gives hope to fans, both through his career and marriage to Abbey Clancy.Then a double calamity struck. Euro  was cancelled and instead of ­canning the project the BBC pressed on with SOS, shackling it with a hostage-to-fortune title and all sorts of baggage and “other stuff” the show could have done ­without as well.Aside from a garden centre set and enormous table, around which Churchill could’ve signed the Yalta agreement, the baggage came in human form: Crouchy’s former team-mates, The Horne Section studio band, a guest comedian and, of course, Maya, who provided my series highlight when she got dangerously side-tracked by the host’s leisure and tourism qualication.“I don’t want to sound silly or anything,” said Maya, carefully setting her own trap, “But what is a GVNQ ”“It’s a GNVQ.” Obviously.As awkwardly as hosts and guests have all gelled, though, the thing that’s really torpedoed this show has been the other stuff. Those outside broadcasts and studio features that were meant to fill the ­football gap, but didn’t.Two regulars were a chino-clad irritant called Fast Dad, who competed against the host to win football memorabilia for a viewer and “Peter’s Extreme Retirement”, which included all the ideas Alan ­Partridge would’ve thought a bit naff, like water-skiing with Joe Cole.The game not even Crouchy’s GNVQ could help him understand, though, was a VAR-related pun called Very Accurate Rhythm.On Saturday it involved Mo Gilligan playing keepie-uppie to The Horne ­Section’s version of Hit Me Baby One More Time. In previous weeks, however, it was Tinie Tempah and Katherine Ryan having a go at swingball and Jimmy Carr playing Mel C at table tennis.There’s a scoreboard as well, yet no sense of what the hell’s going on here, other than the fact that not a single ­person at the BBC knows how to produce light entertainment.If they did, one of them would have given Peter Crouch the two words of prime-time advice he desperately needed to hear. Don’t. Swear.They didn’t, though. Crouchy and his mates swore like he was presenting a late-night E show and so ended up with an E-sized audience of about one ­million. That’s the reason you never see masters of the light entertainment art, Ant  Dec, dropping the F-bomb.In its youth-driven madness, the BBC might think this is a good thing but it alienates the people who actually pay their wages and has direct consequences for Crouch who, before this started, I thought, could have become a ­Saturday night staple.

All of them are mesmerising.Two, though, still managed to stand out from the others.The first was a darkly funny Iraqi called Waleed Nesy who, before he became a journalist’s translator, was pro-war and fronted Baghdad’s only state-approved heavy metal band which, I’m desperately hoping, were called Black Sabba’ath.The other was ferociously bright US army officer Lieutenant-Colonel Nate Sassaman, “a charismatic leader of men” who was hoping to bring peace, democracy and lots of other empty promises to the country until he entered his first local medical centre and: “I’m telling you, the woman running it  She was as hard as a woodpecker’s lips.”Both were damaged by the catastrophe that unfolded and, in the case of Sassaman, helped cause, but they somehow retained their humanity, honesty and sense of humour, which made their testimony all the more astonishing.Like all great war documentaries, Once Upon A Time In Iraq was also prepared to let silence tell the story when the brutality or stupidity became too overwhelming.They made an exception for Waleed, though, when, six weeks into the invasion, President George W Bush boldly declared: “Mission accomplished.”“Mission accomplished  Oh yeah  . . . SERIOUSLY ”Three more episodes will tell you very graphically how well that worked out and they’re as good as anything you’ve watched all year.INCIDENTALLY, I’m grateful to This Morning hosts Ruth Langsford and Eamonn Holmes for revealing blind Celebrity MasterChef contestant Amar Lat measured liquids with “talking jugs”.Which, by a million-to-one coincidence, was also ITV’s original working title for Loose Women.My Strange Addiction: “Eating mattresses can lead to liver damage, intestinal blockage and even death.”But on the plus side, it won’t leave you bed-ridden.Emile Heskey: “When your back’s against the wall, it’s easy to lie down.”Jeff Stelling: “This game will be over when the referee blows the final whistle.”And Chris Kamara: “Three points is another point on the board.”BY the way,you haven’t ever seen Chernobyl, one of the greatest TV dramas ever made, Friday, pm, Sky Atlantic, is your chance.No further excuses will be accepted.WITH no little air of self-congratulation, last week, Celebrity MasterChef welcomed its first ever blind contestant, “travel presenter” Amar Lat, who arrived with a helper and his own super power.“I’ve started to hear the food talking to me,” he explained. “It’s almost like it’s communicating to me and it’s saying . . .”“Don’t worry, Amar. The BBC won’t chuck you out first. It’d look bad.”As good fortune would have it, he didn’t need to worry too much as it was the worst line-up of the series and included Gethin Jones, playing to the camera, rapper Lady Leshurr, whose speciality seemed to be “in-flight meals” and Alan Partridge star Felicity “Lynn Benfield” Montagu, who served up a salad for the guest judges that looked like a Haitian voodoo rattle.The real fall guy, though, appeared to be Jeff Brazier who, at the first challenge, was tugging away at a string of garlic for a good ten seconds before he twigged. “Ah. It’s a decoration. It’s made of polystyrene.”Those people who cry at absolutely everything, of course, were quick to let everyone  know Amar’s eventual progression to the semi-final made them “cry”.I thought the highlight of the week, however, came at the end of the pair’s dessert challenge when the judges’ comments led Amar to ask: “Are you two fat ” and Gregg Wallace replied: “Are you familiar with Jean-Claude Van Damme ”“Yes.”Then get someone to talk you through his voiceover on Minions: The Rise Of Gru.The resemblance is uncanny.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Health Secretary Matt Hancock said our scientists “played a blinder.”The data from research involving more than , healthy volunteers shows a vaccine developed at Oxford University is safe and triggers a strong immune response.Professor Jonathan Van-Tam, England’s Deputy Chief Medical Officer, said the trial result announcement was a “great day for British science.”He is now increasingly hopeful a vaccine will be available “this side of Christmas.”Kate Bingham, of the UK’s Vaccine Taskforce, added: “Optimistically, we’ll be vaccinating by the end of the year.”Professor Adrian Hill, director of Oxford’s Jenner Institute for Vaccine Research at Oxford University, said the results were at the “high end” of expectations.He added: “Its possible for a vaccine being used by the end of the year.”That breakthrough came as it was announced that a “game-changing” drug developed by a firm in Southampton could drastically cut the death rate among Covid- patients.Trials with  hospital patients found the inhaled drug, which uses an anti-viral protein called interferon beta, cut the need for intensive care treatment by  per cent.Patients were also twice as likely to recover during the two-week treatment period.Health Secretary Matt Hancock told MPs the virus is now “on the back foot.”He thanked UK scientists for their efforts and added: “They have played a blinder.”  Further trials of the Oxford vaccine will now begin and officials want half a million volunteers to sign up to help.The vaccine, called ChAdOx nCoV-, is a weakened version of a common cold virus that infects chimpanzees.Scientists modied it with genetic material from Covid-.It works by getting the body to make a protein found on the surface of the bug and priming the immune system against it.Trial data showed volunteers made antibodies and T-cells, a type of white blood cell at the heart of the human immune system, to fight off coronavirus.The effect stayed strong almost two months after vaccination.Professor Andrew Pollard, of the Oxford Vaccine Group, said: “We are seeing good immune responses — exactly the sort of response we were hoping for.”Scientists will now seek to prove the vaccine protects iniduals from becoming sick.With coronavirus cases falling here, the Oxford team has started trials on thousands of volunteers in Brazil and South Africa where rates are higher.The UK has already secured  million doses of the vaccine, with  million set to be delivered this autumn. It all trials are successful vaccinations could start after a month.The Oxford research was published in medical journal The Lancet.The most commonly reported side-effects were fatigue and headache, which were treated with paracetamol.The inhaled drug developed by UK firm Synairgen, called SNG, works by helping to protect lung cells from damage.Synairgen chief executive Richard Marsden said the results were “a major breakthrough in the treatment of hospitalised Covid- patients”.“We couldn’t have expected much better results than these.To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.Normally, it takes ten years to develop a vaccine from start to finish, to the point where you can give it widespread to patients.And you can see with the Oxford announcement just how fast we’re moving on this.What we’ve got with the Oxford result is clear proof that this ­vaccine produces a really good immune response in humans.It is very encouraging indeed.I’m now cautiously optimistic that this ­vaccine may work.I’m a glass half-full man.I’m cautiously optimistic that by late next spring there will be several vaccines that will have made it.And my confidence is increasing.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We knew it cracked down on all domestic opposition. We knew of the way in which they were undercutting the economies of the West.But not until the spread of the Wuhan virus did so many people come to realise how untrustworthy the Chinese leadership is.Now, every day brings more bad news about China. It isn’t because China is doing any-thing new. It is because China has caught the world’s attention.Not in a good way.Just consider the events of recent days.The Chinese government’s mistreatment of its Uighur population in the province of Xinjiang has been known about for years.The Muslim minority group, who regard themselves as closer to Central Asian countries — their language is related to Turkish — have long been in the government’s sights.Armed guardsFor years the Chinese Communist Party has had Xinjiang under its version of special measures.Claiming the one-time independent state, which borders eight countries, constitutes a special security risk, the communists have had the people there under mass surveillance.Even before the recent mass imprisonment, they have had them subjected to forced labour.In recent years they have subjected the entire population to compulsory birth control to try to reduce the size of the population.But for years the world’s attention was not focused on this.We all had troubles of our own to look to.So the Chinese authorities got away with putting perhaps as many as one million Uighur people in what are basically concentration camps — places where these people are meant to be “re-educated” and otherwise “corrected”.Now, drone footage has surfaced which shows shackled, blindfolded prisoners in the province being marched on to trains by rows of armed guards.The scenes are awful.As our Foreign Secretary, Dominic Raab, rightly said at the weekend, they are “reminiscent of something we have not seen for a very long time”.He is right.Yet when the Chinese Ambassador to our country was asked about this at the weekend, he pretended to have no idea what the footage was.He even tried to ert attention by asking his inter- viewer whether he had ever himself been to the charming province in question.But we are not as easily distracted by China as we used to be. Every day brings fresh causes.First, we had China’s appalling behaviour in Hong Kong, breaking its agreements with the UK and cracking down on the local population.Then last week came our Government’s decision to remove Chinese firm Huawei from any involvement in Britain’s G network.Huawei is basically a Chinese government agency and it would have been a serious security breach to allow it to control all our internet communications. Or to develop a back door for looking into them.Then a number of senior Conservatives warned that social media app TikTok is “as much of a threat” to Britain as Huawei.That may sound funny to parents whose children are addicted to it.For most of us, the app is just a source of amusement or bemusement.Depending on your age.But whatever your reaction to it, a growing number of people believe Chinese tech-nologies like TikTok are not safe. Because TikTok’s parent company is ByteDance, a Chinese firm founded in .Of course, the company claims to be independent, as all such firms do, but in China major firms are not independent as they are in Britain or other free societies.Critics insist TikTok could easily be used by hostile forces to harvest information from, and otherwise target, all those who use it.Of course, all of this has brought a degree of sabre-rattling from Beijing.China’s leaders have got used to telling everyone  what to do.As they spread their financial wings in recent decades, countries like ours were very keen to enjoy the benefits.Universities in the UK repeatedly took money from China. Money with strings attached.But money that some of our greedier universities thought was free. Only later learning otherwise.Naturally, the turnaround of recent months has been badly received in Beijing.Its ambassadors and state media have spent recent days pretending it is Britain that is the untrustworthy partner.They are wrong.We are not inconsistent or unfair. We are simply a country that has begun to wake up to a threat.Like the rest of the world. And not a moment too soon.Jaguar Land Rover builds cars for them under a joint venture with Chery Automobile. Pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca has , employees in China across several manufacturing sites, as well as an innovation centre and a ­campus.So as tensions ramp up after the decision to remove Huawei from the UK’s G network, Britain should remember it, too, has aces to play. Most notably tech and skills.To learn about these is why so many Chinese students come to our universities. It is the same reason why state-owned China General Nuclear Power is a one-third partner in the new nuclear power station at Hinkley Point C in Somerset.It will have a front-row seat to the latest tech as China prepares to build around  reactors of its own.Saying no to Chinese firms is not to be taken lightly.There are around , Chinese companies that do business in the UK.

The Foreign Secretary joined MPs in condemning Beijing’s alleged persecution of Uighur Muslims – appearing to compare it with the Holocaust. He slapped an arms embargo on Hong Kong. He also suspended our extradition treaty with the former British colony over a new security law imposed by China as it continues its crackdown on  pro-democracy protesters. The heightened tensions came after China accused the West of sparking a new “cold war” and threatened “a response” – singling out the UK for freezing tech firm Huawei out of our G network. Saying he was braced for retaliation over Hong Kong, Mr Raab said: “We are absolutely clear, we will not – certainly in relation to Hong Kong but also more generally – we will not buck and bow. “We will look for the positive but we will prepare for the resilience of our economy, our security and indeed the resilience of our values.” Mr Raab and Prime Minister Boris Johnson will today meet US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who flew in last night. Collapsing relations with China are expected to top the agenda. MPs yesterday rounded on Beijing in an hour-long debate, highlighting the plight of the Uighur minority in China’s north-western Xinjiang region. Ambassador to the UK Liu Xiaoming denies reports Uighur women are being sterilised to cut the population. On TV this week, he was confronted with footage appearing to show blindfolded Uighurs being marched to trains. It is also claimed authorities are selling Uighur hair on the internet.  Tory MP Neil O’Brien told the Commons: “Whether it’s pictures of Uighur children separated from parents or the horrying footage of Uighurs in chains herded off the trains and into camps, or news the Chinese government is selling the hair of Uighurs, many things are reminiscent of the darkest moments of th century history. “The only way to stand up to a regime becoming more and more bullying is to confront them now.” Mr Raab – whose Jewish father fled the Nazis and whose great-grandparents were murdered in the Holocaust – added that there were “harrowing echoes of what we have seen in the past”. The Foreign Secretary confirmed we will shelve extradition arrangements with Hong Kong in a “reasonable and proportionate” response to China’s new national security law. It gives mainland authorities “the ability to assume jurisdiction over certain cases and try those cases in mainland courts”. An arms embargo on China since ’s Tiananmen Square massacre will also be extended to Hong Kong as a result of the new law. Mr Raab told MPs: “There will be no exports of potentially lethal weapons. It will also ban equipment which might be used for internal repression, such as shackles and smoke grenades.” The UK previously said holders of British Nationalpassports in Hong Kong will get extended rights to join a path to citizenship. More details will be set out this week. The deepening crisis comes just five years after then Prime Minister David Cameron hailed a “golden era” of UK-Chinese relations. In addition to cutting Huawei out of our G network, there are calls for Chinese firms to be blocked from developing nuclear power stations here. Mr Xiaoming said this week: “People say China is becoming very aggressive. That’s totally wrong.  “It’s Western countries, headed by United States, they started this... new Cold War on China.” He also accused Britain of “dancing to America’s tune” with the U-turn on Huawei. But Tory backbencher Bob Seely, on the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee, said yesterday: “The China we hoped for is not now the China we are getting. “And not only in Hong Kong but in foreign lobbying, foreign investment, espionage – industrial or otherwise – and human rights.

Experts at Oxford found a jab they are developing sparks an immune reaction. Researcher Professor Adrian Hill said: “It’s possible there’ll be a vaccine in use by the end of the year.” With a safe and effective vaccine the only way out of the coronavirus crisis, the promising results from a major trial will be a boost to a nation worn down by the pandemic. Scientists were last night optimistic a jab would be available in six months in the fight against a disease that has killed hundreds of thousands of people and is crippling the economy. And they are hopeful it could be rolled out to NHS and care workers, as well as those deemed high risk, possibly before Christmas. Boris Johnson urged a note of caution by warning the jab may not “come riding over the hill like the cavalry” just yet. But Dr Sandy Douglas, one of the trial’s leaders, said: “I think the vaccine may be available for some people in high risk groups in the UK by the end of the year. It won’t be made available to ­everybody immediately. “It is likely to be given to those who have most to benefit from it earliest, and then gradually introduced to others.” Professor Hill, director of the Jenner Institute at Oxford, added: “It’s possible there’ll be a vaccine being used by the end of the year. But of course it has to work. Evenit worked by early November, you might have emergency use authorisation in a month and be deploying in December. So it’s possible but we can’t guarantee it. “That depends on ­incidence of the disease.” As the UK coronavirus death toll rose by  to , yesterday, the study’s lead author Prof Andrew Pollard said the findings were a “really important ­milestone”. But with large-scale clinical trials still to take place it is too soon to confirm whether the vaccine offers enough protection from the deadly disease. There are also questions over whether it will work in older adults whose immune systemsless well than those of the young. With phase one trials complete, the next rounds will take place in the UK, Brazil and South Africa to confirm whether it works effectively.  Prof Pollard said: “We just don’t know what level is neededyou meet this virus in the wild, to provide protection, so we need to do the clinical trials and to work that out.” His colleague Professor Sarah Gilbert added: “There is still much work to be done before we can confirmour vaccine will help manage the Covid- pandemic, but these early results hold promise.” Health Secretary Matt Hancock said British health officials and scientists had “played a blinder” in their vaccine work. But he told MPs the injection would not be approved until the authorities were “clinically confident” it was safe. Mr Johnson said he “had his fingers crossed” and was “hopeful” the vaccine would be available soon. But the PM added: “To say I’m % confident that we’ll get it this year, or indeed next year, that is, alas, an ­exaggeration. We are not there yet. “If you talk to the scientists, they think the sheer weight of ­international effort is going to produce something. “They are confident that we’ll get some sorts of treatments, some sorts of vaccines, that really make a ­dference. But right now can I tell you that I’m % confident  No.” Oxford’s findings, published in the Lancet medical journal, reveal the vaccine could provide double ­protection against Covid-. In the study, , participants made white blood cells, T-cells, that can fight the disease, within  days and ­antibodies – to stop it coming back – within  days. The early stage of the trial found the vaccine is safe and causes few side effects. Some suffered fever or headache that could easily be treated with pain killers.  No suggested a vaccine would not be compulsory, despite reports that one in four Brits would refuse to have the jab. But the PM’s official spokesman said: “The UK has one of the toughest regulatory regimes in the world anda vaccine is licensed for use then it will be safe for people.” An ideal vaccine against Covid- would be effective after one or two jabs, work in high risk populations and protect for a minimum of six months. The UK has already ordered  million doses of another jab being developed with drugs giant ­AstraZeneca. Chief executive Pascal Soriot said ­mass-production would begin before it was approved so it could then be distributed quickly. He added: “Our hope is that we can start delivering the vaccine before the end of the year, and how early depends really on infection rates in the ­community. We will be able to deliver results in September, but it may take another month or two.” "},{"url":null,"title":"public sector pay rise full","story":"NewsPublic sector pay rise in full: Increases coming for police, teachers and moreAlmost , teachers, doctors, police, prison officers and military personnel are in line for inflation-busting pay rises.

Doctors, teachers and police officers are among those who will see extra money in their pay packet after a testing few months since Covid- hit the UK. Teachers and doctors will see the largest increase at .% and .% respectively, according to the Treasury. But while the increases are above inflation, they follow many years of pay freezes for much of the public sector under successive Tory governments. Public sector wages were frozen from  to  - then were capped at % a year for the following five years. Each award is recommended by independent pay review bodies, and this year the Government has accepted the suggested rise for each workforce. The pay awards for the armed forces, prison officers, senior civil servants and NHS staff will be backdated to April, whereas the pay rise for police and teachers starts in September due to those professions operating on a dferent pay schedule running from September to August. But nurses wonapost be included in the pay award this time around. They successfully negotiated a new pay deal in  - with a three-year increase worth .% - though many say itaposs a paltry amount compared to the work they do.  Chancellor Rishi Sunak said: These past months have underlined what we always knew, that our public sector workers make a vital contribution to our country and that we can rely on them when we need them. Itaposs right therefore that we follow the recommendations of the independent pay bodies with this set of real-terms pay rises. The pay awards for the armed forces, prison officers, senior civil servants and NHS staff will be backdated to April, whereas the pay rise for police and teachers starts in September due to those professions operating on a dferent pay schedule running from September to August.  Labour shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds said the pay rise was good news but claimed it would not make up for a decade of real-terms pay cuts for frontline workers. TUC general secretary Frances OaposGrady called for social care workers to join the ranks of those being offered a pay rise. These rises are welcome, but thereaposs still a long way to go to restore pay after a decade of real terms cuts, she said. Many public sector workers, like job centre staff and local government workers, arenapost getting these rises. They deserve a decent pay settlement too.

The paper said the report by MPs and peers described the Kremlinaposs role in the vote that could have split the UK as the first post-Soviet interference in a Western democratic election. But after an -month investigation, Parliamentaposs Intelligence and Security Committeefound nothing to suggest Russia played any part in the  European Union poll, said the newspaper.  The full document is set to be published following months of delays, days after Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab claimed it was almost certain that Moscow had tried to interfere in the  election. The ISC report, prepared by the committeeaposs members in the previous Parliament, was postponed by Boris Johnsonaposs decision to call a general election and the need to re-establish the committeeaposs membership.Mr Raab said last week that Russian actors had tried to influence the  contest by amplying stolen Government papers online. The documents, relating to US-UK trade talks, were picked up by then Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn who said they were evidence the Conservatives were preparing to open up the NHS to US pharmaceutical companies.Relations between the UK and Russia have been under severe strain since the Salisbury Novichok poisoning in , which left former double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in hospital and led to the death of Dawn Sturgess.The incident resulted in Russian diplomats being expelled from Britain by then prime minister Theresa May. Mr Raab also announced this month, in a move that irked President Vladimir Putinaposs administration, that he was imposing sanctions on  Russian nationals linked to the death in custody of lawyer Sergei Magnitsky, who died in  after exposing massive corruption in the Interior Ministry.The ISCaposs alleged findings of interference in British democracy come after the UK, US and Canada claimed that Russian intelligence-linked hackers tried to steal details of research into coronavirus vaccines.Russiaaposs ambassador to the UK Andrei Kelin dismissed the accusations in a BBC interview.

Both sides have warned we are sliding towards a new Cold War as the UK suspended its extradition and arms agreements with Hong Kong today. Boris Johnson warned he would be tough with China over a new national security law, which Britain says will threaten pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong.But there are also mounting fears over cyber-security around the firm Huawei, and human rights abuses against Uighur Muslims in an area of China. The PM promised he wonapost make knee-jerk anti-Chinese policy - but todayaposs action is a far cry from the golden era pledged under David Cameron. Hereaposs what has been announced today and how it fits into the wider picture of chilling relations across the world.What has the UK announced today Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab announced the UK will suspend its extradition treaty with Hong Kong, “immediately and indefinitely”.It means someone in the UK whoaposs suspected of a crime in Hong Kong will no longer be handed over to Hong Kongaposs authorities - and vice versa. It follows the example of the US, Canada and Australia. Itaposs happened because of Chinaaposs new national security law - which allows the country to try Hong Kong cases in courts on the mainland. Extradition wonapost resume unless and until there are clear and robust safeguards to stop UK extradition being misused by China. What  has the UK announced   It comes after the UK took a string of major actions against China over Hong Kong, Chinaaposs national security law, and wider concerns over security. The UK was already introducing a new route for Hong Kongers with British nationalstatus - aposBNOapos - to live and work in the UK, and apply for citizenship. While , people currently hold BNO passports, the huge change potentially extends the right to move to Britain permanently to nearly three million people. The “bespoke route” for people from Hong Kong to come to the UK will be ready by , with more details to be confirmed this week. Today UK also revealed it will extend a -year-old arms embargo that applies to the Chinese mainland to Hong Kong as well. He said: “This will mean there will be no exports from the UK to Hong Kong of potentially lethal weapons, their components or ammunition. “It will also mean a ban on the export of any equipment not already banned that might be used for internal oppression, such as shackles, intercept equipment, firearms, and smoke grenades.” Meanwhile, of course, Boris Johnson last week ordered Huawei equipment to be removed from Britainaposs G network by  - amid fears the Chinese state could use the technology to spy on UK citizens. What is Britainaposs link to Hong Kong   Hong Kong island was ceded to Britain after Chinaaposs defeat in the First Opium War in the th century. China leased the New Territories, which forms Hong Kongaposs rural areas, to Britain for  years in . The approaching expiration led to the Sino-British Joint Declaration, signed in , in which Britain agreed toHong Kong to China in . It became a Special Administrative Region of China run under the one country, two systems principle. Hong Kong was to have its own government and legislature composed of Hong Kong people, while its capitalist system, currency and financial markets were to remain intact. What has happened since   Critics have long accused China of eroding Hong Kongaposs special status. Pro-democracy protesters took to the streets of Hong Kong last year in response to Beijingaposs tightening grip on the territory. But Hong Kongaposs legislature has now passed a controversial, Beijing-backed national security law. It makes activities deemed subversive or secessionist punishable by imprisonment, and is seen as targeting anti-government demonstrators. What are the UKaposs other problems with China   Aside from Hong Kong, and fears about cyber-security around the firm Huawei, there are mounting concerns about Chinaaposs human rights record. Drone footage has emerged apparently showing Uighur Muslims being blindfolded and led onto a train in Xinjiang province. There have long been allegations about so-called re-education camps and forced sterilisations perpetrated against Uighurs in the region. Chinaaposs Ambassador to the UK yesterday said he didnapost knowthe drone footage was real, adding: There is no such concentration camp in Xinjiang. But Dominic Raab said the UK has “grave concerns about the gross human rights abuses being perpetrated against the Uighur Muslims in Xinjiang”. He stopped short of using the word genocide but said: It is clear that there are gross, egregious human rights abuses going on. We are working with our international partners on this. It is deeply, deeply troubling. The human aspect, from enforced sterilisation to the education camps, are reminiscent of something we have not seen for a long, long time. Dramatically. Todayaposs move is a nail in the coffin of what David Cameron cast as a golden era of ties with China only five years ago.

Dad-of-nine Willy Collins was found dead on the bathroom floor during a trip to the Spanish island to celebrate his we Kathleen Collinsaposs th birthday on July .Heartbroken Kathleen has paid tribute to the -year-old following his sudden death earlier this month after a bleeding ulcer in his stomach burst and caused a haemorrhage, reports Yorkshire Live.She said Willy, who was known to many as Big Willy Collins, was the love of her le and she has been left devastated by his death. Family and friends have also been left heartbroken, with tributes pouring in from people in Sheffield as well as celebrities from across the globe who have sent condolence messages to the Collins family.Boxers such as Tyson Fury, Kell Brook and Billy Joe Saunders have sent messages to the family and other stars such as singer Shayne Ward and Irish TV personality have also expressed their condolences.Kathleen, who is now trying to arrange for her husbandaposs body to be flown back to the UK, said she met Willy when she was  and revealed how he told her then how he was going to marry her.  They tied the knot six years later when she was  and enjoyed over  years of marriage before his sudden death which has shattered the Collins family. Kathleen said: He was the love of my le and our children and grandchildren are devastated. He was the King of Sheffield and was very respected. He was very well-known and was a bare knuckle boxer but was more of a peacemaker. I always used to say he was smooth in the middle but rough around the edges - thataposs just what he was. Willy, who was born in Ireland, moved to Sheffield in  and grew up in Pitsmoor.  He used to train at Brendan Ingleaposs gym in Wincobank and although he and his we lived in ious places, Sheffield was always home with the couple eventually settling in Darnall. He had around  nieces and nephews having been the patriarch of the Collins clan and Kathleen says his family, including his children and grandchildren, meant the world to him. He doted on his children, she said. They were his le and they called him aposbig daddyapos. All the children and grandchildren called him that and he would always ring his nephews up who didnapost class him as an uncle - they classed him as a father. After Willyaposs death in Port de Pollença, his body was taken away from his family for over a week by the authorities so that a post-mortem could be conducted. This revealed he died of natural causes. His sudden death came as a huge shock to the family as Willy appeared fit and healthy but Kathleen says they have been comforted by the tributes and messages which have flooded in since his passing. Kathleen said she has received thousands of messages and wants everyone who knew Willy to attend his funeral in Sheffield which she says will be a big bash.

On July  legislation requiring the public to cover their noses and mouths when in shops will come into action.Unless they have been specically exempted, anyone caught breaking the rules will face a £ fine, Essex Live reported.Those who donapost have to worry about covering are supermarket staff - despite people shopping in their stores having to wear one. Environment Secretary George Eustice has suggested that it will not be mandatory for staff in places like Asda, Tesco, Sainsburyaposs and Lidl to wear coverings. Speaking on BBC Breakfast last week, he said: We want to give people time to plan and prepare and for retailers to maybe put in place measures to encourage people to do this or potentially even to have some masks themselvespeople haven’t got one. Once you make something mandatory as we’re doing now for retail environments it sends a much stronger signal that people will follow in greater numbers. Speaking about supermarket staff he said: They’re not being covered by this but I thinkyou go into most shops you will see that staff for a longer time now have either been wearing face shields or face masks. It won’t be a compulsory requirement because it won’t always be right for every setting in a retail environment, particularly those working behind the tills and so on.  Many supermarkets have provided coverings for their staff to wear. The majority have decided to wear them, despite it not being mandatory to do so.Last week, Health Secretary Matt Hancock told MPs that they needed to protect shop workers, who have a higher coronavirus death rate than the general public.One way of doing this, he said, was to introduce face coverings.  He said: In recent weeks we’ve reopened retail and footfall is rising. We want to give people more confidence to shop safely and enhance protections for those who work in shops. Both of these can be done by the use of face coverings.

The BBC interviewer has said that the palace were shocked, not by the interview but by the public reaction afterwards. The interview, widely described as a “car crash”, saw Andrew speak atabout his association with the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. He declined to say he regretted the friendship, with his memorable answers including details of his visit to Pizza Express, saying he was medically unable to sweat and his description of a “straightforward shooting party”. Shortly afterwards the Duke stepped back from royal duties. Prince Andrew has vehemently denied any accusations of wrongdoing over his links to Epstein, including allegations he had sex with Virginia Giuffre when she was  years old. Speaking ahead of the Baftas, where the interview is nominated in the news category, Maitlis told the Radio Times: “We know that the Palace was happy with the interview. We had plenty of engagement with them after it went out. I think their shock was not at the interview itself, but the reaction it caused in the days and weeks afterwards.”  The Newsnight host said she only realised the signicance of her interview with the Duke of York after watching the footage. The Andrew interview won scoop of the year at the Royal Television Society Awards while the BBCaposs flagship current affairs show was also named daily news programme of the year. Maitlis said the penny dropped about the importance of the interview in the editing suite with her programmeaposs editor, Esme Wren.  She said: Weaposd assumed that heaposd want to show empathy to the victims or pin the blame on Jeffrey Epstein. We couldnapost understand why he hadnapost done that. We definitely thought heaposd be spikier... The interview had been a year in the planning and Maitlis said they could have opted for a shorter interview but held out for something more comprehensive. She said within a few minutes of the interview beginning, she knew they had something explosive, adding: First, he was tackling the subject matter head on. Secondly, the lack of apology or any real expression of regret told me that the prince still believed that his actions had broadly been the right ones. And thirdly, the level of detail was unlike anything I was expecting.

Ms Samuel said: “I do to George what [Diana] did to us, which is give impossible toys that are really noisy and take a lot of making. “William then has to spend days putting together.

The handpicked fighting force is testing deadly new weapons, kit and tactics in readiness for emergency combat missions spearheading battles as soon as next year. Around  Royal Marines – part of the Royal Navyaposs maritime assault force plus a select group of Army commandos - will make up the special-forces style unit. Green Beret “strike” troops are being lined up to perform raiding party-style missions to “soften up” enemy forces before regular Army troops form the main attack. The Royal Marines “Vanguard Strike Company” is being set up to destroy enemy defence lines, lookout posts, airfields and headquarters – often launching from the sea. Dubbed Littoral Strikes – meaning attacks along the coastline – the new commando missions will work closely with special forces units from the elite SAS and SBS. The initial trial unit will grow into a much larger fighting force once tactics and training have been completed – just like the UK commando units did in the Second World War. Once the larger force is set up many of them will be sent abroad, to be put on high alert to be deployed into battle at a few hours notice, massively extending the UKaposs military presence globally.One of the targets would be Russian forces making incursions into Baltic allies of the West or regions like Norway. Where UK commandos train every year as part of their arctic warfare missions and Islamic State globally Defence bosses agreed the new strike force could be set up as part of the Royal Marinesapos massive overhaul – their biggest since Wold War Two. They have been given new, light-weight but hard wearing unorms that dry quickly and Diemaco C- assault rles, proven in battle in Afghanistan. Commandant General Royal Marines Major General Matt Holmes, DSO, who led  Commando in Helmand Province, Afghanistan, in  and a Marine for over  years, said: The Vanguard Strike Company will lead and inform how the Royal Marines and Army Commandos will operate and fight in a dynamic, technological era of warfare. “We envisage several of these networked sub-units persistently forward deployed around the globe with an array of sophisticated enabling capabilities, to present dilemmas to adversaries whilst supporting partners. “These will be at high-readiness as a capable forward contingency force at the core of the Royal Navyaposs Littoral Response Groups."},{"url":null,"title":"voice mirror oxford vaccine development","story":"NewsopinionVoice of the Mirror: Oxford vaccine development is dose of good news we all needThe world is buoyed by the news UK researchers at Oxford University have made progress in the race to find a vaccine to prevent killer Covid- - our health and wealth depends on itShareCommentsByVoice of the Mirror:,  JUL NewsopinionUK scientists are leading the global race to find a Covid- vaccine \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Deaths top , – three times above the Government’s “good outcome” target. It is not only lives at stake but our livelihoods too as we see with Marks  Spencer, the latest household name to slash hundreds of jobs. Until an effective vaccine is invented, people will die and the economy will be strangled by expensive precautions to slow the spread. The Government’s order of  million doses of a vaccine developed at unprecedented speed is cause for optimism but it is still to be proved a magic bullet. For our health and wealth we are relying on some of the world’s best scientists to come up with an answer. Caring public A National Care Service that runs ­alongside the National Health Service is no guarantee of perfection but it would almost certainly be an improvement on the current expensive chaos. Labour’s leader Keir Starmer will craft his own policy agenda but the proposal by former Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell is worth considering carefully. Senior figures in Unison, a trade union with intimate knowledge of how private homes operate, also favour nationalisation.

Face masks have been widely heralded for preventing other people getting infected by blocking the coughs and sneezes of those wearing them. But now scientists also believe they make the symptoms of those who do get the infection less severe by reducing the amount of virus droplets they are exposed to. The paper, by infectious disease experts from the University of Calornia, presents evidence to suggest that masks cut down on the amount of viral droplets getting into the airways. And therefore result in higher rates of asymptomatic or milder infection. A lower initial dose of Sars-Cov-, in theory, gives the immune system a better chance of fighting the bug without the risk of getting severely ill - allowing for a greater chance of immunity while a vaccine is developed. For updates on coronavirus, follow our live blog HERE.  Exposing society to SARS-Cov- without the consequences of severe illness with public masking could lead to greater community-level immunity and slower spread as we await a vaccine, the report states. Face coverings are to be mandatory in England in shops and supermarkets from July , and have been on public transport since June. The paper is due to be published in the Journal of Internal Medicine.  Co-author Monica Gandhi, associate ision chief of the infectious diseases programme at San Francisco General Hospital told the Times said masks lead to a lower dose of the virus. You will get in a lower dose of virusyou wear a mask and are exposed to Covid- and are very likely to have mild or no symptoms.

The -year-old, who won the first series of Celebrity big Brother in , partnered with estate agents Purplebricks to reveal all. Craig says that you can increase the value of your property by thousands of pounds by simply sprucing up your front door. With it being the focal point of the house, Craig says itaposs the key to enticing potential buyers and anyone entering your home. In a video demonstration, Craig explains how important it is for homeowners to have a bold front door. But before you go out and spend any money on a brand new door, Craig says you can just give your old one a new lease of le.  The first thing you need to do is to clean your door. Craig says: We will start by cleaning the door with a concentrated sugar soap and warm water. Itaposs to get all the grime off the actual uPVC.  Then make sure to rinse the solution off with cold water, and dry it was a microfiber cloth. He added: Now the door is clean and dry, Iaposm going to give it a light sanding down with the sanding pad to prepare it ready for the new paint. Once the surface has been prepped and has a smooth surface, itaposs ready to paint - and there are two methods to choose from. Craig said: You can use the traditional way with the paintbrush or a faster way is by using a small handheld paint sprayer, but of course you will have to mask over the glass and the handle. Whilst a handheld paint spray can help you save time as you donapost have to wait for each coat to dry before applying another, a paint brush will give you a more precise finish.

In terms of pure squad size, though, cover is needed.We’ve already seen with Siegrist, Butcher and Shankland struggling with injury how short the Terrors could be in crucial early games.A couple of extra bodies would alleviate any concerns of stling.That all but one of their under-contract first-team players accepted a wage cut is cause for optimism for Dundee.The vast majority of the squad making a salary sacrice is testament not only to the players as iniduals but to the togetherness of the club as well.It should reassure Dark Blues supporters they’ll be just fine on the pitch next season under James McPake.He’s clearly built a solid team spirit and bond – one strong enough to see them through the trials and tribulations on and off the park in the months ahead.However, the fact Kane Hemmings is the exception to the rule and could, potentially, be out the door at Dens Park is the last thing the Dee would’ve wanted.Minus the English striker, Dundee are a dferent animal. He, after all, was their marquee signing last summer.The hitman is more than just a goal-scorer, he’s their talisman. Iniably,the -year-old performs well then so do his team.Finding a replacement of his quality would be some task but Dee fans should be hoping all is not lost on No  sticking around.As a proud Scotsman it pains me to say it but Harry Kane truly is a magnicent goal-scorer.He has done it consistently for seasons now butthere was ever any doubt about his ability he has well and truly quashed that by netting his th club career goal against Newcastle on Wednesday.At just ,he stays fit, you wouldn’t bet against him topping Alan Shearer’s Premier League record and Wayne Rooney’s England total.That the Premiership is due toin two weeks and we still have arguments raging between the SFA, SPFL and its member clubs is, sadly, no surprise.Surely this should have been sorted amicably by now PODCAST: Twa Teams, One Street – Does Kane Hemmings have a future at Dundee and will Benjamin Siegrist be fit for United’s opener \" title\"#PODCAST: Twa Teams, One Street – Does Kane Hemmings have a future at Dundee and will Benjamin Siegrist be fit for United’s opener # # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp podcast-twa-teams-one-street- embed # secretJqBekuS\" data-secret\"JqBekuS\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

Once again, the separatists# numbers simply don#t add up.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands wardSir,Exactly two years ago I was diagnosed with stage three, oestrogen positive breast cancer.I’d just come back from a week#s holiday in Spain with Isabel and Margaret. Days before I went on holiday I’d had a biopsy following referral from my GP. Although there wasn’t a cloud in the sky, my holiday was definitely clouded by impending results#I had chosen to wait until after my holiday to get them.The journey that Monday to go to Gartnavel is one I’ll never forget. My partner Frank didn’t shut up the whole way there, obviously he was nervous. I couldn’t be bothered with the small talk and just wanted him to shut up. Obviously I was nervous and he was just trying to keep my mind off it, but I was too busy silently praying. The number  is something I see all the time so I spent the whole journey looking for the number on someone’s licence plate #I saw it everything would be ok. I didn#t see it. That might sound a bit daft, but fear does crazy things to you.Walking into the consultant#s room and finding a nurse waiting there confirmed my worst fears. #It’s a wee cancer,# said Mr Wilson. The words echoing in my head, I couldn’t hear anything after that. I remember taking a deep breath and looking at Frank. I will never, ever forget the look on his face.My only question that day was #am I going to lose my breasts # The answer was no, and thankfully Frank was there to take in what was being said my head was spinning. The question I really wanted to ask was #am I going to die # I was too scared to ask that question.I didn’t cry until I walked out the hospital, then I bawled. Frank was amazing, and he didn’t talk like a budgie on the way home.The journey home was horrendous. I was terried about telling my mum. How do you tell your mum that her only child has cancer  I hadn’t told her anything about finding a lump. I couldn’t cope with worrying about her worrying about me # butit happens again I#d do it dferently and she’ll be the first to know. By the time I got home I had no more tears left.The relief telling mum was a huge weight off my shoulders. What ensued after my initial diagnosis was two weeks of crying every day. Telling the girls at work was so emotional, and in fact I was exhausted with it all.Once surgery and treatment plans were in place I was in a better place. Time to get the head down and get on with it, and that#s what I did. I was full of positivity and determination, and I think my sense of humour helped enormously.The treatment was bad, but it was necessary. The ongoing treatment is bad but it#s necessary. I’m alive and that’s what matters. My le has changed forever, nothing will be the same. My le has been ided into Before Cancer and After Cancer  I now have a new #normal#.I don’t know what the future holds, who does, but I intend to live my le happily, positively and most definitely to the fullest!I will never forget the support, both physically and emotionally that I received from my nearest and dearest, and of course from the whole community. The strength you have given me continues, and for that I am truly grateful.Please, pleaseyou find an abnormality or you just feel something isn’t quite right, act upon it and seek attention.I know it’s a dficult time with this horrid virus but it’s important to remember that early detection saves lives.Stay safe and take care.Yvie Young, Lochgilphead"},{"url":null,"title":"midweek joy for golfer david","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsDavid Ronald took the honours in the first midweek stableford at Tarbert Golf Club, with a fantastic score of  points.He was on target to break  for the first time but finished with a double bogey for a , still a great score.

The noise is constant and intrusive for  –  hours in a day, the decibel level in excess of  dB where sounds above  dB are harmful to hearing.This is a serious issue for residents who cannot open their doors and windows, cannot use their gardens, pets are terried, it is often impossible to have a conversation, or a phone call. The noise from hundreds of bikes is explosive and destructive.The speeds are terrying, they travel in intimidating packs, the noise is threatening and the bikers have no respect for the communities they are speeding through. They pass multiple residential entrances with limited sight lines with no care for risk. The offensive noise seems to come from two actions modying motorbike exhausts and extreme acceleration in legal bikes.If a car made a similar noise, spewed out the same polluting omissions, or did the same ridiculous speeds they would be pulled over by the police, but bikers appear above the law.As technology reduces the noise pollution of cars, planes and other forms of transport, it seems motorbikes are exempt. Bikers claim #loud pipes save lives# but is safety really the motivation for deliberately creating excessive noise Noise counts as a statutory nuisance it either unreasaonably and substantially interferes with the user or enjoyment of a home or other premises or is likely to injure health.The problem on A is known to all the statutory agencies, but nothing is done.If this is a national problem, what action needs to be taken Concerned Loch Fyne-side resident Sir,I am not qualied to judge economic competence, but considering the party he represents, I think that Councillor Redman might find it advisable to be wary of the phrase #colossal mismanagement# .For my part, I would consider a degree of incompetence to be preferable to the great damage caused over the last decade to  per cent of the UK’s people, as well as to its institutions and its reputation by the cruel, self-serving, xenophobic, elitist, dishonestregime currently in Westminster.Name supplied, LochgilpheadSir,Our charity#s support for blind and partially sighted people affected by the coronavirus lockdown has received a £, boost from the Scottish Government#s Wellbeing Fund.With this extra funding we will be able to support an additional  people and respond to the increased demand for more in-depth, one-to-one emotional support.The practical and psychological effects of losing your sight can have a signicant impact on people’s well-being, and this current situation has exacerbated the anxiety and isolation felt by many.Access to essential services such as food and medicines is more dficult as is social distancing, vital information on staying safe isn#t always in accessible formats, and many of our older members aren#t always confident about using new technology to stay in touch with others.Everyone accessing RNIB#s confidential counselling service will receive eight weekly sessions with an accredited counsellor, delivered via telephone and online, with each session normally lasting an hour.The funding will enable us to reduce the waiting list for emergency mental health sessions and also let existing clients access additional sessions.The RNIB helpline is available on   .James Adams, RNIB Scotland directorSir,Every pub across Scotland should be allowed to stock and sell beer from local independent brewers, to help them recover post-lockdown.CAMRA, the Campaign for Real Ale has launched the #Cheers for Choice# campaign.The campaign wants these arrangements to be relaxed, and MSPs are also being urged to support the Tied Pubs Bill being put forward in the Scottish Parliament by Labour MSP Neil Bibby. The legislation would give tied pub tenants protections in law, including a right to be able to sell guest beers in their pubs.Allowing small and independent brewers to sell into all pubs will also improve consumer choice and allow pub-goers to support local brewing businesses.It also makes business sense, with  per cent of pub-goers saying they would be less likely to go back to a pubit doesn’t have a range of brews from small and independent producers.Sarah Crawford, CAMRA Director for Scotland, Kirkcaldy"},{"url":null,"title":"could a two way conversation transform scotlands health","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSome of us have learned in lockdown the importance of other people, and have been longing for these first personal contacts.There have been surprises in discovering just what is important in le, and the comfort of knowing you are not alone in your likes, as your favourite brand of chocolate is again sold out.We have also been made aware that the way we behave makes a dference to the future.

Alison Flood interviewed crime writers about their work, and this is what she found.Ian Rankin is now writing about a John Rebus who has health issues, James Lee Burke has his detective Robicheaux meditating on mortality in his early s and Mark Billingham has slowed his Tom Thorne down a bit because he is in his s. Michael Connelly does not believe that it is credible to have his Harry Bosch with a badge and gun and still working for the LAPD, this in a country where the President is  and one of the presidential hopefuls .Worst of all, Sara Paretsky created a feisty, strong woman for her books, only to succumb to popular misconceptions and stop her age at  because she didn#t #want Vi to be helpless#.These fictional creations battle the evils they see in their society.

Perhaps for the first time in their lives they have heard the bark of deer or spotted something in nature that is totally new to them.

But what we do not want to do is fall back into the same old traps that were so detrimental to the wildle, nature and ecosystems of our planet. Finding a way forward and a new balance is not just crucial for other species but for that of our own children and future generations too.Many will have been shocked at the sudden increase in fly tipping during lockdown plus the thoughtless parking and abandonment of picnic rubbish, disposable barbecues and indiscriminate toileting as lockdown eased. All have grave consequences for wildle and nature.The result is the burning, choking, strangling, trapping or poisoning of animals, birds, plants and aquatic le.Taking care of our surroundings and appreciating nature is a real joy.

Edinburgh Zoo, Five Sisters Zoo in West Lothian, Blair Drummond Safari Park in Stirling and the Highland Wildle Park in the Cairngorms National Park have all reopened, with customers asked to book in advance. Fe Zoo suffered a devastating fire just days after reopening after the Covid- lockdown, but no animals were harmed and owners have said they hope toto normality as soon as possible thanks to support and fundraising from the local community.Stately homes and gardens have also reopened, with several National Trust for Scotland properties now open to visitors.These include Culzean Castle and Country Park in Ayrshire, Threave Garden in Dumfries and Galloway, Brodie Castle’s garden and grounds, Arduaine Garden in Argyll and Crathes Castle’s garden and estate in Aberdeenshire. Historic Environment Scotland has said that it will monitor the situation and reopen properties in due course.Unstaffed outdoor sites are already open, so visitors can enjoy walks around Edinburgh’s Holyrood Park and West Lothian’s Linlithgow Peel among others.Edinburgh’s historic Royal Mile.Walkers and climbers are now welcome to visit the country’s national parks to enjoy some outdoor exercise. Guidelines remain to avoid touching surfaces or opening gates where possible, to follow signs and avoid coming into contact with farm workers where applicable, and to keep dogs on leads and avoid areas known to be busy. Pubs and restaurants without door space have also been allowed to reopen. Glasgow’s The Cranside Kitchen, near the Rotunda, has claimed to be the country’s largest beer garden, with a free-to-enter area seating more than  guests with social distancing measures in place.The beer garden offers a range of drinks alongside food from five popular Glasgow restaurants, Rioja, Halloumi, Pickled Ginger, Kilmurry  Co and La Rotunda.

Each oyster can filtrate and clean up to  litres of water a day, and the native oyster reefs enhance bioersity by becoming fish spawning grounds and nurseries.Back in March Seawilding secured a National Lottery Heritage Fund grant to grow young native oysters over a five-year period in floating baskets on the loch. When they are semi-mature, the oysters will be moved to trial seabed sites around Loch Craignish, where it is hoped they will become a self-sustaining population.Project co-ordinator Danny Renton told the Advertiser: #This is a pioneering project, driven by the Craignish community. Loch Craignish was once a rich environment for native oysters and scallops in particular, but bottom trawling since the s has destroyed much of the seabed. Our community wants to reverse that. We hear a lot about rewilding, but there’s little action been taken so far with restoration of marine habitats – so what we are doing at Loch Craignish is an exciting opportunity to show that marine rewilding and reintroduction of priority marine species is possible.#The project is teaming up with Scottish Association of Marine Scienceand the Department of Aquaculture from Stirling University to enable  marine science students to monitor, survey and research the restoration efforts over the next five years.To kick off the project, the charity along with local partner Heart of Argyll Wildle Organisation and the Ardfern Yacht Centre, has been introducing native oysters in suspended cages under the pontoons of the yacht centre.Each Oyster Hoister houses  mature oysters which will help clean up the marina water as well as releasing spat, adding to the wider restoration effort in the loch. The hoisters are sponsored by members of the community and boat owners, and the plan is to suspend around  cages by the end of the year.When schools open in August, Heart of Argyll Wildle Organisation will be working with pupils to monitor the oysters in the cages, measuring their growth and recording bioersity.Oly Hemmings and Pete Creech, the organisation’s rangers, initially want pupils from five local primary schools to get involved in this exciting project. This is an opportunity for pupils to actively take part in valuable research that will be added to data already being collected from other oyster reintroductions throughout the UK.Oly said: #We’ve been interacting with oysters in Argyll for around , years and it is fantastic to be able to get future generations involved in ensuring this relationship continues.#Any schools interested can email Oly and Pete at info@heartofargyllwildle.org for further information. A teacher’s resource pack that can be used in conjunction with school visits or as a standalone resource is available. The educational objectives are fully funded by the project’s funders, the National Lottery, and this includes travel to and from the project venue at Ardfern Yacht Centre. Oly and Pete also intend to engage with older schoolchildren and community groups as the project progresses.For further information about the Loch Craignish Native Oyster Restoration Project, please visit www.seawilding.org or email info@seawilding.org"},{"url":null,"title":"support local call as argyll eases out of lockdown","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsPubs and restaurants have opened, tourist attractions can now be visited # and those wild and woolly lockdown locks can finally be tamed by a visit to the hairdresser.As the easing out of coronavirus lockdown continues in Scotland, this week has seen the most signicant relaxation of restrictions imposed as the coronavirus pandemic arrived in March.Among other steps, places of worship and childcare providers can now all reopen.There is also a partial relaxation of  restrictions on attendance at funerals and marriage ceremonies, while closer working may now be permitted in the building trade.All of the above, of course, comes with strict safety requirements which must be adhered to # but they are steps in the right direction.And with many Argyll business ready to re-open, residents are being encouraged to support Argyll and Bute by buying local.#Post COVID-, we should support our local businesses as they have supported us during the pandemic,# said Councillor Alastair Redman, Argyll and Bute Council#s policy lead for economic growth.#With lockdown in place,# continued Councillor Redman, #our food and drink producers had to change the way they did business – often in imaginative ways.

Without action and proper investment from central government vital public services will be at risk.This news of huge strain on local authority budgets comes as the SNP is delaying in opening up Scotland’s hospitality and tourism industry. Instead of following other parts of the UK and opening the sector on July , the separatists are forcing businesses to wait until July .This delay will cost businesses millions at a time when thousands of jobs are already on the line.The SNP is risking people#s livelihoods. It needs to accept responsibility for that and take action now.Councillor Alastair Redman,Sir,People occasionally ignore the elephant in the room to support their point of view, but in his latest letter, Councillor Alastair Redman has ignored an entire herd in his living room.In his latest rant he states that the SNP is failing councils as the cost of coronavirus could hit more than £ million, but surely these costs would be the same no matter who was in power He also suggests that #essential local services have been underfunded for years# yet fails to mention the years of needless austerity cuts, actioned by his party and their collaborators, to bail out the greedy and risky practices of the banks, which reduced funding to a devastatingly low level in general. It is worth noting that the Scottish Government has put a greater percentage of their curtailed income into NHS Scotland than any part part of the UK. This has helped NHS Scotland to outperform all of the others, in the UK, for the past five years. This is paying idends now.He s to his familiar attempt to insult by referring to citizens who want to take responsibility for making and managing decisions and working to make their country prosper within the priorities set by its citizens as #separatists#. I’m glad to be described as a separatist because the alternative is to be an apologist for an unrepresentative government in Westminster and to abdicate decision making to that same out-of-touch group.It is Councillor Redman’s final point, however, that demonstrates his blinkered sycophancy. His suggestion that the Scottish Government should follow the example of other parts of the UK. Could he really be saying that we should follow the chaotic shambles and incompetence that has emanated from his chums at Westminster  Does he seriously think that any sensible person, irrespective of their own political affiliation and from any of the devolved nations, would swap what their government#s have done for the Westminster model Sadly, nowhere in his missive does Councillor Redman take time to mention the health and safety of our citizens.It is this, together with scientic advice and without political point scoring, that is driving the Scottish Government#s response to this tragic pandemic.Kevin MacKaveney, TarbertSir,Following reports of littering around Argyll and Bute, including the Isle of Islay, the issue was discussed at a recent meeting of Islay Community Council where community councillors heard that items like rubber gloves have been found dumped in ditches.It is always very disappointing to hear about littering and fly-tipping but doubly so in an area like Islay where residents take such an understandable pride in their environment.We also need to bear in mind that items like disposable gloves can pose a threat to livestock. As well as being profoundly antisocial, this kind of behaviour can be positively harmful.Those acting irresponsibly should remember that there can be serious consequences to their thoughtlessness.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSPSir,We all have a role to play in the recovery of the country’s tourism industry after its reopening on July .Scots could help by taking a trip, visiting an attraction or experience, shopping locally, dining out and booking a staycation.Scottish tourism is facing its biggest challenge in a generation and will need financial support for some time to come to help it recover. The Scottish public has a crucial part to play in helping this happen.It#s easy to not think of yourself as a tourist in your own country but many of the experiences that we often enjoy with loved ones, such as holidays, shopping or eating out, all contribute to our visitor economy.July  marked a new era for the industry as we start to welcome back visitors and take our first steps on the road to a safe and responsible recovery. However, reopening won’t be the same for all businesses, many are still adapting to this #new normal#, so it#s important that we recognise that as we move forward to try and restore our industry.We look forward to helping Scots rediscover their own country in a way that is safe for everyone # visitors, residents and those working within the industry. Recovery will require our collective efforts and we must act as one to ensure the best possible outcomes for the whole of the visitor economy.Malcolm Roughead, VisitScotland chief executive"},{"url":null,"title":"the time for change is is now july 17 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThis isn’t really a campaign, it’s just the things that we should all be thinking aboutwe want Argyll # and the world – to be a recognisable place for our children and grandchildren to live in.The economic crisis could be seen as an opportunity to get started on the work that we know needs to happen.I think that many people in Argyll could continue to work from home people who have lost their jobs could be retrained, or use their existing skills, to do the work that is necessary for Argyll to become carbon-neutral. Walking and cycling infrastructure needs to be improved, trees can be planted, and renewable energy can be expanded and made more efficient.Transport and food are the most obvious areas for behavioural change in Argyll. We need to be promoting the benefits of electric cars and making them preferable to petrol or diesel cars.We can easily bring food production and consumption closer together by shopping and eating more locally and more naturally. Farming in Argyll is generally quite low impact, but does not have the capacity to feed everyone in the area, meaning that we have to buy in meat which is less sustainably farmed to make up the dference. If everyone ate only the meat that is produced locally, we could dramatically reduce the emissions caused from the transport of imported meat, as well as supporting our local market and ensuring that it remains natural and sustainable. Reducing food waste is also an easy behavioural change.Acting on climate change is all about thinking of others. Across the globe, the people who see the most adverse effects of climate change so far are those who are already marginalised and vulnerable.Kindness and common decency indicate that we must act with the needs of these people in mind, with the knowledge thatwe do not act, ‘these people’ will soon become us and our children.One thing that I think would make a huge dference would bewe all took #our whole selves# to work with us.Whatworld leaders were constantly thinking: #what would my children say about my role in this decision # This kind of moral thinking would make a huge dference in the future of industry and politics, and the more we educate the next generation, the more influence they will have on their parents.Everyone can make changes such as cutting down on their meat and dairy consumption, shopping locally, re-using plastic containers, recycling, composting, reducing food waste, buying fewer new things, using a renewable energy supplier, and cutting down or cutting out air travel.At the Paris Agreement in ,  nations decided to take measures to limit the global temperature increase to . degrees above pre-industrial levels. Our current behaviour will not allow for this.A rise of  degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels will mean that large areas of land around the equator will be uninhabitable, resulting in huge numbers of refugees fleeing for their survival. Sea level rise caused by the rapid melting of the ice caps will mean that small island states such as Kiribati and Tuvalu will be submerged. The combination of the loss of arable land and ocean acidication due to temperature increase will mean global food shortages, such that we have never seen before.The rich will still be able to buy food, but those who are already marginalised and vulnerable will find it increasingly dficult to access basic amenities like food and clean water, further stretching the inequality gap.It’s not too late to make changes, but it soon will be.We all need to have climate change in the forefront of our minds when making any kind of decision, be it personal or business. It is an omnipresent issue and every decision, however big or small, will have an effect."},{"url":null,"title":"science matters are aircraft vapour trails harmful","story":"Dorothy H CrawfordUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAlthough much reduced by the Coronavirus pandemic, everyone has seen the vapour trails produced by high-flying aircraft as they streak across the sky. But what are they  and are they harmful Officially called contrails , these ephemeral, cloud-like structures are primarily made of ice crystals. They form at altitudes over , metres from water vapour in the aircraft’s engine exhaust as it freezes almost instantaneously at temperatures below minus  degrees celsius. There are, however, plenty of other volatiles and solid components in engine exhaust, including soot particles that often act as a nucleus around which the ice crystals form.Official figures show that air traffic contributes around five per cent of greenhouse gases. Yet these estimates only account for CO emissions. They do not include the effect of contrails, which can persist for hours and even expand into cirrus clouds several miles wide. These clouds, which are most abundant over North America and Europe, trap heat within Earth’s atmosphere, so do they improve our climate or contribute to global warming Air traffic has been steadily increasing year-on-year, so, assuming the coronavirus effect is a temporary one, estimates suggest that the distance flown by passengers will double every  years, and that air traffic will quadruple by . Therefore, it is imperative to determine how the increase in clouds created by contrails might affect us.In a recent study*, scientists used a climate model to analyse the future impact of contrails on climate change, taking into account their predicted increase balanced against any likely changes in engine soot emissions.The results show a three-fold increase in contrail cirrus coverage by , despite a  per cent reduction in soot emissions due to improved fuel and engine efficiency. These predictions cover all major air traffic routes and are mostly due to increased air traffic volume, although a sht to flying at higher altitudes also contributes. The area with the greatest increase will be Eastern Asia, where the largest rise in air traffic is expected.This previously unaccounted for, non-CO, climate impact of air traffic is now reckoned to have a more damaging effect on climate change than all the CO emitted from aircraft engines.*Atmos.

It must also be the right size, too.HEADLIGHTS AND INDICATORSHeadlights and indicators are crucial to remaining safe on the road, which is why theyre a key part of the MOT test. Ensure theyre all working, and dont forget to test the hazard lights too!BRAKE LIGHTSIf you want to let people know that youre slowing down, then brake lights are a key - and legal - must.

Seat belts should be checked over properly too pull them in and out to check theyre operating correctly and give them a sharp tug as well to make sure that they react as they should doa crash were to occur.HORNWhile youre inside the car, test out the horn and make sure it works - this is something that testers will check straight away.SCREENWASHThe majority of the checks on this list are easy to work out, but checking the screenwash is something that many people forget to do. An MOT centre can fail a cartheres not enough screenwash in the bottle ndash so its crucial that you check to see its filled to the proper level.WINDSCREENAnd while were on the subject of being able to see out of a car properly, its a good time to check over the windscreen. Any damage larger than mm will result in a fail, so look out for any stone chips or cracks.WINDSCREEN WIPERSWhile youre checking over the windscreen, give the wipers a thorough look too. They should be able to effectively clear the screen, leaving no streaks or making a rubbing noise. If thats the case, replace them ndash its a two-minute job on the vast majority of cars.ENGINE FLUIDS AND LEVELSIts best to make sure your car has plenty of fuel in the tank before you put it into its MOT, and its possible that you could be turned away from the test centreit doesnt have enough petrol or diesel.

People called him the Porridge Maker.His most treasured possession was his cooking pot. It was large and heavy and he would carry it on his back with the help of straps he had made. He tied the lid tightly and all his other possessions would be stored in the pot. It became a kind of rucksack as he travelled.He would walk for miles, humming to himself, singing and sometimes playing his penny whistle. Then he would choose a place to settle for the night, and unpack his pot, and start cooking. He would make an evening broth from whatever he had managed to acquire during his dayrsquos travel. Then under the canopy of the stars, or under the boughs of a treeit was raining, he would wrap himself up in the thick blanket that he used during the day as a kind of jacket.Every morning he would make porridge, and always a larger amount than he would need himself. This was the time when people would enquire as to his purpose and origins. Often it was the small children of the village whose curiosity would make them assemble round him and ask questions. Sometimes they would be shooed away by their parents, but often the older members of the community who had more time would engage him in conversation, and then sit with him.The Porridge Maker had tales and riddles, news from far-flung lands and memories of past deeds and events which made his company fascinating for old and young alike. Soon it became apparent why he would make more porridge than he needed: it was to share. He would share it from his one bowl, which he called his Porridge Quaich. It would be passed round in an almost religious ceremony.But to have a taste of his delicious porridge, a price had to be paid. A story or riddle must be told, a memory shared or some wisdom imparted. The Porridge Maker would listen carefully to everything said. This was one way he gained his vast knowledge of the world and of its stories.The other was, of course, in his travels. As he walked he would observe everything: the way the clouds formed, the song of the birds, the landscape and its curiosities, the way people behaved everything. Then he would just be, and allow his thoughts and observations to mingle. This was how new tales and riddles formed in his imagination.And so as he cooked his evening meal, he would tell stories to himself and whisper his riddles, and he would look forward to sharing them with whoever might come his way and sit by his fire.Then one day, someone recognised him.The Porridge Maker had settled himself away from the road by the River Tyne, downstream from Haddington. He had made a small fire and was cooking a trout he had secretly caught when an old man of similar age walked by, stopped, stared at him, and then made his way towards him.The Porridge Maker thought he was now in trouble. But the old man wasnrsquot interested in the fish. He studied the Porridge Makerrsquos features carefully, then he nodded with a grin.ldquoAye, sae it is ye! said the man with an accusing tone.ldquoAye, fir sure I am maist certainly me! replied the Porridge Maker.ldquoYe cannae bamboozle me, said the stranger with a triumphant mocking laughter, ldquoI thocht I kent ye by the way ye wear yer bonnet and by yer stooped shudder, but noo that Irsquove seen yer face I ken fir sure!ldquoAnd  asked the Porridge Maker, seemingly unfazed by this sudden attempt to unmask his identity.The stranger sat himself down and looked the Porridge Maker in the eye.ldquoI cannae mind yer exact name, he said, ldquobut I ken ye were a Jacobite.ldquoThose days are lang past noo, said the Porridge Maker, still keeping his calm.ldquoAye, they are, thankfully. And they hanged many orsquo the likes orsquo ye.ldquoThat they did, replied the Porridge Maker.ldquoYer a MacGregor, said the old man, ldquoI mind that, and ye hud blood oan yer haunds ater Prestonpans.The Porridge Maker said nothing. He just stared into his fire.ldquoYe sliced a manrsquos heid in twa by the wall.Suddenly the Porridge Maker looked up. ldquoHowrsquod ye ken that  he asked, now startled.ldquoBecause I wis there!The Porridge Maker now looked the man in the eye.The old man continued: ldquoYe were goanie dae the same tae me. I hud nae weapon sae I punched ye.ldquoAye, said the Porridge Maker, ldquoI remember that weel enough, revealing the gap in his teeth that was the result.The old man laughed.ldquoThat punch saved ma le, said the old man, ldquofir it gied me time tae run as ye stood like a stunned rabbit. But I saw ye ater, greetin like a bairn.The Porridge Maker was silent but pursed his lips and nodded.ldquoYe cudnae thole it cud ye  said the man accusingly.ldquoI wis a lad, and arsquo fired up with rage, said the Porridge Maker. ldquoHe wisnae the only one that day I killt. But I vowed he wud be the last Irsquod kill tae decorate anotherrsquos pride. He hud cried fir mercy sayin he had bairns, but I didnae understand his words till after Irsquod cut him.The old man laughed. ldquoSae much fir the great warrior race! Ye deserted after the battle, didnrsquot ye  Ye ran awa like a coward and cudnae gang hame. If the Redcoats hadnae caught ye, yer ain family wud huv disowned ye fir the coward that ye are!ldquoI did go hame after, but I found ma hoose burnt and ma we and bairns slain. Sae I hud nae family left after that time, said the Porridge Maker with a breaking voice.The old man bowed his head. ldquoAye, it wis a sair time richt enough. But the wages orsquo rebellion are unforgiving.ldquoDae ye ken the name orsquo the lad that I killt by ye  asked the Porridge Maker hopefully.The man was surprised by the question, and looked at the ground as he thought.ldquoWull I think, aye, it wis Wull. I mind he wis really feart, poor lad, he carsquod fir his mither as he died.The Porridge Maker lowered his head, reliving that moment he had tried so often to forget.Neither men had yet exchanged their names.ldquoYou hungry  asked the Porridge Maker, ldquofor ye can share whit I have ye huv earned it by sharing yer memory wi me.And so two men, who once had tried to kill each other, now shared a meal.ldquoWull, the Porridge Maker whispered as he ate.He finally had a name for the young lad hersquod slain all those years ago in  at Prestonpans.The deepest wounds of war are often those unseen, and the stories left out by military historians are the stories of lives traumatised and changed forever.Sadly, whatrsquos left of the Prestonpans battlefield site is now under threat by proposed new developments."},{"url":null,"title":"column-heyday-open-air-pools","story":"Open-air pool lidos in England are already open.If we were back in our former holiday heyday, we could offer a choice of three seaside lidos.Swimming lsquopondsrsquo at Port Seton, Dunbar and North Berwick once buzzed with summer sociability in the sun.For families, they offered entertainment, like galas, ing displays, water polo matches and midnight bathing.A fortnightrsquos lsquobucket-and-spadersquo seaside holiday drove the popularity of lidos between the wars.

impact of lockdown in a rural area such as ours cannot be underestimated and the long-term effects on our young people.The packs have recycled pens, notebooks, highlighters, treats and activity books,

An MOT test will check the general condition of a tyre as well as the amount of tread it has, so its important to give them a thorough looking over. Make sure theyre inflated to the correct pressure too.The legal minimum tyre tread depth in the UK is .mm throughout a continuous band in the middle of the tyre. Tread gauges are the best way to check the depth, but you can use a p piece too - put the coin into a groove and,the outer rim of the p piece is obscured the tyre has enough tread. If you can see the outer rim, its definitely time for some new rubber.NUMBER PLATEIt can be easy to forget to check the number plate, but its an area which is checked during the test. Ensure its the right colour and that its fully legible too. It must also be the right size, too.HEADLIGHTS AND INDICATORSHeadlights and indicators are crucial to remaining safe on the road, which is why theyre a key part of the MOT test. Ensure theyre all working, and dont forget to test the hazard lights too!BRAKE LIGHTSIf you want to let people know that youre slowing down, then brake lights are a key - and legal - must. One of the easiest ways to check them over is to reverse up to a reflective surface - such as a window or shiny garage door - then press the brake pedal and check in the rear-view mirror to ensure theyre working.SEATS AND SEAT BELTSFront seats should have a good range of motion, so slide them forward and back to make sure everything is moving freely and easily. Seat belts should be checked over properly too pull them in and out to check theyre operating correctly and give them a sharp tug as well to make sure that they react as they should doa crash were to occur.HORNWhile youre inside the car, test out the horn and make sure it works - this is something that testers will check straight away.SCREENWASHThe majority of the checks on this list are easy to work out, but checking the screenwash is something that many people forget to do. An MOT centre can fail a cartheres not enough screenwash in the bottle ndash so its crucial that you check to see its filled to the proper level.WINDSCREENAnd while were on the subject of being able to see out of a car properly, its a good time to check over the windscreen. Any damage larger than mm will result in a fail, so look out for any stone chips or cracks.WINDSCREEN WIPERSWhile youre checking over the windscreen, give the wipers a thorough look too. They should be able to effectively clear the screen, leaving no streaks or making a rubbing noise. If thats the case, replace them ndash its a two-minute job on the vast majority of cars.ENGINE FLUIDS AND LEVELSIts best to make sure your car has plenty of fuel in the tank before you put it into its MOT, and its possible that you could be turned away from the test centreit doesnt have enough petrol or diesel.

Irsquom also ready to accept some fundamental political realities.Letrsquos face it, wersquore all just guinea pigs now, part of a radical public health experiment the likes of which has never been attempted before. This experiment is reaching its most dficult phase yet, the bit where the Government has to somehow let people start doing normal things ndash like going back to work and spending money to keep the economy going ndash while simultaneously reminding us that we wersquore not out of the woods yet. They have to encourage people to go out, while keeping them scared.Many ndash including me ndash have criticised politicians for their missteps and mixed messages over the last few months. But I also recognise a number of basic truths that itrsquos better to get onersquos head around sooner rather than later, regardless of party politics.The first is that until coronavirus has been completely eradicated around the world, risk is going to play a part in our lives for the foreseeable future. The second is closely related: the state cannot tell us exactly how to manage this risk in every single circumstance. We may get health advice and government guidance, but ultimately we have to navigate this new, more precarious world on our own.How we do this, and, crucially, how we feel about doing it, depends on many dferent things, of course, not least our age and underlying health, our financial situation and, to a signicant extent, our personality.I know there are some who believe that through lting lockdown restrictions politicians in Westminster and Holyrood are very deliberately handing over responsibility ndash and thus blame ndash to the public for what comes next. And there may be some truth to this. But come on, letrsquos get real.Accusations of ldquomaking it up as they go along are thrown around asthis was an insult rather than simply a fact describing the predicament governments everywhere find themselves in. How could it be otherwise given the extraordinary events of the last six months  And whatrsquos the alternative to us being public health guinea pigs  Staying at home forever Community levels of the virus in Scotland are now low and falling. Our hospitals lie empty. We have a test and trace system in place to ndash hopefully ndash crack down on infections. Meanwhile, wellbeing continues to suffer under the restrictions and hundreds of thousands of jobs hang in the balance. All of these things mean we can and should lt the lockdown. And lting restrictions means the vast majority of folkmust decide for themselves what level of risk they are comfortable contending with, taking into consideration how it might affect their family and community as well as their own personal circumstances.We can help ourselves along the way. Firstly by staying up to date ndash through trusted, legitimate scientic and public information sources ndash about how the virus is transmitted and the best ways to stay safe.We can also resist the temptation to judge others for their decisions. Frankly, Irsquom sick of the army of armchair virologists spouting their culture war vitriol on social media. On one side you have those who seem to relish the lockdown, the class swots who shout too loudly about how they follow every part of the guidanceand seem to revel in the idea of a second wave. On the other side, you have the virus deniers. Both groups peddle fear and misinformation, whether that is their intention or not.At the end of the day none of us, not even the scientists, know whether and when there will be another wave of the virus. Uncertainty permeates through every part of our lives now, and we must find ways to live with and even embrace thiswe are to make it through the tough months ahead.

Located off Scotlandrsquos east coast, the lighthouse sits atop a partially submerged reef and the stone tower is the worldrsquos oldest surviving sea washed lighthouse. Even more impressive than that, the lighthouse has not required a single repair or alteration to the stonework or design since the day it was built nearly two centuries ago. Regarded as one of the most outstanding engineering achievements of the th century, this lighthouse is definitely one to visit on your post-lockdown staycation.Inchcape, ArbroathCALEDONIAN CANALThe Caledonian Canal was masterminded by great Scottish engineer Thomas Telford and is considered to be one of the greatest waterways in the world. The canal stretches just over  miles from Inverness to Corpachand slices through theof the majestic Great Glen surrounded by some of the most breathtaking scenery in the Highlands. Interestingly only one third of the loch is man made, the rest is formed by ious lochs.FALKIRK WHEELConnecting the Forth  Clyde Canal and the Union Canal in central Scotland, this rotating boatlt is one of Scotlandrsquos better known attractions and is the only construction of its kind in the world. At one time the canals were essential for transportation, today the Falkirk Wheel stands as an iconic Scottish landmark and a reminder of the historical importance of Scotlandrsquos waterways. Cimb onto a boat and soar gracefully m in the air before smoothly landing on the Union Canal where visitors can stop by the recently revamped visitor centre to learn about the workings of the wheel ndash including interesting facts such as: it only takes the power of about eight toasters for the wheel to complete a full rotation.Lime Road, Falkirk, FK RSTHE KELPIESThe Kelpies, the largest pair of equine sculptures in the world, tower  feet above the Forth  Clyde Canal near Falkirk.

Malcolm MacCormick, operations manager at the trust, welcomed the new money, which has been made available through the Scottish Governmentrsquos Bioersity Challenge Fund.However, he also warned that the strategy for tackling invasive plants was far too fragmented.ldquoTherersquos no consistent approach across Scotland by councils or national government, he said.ldquoSome councils are very good, others not so good. There needs to be a national policy and consistency across Scotland in terms of how we deal with this.MacCormick said a wide range of work would be carried out thanks to funding given to the trustrsquos Endrick Legacy Project.ldquoThis year wersquove been seeing the American mink again so we will be putting out traps, he said.ldquoWersquoll be killing them, and while this may sound extreme they should not be here. They cause havoc to fish le, bird le ndash they decimate native species such as the water vole. Wersquoll never eradicate them but we will be working to keep them in check.ldquoIn terms of the American signal crayfish, yoursquore talking about an issue of biosecurity. So anglers might go walking along or in the Clyde and spawn attaches to them, then they go to somewhere like Loch Lomond, the spawn detach and the crayfish are able to spread. So people need to be aware of the need to disinfect their kit, for example.ldquoWe havenrsquot had reports of crayfish in the Endrick but part of the Endrick Legacy Project will be looking to seewe have any here in the Endrick catchment.MacCormick said clearing invasive plants was not just about protecting native flora.ldquoIt means we will have a safer riverside ndash everyone benefits, he added. ldquoOne of the effects a species such as Japanese knotweed and giant hogweed is that in winter, when theplant dies back, the roots are exposed, increasing the risk of erosion of the riverbank.ldquoThis in turn increases water width and reduces depth, which is really bad for the fish you find in the Endrick Water, such as salmonids. Basically, in a warm summer, your fish come under extreme pressure due to to a lack of water cover.Scottish Natural Heritage said protecting bioersity would be critically important.ldquoAs lockdown conditions lt, green recovery projects like the Bioersity Challenge Fund put nature, and nature-based solutions, at the heart of rebuilding our economy, said chief executive Francesca Osowska.ldquoBut itrsquos not just about conservation ndash enriching our nature is also part of the solution to the climate emergency too.ldquoPeople know that climate change is a big issue but not as many know that bioersity loss is also a global and generational threat to human wellbeing.ldquoNature is at the heart of what we do, and we will continue to deliver the transformational change needed to bring a nature-rich, sustainable and more economically secure future for Scotland.A spokeswoman for the Scottish Government said it was taking the control of invasive non-native species ldquoextremely seriously.She added: ldquoThe Scottish Bioersity Strategy provides a strategic focus, setting out the major steps we need to take in order to halt the loss of bioersity and improve the state of nature in Scotland. This strategy includes priorities on preventing the release and spread of non-native species, particularly in areas where they can cause damage to native species and habitats and to economic interests.ldquoWe are also focused on ensuring there is a rapid response to new populations of non-native species before they become established and to apply effective control and eradication measures where needed."},{"url":null,"title":"opinion-mark-smith-need-alternative-names-nationalist-unionist-suggestions-please","story":"The answer, Irsquom afraid, is complicated, and itrsquos complicated because the people who say ldquowhy do you keep banging on about nationalists and unionists have a point: the terms arenrsquot all that helpful, but theyrsquore not entirely useless either. The word ldquonationalist correctly describes some of the independence movement and the word ldquounionist does the same for people who want to stay in the UK. The terms are accurate to an extent ndash just not accurate enough.The precise problem with the words was identied by a reader who emailed me last week. ldquoNationalism has negative connotations, he said, ldquofor example xenophobia, and can be, and is often, used as a term of abuse. To want self-government does not necessarily make you a nationalist in this or any other sense hellip equally, it you want to retain the status quo then that is fine ndash but lsquounionismrsquo can now easily be tarred with Union Jack waving sectarian thuggery.I agree with the gist of what he says there. I also agree with his view that the continuing use of the terms unionist and nationalist could contribute to increasing hysteria and prevent people on all sides coming to terms with whatever political changes are in our future. Until , it would never have crossed my mind to call myself a unionist, but one by one we were ided into unionist and nationalist, yes and no, and the problem, as you know, is that once yoursquove stuck labels on to things, theyrsquore pretty hard to peel off.To make matters worse, the word ldquonationalist also applies to some on the No side and has been used that way by some supporters of independence, as in ldquoBritish nationalist or ldquoBrit Nat. The problem with that approach, though, is the same as the problem with ldquoScottish nationalist: there are some on the No side who love the Union Jack as much as some on the Yes side love the saltire, and Northern Irish unionism, football, and religion also play their part, but itrsquos only a part. To label someone who wants to remain in the UK a ldquoBrit Nat is in most cases a grotesque distortion.The fact that ldquoBrit Nathas gained some traction anyway is itself a reflection of the central problem: British nationalism is a slur because ldquonational, ldquonationalism or ldquonat have negative connotations. Nicola Sturgeon herself acknowledged this in  when she said that,she could turn back the clock and choose her partyrsquos name again, she wouldnrsquot choose the name it has now: she knows the N of ldquonational is reductive and negative, but there it is anyway, nestling between the S and the P.The question is: are there any realistic alternatives and,so, could they catch on  The reader I spoke to last week suggested the phrases ldquothose who want self-government and ldquothose who want to retain the union, or ldquoself-government supporters and ldquounion supporters. He said using such phrases instead of nationalist and unionist would moderate the debate and stop us becoming further polarised.But would they really  As a colleague pointed out to me, the first problem with ldquothose who want self-government and ldquothose who want to retain the union is that they are really hard to fit into a headline. Secondly, therersquos a dodgy implication in the words ldquothose who want self-government that those on the No side do not want self-government in fact, they want self-government in a dferent form. And thirdly, ldquoretain the union suggests unionists want to keep things as they are, whereas, in fact, unionism covers everything from unitarists to federalists who want further reform and change.You can see the problem, canrsquot you  Wersquove got to the point now where all the words that have been used in the debate ndash union, independence, nationalism, even Yes and No ndash have been wielded as an insult at some point which means that trying a new, less controversial combination runs into trouble pretty quickly. The words and phrases we favour also reflect, possibly unconsciously, a desire to make our side look good and the other side less good our words are loaded with our preferences and prejudices.Having said that, I would still like to propose a couple of alternatives. For example, instead of ldquonationalist, how about ldquosecessionist  I did wonder about ldquoseparatist for a while, but I guess the argument there is that the SNP wants self-government whereas separatist suggests something more drastic. Secessionist is also not entirely free of baggage ndash some will think of the American Civil War ndash but as an option, itrsquos not at all bad is it As for ldquounionist, I agree with the former Scottish secretary Michael Moore who said the word serves no purpose other than for those who wish to see no further devolutionand those who favour independence and use it in the pejorative. So how about ldquodevolutionist instead  That was the preferred option of the former Welsh first minister Rhodri Morgan, who said he was neither nationalist nor unionist but a passionate devolutionist who believed the constitution was healthier for having devolution since .I realise both terms ndash secessionist and devolutionist ndash are not perfect devolutionist, in particular, doesnrsquot reflect the fact there are some on the No side, as Michael Moore pointed out, who donrsquot like devolution at all. Irsquom also unsure how Yes supporters feel about the word secessionist. Theyrsquoll probably tell me.And anyway, maybe your response to all of this is: why not stick to ldquoYes supporter and ldquoNo supporter  But even ldquoyes and ldquono are problematic ndash indeed, the SNPrsquos use of ldquoyes probably gave it an unfair advantage in  and still does. Itrsquos also a demonstration of how tricky and touchy this area of politics has become.

Mr W. C. Howard, manager of Argo’s, suggested it at the first meeting of the Stromness and West Mainland Chamber of Commerce, in late June .The best time for it was the third week in July, to coincide with the Kirkwall monthly holiday and the Stromness Regatta, so it was opened by Provost George Robertson on July .Other than during the war, Stromness has always had to work hard to attract business. Provost Robertson said in his opening speech that the aim was “to keep Stromness very definitely on the shopping map” and he told an old Stromness story: “Said a business man to his neighbour, ‘How’s business the day, William ’ ‘Oh,’ replied he, ‘canna compleen, canna compleen – selt a Christian Herald, changed a penny and shawn a man whar the auld kirk is.#”The week was a resounding success. All the shops decorated their windows and offered prizes and discounts. About  flags filled the street, as everyone hung out what they could find. Merriman’s electrical shop, then half-way up Porteous Brae, hooked up loudspeakers to provide music for the passers-by.Even at such short notice, Stromness managed to get the “showies” to ert to the town. There was an amusement arcade in the Transit Shed, at the top of the North Pier, and the side-shows at the Market Green even included chairoplanes.The mystery bus tour was on Tuesday. Provost Robertson had suggested that the tour might take its passengers to “parts of the mainland you have never seen since you were last carted there to a Sunday School picnic ,  or  years ago”. He urged his audience to book but, of course, this didn’t happen and only one bus was laid on. Another five had to be hurriedly brought from Wishart’s Garage.On Wednesday there were sporting competitions at Ness, which culminated in a five-a-side hockey tournament. The men’s final, won by Dounby, was described in the Orkney Herald as being played “with a speed reminiscent of ice-hockey and an enthusiasm to win that might have been more appropriate on the battlefield”.The week also held the Stromness Regatta, a Swimming Gala, a Football Tournament, the County Sheepdog Trials and a Bring and Buy Sale in the North Kirk that raised £.The week ended, as it always has, with a fancy-dress parade. The -yard long procession was led by the Kirkwall City Pipe Band and followed by hundreds of excited spectators.  spectators lined the Market Green for the judging and presentation of prizes.In , the main attraction was the Wick Girls Pipe Band but there was plenty of home- grown entertainment. Nannie Gowans organised a concert by the youth of the town in the Town Hall. When her brother Johnnie was appointed Shopping Week organiser a few years later she ably assisted him. They are still remembered in Stromness for developing a bigger programme of events and bringing in big attractions, such as tightrope walkers, motorcycle display teams and the Globe of Death.There had not been enough time to organise the suggested art exhibition for the first Shopping Week but it was there in , organised by Stanley Cursiter, in the building now occupied by the Ell  Co Café.The Swimming Gala in the harbour included a water-polo match, “…in which it was dficult to know who was playing who” and a display of water-skiing but the big event was the March of Time cavalcade organised by the Young Farmers at the Market Green, showing how farming had developed over the centuries.“First of all came cultivation, beginning with the man with the spade and pick… We saw the genuine old wooden plough of our great-grandfathers…. The lovely and lovable Clydesdales drawing the long-boarded plough and the  tractor carrying its two-furrow at the tail and jogging along with a jaunty air.Sowing, harvesting, threshing and the farmhouse kitchen went through similar progressions, all with a commentary by JGS Flett from Harray. The final scene was the farmer in his feather bed “where he rests amid all possible blessings of State and personal luxury and indulgence.”The week ended with the parade, open air dancing and the first Shopping Week fireworks: a -minute display from the Inner Holm.Patricia Long is a tourist guide based in Stenness with a particular interest in social history.

The public are being encouraged to protect public health and our precious environment.The new Scottish Outdoor Access Code advice includes reminders to:Francesca Osowska, chief executive of Scottish Natural Heritage, said: “We very much want this love affair with Scotland’s great outdoors and nature to continue. But let’s not spoil it for others. We need be kind to nature and respectful to each other by clearing up after ourselves and taking all of our litter home with us. The scenes of abandoned campsites, burned out trees, human waste, as well as litter, are totally unacceptable and a blight on Scotland’s reputation.”Around half of the people surveyed said that they expect to take more visits to the outdoors after lockdown than before the crisis. It is also expected that many will replace cancelled trips abroad with holidays in Scotland this year, so you may arrive somewhere to find it busier than expected. The advice from Scottish Government is to have a back-up plan, andthis happens to you, move on and find somewhere quieter and safer.All of the latest COVID- guidance can be found on the Scottish Outdoor Access Code website. The website includes information about our rights and responsibilities when outdoors, as well as specic guides for a range of activities, from air and water sports, to hillwalking and wild camping.Francesca added: “If we all follow Scottish Government advice and the Scottish Outdoor Access code, we will be doing our bit to ensure that Scotland’s outdoors remains beautul and that COVID- restrictions can continue to be relaxed.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This will require a signicant field force and face-to-face engagement in an effort to support digital participation, engage with the public and raise awareness of census across the population.“The census is a major logistical operation and the twelve months running up to a census are vital in planning and testing the effectiveness and security of systems and processes.

If they do not apply for a registration or stop activities, SEPA will take enforcement action which could see them subjected to fines or criminal prosecution.There is also an important role for the public, with a warning that the use of unlicensed waste collectors could result in waste contributing to fly-tipping and other illegal activity.“Don’t engage the services of people who are not authorised,” Ms Shearer explained.“Remember, services that sound too good to be true often are, and could lead to your waste being illegally fly-tipped or disposed of by other illegitimate means.“Anyone offering to take your waste away should be able to provide a waste carrier registration number and tell you the named facility they will take the waste to –they can’t provide this information, don’t allow them to take your waste.“Now more than ever, Scots are recognising the importance of local services like recycling and the part we all play in correctly managing our waste. You have the responsibility to take care of your waste andwe trace it back to you we can take enforcement action against you too. We don’t want people to be put in that situation so make sure that anyone who takes your waste for disposal is properly accredited.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

We want to help them keep it up.“These survey results and the enthusiastic response to the Make Space for Nature campaign gives us confidence that Scotland is well placed to reverse the decline in ersity of animal and plant species in Scotland. As the need for nature is ever more apparent, the way Scotland recovers from COVID- could be one important way we secure a nature rich future for generations to come.”SNH is keen to encourage and support people to develop their interest, learn more and get involved in nature.

At first the grants were to total  billion euros , but the figure was lowered to  billion euros .ldquoNever before did the EU invest in the future like this, Belgian Prime Minister Sophie Wilmes said.ldquoIt is a historic day for Europe, said French President Emmanuel Macron, who earlier reflected on some ldquoextremely tense moments during the marathon summit.Just shy of being the longest EU summit in history, the  leaders huddled back in the main room of the Europa centre and bumped elbows and made jokes before giving the package the final approval.ldquoDeal! wrote summit host Charles Michel on Twitter. vw,vw,px, px\"French President Emmanuel Macron speaks with German Chancellor Angela Merkel as the summit finished up in the early hours of Tuesday What was planned as a two-day summit scheduled to end on Saturday was forced into two extra days by deep ideological dferences among the leaders.But overall, spirits were high early Tuesday since the talks hit rock bottom Sunday night.The coronavirus has sent the EU into a tailspin, killing around , of its citizens and plunging its economy into an estimated contraction of .% this year.Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez insisted the adoption of an ambitious plan was required as the health crisis continued to threaten the continent.With Mr Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel negotiating as the closest of partners, the traditionally powerful Franco-German alliance could not get the quarrelling nations in line for long. vw,vw,px, px\"French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel towards the end of the meeting The leaders mulled a proposal from the five wealthy northern nations ndash the Netherlands, Austria, Finland, Sweden and Denmark ndash that suggested a coronavirus recovery fund with  billion euros of grants and the same amount in loans. The five nations, nicknamed ldquothe frugals, had long opposed any grants at all, while the EU executive had proposed  billion euros.The latest compromise proposal stands at  billion euros in grants.All nations agree in principle they need to band together but the five richer countries in the north want strict controls on spending. Struggling southern nations like Spain and Italy say those conditions should be kept to a minimum.The five have been pushing for labour market and pension reforms to be linked to EU handouts, and for a ldquobrake enabling EU nations to monitor and,necessary, halt projects that are being paid for by the recovery fund.copy -.

But it is a start, and for many youngsters stuck at home for months it will represent another big step towards normality.The lack of social interaction has been one of the big psychological burdens enforced by Covid-.As we continue to move through the lockdown route map, let#s hope that when sports like shinty do eventuallythey are embraced with gusto by players – and their communities – as never before.Research, commissioned by Skye Connect and carried out by Glasgow Caledonian University, revealed that in the year before Covid- visitors to Skye brought £ million to the economy, and helped support , jobs.But Professor John Lennon, Director of the Moffat Centre for Travel and Tourism and the lead author of the report, also had a warning.“Skye is highly vulnerable to the downturn in international visitors that will continue for much of  and beyond,” he said.“Restrictions on access and reduction in air connectivity will impact on visitation.“The island does benefit from direct road access which will hopefully help catalyse greater domestic visitation – which is likely to characterise visitation for the remainder of the year.”In short Skye, and by extension the wider west Highlands, needs tourists and the region’s economy would collapse without them.But as many former industrialised parts of the country would confirm – over-reliance on a single sector can also carry signicant risk.In future years this area will need alternatives.We might also need to question the type of tourism which has come to characterise the region, and ask whether all the benefits are being as widely shared as they could be.To use one obvious example, many of those heading north and west in the weeks ahead will be coming to stay in houses – perhaps rented at upwards of £ a week – that are owned by people who live hundreds of miles away.Meanwhile, small hotels, guest houses and BBs – which provide local employment – are considering closing their doors as they find the burden of Covid-related regulations simply too onerous to make their business viable for the year ahead.If, as seems likely, Covid- accelerates an existing trend for visitors to seek self catering, rather than serviced accommodation, then the question of who benefits is worth scrutiny.A chalet on the bottom of the croft, put in to supplement modest family income, means money flows into the local economy.Houses hoovered up by letting companies, or let for  weeks of the year by someone who might visit for the other two, results in money flowing out, while the availablity and affordability of housing is limited further.In the most dficult of years all those involved in the local tourist trade deserve good wishes for the weeks and months ahead.But let’s hope there are lessons to be heeded for the future.As SkyeConnect’s project manager, Alistair Danter said this week: “We need to reset and reshape tourism for the new world and encourage a more sustainable approach that provides visitors with an immersive experience while ensuring that the island and its communities see the benefits of a tourism economy.”The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until th July .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/web-banner-1.jpg","title":"litir do luchd ionnsachaidh","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine publishes the text for Ruairidh‘s “Letter to Gaelic Learners” on BBC Radio nan Gàidheal .

Bha athair, air an robh Raibeart mar ainm cuideachd, na mhaighstir-sgoile anns a’ Cheannmhor aig ceann an ear Loch Tatha. An dèidh dha sgoil athar fhàgail, chaidh Raibeart don oilthigh, an toiseach ann an Dùn Èideann, agus an uair sin ann an Cill Rìmhinn.

The Eco-Schools Programme is the world’s largest Environmental Education programme and aims to make environmental awareness and action an intrinsic part of the le and ethos of a school. Its participatory approach and combination of learning and action makes it an ideal way for schools to begin improving the environments of schools and their local communities. Eco-Schools work through a simple seven-step process resulting in the programme becoming central to the schools ethos. Schools can choose from ten eco-topics ranging from litter and waste to energy, bioersity and transport to name a few. Eco-Schools work towards achieving awards - bronze, silver and the prestigious Green Flag.The internationally recognised Green Flag is this highest award given to Eco-Schools and symbolises excellence in the field of environmental activity. Over the past two years, pupils of Buick Memorial have been working hard on many initiatives in order to address their chosen topics of Waste, Litter and Bioersity. Together with Eco Coordinators Mrs Carleton and Miss Stirling, they have produced policies on printing, recycling and litter for staff and pupils within the school to follow. Their continued commitment to regular Cash for Clobber collections enabled the school to purchase a number of new bins for the playground. Thanks to Catherine Hunter, Mid and East Antrim Education Officer, the children were able to give each class a bin for food waste, allowing the Eco Club to produce compost for their many planting activities. A highlight of the Eco-School endeavours is the annual litter-pick with Cullybackey Community Partnership and thanks must be given in particular to Margaret Murphy who is always keen to help the children in any way she can. The school is extremely grateful to Cranswick Country Foods for providing a superb wooden structure for the ‘plastic bottle greenhouse’ project and to Barry Tapster, Mid and East Antrim Recycling Officer, for his guidance. This year has been exceptionally busy, with the introduction of a termly ‘Walking Week’ which the pupils and parents have strongly supported. The Eco Club have spent a lot of time tending to the school pond area building mini-beast and frog hotels, making bird feeders and planting flowers for pollinators amongst many other tasks. None of these opportunities would have run as smoothly were it not for the unwavering input from Mr Fleckand the dedication of Ms Harkin . The positive attitude and increased awareness of environmental issues is evident within the school from Nursery through to P and this Green Flag is a welcome acknowledgement of the children’s efforts.The International Eco-Schools Programme is operated in Northern Ireland by Keep Northern Ireland Beautul and is a free to enter programme.

Sinn Fein has spent years making public statements about the need to #defend the Belfast Agreement# yet at the weekend, the Mid Ulster MP said that nationalists had been #sold a pup# and described the Belfast Agreement as #just a bluff#.Either Sinn Fein supports the Agreement or it doesn#t and Michelle O#Neill needs to clary this as a matter of urgency.Mr Aiken said that Mr Molloy#s frustration was heightened by the fact that Sinn Fein#s demand for a border poll had been rejected out of hand by all three governing parties in Dublin - Fianna Fail, Fine Gael and the Greens.He added: Given that a few weeks ago Sinn Fein was boasting of how it expected to provide the next Taoiseach, it may be that some in the party are having dficulty adjusting their expectations to meet uncomfortable new political realities.Alliance deputy leader Stephen Farry said: Sinn Fein need to clary their position on this comment from Francie Molloy.The Good Friday Agreement sets out the fundamental terms for any border poll. It doesn#t say there shall be one or specy when it should take place. This was as clear in  as it is today. All parties should work to build on the Good Friday Agreement, including developing relationships across the island of Ireland.SDLP leader Colum Eastwood described Mr Molloy#s comments as deeply worrying and said he hoped they weren#t representative mainstream Sinn Fein. If people in that party are dissatisfied with the progress that has been made, they would be better to reflect on their  years as joint head of government rather than blaming the institutions of peace, Mr Eastwood said.The only path to uniting the people of this island is through the spirit of partnership, cooperation and reconciliation that the Good Friday Agreement is built on.Delivering a new Ireland demands that we all spill our sweat to forge new enduring relationships between the people of this island and that we demonstrate to everyone that there is an equal place for them. That#s the challenge that the agreement sets for those of us who support Irish unity. It#s no bluff.The SDLP leader said his party was prepared to spill our sweat again in building relationships and setting out its vision of Irish unity. Rather than thrashing around in blame, others should join us, he added.Mr Molloy told the Belfastthat his tweet had been written out of frustration after Taoiseach Micheal Martin dismissed the idea of a border poll.The Mid Ulster MP said he believed any reticence about holding a referendum was due to fears that a majority of people would vote in favour of a united Ireland.I think that after Brexit, the governments do actually realise that it could happen, he said.My comments are down to the fact that the Irish Government are signatories to the Good Friday Agreement, yet they aren#t doing anything to implement the border poll. Both Dublin and Westminster signed up to the Good Friday Agreement, they#re both guarantors, yet Micheal Martin is dismissing the idea of asking for a referendum for Irish unity, he said.Belfast Related ContentNorthern IrelandGood Friday Agreement a bluff and hasn#t been delivered: Sinn Fein MP Molloy Irish nationalists were sold a pup when they agreed to the Good Friday Agreement, according to a Sinn Fein MP.Most ReadCoronavirus Northern Ireland: No deaths and  new Covid- cases announced as MLA U-turns on family holiday plansHow many would be willing to shell out £m on NI home  You#d be surprised...Heartbroken Co Antrim widow recalls final moments with husband who died hours after first walk at end of weeks of shieldingCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Further nine cases of Covid- NI father-of-five Keith Ross who died in road collision a #wonderful family man#,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Teams at @VaccineTrials and @OxfordVacGroup have found there were no safety concerns, and the vaccine stimulated strong immune responses: https:t.co krqRzXMhB pic SvdMhCXWZ— University of OxfordJuly , Co-author Professor Sarah Gilbert, of the University of Oxford, said: “There is still much work to be done before we can confirmour vaccine will help manage the Covid- pandemic, but these early results hold promise.“As well as continuing to test our vaccine in phase three trials, we need to learn more about the virus – for example, we still do not know how strong an immune response we need to provoke to effectively protect against Sars-CoV- infection.“If our vaccine is effective, it is a promising option as these types of vaccine can be manufactured at large scale.“A successful vaccine against Sars-CoV- could be used to prevent infection, disease and death in the whole population, with high-risk populations such as hospital workers and older adults prioritised to receive vaccination.”The current results focus on the immune response measured in the laboratory, and further testing is needed to confirm whether the vaccine effectively protects against infection.An ideal vaccine against Sars-CoV- should be effective after one or two vaccinations and work in target populations including older adults and those with other health conditions, researchers say.They add that it should confer protection for a minimum of six months, and reduce onward transmission of the virus to contacts.However, the experts warn that the current trial, published in The Lancet, is too preliminary to confirm whether the new vaccine meets these requirements.Phase two – in the UK only – and phase three trials to confirm whether it effectively protects against the virus are taking place in the UK, Brazil and South Africa.The trial included , healthy adults aged - years with no history of Covid-, and took place in five UK hospitals between April  and May .The data included in the paper covered the first  days of the trial and is ongoing.The participants either received the new vaccine , or the meningitis vaccine .Some of them –  given the vaccine, and  in the control group – were also asked to take paracetamol before and for  hours after their vaccination to help reduce vaccine-associated reactions.All volunteers gave additional blood samples and underwent clinical assessments to determinethe vaccine was safe and whether it provoked an immune response.The most commonly reported reactions were fatigue and headache, but some participants also reported pain at the injection site, muscle ache, malaise, chills, feeling feverish, and high temperature.In addition, in the  people who received the extra dose of the Covid- vaccine, side effects were less common after the second dose.The research found that the vaccine stimulates an antibody and T-cell response.Antibodies are proteins produced by the blood in response to antigens, which are harmful substances that come from outside the body, such as from viruses or bacteria.If the non-specic immune cells which respond to any invader instantly cannot tackle it, the T-cells come into play.They take two forms – helper T-cells and killer T-cells.The latter attack the virus directly.T-cell responses targeting the Sars-CoV- spike protein were markedly increased in the  participants studied, peaking  days after vaccination.This level declined slightly by day  of the trial.Researchers also found that the T-cell response did not increase with a second dose of the vaccine.Antibody responses in those given a single dose peaked by day , and remained high until the measurement at day  in the trial.This response was boosted by a second dose.Four weeks after vaccination, neutralising antibody responses against Sars-CoV- were detected in  of  participants, and in  of  participants – depending on the test – who received a single dose of the vaccine.These responses were also present in all participants who had a booster dose of the vaccine.The authors note a number of limitations to their study, saying more research is needed to confirm their findings in dferent groups of people – including older age groups, those with other health conditions, and in ethnically and geographically erse populations.In the current trial, % of participants were white and the average age of participants was  years.PAMost ReadCoronavirus Northern Ireland: No deaths and  new Covid- cases announced as MLA U-turns on family holiday plansHow many would be willing to shell out £m on NI home  You#d be surprised...Heartbroken Co Antrim widow recalls final moments with husband who died hours after first walk at end of weeks of shieldingCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Further nine cases of Covid- NI father-of-five Keith Ross who died in road collision a #wonderful family man#,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The competition encouraged children to record a -day streak of activity to be entered into a draw for a pound Spar voucher alongside the main event.

Two companies based in the city have told the Derry News that the primary cause for concern amongst customers is the virus but also the impact of Brexit. Irvine Moving Solutions has been operational for over  years and specialises in international removals. They have relocated schools and colleges, moved homes all over Europe and government employees to European Parliament in Brussels, London, Dublin and Belfast. Director, Kevin Irvine, said there has been a  per cent rise in people leaving England, particularly the south in areas like London. googletag.cmd.push On average ten families a week are ing from England, he added. They’ve moved people back to Derry, Donegal, Belfast, as well as Limerick, Cork, Galway and Dublin. Reasons are mixed but ‘most’ are saying it’s because of the Coronavirus pandemic and the high death rate with people feeling that the British government mishandled the crisis. “People believe it would be better tohome. Other customers are from England who are moving to Donegal because they believe it’s a better way of le. “We’ve also done a couple of big moves from America, places like Texas and Minnesota, and Canada. googletag.cmd.push There are retirees moving back to Donegal. They made the decision around March because they didn’t like the way the US was dealing with it too. “Everybody is coming out with the same answer.” He continued: “Some of these people have been away for over  years. “They’re moving from properties worth half a million pounds or a million pounds and purchasing one for pound, here. “That is also kickstarting the housing market too with cash buyers coming back.” Middle aged couples are relocating, he said, because of the dference in terms of cost of living and childcare. HIGH DEMAND Director and Operations Manager at Foyle International Removals and Storage Ltd, Bernard McGowan echoed those assertions. The Campsie based company is a well-known local and International mover and storer. He said the removal market between the UK and Ireland has been ‘very busy’ since the UK housing market was reopened again in early June. Mr McGowan commented: “We have experienced a high demand for our service. “We offer an already weekly UK London service and every customer we’ve spoken to recently says they are worried about two main issues and want moved ASAP to be resettled. “The main concern is a second wave of the awful pandemic. “The other major concern of people contacting us is now that the UK has left the EU can we still move them for example a cross the border or other European destinations, the answer is yes as we have all our national and international operators licences in place to have your home, office or business moved across the Border or across Ireland UK or Europe. “We have done all we can and hope all governments in London, Dublin and Europe do all they can to support Businesses and people.” The company has sought to allay any customer concerns and assured them that staff have taken every precautionary measure, including the use of responsibly sourced PPE. Customers are either not present during the move or leave instructions or simply stay in a safe area out of the way. Vehicles are also sanitised after each move and on a weekly basis deep cleaned for customer peace of mind.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

This sweet and gentle dog was stray for quite some time and covered over  miles on his travels, carrying on even after he was hit by a car. Thankfully, he was brought to Friends of Rescue who gave him a full MOT before nursing him back to health in foster care. Now Miles is looking for a home to call his own, with a very secure garden. We were tracking Miles for over a week and there were sightings of him all over the place, said Friends of Rescue founder, Suzanna Flemming. googletag.cmd.push He was on the run and losing weight quite rapidly. He was hit by a car and still kept running. Thankfully he had no broken bones and was just a little stf and sore, but he had a lot of scarring on his body new and old. After a well deserved bubble bath he was wormed and flead and we got him into foster care and got him fattened up a little bit and neutered, chipped and vaccinated. Miles is a special dog and will need a special home. He is doing his very best in foster but he is still a very nervous man and he will need time, reassurance and most of all patience, said Ms Flemming. googletag.cmd.push Miles would benefit from another dog or dogs in the household but no young children, and this is purely down to his nervousness. And hell obviously need an extra secure garden so that he doesn’t ‘try a Miles’ again He will make an amazing family member. He is sweet, gentle and forgiving. Friends of Rescue had to close its doors due to lockdown but since lockdown has eased it has  dogs and  cats in its care. We have been very busy since the travel restrictions eased, whether this is down to people going back to work, we dont know, said Ms Flemming. The charity started as a rehoming blog around two and half years ago but one dog turned into five and it became a rehoming charity. Friends of Rescue now has six or seven foster families who look after rescued animals while they are treated at the vets and assessed for what type of family would suit them. If you would like to offer Miles a loving home or find out more about the charity you can visit the Friends of Rescue Facebook page.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Coronavirus pandemic has been tough on local businesses and news that Eason closed in Foyleside came as a blow to the city centre. There are however independent businesses who despite the current economic uncertainty are branching out and creating employment in the city. Much loved food truck and eatery Pyke ‘N’ Pommes revealed on social media that it is about to take over a new unit – at the old Primrose cafeacute on the Strand Road. googletag.cmd.push An exciting new project, BROslashN, has also been announced at recently vacated premises on Bishop Street which will house a coffee bar, barista school, restaurant and cocktail bar with locally sourced beer and spirits. Daragh McCauley is the owner of ine Hostages Coffee Company which is based at the top of Waterloo Street. He will run the new venture with business partner Connor Allen who has been manager at Harry’s Shack in Portstewart since it opened. ine Hostages started as a coffee van on the side of the road in Donegal before they opened the shop in Derry towards the end of . googletag.cmd.push “My dream was always to open a coffee shop,” Mr McCauley said. A refined menu at ine Hostages consists of grilled cheese toasties with a choice of good quality local meats and homemade ingredients as well as the best quality bread and baked goods. It was ‘slow going’ at the beginning but the pandemic came as a blow as the business was beginning to gain some traction. With a one-way system in operation they were able to successfully reopen once permission was granted. Mr McCauley believes the quality of coffee sourced from Bailies Coffee Roasters is second to none The most important ingredient is the ‘passion’  Hostages has for all of their products, he added. Anyone using Bailies products in the North West of the country will now be trained at the new Bishop Street premises. BROslashN will offer coffee and food throughout the day and sit-down meals in the evening complemented by craft beers and cocktails. They intend to support local as much as possible through suppliers and employing staff from the North West. “I’ve been working in coffee now for about four and a half years, I’m going to stay managing this shop but will work in BROslashN as well,” Mr McCauley explained. “We’re going to try and create as many jobs as we possibly can. About  people across both businesses. “The barista school will be opened upstairs on Bishop Street. “We’re hoping to open around August  and we’ll know this week whether that’s going to happen. “We’ve a lot of staff hired but are still looking for people with experience.” Mr McCauley said he feels confident opening the new business in the current climate because the people of Derry have done a good job of looking after each other and businesses have been sensible. “Derry has been really, really good so far and the way we will lay the shop out on Bishop Street it held about  people but we’ll be dropping it to  and the tables will be spaced out without losing the atmosphere. “It will be a cosy but modern shop and unless there was a complete lockdown again we’d be very confident with the way we have it laid out that it will work.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Coronavirus pandemic has been tough on local businesses and news that Eason closed in Foyleside came as a blow to the city centre. There are however independent businesses who despite the current economic uncertainty are branching out and creating employment in the city. Much loved food truck and eatery Pyke ‘N’ Pommes revealed on social media that it is about to take over a new unit – at the old Primrose cafeacute on the Strand Road. googletag.cmd.push An exciting new project, BROslashN, has also been announced at recently vacated premises on Bishop Street which will house a coffee bar, barista school, restaurant and cocktail bar with locally sourced beer and spirits. Daragh McCauley is the owner of ine Hostages Coffee Company which is based at the top of Waterloo Street. He will run the new venture with business partner Connor Allen who has been manager at Harry’s Shack in Portstewart since it opened. ine Hostages started as a coffee van on the side of the road in Donegal before they opened the shop in Derry towards the end of . googletag.cmd.push “My dream was always to open a coffee shop,” Mr McCauley said. A refined menu at ine Hostages consists of grilled cheese toasties with a choice of good quality local meats and homemade ingredients as well as the best quality bread and baked goods. It was ‘slow going’ at the beginning but the pandemic came as a blow as the business was beginning to gain some traction. With a one-way system in operation they were able to successfully reopen once permission was granted. Mr McCauley believes the quality of coffee sourced from Bailies Coffee Roasters is second to none The most important ingredient is the ‘passion’  Hostages has for all of their products, he added. Anyone using Bailies products in the North West of the country will now be trained at the new Bishop Street premises. BROslashN will offer coffee and food throughout the day and sit-down meals in the evening complemented by craft beers and cocktails. They intend to support local as much as possible through suppliers and employing staff from the North West. “I’ve been working in coffee now for about four and a half years, I’m going to stay managing this shop but will work in BROslashN as well,” Mr McCauley explained. “We’re going to try and create as many jobs as we possibly can. About  people across both businesses. “The barista school will be opened upstairs on Bishop Street. “We’re hoping to open around August  and we’ll know this week whether that’s going to happen. “We’ve a lot of staff hired but are still looking for people with experience.” Mr McCauley said he feels confident opening the new business in the current climate because the people of Derry have done a good job of looking after each other and businesses have been sensible. “Derry has been really, really good so far and the way we will lay the shop out on Bishop Street it held about  people but we’ll be dropping it to  and the tables will be spaced out without losing the atmosphere. “It will be a cosy but modern shop and unless there was a complete lockdown again we’d be very confident with the way we have it laid out that it will work.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The first threat came in the rise of out of town shopping centres. I can remember the campaigns fought against them in Derry by local city centre retailers who argued it would suck the le out of the city centre. This battle to stop planning being granted for out of town centres was largely lost and we only have to look at Crescent Link to see the impact its had on retail footfall in the city centre. Then we had the advent of online retail which began nibbling at retail sales about  years ago. googletag.cmd.push This nibble has now become a feast. Prior to Covid-, online retail was certainly taking a big chunk out of disposable income. For anyone under  purchasing online from eBay Amazon and using PayPal was as normal as going up the town. Buying clothes, electronics, games etc on your phone for younger people was the norm rather than the exception. With Covid-, however, online retail has reached into every age group. With shops closed and fear of infection particularly amongst older people the rush online has been music to the ears of companies like Amazon. For Derry city, the problem is amplied. googletag.cmd.push Derry suffers from having an already dficult retail situation. We have the highest level of welfare dependency in the North and still rank the highest in any UK deprivation statistics. We also have the highest level of unemployment in the  council areas. This in turn means less disposable income for the local population so retailers have to compete for a smaller amount of money available. Our city centre is beautul but it really needs huge investment made. Carlisle Roadhas a few vacant sites and a number of vacant shops and really could benefit from some redevelopment.  There is a plethora of charity and pound shops which provide valuable employment and services to the most vulnerable but they also tell a story about our city and its spending power.  And when you see a landmark building like the Austin’s Building boarded up and the old Poundstretchers site on Bishop Street still not developed, it really doesnt bode well. And lets not even talk about the view from the Peace Bridge into Foyle Street which shows buildings with weeds growing out the windows. I could go on, but the city centre has been on a slow decline for the last  years and the financial crisis of  has really accelerated it. If there is not urgent action taken now and led by Derry and Strabane District Council, we might not have a city centre in . So how do we reimagine our city centre   Well one thing for sure is the recent announcement by DCSDC that a shortfall in their budget might have to be met with a -year double digits rates increase is not the answer. Such a move, in my opinion, would completely kill business owners operating in the city centre. And remember having a vibrant city centre is what drives tourism. It also drives student numbers. Students and tourists will only come to Derry is it is vibrant and safe. If we allow it to die then we kill tourism. We have to be very careful of what we do in the next  years. So, what could a post Covid- Derry city centre look like  For starters, I think we definitely need more outside space offered to shops and retailers. The whole vibe seems to be al fresco which is driven mainly by the belief that its harder to catch the virus outside. It also helps solve the capacity issue for many pubs restaurants etc. Of course, in continental Europe it rains a lot less but in Holland it rains  days a year and they have a lot more outside space use than us. Ive been to Liverpoola few times and they have as much rain as us but definitely more outside space.  I just hope council dont charge rates for this space. If we want people back to work and businesses generating profits to afford rates, we shouldnt overload their rates bills. I would also seriously look at taking traffic out of the city centre and creating a huge pedestrian zone from the top of Bishop Street straight down to the River Foyle. I would also pedestrianize from the bottom of Carlisle Road right up and including the whole of the Walled City.I would allow a bike lane. Post Covid-, people will want physical distance and what better way to do it than take traffic out all together from the city centre. Data from Living Streets suggests where the pedestrian experience has been improved, footfall has increased between  and %. Bear in mind there has been a % decline in footfall on the high street across the UK between  and . In Leicester for example, shop vacancy rates were five times higher on streets with higher levels of traffic and turnover in pedestrianised areas generally outperforms non pedestrian areas . Bear in mind that a report done by Sustrans titled ‘Bike Le ’ found that % of residents living in  UK citieswere keen to see more space made available on their high streets for people socialising cycling and walking. This was before Covid- and I would guess the % in now higher. Council government really need to look at the whole business rates issue and attempt to rebalance it. Some work is already being done on this and I know the Minister for Finance Connor Murphy is looking to launch something soon. Derry, however, should look at a scheme to encourage new businesses to take up space which includes a rates free period. We need to encourage new businesses to locate into the city centre. Ebrington is another exciting addition to the solution. We can expand the city centre across into Ebrington where there is plenty of outside space. We should also utilise the Guildhall Square on a permanent basis and its a perfect link to Ebrington. We really need to imagine a new city centre with many uses. We need to also develop more markets across the city. Markets bring football and offer small producers a change to sell their products. Covid offers many opportunities as well as challenges. During lockdown we saw a huge increase in the number of people working from home and living locally. Its likely that there will be less commuting to larger towns and cities so people will be spending more time in their immediate local area. Its up to us now to design a new city centre which meets the needs of people. The new high street city centre cant only be about retail. To think this way would be to ignore the clear trends in consumer behaviour and online retail. Sustans, an organisation which has researched this widely, said in a recent report: Re-establishing the role of the high streets as a hub for social connection and reinforcing and celebrating its roots and unique character could go a long way to encourage people to stay local and spend their money where they live. I would go further than that and suggest it could also attract the visitors and students Derry needs to become the vibrant city it aspires too. We need to reimagine our city centre. We have to repurpose large buildings for new uses and also consider housing provision as well. Public spaces like the Guildhall Squareneed remodelling to make more room for meeting, eating and retail.  All of this might mean changing rules in relation to the use of public space and licensing arrangements but we really have to change before our city centre dies. In summary, the current city centre isnt thriving and hasnt for  years. Consumer behaviour, out-of-town retail, online shopping and now Covid- have each had an impact. Its now time to tear the rule book up and imagine the city centre we want for the next  years and the reality is that it will be less about retail and more about making them somewhere where people want to be. It needs to be accessible fun and an exciting development. Lets hope our council appoint the right experts and design team who can hopefully create and enhance our city centre for social and civic use.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

In a statement, they said: Testing and contact tracing is being conducted to identy people who may be potentially affected to help prevent any further spread. With lockdown restrictions being eased this type of occurrence is to be expected, which is why the Test, Trace and Protect programme is in place. At present anyone who tests positive for COVID- in Northern Ireland will be contacted by the contact tracing team to be given advice on what to do about managing symptoms and of the need to self-isolate to prevent any wider spread of the virus. googletag.cmd.push They will also be asked who they have been in contact with so that we can follow up with those iniduals to give them advice to help prevent the further spread of infection. Contact tracing is an established method to help prevent the further spread of infections such as COVID-, and we are using this approach to target potential clusters which could spark new outbreaks. Limavady councillor, James McCorkell, appealed for people not to panic, and to co-operate with the contact tracing teamthey are contacted. This highlights the fact that we are by no means over this troubling time and people must take this serious when out and about, he said. googletag.cmd.push I would ask that people dont panic - the Test Trace  Protect system is there to help identy these pockets that will inevitably flare up whilst we continue to go through this pandemic. I would appeal for people to cooperate with the Contact Tracing Team, should they be contacted, as this will help get any clusters under control on the area. Please also ensure you know the symptoms of covid- and take every precaution when out and about to social distance and follow at the guidance the Government has asked us to follow. If the team identies a potential cluster or outbreak this will be reported through the PHA’s normal outbreak management channels and the appropriate infection control advice actions carried out. PHA will continue to monitor all cases of COVID-, look for trends and linked cases and where we need to advise or inform the public of any increased risk to public health we will do so in a timely manner. We will not comment on inidual cases as this could lead to people being identied and deter others with symptoms coming forward to be tested. We would ask everyone to be mindful of this risk. This virus has the potential to make its presence felt in any district. Everyone should act on the basis that it might potentially be in their neighbourhood right now. That’s why following the public health advice on regular hand washing and maintaining a social distance of two metres remains vitally important.

Many businesses had to close for over three months as a result of coronavirus lockdown measures and are on the slow road to recovery. It is essential that they have the publicrsquos backing and support at this critical time, he said.ldquoIt is more important than ever that we support our local shops, cafes, bars and restaurants who collectively provide signicant employment, supporting many families.Cllr Andrews said local businesses and ious retail outlets ldquohave all gone the extra mile, working to implement guidelines and regulations designed to keep staff and customers safe at all times.He added: ldquoCrossgar is one particular part of the district where businesses have worked hard to ensure that people are safe, whether shopping or out for something to eat.ldquoThe village is home to a number of businesses, many of them family-owned, and it is important that we support them at this time, alongside other businesses across the district.

I would like them to get in touch.William said he has heard many reports about the disaster, including one relating to men from Portaferry who allegedly took a piano off the ship.The Georgetown Victory was a lsquoVictory Shiprsquo and was built in  at the Fortfield Shipyard at Bethlehem, Maryland, in the United States. She weighed in at , tons and was powered by two steam turbine enginesSays William: ldquoThe vessel was registered at Baltimore and when it left Fremantle for Glasgow with , Royal Navy men and marines due for demob. The crew mistook Strangford Lough for the River Clyde and the ship ran aground  yards off Killard Point, with her back breaking just forward of the bridge within a few hours of stranding.The Georgetown Victory had been converted from a cargo ship to a troopship able to transport up to , troops, with her cargo holds converted to bunk beds and hammocks stacked three high for hot bunking. In the cargo hold, mess halls and exercise areas were also added.Entering service near the end of the war, the Georgetown Victory and  other Victory troopships were given the task of transporting the troops home as part of Operation Magic Carpet. The vessel was operated by the American Export Lines.The ship departed Sydney with , troops steaming to Glasgow, stopping for water and fuel at Fremantle in Australia, Colombo in Sri Lanka and Aden in Yemen via the Suez Canal.On April , , just before midnight, the ship ran aground hard, at near top speed,  yards south of Killard Point.All of the servicemen aboard were rescued by leboats and breeches buoy to a tug started at about am.William said local people can remember some men wading ashore through heavy fuel oil from the stricken vessel to be cared for in nearby homes. The Cloughey and Newcastle leboats were also launched to help.Winter storms subsequently broke the wreck into two parts with all remaining portable gear not already taken by looters removed and the ship abandoned. The ship sections were salvaged in  and consigned to a breakerrsquos yard at Troon in Scotland.With his resplendent model now complete, William could be forgiven for sitting back on his laurels. But he has no intention of doing so.His next project will be making a model of the SS Bereby, a British merchant steamer built in  and owned by the Elder-Dempster Line.In , the vessel, which was carrying military stores and general cargo, was wrecked at Ringvad Point, near Gunnrsquos Island, while en route from Liverpool for Takoradi.Anyone who can assist William with information about the Georgetown Victory is asked to contact him on    or pop into his shop in Quay Street..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th July 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Call to be vigilant of seals  ","story":"VISITORS to Minerstown beach are being urged to tread carefully to protect seals and the arearsquos rich ecology.The appeal has been issued by Newry, Mourne and Down Council with officials particularly keen for boats and jet skis to stay away from key areas.Minerstown beach mdash popular with locals and visitors alike ndash is located within the Strangford and Lecale Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and, along with neighbouring Tyrella, is part of the Murlough Special Area of Conservation and area of special scientic interest.Noted for its honeycomb worm reefs and harbour seals, Minerstown was particularly busy over recent months with many people furloughed from work as part of sweeping coronavirus lockdown measures visiting the beach where harbour seals which are protected by law.Then animals use the rocky outcrops just offshore as so-called haul-out and pupping sites with the peak pupping season running from the end of June to mid-July.Pups wean from their mothers approximately four weeks after birth and, for this reason, council officials are asking all watercraft owners to stay away from the haul-out areas until the end of October.Council staff say that with seals very sensitive to disturbance, it is important for people to leave them alone.They say the area between the beachrsquos high and low tide marks is an important site for sand flats with boulders containing the honeycomb worm reef, a Northern Ireland priority marine feature.The worm lives in tubes constructed from small pieces of sand and shell fragment cemented together forming reefs between pebbles and boulders in the middle shore.Council officials have explained that these delicate reefs are under threat from beachgoers walking in the area and from vehicles driving on the beach.ldquoUnderstanding the impact that our actions can have and following simple advice will protect the health of the wildle at Minerstown beach and protect it for future generations, said officials.Council chairwoman Laura Devlin said people were spoilt for choice when it came to local beaches and the waterways, with Minerstown one area which has seen an increase in use during the lockdown period.ldquoUnfortunately, an increase in the use of the beach and its surrounding waters can cause some problems for the local wildle, he said.ldquoThe council is asking beach goers to help it protect these beauty spots and the associated plants and animals by being mindful of how their actions can impact on the environment.Describing Minerstown as a ldquovery special place, she said it was important for local wildle.Cllr Devlin added: ldquoWhile we want our residents and visitors to enjoy the wonderful coast that our district has to offer, we also want to protect the habitats and species that make this place so special.ldquoPlease help us to protect this area by not taking vehicles onto the beach, stay away from the seal haul-out sites, always keep dogs under control and not allow them to chase birds.

I hope it is not obeying the tune of centralising services in Belfast. The local population deserves better.The former South Down MP said that as Northern Ireland was being reopened for business following a reduction in the number of Covid cases, ldquonormal services at the Downe hospital should resume.Lady Ritchie said anything which falls short of what was previously in the hospital would ldquorepresent a lack of faith and trust.She added: ldquoIt is important to remember that the real ing of the Downe Hospital with its suite of services and consultant physicians is directly linked to the AE provision.ldquoI have told both the health trustrsquos chief executive and health minister Robin Swann that anything that falls short of that requirement will be unacceptable and present our community with an intolerable position.Last week, health officials insisted that emergency services removed from the Downe as part of sweeping changes to help tackle the coronavirus pandemic will be reinstated. In addition, officials branded claims that the service will notand be replaced with a daily minor injuries service as ldquoinaccurate and misleading.The health trust says that it hopes to be in a position to confirm a date for theof AE services to the Downpatrick hospital by the end of July and that it remains totally committed to the Downe and its staff..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/11606881.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local servicesThese adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Unionism has lost its majority in the Assembly lost its majority on Belfast City Councilat present it doesn’ta majority of the MPs from Northern Ireland key players worry that successive UK governments seem determined to bend over backwards to keep Sinn Fein anchored within the peace political process it looks like the Withdrawal Agreement will see a border in the Irish Seaand, on key issues of importance to unionism , unionists cannot rely upon a UK government to be in their corner. So, arguing that the unionist strategy can only be one of hanging in, strikes me, on first sight, as a weak argument. That said, it’s certainly a much better argument than that of Terri Jackson who, in a letter to the paper, claimed the ‘Union is safe for decades to comein the  last general election the number voting for unionist candidates was at least , more than those who voted for nationalist candidates.’ Hmm. \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...Stephen Farry’s victory in North Down at the December general election shows unionism usually suffers when Alliance does wellIn that election , votes were cast for unionist parties and candidates , against , votes for Sinn Fein and the SDLP . That’s a gap of , and .%. My hunch would be that People Before Profit and Aontú voterswould run heavily in favour of nationalism. Alliance and Greens gathered , votesand I think the general view would be that both parties are probably neutral on the Union, so shouldn’t, automatically, be included in the unionist column. Eventhose two parties were to split   in a border poll that would take the pro-Union vote to just .%. Personally, I think it would be higher, but it would be reckless, utterly reckless, for unionism to assume ‘it’ll be alright on the night’. Every vote needs to be worked for.Now, back to Jeff’s point and another question: is it possible for unionism to make progress evenit is merely ‘hanging in’ Yes, of course it is.When asked how he had come upon the theory of gravity, Newton replied, “By thinking upon it continuously.” And that’s exactly what unionism needs to do when it comes to sustaining a majority for the Union.It wasn’t very long ago when the evidence of background, upbringing, religion, school attended, what their parents did, where they lived etc would provide a reasonably accurate yardstick for identying someone with pro-Union roots and, consequently, likely to be or become a unionist voter. Yet, as can be seen in the recent sht from unionist to ‘other’it can no longer be taken for granted that someone with pro-Union roots will vote for a party which clearly identies as unionist. Why not That question can only be answered when there is very detailed analysis of what someone from a pro-Union background actually wants. Or, maybe more important, what they don’t want. The Ulster Unionist Party, for instance, has been particularly badly hit by Alliance. Why  Why would someone who used to be reasonably comfortable with the UUPchange, and vote for a party which describes itself as mostly neutral on the constitutional question  What is that voter getting from Alliance that isn’t available from the UUP   Party political unionism needs the answer to those questions or it may discover that the continuing drt to ‘others’ will rob the DUP of its lead role in the Assembly at the next election. In other words,unionistsreckon that Alliance is a safe enough choice in Assembly, Westminster and council elections then party political unionism is in for bigger blows. Fair enough, voting Alliance doesn’t mean you wouldn’t vote for the Union in a border poll but voting Alliance does mean that the likely electoral casualty is from a unionist party and that, as we have seen, can means fewer unionist MPs, MLAs and local councillors. Look at North Down last December.If there is no such thing as a freestanding definition of unionist and unionism, how can unionist leaders and strategists make convincing claims about unionism and unionist politics  In the last few days I have heard Lord Empey, Steve Aiken, Jim Allister and Sammy Wilson fire broadsides over the government’s bows about how Northern Ireland is being treated within the Withdrawal Agreement package and the specic NI Protocol. What the broadsides suggest is the leadership of political unionism is concerned which, in turn, fuels broader concerns within unionism .Unionism is a very erse community, with a huge mix of parties, fringe groups, manestations, nuances, dferences, priorities and interests. That makes it dficult to agree on central messages. It makes it even more dficult to agree on a definition of modern unionism which appeals to a softer, Alliance-leaning pro-Union base, while preserving the core myths and boundary symbols of more traditional unionism. Crucially, for an ideology which usually interprets compromise as capitulation, any attempt to soften the message tends to end badly. Jeff is probably right, though: ‘hanging in’ is maybe the only available strategy for unionism. But ‘hanging in’ should also be accompanied by a willingness to ask dficult questions of itself. By the way, I remain unpersuaded that the endgame I mentioned last week will be as long as Jeff and others hope believe it will be.\"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-drMfKT fpqScQ\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg eOOfIS\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-drMfKT fpqScQ\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg eOOfIS\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-gxMtzJ sc-dfVpRl dLpuYr\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy News you can trust since Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

I have yet to meet anyone in the Church of Ireland who is other than pusillanimous.As for the Church of England, the situation is worse still . Shane Paul O’Doherty came to us in the late s with a formidable record. A fearless explosives officer for the IRA and,I remember correctly,  years in Wormwood Scrubs,  months of which in solitary confinement.Letter to the editorTime indeed for the kind of reflection that makes a great scholar.His letter of application I can say was unique, designed to terry the average academic . He is the only student in my course on ‘Sir Gawain and the Green Knight.’ who was ever recommended to us by Wormwood Scrubs. I can confidently say that he was far and away the most opinionated student I ever taught and made a mockery of many of my seminars.The bright young ladies in that senior freshman seminar on ‘Sir Gawain and the Green Knight’ adored him, as well they might as he made le dficult for me with regular denunciations of the British Empire, not normally a feature of criticism of England’s greatest poem. They seemed to think of him as a modern iant of Sir Gawain. In a way he was. Sadly he has been denied access to the Land of the Free. I would suggest that President Trump invite him to Washington to ask for his advice on the ongoing conflict in Northern Ireland. There is nothing like experience in le to deal with a problem such as this.Unlike Mary Lou McDonald from leafy Rathgar, Dublin , who also read English I in Trinity College Dublin, Shane Paul O’Doherty knows what it is like to be in the frontline. He has tried to make peace with his victims and is at peace with himself.If we are going to achieve the peace in Ireland that we have all sought for more than a hundred years, Shane Paul O’Doherty in my opinion is more likely to achieve it than Mary Lou McDonald.I congratulate Wormwood Scrubs on the opportunity for reflection it gave Mr O’Doherty.If you want a reference for him I would be happy to oblige.Trinity College Dublin, the famous University of All-Ireland, was founded by a Protestant heretic, excommunicated by Pope Pius V in  and founder of Jesus College, Oxford in , the College of Lawrence of Arabia and Oxford’s greatest college.Dr Gerald Morgan, Fellow Trinity College Dublin——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

The luxury of an expertly made bed with perfectly-pressed sheets and a swaddling duvet. The thrill of an ensuite bathroom with fluffy white towels, dinky shampoo bottles and a shower head the size of a dinner plate. Ordering food to the room and not having to do the dishes. Not having to do anything, in fact. But in a post-lockdown world, what would staying in a hotel be like  Would it be joyless and clinical  Not worth the bother of packing one’s toothbrush To find out, my daughter Maria and I booked into Bishop’s Gate Hotel in Londonderry, a luxurious, boutique establishment within the historic city walls. Having spent the last few months together with the hell-on-earth of home-schooling and not going further than the local park for a walk, we were practically exploding with excitement as we arrived at the exquisite Grade B listed building. Before going through the revolving doors we squirted on hand-sanitiser from a large dispenser, then followed the arrows on the floor to reception, where an exceptionally friendly receptionist welcomed us from behind Perspex.Ourroom key was presented in an envelope, as was a map to the city. None of this seemed weird or impersonal, in fact it was a comfort to know these measures were in place. We were asked to book in for breakfast the following morning, rather than just turning up. Again, absolutely fine.Before taking the lt to our room, we hand-sanitised once more from a wall-mounted dispenser.A quick scan around our beautul room, decorated in muted tones with pops of orange, and it was hard to tell that anything was dferent than from before lockdown. On closer, Columbo-style inspection, I noticed the TV remote encased in a plastic covering there were no tourist leaflets, pens or stationery, menus or information booklets about the hotel - the paraphernalia you wouldnormally find in a hotel room. There was, however, a Bible in a drawer and the usual tea and coffee making facilities. In the bathroom a bottle of hand sanitiser was provided along with all the other toiletries. Before dinner in the Gown restaurant, we enjoyed a pre-dinner drink in the Wig Champagne Bar.A one-way system was in operation, with patrons going in one door and out the other. Tables were spaced apart and there was a convivial atmosphere as patrons sipped extravagant-looking cocktails. The staff were not wearing masks, but kept their distance.Drinks were ordered and served at our table, so no propping up the bar. I noticed staff thoroughly clean a table and seats with sanitiser after some customers had left.None of this spritzing, cleaning and hand-sanitising, dampened our elation: not only were we staying in a hotel, we were going to have wonderful dinner cooked by someone  served to us at our table. After months cooped up together in our home, with humble, uneventful meals, it felt joyous.The safety measures, such as the one-way route, were more reassuring than annoying and the frequent hand-sanitising became second nature. In the dining room, hygiene measures were unobtrusive, tables spaced apart, a waitress spritzing chairs and tables. We settled down, thrilled to be dining out, My daughter delighted to have a choice beyond beans on toast and beans under toast.Her squid starter was a symphony of flavours, my goat’s cheesetart, scrumptious. Our mains, cod for her, hake for me, were substantial andsublime.We rounded off with sticky toffee pudding and a visually dazzling Baked Alaska, me happy at the thought of not having to clear the table and stack the dishwasher .Next day we were planning a stomp around the city walls, so set ourselves up with good breakfasts - an omelette for me, and a pancake stack for Maria. Buffet items, such as croissants, pastries and fruit salads were inidually wrapped on a table, alongside little boxes of cereals. Other than that, the breakfast experience was normal.I noticed diners who hadn’t booked in for lunch, being asked for their names and telephone numbers - a way, I assume, for the hotel to track any customer should any guest later report Covid-. The new safety measures at Bishop’s Gate Hotel do not, in my opinion, impinge on the visitor experience, but obviously a lot of hard work has gone on, and is going on, behind the scenes to ensure customer and staff safety. Ciaran O’Neill, managing director of the hotel, said when the Executive confirmed July  as the date for the reopening of hotels in Northern Ireland, they implemented ious new measures to facilitate a safe reopening.These included the installation of hand sanitiser stations at entry points, the introduction of disinfectant “fogging” machines to sanitise guest bedrooms, a contactless payment policy where possible and reconfiguration of bar and restaurant areas.‘‘It really is like trading in a new world,’’ he said. ‘‘We have embraced the challenges and we have worked to ensure that we have a safe environment for our employees and guests, while still maintaining the Bishop’s Gate magic that we are renowned for.“Feedback from customers to date suggests that the “new” hotel experience looks very like what it was before, albeit with some face masks apparent, increased evidence of cleaning and some changes to the flow of guests through the building.“As the relationship between each brand and consumer starts by building trust, regaining customer confidence will be the first step in overcoming the crisis.

balances.\"Itrsquos ironic in some ways as when we were setting the budget for this financial year, some of our members wanted to use them and reduce the council tax levels.\"If we had done that, we would not have the buffer we have now.\"Itrsquos fortuitous that at that time I resisted, because I didnrsquot want to be in a position where we would not have finances available to respond to an emergency.\"I didnrsquot know that the coronavirus was going to hit us, but clearly it is having an effect.\"Wersquore not collecting business rates because wersquove given lots of businesses a payment holiday and wersquove also issued a considerable number of grants to businesses.\"We have paid out more than pound million in grants to businesses, which we will get back from Welsh Government, but therersquos no guarantee that all businesses will survive this.\"Wersquove also granted some rent relief for businesses who operate in council-owned premises for the first three months of this year, but who knows how long this pandemic will last \"Whilst Welsh Government has been able to provide some additional funding to local authorities, they have not got a bottomless pit of money either.\"Wersquore also paying out grants to charities and amateur sports clubs.\"\"Covid- is also having an effect on the council tax relief scheme,\" Cllr Moore said. \"The Government currently provides money to help people on low incomes claim a discount.\"The level of funding was set prior to this pandemic and the call on this funding is already increasing.\"This may not be sustainable and we may have to fund it ourselves.\"Applications for that fund have gone up immensely since the covid- situation.\"The Welsh Local Government Association believe there could be a spending increase of around pound million across Wales.\"For us that would equate to around pound,.\"At the moment, we can code spending against the pandemic and make claims to Welsh Government, as is every other local authority in Wales.\"But I emphasise, therersquos no guarantee that it is going to go on forever.\"The virus has also seen internal costs increase in certain areas.\"We needed to upgrade our IT facilities and expenditure on waste and recycling is also rising.\"Wersquove had to increase our investment in IT because a considerable number of staff are now working from home.\"Originally, we thought we were going to get all of that back, but now wersquove been told wersquore only going to get  per cent.\"Thatrsquos an expense we didnrsquot anticipate and itrsquos an expense we will have to absorb.\"The other added expenditure is due to people being out of work or furloughed.\"We have seen increases in applications for universal credit and thatrsquos going to have an impact on us in terms of the ability to collect rents and council tax.\"Exactly what that impact will be is unclear.ldquoDespite that, we are continuing to run services, as far as possible and we have seen a massive increase in areas such as recycling and waste.The other area of increased spending is in social services, which normally spends around  per cent of our budget.\"That is going to go up dramatically because people are getting frailer and succumbing to covid- and we are also supporting people in care homes and providing PPE for our staff and the care homes.Overall the virus is having a massive impact on the council and the community.\"The exact extent of this impact is very dficult to estimate, but we will continue to support the community until it is defeated.\"He added:

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityAt the daily coronavirus press conference, Mr Drakeford said new guidelines were being introduced for when the two-metre social distancing guidelines were not possible to maintain on public transport.The first minister said these should be in place by Monday, July , when passengers will also be required to wear face coverings.\"Public transport moves across our porous border with England,\" he said. \"There the use of face coverings is mandatory on public transport.\"And, for the sake of simplicity and consistency, as well as being part of our plan to reduce the risk of transmission while on public transport, where it is not possible to maintain a two-metre physical distance, it will become mandatory in Wales for people to wear a three-layer face covering while travelling on public transport, and that includes taxis.\"Mr Drakeford said having separate rules to England on this was \"not sustainable in the long run.\"When asked why face coverings were not being mandated straight away, Mr Drakeford said there were still details to iron out.Children under a certain age - which has not yet been specied - those with breathing dficulties and people who rely on lip reading will be exempt from wearing face coverings.\"A couple of weeks to get those things right and get them in place and to do that with the operators is not, I think, unreasonable,\" said Mr Drakeford. \"And in the mean time, anybody who feels more comfortable wearing a face covering on public transport will be free to do so.\"Once it is mandatory,you dont do it, there are consequences for you. Its fair that the public in Wales have the chance to get themselves ready for that date.\"Mr Drakeford reiterated the Welsh Government advice on face coverings is \" you are somewhere where it is crowded, it is advisable to wear a face covering.\"Details on how these measures will be enforced in the next few days, but the first minister did say enforcement \"cannot be left to the driver and to staff on the ground.\"Mr Drakeford was also asked about comments from Labours shadow minister for business, energy and industrial strategy Lucy Powell MP about the importance of bringing confidence back to the public by mandating face coverings be worn in shops.\"Im responsible for the position in Wales, not anyone s position in England,\" said the first minister. \"I have set out why in Wales our position is that mandation on public transport will be a requirement from July .\"We do not intend to mandate their use in other contexts while the circulation of the virus in Wales remains at such a low ebb.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

She said: ldquoI think this end of Dinas has been forgotten. [The council] seems to concentrate on the other end.ldquoI walk past here every day. It wouldnrsquot be so badthey just walled it off. I never complain, but this is just appalling.The council has now promised work will begin to remove the bridge next month, and blamed coronavirus for the most recent delay. The new timetable is to finish the job by this October.A Vale of Glamorgan council spokesperson said: ldquoUnfortunately, the contractor originally appointed to remove the bridge withdrew from the project after agreement couldnrsquot be reached on a claim for additional costs due to the coronavirus pandemic.ldquoThat meant a new contractor had to be found, a process that added to the delay caused by the pandemic itself, which for a period prevented work of this type being carried out.ldquoThe council has now successfully appointed a new contractor and received an indication that work is expected to start in mid-August. It is anticipated the work will be completed by the end of October.But both Cllr Franks and Ms Webber raised doubts about the new timetable.

At first the grants were to total  billion euros , but the figure was lowered to  billion euros .ldquoNever before did the EU invest in the future like this, Belgian Prime Minister Sophie Wilmes said.ldquoIt is a historic day for Europe, said French President Emmanuel Macron, who earlier reflected on some ldquoextremely tense moments during the marathon summit.Just shy of being the longest EU summit in history, the  leaders huddled back in the main room of the Europa centre and bumped elbows and made jokes before giving the package the final approval.ldquoDeal! wrote summit host Charles Michel on Twitter. vw,vw,px, px\"French President Emmanuel Macron speaks with German Chancellor Angela Merkel as the summit finished up in the early hours of Tuesday What was planned as a two-day summit scheduled to end on Saturday was forced into two extra days by deep ideological dferences among the leaders.But overall, spirits were high early Tuesday since the talks hit rock bottom Sunday night.The coronavirus has sent the EU into a tailspin, killing around , of its citizens and plunging its economy into an estimated contraction of .% this year.Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez insisted the adoption of an ambitious plan was required as the health crisis continued to threaten the continent.With Mr Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel negotiating as the closest of partners, the traditionally powerful Franco-German alliance could not get the quarrelling nations in line for long. vw,vw,px, px\"French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel towards the end of the meeting The leaders mulled a proposal from the five wealthy northern nations ndash the Netherlands, Austria, Finland, Sweden and Denmark ndash that suggested a coronavirus recovery fund with  billion euros of grants and the same amount in loans. The five nations, nicknamed ldquothe frugals, had long opposed any grants at all, while the EU executive had proposed  billion euros.The latest compromise proposal stands at  billion euros in grants.All nations agree in principle they need to band together but the five richer countries in the north want strict controls on spending. Struggling southern nations like Spain and Italy say those conditions should be kept to a minimum.The five have been pushing for labour market and pension reforms to be linked to EU handouts, and for a ldquobrake enabling EU nations to monitor and,necessary, halt projects that are being paid for by the recovery fund..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: EU leaders clinch deal after marathon summit article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

With this in mind, I sincerely hope our customers will continue to support the charity and visit our other shops in the wider area.”The closure coincides with the launch of an urgent new TV appeal to help get Cancer Research UK’s le-saving work back on track.

Commenting proprietor Brian Jardine said: “It’s been a pleasure to welcome our customers back to the Pot Belly and to hear their positive feedback on our distancing and sanitising measures.“Part of our measures to keep everyone safe includes our two Gel-Gem sanitising units which are front of house and at the entry to our separate upstairs restaurant and a new external covered space, our Terraced Bar.”Gel-Gem came about at the beginning of lockdown when most businesses were closed said Raymond Fegan of construction and property maintenance company d Property Services. “The amount of enquiries we received from business of all sizes led us to develop a solution to help the fight against Covid-. “One of the early issues we identied and worked to overcome was the fragile nature of some sanitising systems being installed into entrances which took up considerable space and required regular monitoring and replacement. “We wanted to design a hands-free unit which was locally produced, high capacity and which was built to last.Studying the market we believe that in offering a sturdy, solid and safe stainless steel construction which includes a gel level monitoring window, we’ve done just that.“Gel-Gem comes in three dferent sanitising gel capacities - ,  and a mammoth  litre version for higher footfall areas.They can be used outside and we are also producing bespoke ‘all ability’ models and models which include provision to store contact tracing details, order to meet the specic needs of our clients. “Working to provide solutions for our clients across the local area, from small shops to the Bouled Outlet and from churches to sports clubs we have been delighted with the feedback we have been receiving not only for our Gel-Gem’s but also for our new hand-friendly sanitising gel which we can supply wholesale. “We are also delighted that every sale of a Gel-Gem unit supports the work of charity Kidney Care UK as they support local kidney patients which highlights the need to sanitise not only for ourselves but for those who are clinically vulnerable and at higher risk of infection.”Concluding Brian Jardine said: “At The Pot Belly we are very proud of our historic roots and excited about once again welcoming our customers back to enjoy our locally sourced menu’s while at the same time taking the steps to keep everyone safe.”If you want to find out more about the Gel-Gem units visit www.d-ps gel-gem or contact Raymond at gel-gem@d-ps\"\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-drMfKT fpqScQ\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg eOOfIS\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-drMfKT fpqScQ\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg eOOfIS\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleMore from Portadown TimesAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-gxMtzJ sc-dfVpRl dLpuYr\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyNews you can trust since News\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisCoronavirusSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessFollow us    "},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1594907543060.jpg--fundraiser_for_the_late_declan_grimes_raises_almost__7_000.jpg?159490754300","title":"fundraiser for the late declan grimes raises almost   ","story":"A virtual concert held in memory of Carrickmore man Declan Grimes, who passed away from Covid- earlier this year, has raised almost pound, for the Western Trust.Singer song-writer Ciara Fox, from Greencastle, organised a virtual concert in memory of Mr Grimes who sadly passed away in the Critical Care Unit at the South West Acute Hospital, Enniskillen, in April this year.
