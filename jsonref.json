It is already warmer than any April temperature last year.’The current hot weather far surpasses the average maximum temperature for April, which sits at 11.4C (53F).The summery spell comes as a result of warm air from the Azores, off the coast of Portugal, being dragged up towards the UK by the combined efforts of an area of low pressure over the Atlantic and high pressure over western Europe.If temperatures hit 28C, it would beat the 2001 April high of 27.8C (82F) (Picture: James Linsell-Clark  SWNS.com)If temperatures hit 28C, it would beat the 2001 April high of 27.8C (82F), the Met Office said.The warmest April day on record was 29.4C (85F) in 1949.Weekend temperatures are expected to dip slightly before showery outbreaks on Sunday.Competitors in the London Marathon can expect hot and humid conditions with a forecast of between 21C (70F) and 23C (73F) (Picture:  Francis Hawkins  SWNS.com)Competitors in the London Marathon can expect hot and humid conditions with a forecast of between 21C (70F) and 23C (73F), Mr Burkill said.‘There could be a shower but it’s not very likely.

What can you talk about to ensure that there are no awkward, staring-at-the-menu silences? And most importantly, how can you impress her enough to get a second date?It can feel like a complete gamble. But don’t panic – here are some stressbusting tips to help you make sure everything goes smoothly.We know, you want to be romantic and original. You don’t want to take her to a boring bar or restaurant, so you’re thinking of a mid-day picnic in the park. Perhaps a hike to a place you’ve never been before? Ice-cream on a rollercoaster?The whole point of first dates is that you’re getting to know a stranger – you have absolutely no idea what they like. At this point, you don’t want to suggest a quirky, offbeat date that they might not enjoy (besides, ants crawling all over the two of you on a blistering July day in the park is not exactly conducive to romance).No, no, there’s a reason the classics are classics.Take her to a restaurant and just talk. Order your signature drink, ask her if she wants to split a starter. Once you know her likes and dislikes better, you’re free to plan inventive dates.First dates can feel like a job interview, in the sense that you’re both trying to see if you’re a good match. You want to skillfully highlight your time spent doing charity work in Uruguay, your extensive knowledge of Russian literature, or your piano-playing ability.But that doesn’t exactly put people in the mood for romance. Take off your interview hat and relax, so you can put her at ease.Instead of talking, listen. Ask her simple questions: ‘What’s a typical weekend like for you? Ah, do you enjoy that? That must be difficult – tell me more?’Good listeners are rare enough to be impressive.Above all else, she wants to feel that you take an interest in her, and that she’s an interesting person. If you spend the entirety of the date lecturing her on all the wonderful things about yourself, she’s going to go home bored out of her skull – no matter how varied your CV is or how funny you try to be.Sure, that’s not how you’ve seen it on TV and movies. Onscreen, first dates are filled with sexy innuendo and knock-em-dead lines. But this can easily backfire, or come off cheesy, or (worst of all) leave her feeling uncomfortable – the kind of uncomfortable where she calls for the bill and texts her friends saying: ‘Oh god, complete disaster. He was being creepy and overtly sexual the entire night.’When in doubt, keep it subtle. Maybe lay off that filthy joke you heard around the office last Friday. Don’t go straight to the pick-up line you read in some men’s Internet forum.Do compliment her: ‘You look beautiful in that dress.’ A tasteful compliment does the heavy lifting –it lets her know that you’re attracted to her, without being OTT. Remember, you can always flirt outrageously later when you know more about her preferences.It’s natural to be curious about the other person’s relationship history, or their current status. You want to swap horror stories of online dating, or talk about dealbreakers. You might both be thinking: ‘Heshe is so great, why are they single?’All of that is fine. With one notable exception: Do not talk at length about your exes. There’s just no reason to do it on the first date, no matter what. Even if you thought they were ‘crazy’ because they keyed your car.Don’t talk about why you broke up with them, or do a post-mortem of that relationship. Don’t point out that your ex’s favourite band is playing in the bar. Don’t talk about them, period. This is a date between two people, not a therapy session with the ghost of your ex in attendance.Keep the ex references to zero – and if that’s tough, question why. If you can’t go on a date without bringing up Jenny who you loved four years ago…maybe you shouldn’t be dating.Okay, let’s skip ahead to the final five minutes of the evening. You’ve split the check after she refused to let you pay, you’re walking her to her car, and you feel so tense you can’t move. What do you do? Do you kiss her? Do you say goodbye? Do you do the stiff one-arm hug before disappearing?Relax. Watch her cues. If you’ve been flirting heavily for hours, it might be the propitious moment to lean in slightly and say ‘I’ve been thinking about kissing you the whole night.’Whatever you do, don’t lunge – it’s hugely offputting.If a kiss happens organically, fantastic. If not, don’t stress it. Handle any rejection with grace. It might not be the right time. Maybe it’ll happen on the second date, when you finally go on that picnic in the park.This is your chance to be polite and sweet. Tell her that you had a lovely time, and ask her to text you when she gets home safe. That way, she’s much more likely to say ‘Yes please’ when you text ‘Can we do this again?’MORE: How to avoid unintentionally being a d*ck to women in the street at nightMORE: How to compliment a woman without being a creepMORE: A guide to birdnesting, the hot new orce trend"},{"url":"http://metro.co.uk/author/ellen-scott/\" class=\"author url fn\" rel=\"author\"\u003eEllen Scott\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"post-date\" itemprop=\"datePublished\"\u003eThursday 19 Apr 2018 1:53 pm\u003c/span\u003e\u003cmeta itemprop=\"dateModified\" content=\"2018-04-19T14:36:20+0100","title":"can guys feel difference different vaginas just penis","story":"(Picture: Ella Byworth for usCome on, you know you’ve wondered.Do different vaginas actually feel that different?Does my vagina have a particular sensation completely unique to someone else’s?Could someone be capable of feeling the difference with their penis alone?Or are all vaginas generally the same cosy, cushioned, tunnels, indistinct from one another?It’s something we’ve pondered. And apparently we’re not alone in this eternal questioning, as someone’s started a thread all about it on Reddit, titled: ‘Do different vaginas feel different to guys during penetrative sex?’We took it upon ourselves to ask some people with penises for answers. Their names have been changed, because shockingly few people want to publicly compare people’s vaginas. Fair enough.First off, what does sex feel like when you have a penis? The general consensus is a warm, wet, cosy grip of the penis. That’s what we’re working with.Adam, 26, tells Metro.co.uk that yes, there are noticeable differences between different vaginas purely in terms of penetrative sensation.‘Some feel harder, some wetter, some deeper, some tighter, squishier, funner,’ he explains. ‘Some just feel better… comfier and easier to work with.’Tom, also 26, agrees. ‘Naturally there are differences – tightness, wetness – although I suppose the second isn’t necessarily a physical difference in vaginas,’ he muses.(Picture: Ella Byworth for usWetness makes sense as a noticeable difference. People’s vaginas will vary in terms of wetness depending on their arousal level as well as their vagina’s natural lubrication levels, and the wetter someone is, the easier penetration will be – that’s something that’s noticeable based purely on penile sensation.But within someone’s personal wetness, there are different levels of lubrication. One day they may feel wetter than another, so it’s not a particularly distinguishable trait.The same goes for warmth, which Brian, 33, says he notices as a variable. Vaginas change in temperature, and the penis can feel that, but one person’s temperature on one day doesn’t make their vagina unique to another’s.‘Some are warmer than others,’ says David, 33. ‘Some get cold when they cum.’It’s worth noting that some differences will only be noticed through digital (with your fingers) penetration, but not through the penis.‘Bumpiness is not something you notice with your penis,’ Brian tells us. ‘But you do with fingers.’Our fingers are sensitive and we use them to feel things out and pick up information. We aren’t trained to do the same kind of textural learning with the penis (in evolutionary terms, we just want to penetrate to the best of our ability to reproduce), so it makes sense that someone may not feel the intricacies of a vagina’s curves and bumps with their penis alone.So while vaginas may each be different in terms of texture and curves, it’s likely that those differences wouldn’t be picked up by penetration with the penis.(Picture: Ella Byworth for usPenis sensitivity declines with age, lessening from age 25 onwards, and one person’s penis may be more sensitive than another’s, so there’s no blanket answer for what exactly someone’s penis feels when they’re tucked up in the vagina.But as Tobias Kohler, assistant professor of urology at Southern Illinois University School of Medicine, notes, men rarely complain about their decline in sensitivity. This suggests that either sensitivity to the vagina’s textures isn’t that big of a factor in men’s sexual satisfaction, or the changes in sensitivity aren’t noticeable – possibly because the penis wasn’t that sensitive to texture and curves to begin with.If you’ve ever had a guy think he’s penetrating you when he’s in fact nestling his penis between your thighs, or had him do accidental anal, you’ll probably agree that the penis isn’t that great at figuring out what it’s encountering.The differences the penis is able to pick up, however, are warmth, wetness, and grip.‘Tightness is a massive variable and one of the only things that isn’t changed by a condom,’ says Brian.Think about it in terms of other bits of your body – if you wedge your arm into something, you might not be able to tell what it is as well as you’d be able to with the tips of your fingers, but if it tightened around your arm, you’d feel that. Feel free to test that by grabbing your arm right now, as we’ve been doing for the last hour or so.Tightness is something varies between women, but can also change over time or on different occasions. A more relaxed vagina will feel looser, so there’s not one defined grip that one vagina can deliver, although some people will have vaginas that are naturally more narrow or wider set.Body type does play a role in how the vagina will feel, although it may not be noticeable through penetration.Carl, 26, tells Metro.co.uk: ‘Some are more bony – like, hard. It’s skinny girls, actually. It’s more pleasurable with girls who are above a size ten.’(Picture: Ella Byworth for usThe biggest differences in sensation aren’t down to the uniqueness of one person’s vagina, but more so the overall experience of sex. That’s what guys will be noticing during penetration – how good the sex feels, not the vagina’s measurements and floorplan.Warmth, lubrication, and grip, all affect the general experience of sex – but these are all things that can vary not just from person to person, but moment to moment.Of all the guys we asked, none of them felt confident that they’d be able to pick out a previous partner’s vagina based on a blindfolded line-up of penis penetration. So while different vaginas may feel different, the differences aren’t stark enough to help distinguish one person’s vagina from another.It’s more so the other stuff that’s going on that would help a man tell different women apart – the movements, the warmth, the general enjoyment – not the exact way the vagina feels in terms of texture and shape‘I’m not so sure I could,’ says Tom when posed the vagina line-up scenario. ‘Obviously there’s the staple sensation of just dick in vagina, but it’s everything else that’s with it that obviously causes that specific sensation as well.‘If you were to just give me some real life replica of my girlfriend’s pussy or something and I had to f*** it blind folded it’s not gonna feel like f***ing her.’That’s because – not to get mushy – sexual pleasure and sensation isn’t about the physical structure of someone’s vagina. It’s about how you use said vagina, and all the other stuff going on as part of sex.And none of the men said they’d had experience with an unpleasant-feeling vagina, so even if they can feel those subtle differences, it’s really not a big deal.Tom explains that he’s had sex with someone who had a ‘bad’ vagina – ‘but that might be more to just not feeling it with that person, rather than their vagina, or me being too drunk ’cause you know the IPAs don’t cooperate with my pecker.’So in short: Yes, sex feels different with different people. That makes sense.But the textural details of your vagina don’t make you distinguishable in a line-up assessed only by penetration. The things a penis feels are warmth, wetness, and grip – all of which can vary day to day.No matter what they feel though, the men we spoke to agree that vaginas on the whole are very good. So you don’t need to panic that your vagina doesn’t feel as amazing as someone else’s, or wish your vagina fit some model ideal.Now we’ve got that sorted, we can stop pondering these big questions and focus on just enjoying sex.

He added: ‘I feel I will live with this for the rest of my life.’Victim statements from the second man said he had been left in dire financial straits, had to take out pay day loans and spent some inheritance from his grandfather on his debts.He added: ‘I feel I can’t trust anyone and I’m paranoid I will be taken advantage of.‘The difficulties will remain with me for some time yet and may never go away.’Bain, who has now been jailed for six years, met one of his victims on wasteland in Newcastle while waiting for a male escort who failed to show up.Bain pretended to be the male prostitute and they walked away together.But then He said he was from anti-paedophile group Protectors of the North and told him ‘you are going to get caught, you are a paedo, a nonce’ before demanding cash.The victim gave him £200 and hoped that Bain would go away but he turned up at his house and demanded more money.Prosecutor Mark Giuliani told the court: ‘He said things would be put on the internet that would identify him as a homosexual man.‘He said to him he was going to put things online and in the Evening Chronicle, saying he was going to out him, he was going to say he was a paedo, a nonce, and f****t.’The court heard the victim had handed over a total of £1,260 when Bain turned up at his home again and demanded more money but this time the brave complainant refused to pay.Mr Giuliani said: ‘Having stood up to the defendant, the complainant went home and effectively broke down and told members of of his family what had been happening to him.‘He felt it necessary to inform his family he was, in fact, gay. He had to out himself.’The victim said in a statement he was ‘frightened and terrified’ during the ordeal and added: ‘I feel I will live with this for the rest of my life.’The court heard the second gay victim was convinced Bain was ‘also homosexual’ and initially freely handed over loans as their friendship grew, in the belief they would be paid back.As Bain’s requests for cash started to increase, he said he had a sick son and that they ‘needed money to travel to Scotland’, which made the victim feel sorry for him.The court heard when victim started to become reluctant to hand over more cash, Bain changed tactics.Mr Giuliani said: ‘He became more openly threatening, saying if he didn’t hand over money a gang called the Conroys could come calling for looking for him and smash up his home and car, saying he knew where his family lived and they would be hurt.’Bain even penned a letter, claiming to be ‘contract’ from one of the ‘Conroys’, saying money had to be handed over by 2pm as a ‘guarantee to be the end’.By the end of the man’s ordeal, Bain had pocketed £15,797.The court heard the victim’s credit score was badly effected by him having to find large cash sums and take out taking out high interest pay day loans.Bain, of Gateshead who has no fixed address, admitted two charges of blackmail as well as fraud and theft in relation to the second man.Bain also pleaded guilty to a fraud charge after taking £295 from a disabled man’s account, who had handed over a cash card in exchange for having his windows cleaned.Judge Simon Batiste sentenced Bain to six years behind bars and said his behaviour was ‘wicked’.The judge said: ‘Eventually, one man, went inside and told his family what was happening and the fact he was gay.‘As a result of this offence he, in fact, had to out himself to his family.’Rachel Hedworth, defending, said Bain has a long term drug habit, which is at the root of his long criminal record, and is ‘extremely remorseful’ for his actions.Miss Hedworth said Bain ‘pretended he was also homosexual’ and added: ‘He, in fact, led both of these men on to believe something would happen, that he would embark on a relationship with both of them in the first instance.’"},{"url":"https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/sec_8099102.jpg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all","title":"proof that people dont listen to airplane safety announcements anymore","story":"People only covered their mouth with the oxygen masks (Picture: FacebookMarty Martinez)A picture from the Southwest plane which was forced to make an emergency landing has proved that most people don’t listen to plane safety announcements any more.The photograph shows people putting oxygen masks over their mouths, but not on their noses.Bobby Laurie, a former flight attended and TV show host, said on Twitter: ‘PEOPLE: Listen to your flight attendants!‘ALMOST EVERYONE in this photo from @SouthwestAir #SWA1380 today is wearing their mask WRONG.

It did catch me off guard.\u0027He added: \u0027She kissed me. She made the move. And I think I was like, OK – we\u0027re at that phase of our relationship right now, we\u0027re kissing. That was what happened.\u0027There were other kisses after that moment. She definitely made the first move and initiated the first act of affection in that way.\u0027Silverstein, who still lives in Los Angeles, said the duo had previously hugged and held hands but had never gone further until the actress, now 36, took matters into her own hands.Meghan later recounted the moment during a 2013 interview with Larry King, telling the veteran host: \u0027I was 13, it was a summer camp and I kissed him!\u0027Silverstein added: \u0027We had already become a couple. We had held hands prior - I\u0027ve always been affectionate, so we\u0027d already hugged. But the kiss was definitely her, her initiative absolutely.\u0027The teenage romance began after the pair met at a drama-focused summer camp organized by the Agape International Spiritual Center.Silverstein has grown up to be a star in the US as he is an actor, comedian and rapper who appears on The Late, Late Show. He is now a married father-of-two young children still living in Los Angeles, but he still remembers his romance with Meghan           Meghan and Silverstein met at a drama summer camp at their local Agape Spiritual Church. Adherents, who include Meghan\u0027s mother Doria, 61, and talk show host Oprah Winfrey, believe that God is everywhere, that sickness starts in the mind and that positive thinking has a healing effectFounded in 1986, adherents, who include Meghan\u0027s mother Doria, 61, and talk show host Oprah Winfrey, believe that God is everywhere, that sickness starts in the mind and that positive thinking has a healing effect.As a result, Silverstein says, participants in the camp were encouraged to take part in meditation sessions as well as in acting and dance workshops – the latter much loved by budding actress Meghan.He says the pair initially bonded over their mixed race heritage, telling DailyMailTV that they found themselves thrown together because of their \u0027intimate\u0027 class of 15.          Silverstein said that he believes Meghan will continue her activism work once she marries Prince Harry. Meghan is pictured above outside Buckingham Palace as a teenagerSilverstein describes the 13-year-old Meghan as being \u0027very sweet\u0027, charming and \u0027quirky\u0027 but already displaying the determined streak that took her to success in Suits and a glamorous royal life in London after she weds Prince Harry next month.\u0027Meghan as a 13-year-old was very kind, very sweet, very talented, very interested in the theater camp – it was then that we saw how impressive she was on stage,\u0027 he said.\u0027She was charming and quirky. She wasn\u0027t a stereotypical 13-year-old girl she wasn\u0027t decked out in pink every single day, she wasn\u0027t flaunting make-up or anything.\u0027She was her own person, very authentic to who she was at the time. She was curious, I think she was serious about her craft.\u0027In true teen fashion, the pair realized they liked each other after telling friends about their respective crushes.\u0027I found out from our friends that she liked me and I liked her and I just think we decided it would be a good idea to become boyfriend and girlfriend,\u0027 Silverstein said.The relationship wasn\u0027t his first: he had previously kissed girls at kindergarten and had a \u0027girlfriend\u0027 in first grade.Prince Harry and Meghan Markle to attend Stephen Lawrence...Let the madness begin!

But what is GDPR?What is GDPR?The General Data Protection Regulation has been created over the course of four years in order to strengthen data protection in an era in which people are continuously giving social media websites permissions to use their personal information in exchange for ‘free’ services.GDPR will be replacing the Data Protection Act 1998, which itself was brought into law so that the 1995 EU Data Protection Directive could be implemented and give people more control over how organisations use data.The regulation also introduced penalties for those who do not comply with the new rules and in turn, suffer from data breaches. It also standardised all data laws across the European Union.A significant change in the new regulation is that if companies fail to provide adequate security to protect data, they could be fined heavily under GDPR.Why do we need GDPR?  The advent of the Internet and the emergence of the cloud led to organisations being able to use personal user data for their own purposes, which caused problems when iniduals wanted to know how their information was being used.  GDPR was planned because of the EU’s need to align data protection law with the 21st century, a time where people use free services like Amazon, Google, Twitter and Facebook and offer their information openly.Alongside this, the EU wanted to align data protection law across all member states so that companies are clear about what they need to comply with.          The General Data Protection Regulation will apply from May 25, 2018 in all EU member statesWhen will the GDPR be implemented?The GDPR  will apply from May 25, 2018 in all EU member states automatically, without the need for each country having to draw up their own legislation.While businesses have until May 25 to ensure they have applied the new rules, the directive came into force on May 24, 2016 after the EU agreed to the final text.Who does the GDPR apply to?GDPR will apply to those who decide how and why personal data is processed, the controllers, as well as those who actively process the data, otherwise known as the processors. This means that GDPR could apply to anyone working in a company, charity, government or IT firm.It will also apply to controllers and processors that are based outside the EU, but deal with data that belongs to EU residents. Controllers are responsible for ensuring that processors abide by the new law and process data lawfully, who themselves are required to maintain records of their activities.After the GDPR is put in place, data must be processed with consent and transparently, for a purpose and once it is no longer needed, data should be deleted. Alongside this, consent must be granted in an active fashion by the user, not passively with pre-ticked boxes.What is personal data?Under the GDPR, the European Union has expanded the definition of ‘personal data’ to include other online identifiers such as IP addresses, mental health, cultural and economic information about an inidual.Iniduals already have the right to access information that a company has obtained and to know how and why their data is being processed, as well as who will see it. Data can also be rectified, changed or deleted at any time by the person it belongs to.          The European Union has expanded the definition of ‘personal data’ to include other identifiersHow much are GDPR fines?When a data breach occurs, the people who are at risk of being affected must be told within 72 hours of the company being aware of it. Those who do not meet this deadline could face a penalty of two per cent of their annual worldwide revenue, or €10 million (£8.7m), whichever is higher.Then, the data protection authority should be contacted and in the UK, this means the Information Commissioner\u0027s Office, or the ICO. The authority should be given information about the nature of data breach, how many people have been affected, what the consequences could be and what measures have been actioned.If people’s rights are ignored, the fine could reach up to €20 million (£17m) or four per cent of your global annual turnover, whichever is higher.Does Brexit affect GDPR?With Article 50 being triggered in March 2017, the UK has two years in which to leave the European Union, but this means that the GDPR will be implemented before this time. In August 2017, the UK government put forward a new Data Protection Bill, which replicates the requirements of GDPR ahead of Brexit. The new bill allows the ICO to issue fines of up to £17 million, or four per cent of global turnover, whichever is highest.Billboard Music Awards 2018: Everything you need to know Zlatan Ibrahimovic will be the face of Visa\u0026#8217s Russia 2018 World Cup campaignLauryn Hill tour announced to mark The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill 20th anniversary Who is Kodak Black?

I pray he has found peace\u0027 and Dale\u0027s cousin Madeleine Trehearne, 65, told MailOnline: \u0027We feel that he died far too young and we\u0027re really cut up about it.\u0027 Dale started his career in local radio and had little work for eight years until he spent nearly a decade hosting Supermarket Sweep before fronting the National Lottery show In It To Win It on BBC1 for 14 years and the Pick of the Pops show on BBC Radio 2 for ten years.But the star, known for his sunny disposition, bright smile and tan, disappeared from public life two years ago admitting he \u0027wouldn\u0027t leave the house\u0027 because of depression and regrets that he had failed to admit he was gay until he was 45.A year earlier he failed to make it to his close friend Cilla Black\u0027s funeral, sparking concerns about his health, and had undergone four operations in four years to fix crippling pain in his knees and shoulders. But this year he relaunched his career with a US travel show on Channel 5 called Dale\u0027s Florida Fly Drive.  The final episodes will now be shown at an \u0027appropriate time in the future\u0027.          This year he had relaunched his TV career with a new Channel 5 show Dale\u0027s Florida Fly Drive (pictured) but he died before the series was shown in full   TV star Dale Winton has died at the age of 62 at his London home (pictured in his last public appearance in July 2016 with friend David Walliams), and right a month later          Flowers for the \u0027kindest man I know\u0027 were left on his doorstep today by a friend nicknamed \u0027GoGo\u0027 by the starDale had moved to a five bedroom semi detached home in Whetstone worth around £1million and his silver Range Rover with a personalised number plate is still on the drive. Next door neighbour Evelyn Sawers, 68, said: \u0027Dale had only been living there about a month. \u0027He kept to himself, occasionally I\u0027d see him on his door step and he\u0027d say \u0027hello\u0027 but other than that I didn\u0027t see much of him.           Dale\u0027s big break came with Supermarket Sweep, which saw contestants racing around a supermarket collecting items. He hosted the show from 1993 to 2001, and was involved in a 2007 reboot\u0027Yesterday there were four ambulances and a lot of police and I wondered what had happened. \u0027There was a tall blonde woman by his front door talking to a policeman. She might have been a relative. \u0027It wasn\u0027t until I saw the news that I realised Dale had died. It\u0027s a shame as he seemed a nice man. I recognised him from the television\u0027. Former neighbours of Winton in Central London have paid their tributes to the TV star.\u0027I saw him a few weeks ago,\u0027 said a woman who lives on York Terrace East and declined to be identified.\u0027He was delightful, always very kind, but he hadn\u0027t been the same since Cilla (Black) died. Since then, he spent a lot more time in Florida.\u0027A man who lives opposite Winton\u0027s former residence said: \u0027He was a very nice man. Very agreeable and cheerful. He always gave me a big hello on the street. He was very neighbourly.\u0027A bouquet of white roses lay on the doorstep of Winton\u0027s old house with a card that said: \u0027The kindest man I knew. Always in my heart.\u0027 It was signed \u0027Go Go\u0027. Last night Winton\u0027s agent confirmed his death at home at the age of 62, but no further details about how or why were given. In a moving tribute to his friend David Walliams tweeted today: \u0027Dale was the best company, always outrageous \u0026amp hilarious. He adored being in show business \u0026amp loved meeting fans. He devoted his life to making everyone else happy, his friends, the public \u0026amp his godsons, even though he found it hard to be happy himself. I pray he has found peace\u0027. In June 2016, two months before he was last seen in public, he said: \u0027I would not leave the house for five years. I didn\u0027t want to put one foot in front of the other outside the house. I had a bad break up and I had health issues and I thought, \u0027I want to withdraw\u0027.\u0027A year earlier he failed to make it to his close friend Cilla Black\u0027s funeral, sparking concerns about his health, and had undergone four operations in four years to fix crippling pain in his knees and shoulders.In his 2002 autobiography he came out as gay but revealed his regret at not telling his mother before her death saying in 2008 that nobody had really ever asked him about his sexual orientation. This year he had relaunched his TV career with a new Channel 5 show Dale\u0027s Florida Fly Drive but he died before the series was shown in full. His friend Davina McCall led the tributes last night as she described him as a \u0027lovely, warm, kind, sensitive, generous soul with a touch of naughty!\u0027Comedian David Walliams also said he was \u0027heartbroken\u0027 to hear of the death of his friend, who spoke openly about his battle with depression two years ago.But describing how much fun he was to be around he said: \u0027One night Dale \u0026amp I were going out to dinner \u0026amp he stopped off on the way to buy diet lemonade from a corner shop. He was in there about 20 minutes. When he finally got back in the car I asked \u0027what took you so long?\u0027 \u0026amp he said \u0027sorry David I am very big with the Indian community!\u0027In another anecdote he said: \u0027One afternoon Dale \u0026amp I were out shopping \u0026amp some policeman were standing on the street corner. He gave them a huge wave \u0026amp called out \u0027hello loves, hello darlings!\u0027 I asked why he was saying hello. He replied \u0027always wave at policemen David.

Denuclearization will be a great thing for World, but also for North Korea!\u0027 Pompeo has been paving the way for an expected meeting between Trump and Kim.The CIA director has a close relationship with the president, unlike former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who Trump fired last month in a tweet a few days after agreeing to an invitation from Kim to meet. Trump immediately tapped Pompeo to replace Tillerson. At a confirmation hearing last week that would have taken place after his trip to Pyongyang, Pompeo told senators on the Foreign Relations Committee that he was \u0027optimistic that the United States government can set the conditions for that appropriately so that the president and the North Korean leader\u0027 can have a conversation that \u0027will set us down the course of achieving a diplomatic outcome that...America and the world so desperately need.\u0027Referring to the testimony on Wednesday, Sen. Bob Menendez, the top-ranking Democrat on the committee, scolded Pompeo for not being forthright with him even in their private talks about his Easter weekend tete-a-tete with Kim. \u0027After committing to transparency in his opening statement, he was not forthcoming when I questioned him about his involvement in the Russia investigation and I can tell you even his private conversations with me he didn\u0027t tell me about his visit to North Korea,\u0027 Menendez said at a Center for Strategic and International Studies event in Washington. The president confirmed Tuesday that a face-to-face meeting between himself and Kim was still on track to take place in the next few weeks.\u0027I look forward to meeting with Kim Jong-un. And hopefully that will be a success. And maybe it will be, and maybe it won\u0027t be. We don\u0027t know,\u0027 Trump said. \u0027But I can say this: They do respect us. We are respectful of them. And we\u0027re going to see what happens.\u0027Unless negotiations go offer the rails, Trump said the talk wold take place in late May or early June in one of five undisclosed locations he said are under consideration.\u0027We have had direct talks at very high levels, extremely high levels, with North Korea. And I really believe there\u0027s a lot of good will,\u0027 the U.S. president said. \u0027As I always say, we\u0027ll see what happens. Because ultimately, it\u0027s the end result that counts.\u0027Locations under discussion were thought to include Beijing, Geneva and Panmunjom, a city inside the Demilitarized Zone. Sweden has also offered to assist with a meeting, and Mongolia\u0027s former president recommended his country\u0027s summit city, Ulaanbaatar. Trump said Washington had been ruled out, affirming experts\u0027 expectations that the meeting would not take place on either of the leaders\u0027 home turf.   US President Donald Trump greets Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe as he arrives for talks at Trump\u0027s Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida on Tuesday          DEATH GRIP: President Trump yanked Abe in for one of his famous locked and loaded handshakes           Trump said during the joint appearance that the U.S. and Japan \u0027are locked and we are very unified\u0027 in their approach to North KoreaTrump commented on the scheduled talks with Kim on Tuesday as he hosted Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe at Mar-a-Lago for a two-day summit.Trump said Japan and the U.S. are \u0027locked and we are very unified\u0027 when it comes to North Korea.  He delivered the remarks after welcoming Abe to his Palm Beach property for an afternoon meeting that both he and the Japanese leader said yielded great progress on the trade and security issues at hand.\u0027On those two points, we actually successfully forged a mutual understanding,\u0027 Abe said. \u0027So I\u0027m very happy to see the outcome of our one-on-one discussion.\u0027     Abe commended Trump on Tuesday for having the \u0027courage\u0027 to meet with Kim.  Still, he said he wanted to \u0027underscore the importance of achieving the complete, verifiable, and irreversible denuclearization, as well as the abandonment of missile programs of North Korea\u0027 in their talks.           US President Donald Trump greets Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe as he arrives for talks at Trump\u0027s Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach on Tuesday          Conversation today with Abe centered on global security and trade will pick back up Thursday and apex with a joint press conference.

Tree pollens tend to be most active from March to May and weed pollens from early spring to early autumn.Symptoms include sneezing, a runny nose and itchy eyes.                                                     DEFRA guidance for high air pollution said: \u0027Adults and children with lung problems, and adults with heart problems, should reduce strenuous physical exertion, particularly outdoors.\u0027People with asthma may find they need to use their reliever inhaler more often.\u0027Older people should also reduce physical exertion.\u0027Anyone experiencing discomfort such as sore eyes, cough or sore throat should consider reducing activity, particularly outdoors.\u0027Around 29,000 Britons are killed annually by air pollution - 15 times more than the 2,000 who die in road accidents - Department of Health-backed research shows.With temperatures expected to hit a scorching 80F, the bookies have slashed the odds into just 14 that Thursday notches up the highest temperature of 2018. And the scissors have also been taken to the price that a whopping 86F (30C) is reached (64) anywhere in UK. It\u0027s also now a 65 shot that despite its sodden start, this April takes home the accolade as being the warmest ever. Jessica Bridge of Ladbrokes said: \u0027The gorgeous weather has got us feeling flush and we\u0027ve been forced to slash the odds of the sunshine sticking around. \u0027Bosses ought to expect workers to be pulling sickies left, right and center this week as the mercury rises.\u0027 Supermarket chiefs are stockpiling beer, cider and sun cream as the min-heatwave sweeps in.Sainsbury\u0027s predict a 300 per cent rise in demand for sun cream and a 100 per cent increase in sales of fake tan over the next couple of days – so punters can look ready-bronzed in the sunshine.They also estimate 70 per cent more sales of beer and cider, a 30 per cent uplift in Rosé wine and a 150 per cent increase in demand for ice cream.And as the BBQ gets dusted down for the first time this year, the supermarket believes sales of vegan and vegetarian food will soar by 130 per cent.A Sainsbury\u0027s spokesperson said: \u0027It seems the whole country has been eagerly awaiting the warmer weather, and we\u0027re expecting our customers to celebrate the return of sunshine by bronzing with fake tan, cooling down with ice cream and firing up the barbecue.\u0027 The high temperatures will not just be confined to one part of the country, with 68F-70F (20C-21C)  expected in Newcastle, 64F-66F (18C-19C) in Northern Ireland and 63F (17C) in Glasgow.Met Office meteorologist Mark Wilson said: \u0027It\u0027s going to be a pretty nice day - it will be a slow start in places with cloud first thing.\u0027But by mid-afternoon there will be lots of unbroken sunshine.\u0027Thursday could see even higher temperatures - 77-80F  (25C-27C) in the South East - as warm air continues to come up through Spain and on to the UK.Saturday could see isolated showers in parts, while there is \u0027uncertainty\u0027 about what Sunday\u0027s weather will bring.Experts predict these warm conditions are likely to last for the rest of the month, with changeable conditions continuing in the northwest, while the southeast still has some decent dry and bright spells.Toasty temperatures will even be higher than those in Malibu, Athens and Rome. The start of the week should see warm weather in the south and the east, but the north and west have a high risk of rain and wind.The southeast can expect the best conditions in the country with the northwest seeing the bleakest.The African plume differs to the Spanish plume the UK experienced last summer which brought with it temperatures of 77F (25C). A Spanish plume is caused by cool Atlantic air being pushed towards Spain, which in turn pushes warm Spanish air towards the UK, bringing with it hot humid weather.   Get ready for two weeks of sun!

He explained that the site where the accident happened, about 22 feet before reaching the door to re-enter the casino, is essentially level with only a 1-degree dropCox, from Kent, claims lasting brain and body injuries and more than $400,000 in medical expenses. He claims to have suffered injuries to his brain, neck and shoulders.He and his wife, Minh-Hahn Cox, are seeking unspecified damages in their lawsuit, which also names as defendants the MGM Grand, show producer Backstage Employment and Referral, and construction firm Team Construction Management.Cox, who was at the show as the highlight of a dream trip to celebrate his 53rd birthday, claims negligence led to his fall.On Tuesday, the magician\u0027s friend and executive producer, Chris Kenner declined to say it was dangerous to lead people along a dark and unknown route over changing floor surfaces of linoleum, cement, carpet, sidewalk and tile. The illusion had been performed thousands of times over the last two decades, with about 55,000 taking part in the last ten years alone and none of them having had a problem, Kenner said.Earlier in the case, MGM Grand\u0027s attorney Jerry Popovich told the jury that Cox simply missed a step when he fell and did not slip. He explained that the site where the accident happened, about 22 feet before reaching the door to re-enter the casino, is essentially level with only a 1-degree drop. Popovich said that 10 minutes before Cox went down, Copperfield had walked through that same area as part of another illusion that did not involve audience participation. He said Copperfield would have notified staff if he had noticed any problem in the route.    Gavin Cox (pictured) was overcome with emotion as opening statements were made in the case. He claims that on returning to Britain after taking part in the trick, he suffered chronic pain while a scan showed a lesion on his brain.He said Copperfield\u0027s assistants hurried him down a secret passage, through a door and outside into the open air. He said: \u0027It was like a fire alarm went off. They were saying Hurry! Run, run, run!\u0027It was total pandemonium. You don’t know where you are going. It’s dark. There are hands pushing you on your back. As I went around a corner, my feet slipped from underneath me and I hit the ground.\u0027Mr Cox says he fell as he ran around the side of the theater.In the interview, he said that he as now forced to wear an oxygen \u0027lung\u0027 at night because he stops breathing, and he spent three months in a Californian brain trauma centre. The couple claimed they had been forced to live in the US for years as the case dragged on.Mrs Cox said in 2016: \u0027We are too broke to go out and Gavin’s injuries prevent us from enjoying a normal life. Gavin once cooked for royalty but now he can’t even bake a muffin because he has nerve damage in his hands and no sense of smell.\u0027 Mr Cox said he blacked out after his fall but remembers the audience cheering at the end of the trick. An ambulance later took Mr Cox to hospital where his right shoulder was found to be dislocated.Two days later he filled out an accident report at MGM and hired a US personal injury lawyer.  Copperfield\u0027s lawyers lost pretrial bids to close proceedings to the public to avoid disclosing performance secrets, although Judge Mark Denton has said some portions of Copperfield\u0027s testimony might still be conducted behind closed doors Once back in Britain, Mr Cox said he began to suffer chronic pain, headaches and confusion. A scan would later show lesions on his brain. But Mrs Cox said NHS waiting lists were ‘too long and he needed immediate treatment’.So the couple returned to Vegas in February 2014. Their travel insurer refused to pay for ongoing treatment, but they were seen under a \u0027medical lien\u0027 – doctors agreed to treat Mr Cox and receive payment only when the lawsuit is settled.Mr Cox\u0027s career had once included years as a chef at London’s Buck’s Club, where he cooked for the Queen Mother, Margaret Thatcher and Dracula actor Christopher Lee, and running a guesthouse in Broadstairs, Kent. But he said in the interview that he has been unable to work since the accident.Having had multiple operations on his back and neck, he said he had been diagnosed with permanent brain damage and a form of Parkinson’s. The Coxes were forced to sell their guesthouse for £515,000 at the end of 2014 and had been living off their savings. At the time of the interview, the Mail On Sunday quoted Copperfield’s lawyers as saying they denied all allegations but could not comment further due to ongoing litigation.They added: ‘This illusion has been performed for more than 15 years and with more than 100,000 participants.

But police believe he assaulted at least 105 between 2002 and 2008. The Parole Board made its decision while taking into account his 19 convictions, and not the 100 or more offences he is suspected of carrying out.

I accept responsibility, so I’m not hiding behind my advisers.

Put down the phone, stop with the selfies.. and LISTEN. **Cover your NOSE \u0026amp MOUTH.**\u0027 Aviation experts say the masks are essential in ensuring passenger safety during aircraft emergencies.The Federal Aviation Administration calls the masks \u0027the first line of defense against the potentially lethal effects of hypoxia and carbon monoxide poisoning.\u0027 Hypoxia occurs when a person isn\u0027t getting enough oxygen, which can cause dizziness, reduced vision, impaired judgment, unconsciousness and even death. Aircraft manufacturer Airbus say if a plane loses pressure at 40,000 feet, those on board have as little as 18 seconds of \u0027useful consciousness\u0027 without supplemental oxygen.According to flight attendants, at this point the masks should drop from the cabinets overhead and they can then be activated by tugging them towards you.Passengers then need to strap the masks over both their nose and mouth before fastening the white cords behind their heads. In the picture, at least three passengers can be seen pressing the masks to their own faces and only covering their mouths.Mr. Laurie\u0027s post has now been liked and re-tweeted over 20,000 times, as several others voiced their concerns over the passengers\u0027 actions. Jennifer Riordan, 43, a mother of two, was killed on the Southwest Airlines flight from New York to Dallas on Tuesday morning - the first fatal incident in US commercial aviation for nearly a decade. The Boeing 737-700 took off without incident but minutes into the flight, passengers heard an explosion in the left engine, which sent shrapnel flying through the window, shattering the glass and leading oxygen masks to drop.     Terrifying images shot from on board show the carcass of the ruined aircraft engine which malfunctioned mid-airJennifer  was nearly drawn out of the window which was next to her seat and had to be pulled back into her seat by other passengers.After the plane made a rushed emergency landing - she was taken to hospital for emergency treatment but later died.Seven other passengers were also treated for injuries, although it is unclear as yet whether any were suffering the effects of hypoxia or carbon monoxide poisoning. Marty Martinez, 29, began filming in selfie mode in the immediate aftermath of the disaster. Martinez, who runs a Dallas marketing agency, said on Wednesday he wanted to communicate with loved ones, but many social media users attacked him in expletive-laced postings. The hero captain of the plane insists she was just doing her job after safely performing an emergency landing amid the crisis unfolding on board.Tammie Jo Shults showed \u0027nerves of steel\u0027 and kept calm even as she told air traffic officials that a passenger, Jennifer Riordan, had almost been sucked out of the depressurized cabin of the Dallas-bound Boeing 737.But in a statement a day after the mid-air drama, the 56-year-old and First Officer Darren Ellisor said: \u0027We all feel we were simply doing our jobs\u0027.\u0027On behalf of the entire Crew, we appreciate the outpouring of support from the public and our coworkers as we all reflect on one family\u0027s profound loss,\u0027 the two pilots said, adding that their \u0027hearts are heavy\u0027.It comes as it emerged that Shults was once turned down by the Air Force and had even been warned at a high school careers fair that \u0027there were no professional women pilots\u0027. Instead, Mrs Shults was commissioned into the Navy in 1985 and reached the rank of lieutenant commander, said Commander Ron Flanders, the spokesman for Naval Air Forces in San Diego.Women aviators were excluded from combat missions until the month after Mrs Shults got off active duty in March 1993, but Mr Flanders said Mrs Shults flew during Operation Desert Storm trainings as an aggressor enemy pilot.           Jennifer Riordan, 43, was the only person killed on the flight after a piece of shrapnel punctured the window next to her          Tragic images show where Ms Riordan was nearly sucked out of the open window and had to be pulled back in by passengers          A piece of the engine casing discovered by startled residents at the Heidelberg Country Club in Bernville, PA, approximately 60 miles from the landing site          Officials from the FBI have been called in to help investigate the cause of the incident and could be seen helping wrap up the evidenceSouthwest Airlines passenger, 29, trolled for LIVE STREAMING emergency landing | Daily Mail Online"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/19/03/4B4C072000000578-0-image-m-26_1524104630415.jpg","title":"Bovis Homes accused misleading buyers deliberately delaying repairs shoddy homes","story":"    Nearly 3,000 people have joined the \u0027Bovis Homes Victims Group\u0027 on Facebook, complaining of a long list of problems with their homes.

She also claimed her driveway was sinking. In addition she suggested the invasion of slugs, worms, beetles and spiders was a result of them having their \u0027own personal entrance\u0027 into her home.A statement issued by Bovis apologised that Ms Stacey-Pope \u0027did not get the quality she deserved\u0027. They promised the repairs would be dealt with and her property brought up to standard.

There has been a number of protests outside the hospital in Liverpool in support of the youngster\u0027s family          Dr Jayaram has accused protestors - dubbed Alfie\u0027s Army - who are demanding he be released from hospital - of taking advantage of the family\u0027s grief\u0027There\u0027s this lack of trust of people perceived to be in authority or establishment. Some of the comments are terrifying.\u0027Do these people genuinely think that children\u0027s doctors and nurses are deliberately lying and going out of their way to do harm?\u0027How the hell has it come to this in 2018?\u0027Remember the best interests and well-being of the child are paramount - not the doctors, the nurses, not even the family and certainly not the baying mob.

Earlier this week Mr Evans met the Pope to plead for more help to save his brain damaged son\u0027And the difficulty here is if the chance of any long term improvement is virtually nil then by actually putting Alfie at potential risk, because there are huge risks in transporting a critically ill babies.\u0027It\u0027s a question of dignity. It puts him at higher risk of dying.\u0027I can understand, as a parent myself, you want to cling on to any straw floating by in the sea to stop you from drowning.\u0027Dr Jayaram compared the case to that of terminally ill baby Charlie Gard last year whose parents were denied the right to take him to America for experimental treatment following court rulings.          Posting photos of himself kissing Pope Francis\u0027s hand, Mr Evans wrote: \u0027Your holiness save our son\u0027He said: \u0027Alfie has a condition that falls into the group of conditions called neurodegenerative conditions.\u0027Some of these have names and some have not got specific names.\u0027This is an important point because one of the arguments being put forward is that there isn\u0027t a diagnosis, there isn\u0027t a name to this neurodegenerative condition.\u0027But people know what it is and we know that the outlook is grim. The brain gradually effectively just dies away.\u0027Alfie\u0027s parents, Tom Evans and Kate James, from Liverpool, have lost fights in the high court, court of appeal, supreme court and European court of human rights (ECHR).They say \u0027the state\u0027 is wrongly interfering with their parental choice and want to move their 23-month-old son to a hospital in Rome for further treatment.Earlier this week Mr Evans met the Pope to plead for more help to save his brain damaged son after flying into Rome last night.He had a 20 minute private audience at the Vatican where the Pontiff agreed to ramp up the campaign to stop his life support being switched off.Posting photos of himself kissing Pope Francis\u0027s hand, Mr Evans wrote: \u0027Your holiness save our son.\u0027 Born on May 9 last year, Alfie is said to be in a \u0027semi-vegetative state\u0027 and has a degenerative neurological condition.Specialists at Alder Hey say life-support treatment should stop and judges have accepted evidence that shows further treatment would be futile.On Tuesday Mr Evans asked \u0027Alfie\u0027s Army\u0027 supporters to calm down and quit protesting for a while so they can enjoy time with their son in peace.He said: \u0027Can I ask that after tonight I would really appreciate if everyone has a break from the protesting please?\u0027Me and Kate need to focus on spending precious time with Alfie and focus on the next legal step, keeping the relationship with the staff at ease and peace and make sure no parents are being affected any more.\u0027Earlier this week Merseyside Police called for protesters to respect the safety of staff and patients at the hospital.Chief inspector Chris Gibson said: \u0027While many people have gathered to protest in a peaceful way, Merseyside Police is now investigating a small number of reports, some of which originate from social media, as well as instances of verbal abuse and acts of intimidation from those outside the hospital..\u0027This is extremely unhelpful for all concerned and we are investigating further to establish the full circumstances.\u0027They also expressed \u0027dismay\u0027 and \u0027concern\u0027 over reports supporters of Alfie\u0027s family had gone in to the paediatric intensive care unit at the hospital..An Alder Hey spokesperson said: \u0027We hope that staff will be allowed to continue caring for Alfie and all other children at Alder Hey without interference or disturbance.\u0027  "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/19/12/4B4E925C00000578-0-image-a-77_1524136882394.jpg","title":"Lion looks adopted hipster hairstyle","story":"    Who\u0027s a pretty boy?

North Korea has pursued the goal of developing a nuke that can hit anywhere on earth for decades despite harsh sanctions, and recently announced it had completed the task          Mr Moon spoke ahead of his meeting with Kim next week which will take place inside the Demilitarized Zone - a heavily fortified border between North and South \u0027So first, the South-North Korean summit must make a good beginning, and the dialogue between the two Koreas likely must continue after we see the results of the North Korea-United States summit,\u0027 Moon said.U.S. CIA Director Mike Pompeo visited North Korea last week and met leader Kim Jong Un with whom he formed a \u0027good relationship\u0027, U.S. President Donald Trump said on Wednesday, ahead of a summit planned for May or June.Trump said on Wednesday he hoped the summit would be successful, but warned he would call it off if he did not think it would produce results.Trump told a joint news conference with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe that his campaign of \u0027maximum pressure\u0027 on North Korea would continue until Pyongyang gave up its nuclear weapons.\u0027The United States remains committed to complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearsisation of North Korea,\u0027 U.S. Disarmament Ambassador Robert Wood told a news conference in Geneva on Thursday ahead of a two-week conference on the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.\u0027In terms of the pressure campaign, things we are very interested in are maintaining the pressure, meaning enforcing sanctions, ensuring that the North is not able to get access to funds that help further his nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.\u0027China\u0027s foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told a regular press briefing in Beijing that China supported ending the state of war on the Korean peninsula.\u0027China supports ending the war state on the peninsula at an early date,\u0027 she said. \u0027As a party involved in the peninsula issue, China is willing to play an active role.\u0027Ahead of next week\u0027s summit, Seoul and Pyongyang will also complete the instalment of a telephone hotline between the two leaders on Friday, directly connecting the South\u0027s presidential Blue House and the North\u0027s State Affairs Commission, the South\u0027s presidential spokesman said.Six top South Korean officials will accompany Moon to the summit, including his chief of staff, spy chief, national security adviser and unification, defence and foreign ministers, the spokesman said.North Korea meanwhile will hold a plenary meeting of its ruling party\u0027s central committee on Friday, state media KCNA said on Thursday.The meeting was convened to discuss and decide \u0027policy issues of a new stage\u0027 to meet the demands of the current \u0027important historic period\u0027, KCNA said. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/19/17/4B5099B800000578-5634359-Many_residents_were_trapped_inside_for_hours_as_the_weeds_piled_-a-3_1524154191967.jpg","title":"Tumbleweeds bury homes California Utah","story":"As many as 150 homes in Victorville, California were filled with thousands of tumbleweeds in their front and back yards           Many residents were trapped inside for hours as the weeds piled up as high as the second story or even roofs of homes on MondayDramatic chatter between Southwest flight 1380 pilot and ATCShocking moment man shoves Met Police officer off moving motorbikeNail-biting CCTV shows schoolgirl hiding from gang behind low wallPolice threaten to crush vehicles of those caught \u0027hare coursing\u0027Experience the sights and sounds of New York City in 1911Moment husky \u0027cries\u0027 into owner\u0027s arms after rejection by female dogVideo on board passenger plane which made emergency landing in PhillyThe chilling moment a child killer hauls dead girl in sports bagThieves steal \u0027DIY SOS\u0027 tools as Nick Knowles appeals for helpA high wind warning had to be issued for the region, where gusts reached as fast as 70mph, according to the National Weather Service.While tumbleweeds aren\u0027t an uncommon sight in Victorville, many residents told the Victor Valley Daily Press it was the worst they had ever seen.Nav Mangat said one of her neighbors was trapped in his home for two hours until a clean-up crew from the city could clear the front door and garage. \u0027Yesterday I can\u0027t even stand here in my garage,\u0027 she told KABC. \u0027There were like a hundred of these bushes.\u0027           Clean-up crews were sent from the city to help clear the weeds, which have prickly thorns           The weeds were blown in by high winds, which reached speeds of 35 to 70mph in the region           While tumbleweeds aren\u0027t an uncommon sight in Victorville, many residents said it was the worst they had ever seen\u0027They were just flowing like it was a tornado yesterday.\u0027 Homeowners donned gloves and armed themselves with pitchforks as they tried to hold back what they called the \u0027invasion\u0027 of the tumbleweeds. The weeds, which roll in from open fields in the area, are armed with thorns that can scratch the skin -

Some have even been deported by mistake.This unfortunate cockup reveals how some white British politicians and the Establishment secretly view the Commonwealth.At the Commonwealth Games in Australia the other week, many of the British medal winners will be the grandchildren of Windrush families - we’re proud to call them British when it suits us.The Commonwealth countries need a leader who can speak out in these situations, and demand justice, not someone served by footmen in knee breeches.          The Commonwealth countries need a leader who can speak out in these situations, and demand justice, not someone served by footmen in knee breechesIn 2018, the Commonwealth can’t re-inforce the stereotype of a Regal head, someone who dishes out patronage and attends meaningless ceremonies and military events all over the world.The Commonwealth includes countries who still enforce the death penalty, who are not receptive to gay rights and who don’t think women should be allowed abortions. Navigating all that and pushing for change requires diplomacy, tact, and people skills - something which the Queen possesses in spades.To succeed her, a career politician or a charismatic leader is required. The only downside? They might not own palaces, sycophantic staff or be able to afford champagne and swanky canapes.Is Prince Charles truly the best candidate? He rarely looks at ease in these situations, his life has been spent waiting on the sidelines, being indulged and spoilt, and his relationship with his children has only recently improved.          Is Prince Charles truly the best candidate? He rarely looks at ease in these situations His relationship with his former wife was disastrous. Sensing that the handover might be tricky with some Commonwealth members, the Queen has been using her brand to reinforce the notion that the Royal family are willing to take on new challenges involving young people and sexual equality.Highly paid PR people and Private Secretaries are mounting a charm offensive to launch a second wave of junior Royals into key roles.Princess Eugenie - 8th in line to the throne and 15 other Commonwealth realms, according to her Dad’s website - turned up at a reception this week wearing a short dress and scuffed suede boots - hardly a suitable outfit for someone aspiring to ‘lead’ another democracy.Prince Harry - 5th in line to the UK throne and 15 countries - has just been appointed Commonwealth Youth Ambassador by his granny.He introduced Meghan Markle, his bride to be, to the assembled youth leaders as if they were leading a world-wide crusade for gay rights. It all sounded a bit like a rehearsal for their wedding next month.The notion that Meghan Markle will be touring the world telling other countries about human rights is patronising in the extreme.I don’t doubt for a moment that the couple are sincere and well-intentioned - but will any political leader be swayed by a woman from a TV soap? You might as well send Bono or Sting.           In 2018, the Commonwealth can’t re-inforce the stereotype of a Regal head, someone who dishes out patronage and attends meaningless ceremonies  all over the world"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/19/15/4B37D4A100000578-5634495-image-m-26_1524148767752.jpg","title":"Property consultant conned actress 1m estate told not leave him","story":"A court heard Iain MacMaster, pictured left, did not con actress Claire Gordon, right, out of her £1million estate and told her \u0027it\u0027s not fair to leave everything to me\u0027          Ms Gordon, pictured, left property in Egypt, cash and shares in businesses to MacMaster and fellow developer Morris BenahmuMacMaster was to take 60 per cent of her estate and Benhamu 40 per cent, jurors were told.The two men are accused of falsely claiming she intended them to have it, and that she was was in a \u0027fit and proper state\u0027 to sign a will in her name.The pair are said to have carried out the scam between January 2014 and September 2015.A summary of a police interview MacMaster gave in September 2015 was read to Southwark Crown Court.British company director is extradited to US from Morocco...Bride-to-be hairdresser, 27, paid £3,000 for dream honeymoon...Share this articleMark Halsey, prosecuting, told jurors: \u0027He said that Claire had mentioned making a will, but then she didn\u0027t say anything more about it.

I went through to the girls\u0027 room to waken them up and get Dior ready for school. When I opened the door all I could see of my little girl was her legs sticking out from under the teddy.\u0027She was lying face facing up in the bed but with the big teddy on top of her.

My mum who lives closely arrived and she took over. When the paramedics came they tried as well but it was too late. My little girl had gone.\u0027 Miss Walsh explained that her daughter\u0027s bed had a guard on one side, and she thought that stuffing the gap on other side with soft toys would stop Connie Rose from falling and injuring herself.          Connie\u0027s mother used the toys to stuff a gap between her bed and the wall, to stop her fallingShe added: \u0027I have been blaming myself. I packed the side of the bed with the smaller teddies and place the big one on top thinking that would stop her falling down the side and hurting herself. She did slip down the side but ended up below the big teddy and couldn\u0027t breathe.\u0027I just think now that if I had taken away all the soft toys out of the bed at night, she may have fallen out. She may have only hurt herself. Maybe a broken arm but she would still be with us. I just think that what if I had done this or that instead - but it\u0027s too late.\u0027 Connie Rose was buried on March 21 and mourners released pink balloons into the sky in her memory.

To be covered in toys and maybe princess drapes and that is good. And that is all right during the day but at night they should all be taken away. They don\u0027t need anything on their bed when they go to sleep. Just a cover.

Since then, he spent a lot more time in Florida.\u0027A man who lives opposite Winton\u0027s former residence said: \u0027He was a very nice man. Very agreeable and cheerful. He always gave me a big hello on the street. He was very neighbourly.\u0027A bouquet of white roses lay on the doorstep of Winton\u0027s old house with a card that said: \u0027The kindest man I knew. Always in my heart.\u0027 It was signed \u0027Go Go\u0027. Last night Winton\u0027s agent confirmed his death at home at the age of 62, but no further details about how or why were given. In a moving tribute to his friend David Walliams tweeted today: \u0027Dale was the best company, always outrageous \u0026amp hilarious.

I pray he has found peace\u0027. In June 2016, two months before he was last seen in public, he said: \u0027I would not leave the house for five years. I didn\u0027t want to put one foot in front of the other outside the house. I had a bad break up and I had health issues and I thought, \u0027I want to withdraw\u0027.\u0027A year earlier he failed to make it to his close friend Cilla Black\u0027s funeral, sparking concerns about his health, and had undergone four operations in four years to fix crippling pain in his knees and shoulders.In his 2002 autobiography he came out as gay but revealed his regret at not telling his mother before her death saying in 2008 that nobody had really ever asked him about his sexual orientation. This year he had relaunched his TV career with a new Channel 5 show Dale\u0027s Florida Fly Drive but he died before the series was shown in full. His friend Davina McCall led the tributes last night as she described him as a \u0027lovely, warm, kind, sensitive, generous soul with a touch of naughty!\u0027Comedian David Walliams also said he was \u0027heartbroken\u0027 to hear of the death of his friend, who spoke openly about his battle with depression two years ago.But describing how much fun he was to be around he said: \u0027One night Dale \u0026amp I were going out to dinner \u0026amp he stopped off on the way to buy diet lemonade from a corner shop. He was in there about 20 minutes. When he finally got back in the car I asked \u0027what took you so long?\u0027 \u0026amp he said \u0027sorry David I am very big with the Indian community!\u0027In another anecdote he said: \u0027One afternoon Dale \u0026amp I were out shopping \u0026amp some policeman were standing on the street corner. He gave them a huge wave \u0026amp called out \u0027hello loves, hello darlings!\u0027 I asked why he was saying hello. He replied \u0027always wave at policemen David.

He claims to have suffered injuries to his brain, neck and shoulders      The illusionist (pictured in court on Wednesday) said he passed through the same outdoor alley alone while performing another illusion about 10 minutes earlier, and didn\u0027t notice any debris  The 61-year-old performer is due to return to the witness stand next Tuesday for more testimony in Clark County District Court Copperfield said he didn\u0027t know whether there as a powdery residue near a trash bin in an MGM Grand alley. He said he passed through the same outdoor alley alone while performing another illusion about 10 minutes earlier, and didn\u0027t notice any debris.\u0027If in fact there was construction dust, could that be your fault if someone fell and got hurt?\u0027 Morelli asked.Copperfield responded that he couldn\u0027t answer a hypothetical question before proceedings ended for the day.Copperfield\u0027s lawyers lost pretrial bids to close proceedings to the public to avoid giving away performance secrets, although Judge Mark Denton has said some portions of the illusionist\u0027s testimony might still be conducted behind closed doors. The performer is due to return to the witness stand next Tuesday for more testimony in Clark County District Court.           MGM Grand\u0027s attorney Jerry Popovich told the jury that Cox simply missed a step when he fell and did not slip. He explained that the site where the accident happened, about 22 feet before reaching the door to re-enter the casino, is essentially level with only a 1-degree dropCox, from Kent, claims lasting brain and body injuries and more than $400,000 in medical expenses. He claims to have suffered injuries to his brain, neck and shoulders.He and his wife, Minh-Hahn Cox, are seeking unspecified damages in their lawsuit, which also names as defendants the MGM Grand, show producer Backstage Employment and Referral, and construction firm Team Construction Management.Cox, who was at the show as the highlight of a dream trip to celebrate his 53rd birthday, claims negligence led to his fall.On Tuesday, the magician\u0027s friend and executive producer, Chris Kenner declined to say it was dangerous to lead people along a dark and unknown route over changing floor surfaces of linoleum, cement, carpet, sidewalk and tile. The illusion had been performed thousands of times over the last two decades, with about 55,000 taking part in the last ten years alone and none of them having had a problem, Kenner said.Earlier in the case, MGM Grand\u0027s attorney Jerry Popovich told the jury that Cox simply missed a step when he fell and did not slip. He explained that the site where the accident happened, about 22 feet before reaching the door to re-enter the casino, is essentially level with only a 1-degree drop. Popovich said that 10 minutes before Cox went down, Copperfield had walked through that same area as part of another illusion that did not involve audience participation. He said Copperfield would have notified staff if he had noticed any problem in the route.    Gavin Cox (pictured) was overcome with emotion as opening statements were made in the case. He claims that on returning to Britain after taking part in the trick, he suffered chronic pain while a scan showed a lesion on his brain.He said Copperfield\u0027s assistants hurried him down a secret passage, through a door and outside into the open air. He said: \u0027It was like a fire alarm went off. They were saying Hurry! Run, run, run!\u0027It was total pandemonium. You don’t know where you are going. It’s dark. There are hands pushing you on your back. As I went around a corner, my feet slipped from underneath me and I hit the ground.\u0027Mr Cox says he fell as he ran around the side of the theater.In the interview, he said that he as now forced to wear an oxygen \u0027lung\u0027 at night because he stops breathing, and he spent three months in a Californian brain trauma centre. The couple claimed they had been forced to live in the US for years as the case dragged on.Mrs Cox said in 2016: \u0027We are too broke to go out and Gavin’s injuries prevent us from enjoying a normal life. Gavin once cooked for royalty but now he can’t even bake a muffin because he has nerve damage in his hands and no sense of smell.\u0027 Mr Cox said he blacked out after his fall but remembers the audience cheering at the end of the trick. An ambulance later took Mr Cox to hospital where his right shoulder was found to be dislocated.Two days later he filled out an accident report at MGM and hired a US personal injury lawyer.  Copperfield\u0027s lawyers lost pretrial bids to close proceedings to the public to avoid disclosing performance secrets, although Judge Mark Denton has said some portions of Copperfield\u0027s testimony might still be conducted behind closed doors Once back in Britain, Mr Cox said he began to suffer chronic pain, headaches and confusion. A scan would later show lesions on his brain. But Mrs Cox said NHS waiting lists were ‘too long and he needed immediate treatment’.So the couple returned to Vegas in February 2014. Their travel insurer refused to pay for ongoing treatment, but they were seen under a \u0027medical lien\u0027 – doctors agreed to treat Mr Cox and receive payment only when the lawsuit is settled.Mr Cox\u0027s career had once included years as a chef at London’s Buck’s Club, where he cooked for the Queen Mother, Margaret Thatcher and Dracula actor Christopher Lee, and running a guesthouse in Broadstairs, Kent. But he said in the interview that he has been unable to work since the accident.Having had multiple operations on his back and neck, he said he had been diagnosed with permanent brain damage and a form of Parkinson’s. The Coxes were forced to sell their guesthouse for £515,000 at the end of 2014 and had been living off their savings. At the time of the interview, the Mail On Sunday quoted Copperfield’s lawyers as saying they denied all allegations but could not comment further due to ongoing litigation.They added: ‘This illusion has been performed for more than 15 years and with more than 100,000 participants.

But police believe he assaulted at least 105 between 2002 and 2008. The Parole Board made its decision while taking into account his 19 convictions, and not the 100 or more offences he is suspected of carrying out.

Parole Board chairman Nick Hardwick was then forced to quit.   Justice Secretary David Gauke (left) has admitted he is responsible for the Parole Board\u0027s decision, which eventually saw its chairman Nick Hardwick (right) forced to resign when the ruling was overturned The Crown Prosecution Service  is facing mounting pressure to review the decision not to charge Worboys in connection with some of the 83 cases that police passed files to them on.A spokesman for the CPS said that every rape allegation which met the evidential test was prosecuted. No further charges have been brought forward and the CPS said ti would only review the cases should new evidence surface.  Two weeks ago Justice Secretary David Gauke admitted he is responsible for the Parole Board decision.He told the Sun on Sunday that he did not want the serial sex attacker to be released and that he was pleased the High Court challenge by two victims to overturn ruling was successful.He said: \u0027Clearly, things didn’t go as they should have gone. \u0027Look, I made the decision. I accept responsibility, so I’m not hiding behind my advisers. It’s my responsibility entirely.\u0027The Justice Secretary refused to block the parole board decision as outrage mounted and instead waited for victims to launch a legal challenge.He added: \u0027I felt it ­sensible to take advice from a top barrister and I interrogated that advice and concluded it was right I don’t take the action.\u0027I was pleased it was successful and Worboys remains behind bars — I didn’t want Worboys released.

Put down the phone, stop with the selfies.. and LISTEN. **Cover your NOSE \u0026amp MOUTH.**\u0027 Aviation experts say the masks are essential in ensuring passenger safety during aircraft emergencies.The Federal Aviation Administration calls the masks \u0027the first line of defense against the potentially lethal effects of hypoxia and carbon monoxide poisoning.\u0027 Hypoxia occurs when a person isn\u0027t getting enough oxygen, which can cause dizziness, reduced vision, impaired judgment, unconsciousness and even death. Aircraft manufacturer Airbus say if a plane loses pressure at 40,000 feet, those on board have as little as 18 seconds of \u0027useful consciousness\u0027 without supplemental oxygen.According to flight attendants, at this point the masks should drop from the cabinets overhead and they can then be activated by tugging them towards you.Passengers then need to strap the masks over both their nose and mouth before fastening the white cords behind their heads. In the picture, at least three passengers can be seen pressing the masks to their own faces and only covering their mouths.Mr. Laurie\u0027s post has now been liked and re-tweeted over 20,000 times, as several others voiced their concerns over the passengers\u0027 actions. Jennifer Riordan, 43, a mother of two, was killed on the Southwest Airlines flight from New York to Dallas on Tuesday morning - the first fatal incident in US commercial aviation for nearly a decade. The Boeing 737-700 took off without incident but minutes into the flight, passengers heard an explosion in the left engine, which sent shrapnel flying through the window, shattering the glass and leading oxygen masks to drop.     Terrifying images shot from on board show the carcass of the ruined aircraft engine which malfunctioned mid-airJennifer  was nearly drawn out of the window which was next to her seat and had to be pulled back into her seat by other passengers.After the plane made a rushed emergency landing - she was taken to hospital for emergency treatment but later died.Seven other passengers were also treated for injuries, although it is unclear as yet whether any were suffering the effects of hypoxia or carbon monoxide poisoning. Marty Martinez, 29, began filming in selfie mode in the immediate aftermath of the disaster. Martinez, who runs a Dallas marketing agency, said on Wednesday he wanted to communicate with loved ones, but many social media users attacked him in expletive-laced postings. The hero captain of the plane insists she was just doing her job after safely performing an emergency landing amid the crisis unfolding on board.Tammie Jo Shults showed \u0027nerves of steel\u0027 and kept calm even as she told air traffic officials that a passenger, Jennifer Riordan, had almost been sucked out of the depressurized cabin of the Dallas-bound Boeing 737.But in a statement a day after the mid-air drama, the 56-year-old and First Officer Darren Ellisor said: \u0027We all feel we were simply doing our jobs\u0027.\u0027On behalf of the entire Crew, we appreciate the outpouring of support from the public and our coworkers as we all reflect on one family\u0027s profound loss,\u0027 the two pilots said, adding that their \u0027hearts are heavy\u0027.It comes as it emerged that Shults was once turned down by the Air Force and had even been warned at a high school careers fair that \u0027there were no professional women pilots\u0027. Instead, Mrs Shults was commissioned into the Navy in 1985 and reached the rank of lieutenant commander, said Commander Ron Flanders, the spokesman for Naval Air Forces in San Diego.Women aviators were excluded from combat missions until the month after Mrs Shults got off active duty in March 1993, but Mr Flanders said Mrs Shults flew during Operation Desert Storm trainings as an aggressor enemy pilot.           Jennifer Riordan, 43, was the only person killed on the flight after a piece of shrapnel punctured the window next to her          Tragic images show where Ms Riordan was nearly sucked out of the open window and had to be pulled back in by passengers          A piece of the engine casing discovered by startled residents at the Heidelberg Country Club in Bernville, PA, approximately 60 miles from the landing site          Officials from the FBI have been called in to help investigate the cause of the incident and could be seen helping wrap up the evidenceSouthwest Airlines passenger, 29, trolled for LIVE STREAMING emergency landing | Daily Mail Online"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/19/15/4B50E8A100000578-0-image-m-38_1524147333521.jpg","title":"Queen Prince Charles welcome heads Commonwealth Buckingham Palace","story":"Steal Sophie\u0026#39s style in a floral print dress by SuzannahWith the Duchess of Cambridge on maternity leave, we\u0026#39ve been looking to the rest of the Royal family for some style inspiration recently.

They were not shirkers, but newcomers who have enriched British culture.A blame game is going on, as politicians squabble over who is responsible for destroying the entry papers of over 50,000 Windrush immgrants, many of whom have been refused the right to work, to claim benefits and receive healthcare, and to obtain a British passport, all because the original documents showing their status cannot be found. Some have even been deported by mistake.This unfortunate cockup reveals how some white British politicians and the Establishment secretly view the Commonwealth.At the Commonwealth Games in Australia the other week, many of the British medal winners will be the grandchildren of Windrush families - we’re proud to call them British when it suits us.The Commonwealth countries need a leader who can speak out in these situations, and demand justice, not someone served by footmen in knee breeches.

Sensing that the handover might be tricky with some Commonwealth members, the Queen has been using her brand to reinforce the notion that the Royal family are willing to take on new challenges involving young people and sexual equality.Highly paid PR people and Private Secretaries are mounting a charm offensive to launch a second wave of junior Royals into key roles.Princess Eugenie - 8th in line to the throne and 15 other Commonwealth realms, according to her Dad’s website - turned up at a reception this week wearing a short dress and scuffed suede boots - hardly a suitable outfit for someone aspiring to ‘lead’ another democracy.Prince Harry - 5th in line to the UK throne and 15 countries - has just been appointed Commonwealth Youth Ambassador by his granny.He introduced Meghan Markle, his bride to be, to the assembled youth leaders as if they were leading a world-wide crusade for gay rights. It all sounded a bit like a rehearsal for their wedding next month.The notion that Meghan Markle will be touring the world telling other countries about human rights is patronising in the extreme.I don’t doubt for a moment that the couple are sincere and well-intentioned - but will any political leader be swayed by a woman from a TV soap?

But as the country’s 70th anniversary nears, the strain is showingBen-Gurion Boulevard climbs from the bustling port on Haifa’s Mediterranean shore up Mount Carmel towards the famous Bahai shrine, its gleaming golden dome surrounded by lush terraced gardens. On the south side of the palm-lined road, on a spring lunchtime, the Fattoush restaurant is packed with customers chatting noisily in Arabic and Hebrew over Levantine and fusion salads, cardamom-flavoured coffee and exquisite Palestinian knafeh desserts. “I prefer to talk of shared existence rather than coexistence,” says Yona Yahav, the veteran Jewish mayor. “Haifa’s Jews and Arabs are the same Jews and Arabs as in Jerusalem, but here things work in a stable way.” Yahav’s office is lined with portraits of his predecessors, the first two wearing Ottoman tarbooshes. The street outside bears the name of one of them, Hassan Bey Shukri. Yahav flourishes a copy of a Hebrew newspaper notice mourning Shukri’s death in 1940. “I can promise you that this won’t happen if I die,” he jokes. He is also keen to point out that his secretary, Reem, is an Arab. “I can’t tell you that all Jews love Arabs and vice versa, but people do feel safe here.” No one questions that the city is special. “If all of Israel and Palestine could be like Haifa, I’d be happy,” muses Amjad Iraqi, a twentysomething Palestinian intellectual. “It’s not lovey-dovey. Life is essentially segregated but every community accepts that you can do your own thing. It’s not perfect, but it’s still better than everywhere else.” Asaf Ron, who runs the municipally funded Beit Ha’Gefen cultural centre, argues that it is all about promoting empathy. “Many Israeli Jews don’t know any Arabs. We need to break down stereotyping and fear.”Ayman Odeh, Israel’s most prominent Arab politician, lives in the Kababir neighbourhood, with its handsome mosque and stunning views over an azure sea. He also believes his home town is different. He served on the city council before being elected to the Knesset in 2015. “The situation between Jews and Arabs has always been better in Haifa than anywhere else in Israel, but it is far from equal,” he insists. “The mood is good and there is a sense of sanity. But it is not an island.” The local HQ of Odeh’s party, the Democratic Front for Peace and Equality, is on Ben-Gurion Boulevard opposite Fattoush. It is ironic that the street is named after David Ben-Gurion, the Jewish state’s founder and first prime minister. But there are many similar examples: the Istiqlal (“Independence”) mosque is at the junction of Shavei Zion (“Returnees to Zion”) and Kibbutz Galuyot (“the Ingathering of the Exiles”) streets. Zionism Avenue snakes across the Carmel to the downtown Arab quarter of Wadi Nisnas. Identity issues will be in the air in Haifa this month and next when Israel celebrates the 70th anniversary of its independence and Palestinians mourn the Nakba, or “catastrophe”, that the 1948 war represented for them. “Arabs don’t take part in Independence Day celebrations,” says Yahav. “They don’t feel it is their holiday.” Johnny Mansour, a historian from the Greek Catholic community, will be joining a “march of return” to some of the hundreds of Arab villages destroyed after the war – the same symbolic commemoration that has triggered the recent deadly upsurge of violence on the border between Israel and the Gaza Strip. Fattoush, proudly flaunting its Palestinian nationalist credentials, will be closed to mark the occasion.Haifa once represented modernity and progress but feels less dynamic these days. In the twilight years of the Ottoman empire it was the terminus for a branch line of the Damascus-Hejaz railway. Allenby Street is named for the British general who freed the town in 1918, soon after the Balfour declaration backed the establishment of a “Jewish national home” in Palestine. The port opened in 1933, followed by an oil pipeline starting in Iraq. At that time, explains historian Motti Golani, half the Jewish population spoke Arabic. During the second world war, when Italian aircraft bombed the city, Jews and Arabs huddled together in basements. By 1948, the population was 70,000 Jews and 65,000 Arabs. But war changed that. In April, as fighting raged and the British prepared to leave, all but 3,000 Arabs were expelled or fled to Lebanon or the West Bank. The history of that fateful year remains bitterly contested: the Jewish mayor – unaware of military planning – urged Arab leaders to stay but they felt unable to comply with the terms for a truce. Newly arrived Jewish immigrants moved into abandoned homes in Wadi Salib. Many houses, defined as “absentee property”, are now in a state of advanced decline. The city’s flea market is held in the shadow of a crumbling Turkish bathhouse, Hammam al-Pasha. Impressive new glass and steel towers, housing the city’s courts, loom over the ruins. Haifa occupies an important place in Palestinian collective memory thanks to local luminaries such as Emile Habibi and Toufik Toubi. Habibi wrote the best-known novel by a Palestinian in Israel: The Secret Life of Saeed: The Pessoptimist. Etched on his grave are the words: “I remain in Haifa.” Acre-born Ghassan Kanafani, assassinated by the Mossad, captured the essence of the conflict in his novella Return to Haifa, in which a visiting Palestinian refugee encounters an Israeli woman who survived Auschwitz. Palmer Gate, the entrance to the port, is where Holocaust survivors came ashore and terrified Palestinians fled by boat to Acre or Beirut, mostly never to return. Haifa’s tolerance is tested at regular intervals. In October 2000, at the start of the second intifada, 13 Arab citizens were shot dead by police while demonstrating in solidarity with their kinfolk in the occupied West Bank and Gaza. Yahav’s predecessor ensured the city remained calm. It was harder three years later when a woman suicide bomber from Jenin blew herself up and killed 21 others in Maxim’s restaurant – jointly owned by Jews and Arabs. In the Lebanon war of 2006, a missile fired by Hezbollah killed two elderly Arabs. Successive Israeli wars against Hamas in Gaza – in 2008-9, 2012 and again in 2014 – saw anger flare. “In Haifa, Arabs and Jews live alongside each other, but when there is tension they move apart,” argues Amjad Shbita of Sikkuy, the Association for the Advancement of Civic Equality. “Haifa’s coexistence is the best in Israel, but it can still be easily damaged.” Palestinians in Haifa and across Israel have grown closer to relatives and friends beyond the pre-1967 “green line” border with the West Bank, but their lives are very different and they have their own issues close to home. In 2013, protests erupted over a government plan to demolish the homes of“unrecognised” Bedouin communities in the Negev and build a Jewish town. Two years ago, after an unusually hot autumn, fires consumed large areas of the Carmel, triggering accusations by rightwing Jewish politicians of an “arson intifada” – though no one was ever charged. Haifa-based NGOs have their work cut out tackling discrimination in social services and budget allocations. The worst poverty is in Halissa, a mainly Arab neighbourhood where violence is blamed on rivalry between Bedouin clans and relocated collaborators from the West Bank. “The Israeli idea of coexistence is about a majority and a minority – the strong and the weak,” observes Tom Mehager of Adalah (Justice), which is devoted to securing the rights of Israel’s Arab citizens – and has vocally condemned the army’s killing of Palestinians in Gaza. “Coexistence is not equality. Speaking the same language and eating hummus together doesn’t mean Jews and Arabs are equal.” Jafar Farah, who runs the Mossawa (Equality) centre, compares the relationship between the two peoples to one between “a rider and a horse”. And that, he insists, “is how Yona Yahav deals with the Arab community in Haifa.”Education provides important insights. In Haifa, as elsewhere, Jewish and Arab children mostly attend separate schools. Many Arab children (the majority are Christians), study in fee-paying church schools, and a few dozen in Jewish ones. There are no Jews in Arab public schools, where standards are poor. The curricula are different too. “People want to stay within their own communities to speak in their native languages, have days off on their own holidays, and learn about their own history, culture and religion,” says Asaf Ron. “Assimilation through attending the other community’s schools is a free choice that almost no one chooses.” The Yad beyad (“Hand in Hand”) private network of bilingual schools complains about long waiting lists and a struggle to secure municipal support. In its kindergarten in Hadar, Arab and Jewish six-year-olds sing songs and are captivated by nursery rhymes that interchange Hebrew and Arabic – a heartwarming but highly unusual sight. “The whole country is based on separation in a very profound way,” says Merav Ben-Nun, its community organiser. Older Palestinians tend to be relaxed about this, but younger activists can be contemptuous about condescension or racism towards “colourful” natives. Many are keen to assert their growing self-confidence in the face of what they condemn as Israeli “apartheid and settler colonialism” – in the words of a strategy paper that was drawn up in the cafe Fattoush last December. The closure of Haifa’s Arab theatre, al-Midan (“The Square”), is cited as an example: state funding was withdrawn after it staged a play about a Palestinian security prisoner. The defiant response was to create an autonomous crowdfunded alternative – al-Khashabi (“The Stage”). Its Arabic-language performances are translated into English, but conspicuously not into Hebrew. “Independent Palestinian institutions do not believe in coexistence,” explains Al-Khashabi’s director, Bashar Murkus. “We believe in dialogue from a position of strength and independence.” His colleague Khoulood Tannous flatly refuses even to use the “c” word. “No one is shelling us here,” she adds. “It’s no Gaza, nor the West Bank. It’s mind games.” Politician Ayman Odeh’s disapproving view is that influence should matter more than identity to Israel’s Palestinian minority, in Haifa and beyond, and that joint struggle is the key to a more equal future. “Arabs are developing autonomy at the expense of Arab-Jewish cooperation,” warns Sikkuy’s Shbita. Neither side harbours illusions about the other. “In Haifa it’s not hate, but there’s not too much love either,” is the stark conclusion of Omer Shaffer, a Jewish Technion postgraduate who was both moved and surprised when an Arab colleague told him to “take care” when he went off to do a stint of reserve army duty at a checkpoint in the West Bank. “It’s pretty indifferent. We’ve found a way to ignore each other without killing each other.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/423063c047513fafefe978f5f2ead6c4eda3faca/0_443_4458_2675/master/4458.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=ea5fb61730582349d323db2fbe6778d6 1240w","title":"political arrogance david cameron brexit","story":"It has never been difficult to distinguish between David Cameron and a humble man plagued by self-doubt.The former prime minister’s most prominent trait in power – and probably the reason he lost it – was his combination of blithe confidence with peevishness when challenged by people he judged to be his social inferiors, which covers most people. So it is not surprising to learn now, in a TV interview, that Cameron is satisfied with the decision he made to call an EU referendum (“I believe I was right”), while also believing the outcome was a bad one (“we’ve taken the wrong course”).No one likes admitting error. For public figures it can be ruinous. That is why political apologies tend to adopt the passive voice – “mistakes were made” “sorry for upset that was caused” “sorry if offence was taken”. There is nothing new in this, but it feels as if political responsibility has become especially diffuse recently. There is a culture of treating bad things that happen as acts of nature, hurricanes that formed somewhere out at sea, beyond view, and blew in without discernible cause.Theresa May, under duress, apologised for anxiety caused to the Windrush generation, whose entitlement to the security and privileges of British citizenship was callously shredded. But the prime minister is unable to articulate what, or who, caused the anxiety. Earlier this week she tried to deflect blame on to the last Labour government, as if no one would notice that her narration of the scandal omitted the operation of the Home Office between 2010 and 2016, when she was in charge of it.May’s motivation here is old-fashioned tactical evasion and partisan counter-attack, albeit not very effectively executed. But she also conveys a sincere belief in her own immunity from blame. She is not conceited in the haughty Cameron mould. She certainly doesn’t carry herself with effortless social aplomb. But her shyness must not be mistaken for modesty. She has a different kind of arrogance: a pious certainty of moral purpose that allows her to imagine her critics must be driven by motives shabbier than hers. (This, notably, is a trait she shares with the leader of the opposition.)Partly that is just a feature of a long-serving politician. A certain thickness of skin is required to survive Westminster’s vicious contact sport. And once you get into the habit of surviving criticism, it is easy to evolve the belief that none of it is justified.But there is a more profound diffusion of responsibility in British politics right now. It flows from the perversity of a government committed to a course of action that the incumbent prime minister could not bring herself to recommend to the country in a referendum. A monumental, epoch-defining thing is happening. Yet no one who believed in the idea before it became a political reality has executive control over the outcome.Boris Johnson, the highest-ranking leave campaigner in government, would rather hint that he is unhappy with the choices May is taking than demonstrate the courage required to unseat her and test different choices in practice. The foreign secretary embodies a common desire to enjoy the status of an office without the responsibility contained in that office. He wanted his ambition to be inflated by the spirit of Brexit, but not to own the consequences of Brexit.Johnson was not in Cameron’s cabinet, but the model of being pro-leave in government, without having to explain how a government might safely go about leaving, was pioneered by the former prime minister. He was so confident of winning the referendum that he allowed Tory Brexiteers to campaign against him without surrendering the security of their ministerial berths. He suspended cabinet responsibility, allowing colleagues to serve the government in the morning, criticise government policy in the afternoon, and join rallies with the government’s sworn enemies in the evening.Brexiteers have subsequently been accused of wanting to have their cake and eat it. But for years Cameron indulged radical Euroscepticism as if it were a manageable eccentricity or cultural foible, wholly compatible with the demands of responsible government. He ran the magic cake shop for Tory politicians.He did this because he worried about splitting the party and imagined that was the likelier hazard than Britain actually leaving the European Union. When it turned out he was wrong, he shrugged and left the stage, humming a little tune, with the jaunty gait of a man who has never had to clear up his own mess whose tables have always been laid before he arrives and cleared by the staff after he leaves.And now, nearly two years later, he tells us he thinks he made the right choices. Former prime ministers aren’t generally in the business of trashing their own legacies and, since the Brexit plebiscite is certain to be Cameron’s biggest contribution to the history books, he doesn’t have much incentive to think of it as a monumental blunder. Also, his position is logically consistent. A democrat can be glad that the nation was consulted and accept, with a heavy heart, a disappointing verdict.But Cameron’s heart doesn’t sound heavy. His manner is as breezy as ever. He seems to consider two notions – that the referendum was a good idea and that Brexit is a bad idea – as distinct entities in time and space and not part of a political sequence defined by actions for which he had responsibility.He doesn’t have to be sorry that the referendum was held. But he might, as a courtesy to those who agree with his verdict on the result and who now live with the consequences, sound a bit sorry that he failed to win the argument that he gambled with other people’s money and jobs, miscalculated the odds and blew it. He may not have wanted Brexit, but he still has to own it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d7a6e9e7657f6b5bd0877bca6cddc1da01df39c8/40_0_1713_1028/master/1713.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=e5b00c9a569ab9ada87e0522ee9574f4 1240w","title":"theresa may customs union brexit","story":"After last night’s Brexit defeat in the Lords, May should commit to staying in the customs union before MPs force her handDid Brexit seem to slip out of sight, forgotten amid Syrian bombing, plastic-straw banning or the shaming Windrush scandal? It’s back from Easter with a roar, as the Lords on Wednesday delivered a walloping vote supporting the customs union.The 123-vote defeat for the government was far greater than expected, backed as it was by 24 Tory peers, several of whom were former ministers. There are five more days of Lords Brexit debate on the withdrawal bill, including defining a “meaningful vote” on the final deal, so expect more fireworks.The Lords’ fiercest Brexiters warn against – or aim to foment – a constitutional crisis, as Lord Forsyth accused them of “putting peers against the people”. When the Lords’ amendments go back to the Commons, a probable 10 Tory MPs may back them on the customs union – Dominic Grieve is reportedly confident.This is crunch time. As both houses begin to engage in the real battle, this becomes the greatest constitutional risk of our lifetime. Until now, many MPs have tiptoed a fine line between the people’s will and protecting their country’s future. Do MPs take their lead from a one-off referendum or their duty to defend the nation from the clear and present danger of a brutal break with our vital trading partners? The time is short: those many Tory MPs who well know the madness of no deal or a hard deal, yet fear their constituents’ wrath, face that dilemma right now, in public, with nowhere to hide. This is when being an MP gets tough, separating those in craven fear of their electorates from Burkian believers in a higher duty.Keir Starmer this morning sounded confident on the Today programme that enough Tory MPs will vote to stay in the customs union. People didn’t vote on how to leave the EU, he said. Theresa May and David Davis both pledged the UK would keep “the exact same benefits” as it leaves – and that means, at the very least, staying in the customs union. Every week that passes reveals new impossibilities in leaving it, as one industry after another discovers how the nightmarish obstacles of border checks and tariffs will wreck their businesses.As for trade, by now any half-awake MP who is not sticking their fingers in their ears to block inconvenient facts will have understood what leaving the customs union means. As Starmer points out in his calmly reasoned style, leaving the customs union results not just in the loss of EU trade, but also the loss of 37 trade agreements with 67 countries outside Europe. What kind of fantasy imagines our one country alone can replicate, let alone improve on, those deals? Just one example: Lord Bilimoria last night told the Lords he had talked to India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, and trade with the UK, minimal now, is a very low priority.By the EU summit in June, the most tendentious issues must be resolved, with none tougher than the question of the Irish border. One Tory commentator recently suggested drones could conduct checks from the air to avoid the pulling down of customs-post cameras by outraged border-dwellers. But the more bizarre the solutions proposed, the more blindingly obvious it has become that the whole of the UK staying in the customs union is the only viable option.Donald Tusk warns there will be no deal, no transition, without an Irish solution. The deal will have to pass the European parliament, whose largest group is led by Manfred Weber, who this week declared: “We are all Irish”, his stout solidarity echoing President Kennedy’s famous “Ich bin ein Berliner” as he stood by the Berlin wall. Our European neighbours have noted the abominable treatment of the Windrush generation, as they decide whether to trust Theresa May’s “hostile environment” Home Office to treat their 3.5 million citizens in the UK well. She and her “nasty party” have truly turned us into a “nasty country” in their eyes.May’s folly in laying out red lines becomes clearer with each retreat she is forced to make. Had she started out on the path to Brexit with a pragmatic openness, she would have saved herself one humiliation after another. Her whips will be out arm-twisting and counting their vote. She would be well advised to get her retreat in first this time, and concede to staying in the customs union before the Commons vote."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e01aac3802d1606b2d7b6aa793fdcb0854f659f4/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=0481c63788a426603c9b03f7d20780ed 1240w","title":"kendrick pulitzer black artists excellence beyonce grammys creativity equality","story":"This week the unparalleled contributions of black performers were finally recognised by the establishment. Why has it taken so long?Did she just say … Kendrick Lamar? The satisfied little smile on Pulitzer prize administrator Dana Canedy’s face as she announced the final award of the afternoon confirmed what I thought I surely had misheard. In awarding the first Pulitzer for a hip-hop album and artist, the music jury, which included the jazz violinist Regina Carter and Columbia professor Farah Jasmine Griffin, cited Lamar’s “vernacular authenticity” and “affecting vignettes … on African-American life”. In other words, the boy can rap.It has been an abundant week for black excellence: Black Panther was certified the third highest-grossing film in US box-office history Beyoncé delivered a jaw-dropping performance at Coachella and yes, Kendrick Lamar won a Pulitzer prize. We seem to be having a moment. But is it a moment of increased creativity, or just increased recognition for what we’ve been doing all along?The surprise of Lamar’s win comes, in part, from the fact that the Pulitzers don’t announce finalists ahead of time. But there’s also, obviously, another element: no one expects a young black rapper to win one of the fanciest prizes in the land. Despite the fact that black Americans have long been at the vanguard of popular music and culture – evidenced, in part, by hip-hop overtaking rock this year to officially become the top-selling musical genre – there is still a gaping chasm between black artists’ creative achievements and how that work is acknowledged by the white mainstream.Beyoncé’s riveting performance at Coachella last weekend is just one example. With her all-black marching band and string section, Formation-infused rendition of James Weldon Johnson’s “black national anthem” Lift Every Voice and Sing, and tireless vocals and choreography, she gave us a loving salute to historically black college culture that was not only artistically impressive, but a technical feat, with abundant pyrotechnics, a giant bleacher-style set, dozens of musicians and dancers in constant, meticulous motion, and top-level live video editing that is tough to get in a single take.But she was also the first woman of colour to headline the festival in its 20-year history. She is the most beloved artist on the face of the planet, but had to watch Adele, a huge Beyoncé fan, reluctantly accept the 2017 Grammy for Album of the Year over her. In previous years, Beyoncé lost that award to Beck and to Taylor Swift.There’s a reason Kanye West ran up to a different award stage, at the Video Music awards in 2009, to snatch the microphone from Taylor Swift to deem Beyoncé’s Single Ladies “one of the best videos of all time”– because mainstream institutions rarely give black artists their due. You can hold your breath waiting on that recognition or you can take matters – and mics – into your own hands.This reality harks back to what so many black children are taught by our parents: that we have to “work twice as hard to earn half as much”. That to succeed, compromises and considerations have to be made. Tina Knowles, in hearing her daughter’s idea for a Coachella show with an HBCU (historically black colleges and universities) theme for a mostly white audience, thought perhaps it would go over their heads. (And it did.) Beyoncé’s response? “At this point in my life and my career, I have a responsibility to do what’s best for the world and not what is most popular.”If you know you might not ever get a top award for your work, perhaps that allows you the creative licence to do whatever you want. For Beyoncé, whose racial politics did not discernibly enter her work until Lemonade (2016), that has meant celebrating the Black Panthers at the Super Bowl and talking about police brutality in the Formation video. At Coachella, it meant creating her own sorority, “Beta Delta Kappa”, complete with step show and an initiation – for a “historically Beyoncé college or university”. As someone who attended an HBCU, it felt so good, so special, to be directly spoken to like that. Beyoncé said she hoped young people of all races would feel inspired to further research the references made in her performance. But she didn’t make that beautiful performance for everybody. She made it for us.The same goes for Lamar and Damn. It’s an album that is explicitly political, openly black and undeniably good. His Pulitzer resonates, in part, because it’s a deviation from the norm of overlooking black artists for their unparalleled contributions to culture.It is also a major institution’s belated acknowledgment of a genre that has been award-worthy for decades. For the Pulitzers, Grammys and others, the first person of colour to do something often happens long after the founding of the organisation. Though it’s exciting to see Lamar, Beyoncé, Ava DuVernay, Tiffany Haddish and Donald Glover be so publicly lauded, it does raise the question: why did it take so long?Every year that black people and other marginalised groups get shut out from big awards (which could be every year), there are two reactions: the demand for inclusion, and the demand to “create our own awards”. There are those who seek the legitimising kiss of an Academy and there are those who know it’s not by us, or for us.The Pulitzer board’s “special citations”, which are only occasionally given, illustrate a telling pattern: Duke Ellington, John Coltrane and Thelonious Monk were only honoured long after their deaths Alex Haley was cited for Roots in 1977 when he just as easily could have won for The Autobiography of Malcolm X. It reminds me of Spike Lee’s “special” Oscar awarded in 2015 it smacks of a consolation prize.With someone as culturally invested as Lamar, it’s important to remember that a Pulitzer does not legitimate him, his work, or his art form. Though it be middle-aged, with a Harvard archive and research institute specialising in it, hip-hop has never needed formal recognition of its merits.And for black artists, who so often get passed over for recognition, many times in favour of non-black artists doing approximately the same thing (see: Macklemore beating Lamar for best rap album at the 2014 Grammys), that distinction – a guest at the table, or seated at the head – might mean the difference between the freedom to create, and the hope that one day, that kiss will be for you.It’s wonderful to see them celebrated and deified but Kendrick, Beyoncé, Lena Waithe, Jordan Peele, Cardi B, and so many more were creating works we love long before the establishment paid attention. In other words, if a black artist does her work in the woods and the white mainstream isn’t there to see it, doesn’t she still slay?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c7726b621fc69001134046e888ac3da5e7b66529/0_68_5120_3072/master/5120.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=5229b6698b6ee7129d50c31835627332 1240w","title":"cross party inquiry school funding","story":"Plan suggests MPs are unhappy with way issue has slipped down Downing Street’s agendaMPs are in danger of starting a turf war with the Department for Education, after the education select committee announced a wide-ranging inquiry into funding for schools and colleges in England.Announcing the inquiry, the committee’s chair, the Conservative MP Robert Halfon, said he wanted the the inquiry to promote an ambitious “10-year vision for education investment” supported by the public.The announcement suggests many MPs regard school funding as a major concern among voters, and are unhappy at the way the issue has slipped down Downing Street’s agenda despite its importance in swaying votes at the last election.Lucy Powell, the Labour MP for Manchester Central, said the inquiry would be a cross-party effort intended to be a major piece of work. “At the last election school funding generated a lot of concern,” she said. “What we want to do is look beyond the short term, and see what schools and colleges need to sustain education in this country.”Paul Whiteman, the general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said: “This is an important move from the education select committee. School and college funding is the issue that just won’t go away. There are too many parents, teachers, governors and school leaders pushing for more money for their children for the government to ignore these calls any longer.”In a call for evidence, the education committee said its inquiry would “examine whether a longer-term plan is needed for investment in education and what resources are required to ensure schools and colleges get the support they need”.MPs will also look at the effectiveness of government policies such as the pupil premium, which gives schools additional funds for pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds, and the implementation of the controversial new national funding formula for schools.“The prime minister recently signaled a new approach to funding the NHS. I hope the education committee can help to make the case for a similar plan for expenditure on our schools and colleges,” Halfon said.“Young people are in compulsory education for around 13 years, yet government only plans investment in education every three or four years.“We need to move to a situation where education funding is not driven primarily by Treasury processes but rather by a long-term strategic assessment of our national priorities for education and skills.”Halfon’s remarks were described as “a breath of fresh air” by Geoff Barton, the head of the Association of School and College Leaders, which represents many secondary school heads.“The funding crisis is putting hard-won education standards at risk and damaging social mobility. Our young people deserve better,” Barton said.The committee is likely to further annoy the government next month, when it hears evidence from the former chancellor George Osborne on the educational ide affecting schools in the north of England."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1f95634c47041999bde41c8637f1e2acfa3541c9/50_0_1170_702/master/1170.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=2204b12a7c9f7a2bec2a51fcad2b6b67 1240w","title":"which decade was best to live in heres what we learned at the movies","story":"The Grease rerelease might fill us with nostalgia for the 50s, but from serial killers to terrible haircuts, other eras don’t look quite so appealing•Sign up for Film Today and get our film team’s highlights of the dayYou’d live in the 1950s, wouldn’t you? You have seen Grease and Stand By Me and Back to the Future, so you know it was a carefree decade full of dancing and childhood adventure and songs about cars that can somehow bring schoolgirls to orgasm. Even now, 40 years after it was first released, Grease still feels like an escape.For the most part, cinema has been kind to the 50s. The Shawshank Redemption found uplift in suicide and incarceration, M*A*S*H retroactively transformed the Korean War into a goonish cavalcade of knockabout high jinks, and Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull managed to take the decade’s constant palpable fear of comprehensive nuclear obliteration and leverage it into a vehicle for slapstick fridge jokes. So long as you ignore stuff such as Vera Drake and Badlands and The Last Picture Show, you would totally live in the 1950s.But, using a similar formula, would you want to live in any other recent decade? Let’s find out.Nope. No. Absolutely not. Sure, it was the decade of free love and the Beatles, but watch almost every post-60s film and you will know what a relentlessly abhorrent decade the 60s was. Gay? A Single Man taught us that you would experience enough loss to give you a fatal heart attack. Mentally unwell? One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest depicted the outright savagery you would encounter. And if you were young enough to be drafted, God help you. Two words: Apocalypse Now. And three more words: Full Metal Jacket, not to mention Platoon or Born on the Fourth of July or Good Morning Vietnam. However, if you still need convincing – and, truly, I am sorry to have to point this out to you – Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me was also set in the 1960s. The horror. The horror.Once again, hard pass. Judging by the films made about them, the 70s were almost comically bleak. Look at Zodiac and Summer of Sam and you’ll see that the entire decade was absolutely riddled with real-life serial killers. Watch Rob Zombie’s one-two of The House of 1000 Corpses and The Devil’s Rejects and you’ll see it was just as full of fictional serial killers. If you lived in the 70s, you were doomed from the outset. The haircuts were bad, the politics were bad and the clothes were bad. Even something as treacly as My Girl was essentially a dire warning that anyone with the temerity to fall in love in the 1970s would end up dead by bees. Avoid.Hey, now we’re talking. Cinematically the 1980s was the decade of The Wedding Singer, Adventureland and Hot Tub Time Machine a decade where nothing bad happened and everyone could get rich and goof off like it was the 1950s all over again. Even Fargo and American Psycho (both set in 1987) could shrug off numerous grisly murders with Phil Collins references, because what the hell? It was the 80s! But the haircuts, boy oh boy. What were those guys in Precious and No Country for Old Men thinking? Thank God nobody could tag Anton Chigurh on Facebook back then.Of course, being more recent than the other decades, there are fewer 90s revivals to choose from. However, Edward Zwick’s Love and Other Drugs, – which is genuinely intolerable to sit through – can’t help but paint the decade poorly. Other 90s movies include I, Tonya and The Informant!, along with some of Straight Outta Compton, some of Notorious, some of One Day and some of the Adam Sandler film Click, none of which do enough to conjure a full picture of what the decade was really like. However, you could argue that cinema doesn’t need to remind you what the 90s were like, because I’m still alive and happy to tell you at length how rubbish they were. Honestly, just ask."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8339a666bdeec2d8eb65868d0ae33335e2e7f40f/255_59_1678_1006/master/1678.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=b24acfbf83f6083d457ff80d1b051cbe 1240w","title":"liverpool success coutinho klopp genius","story":"I have heard Jürgen Klopp cite inspirations as varied as heavy metal music and Rocky Balboa so\u0026nbspI\u0026nbspwouldn’t be surprised if the Liverpool manager\u0026nbspwas also familiar with Aristotle. After all, Klopp showed in January that his football philosophy is very much in line with the great Greek thinker who believed that “the whole is greater than the sum of its parts”.Klopp shocked many in the football world when almost four months ago he sanctioned the sale of his most technically gifted player, Philippe Coutinho, who had been outstanding in the first half of the season and did not replace him like for like, causing supporters and pundits to question everything from his judgment to his sanity. Instead he recruited a centre-back in Virgil van Dijk and trusted his instinct that the team would improve as a consequence.If you reflect on some of the commentary and analysis\u0026nbspof Liverpool at the end of the January transfer window you would assume that their performances would tail off without the genius and creativity of Coutinho and that they could not possibly withstand the loss of a world-class player.Instead fast forward to mid‑April and I cannot remember a time when Liverpool have been in such a strong position and fans so hopeful in the short and long term to fight for the top trophies at home and in Europe.The narrative which Klopp has superbly orchestrated is a story about the victory of team functionality, philosophy and identity where the importance of team chemistry, understanding of inidual roles within a system and collectivism is evident. This is vital in a sport where increasingly more importance is placed on the inidual superstar and the size of transfer fees and wages that come with that kind of player.What Liverpool have achieved this season, especially since Coutinho moved to Barcelona and they acquired Van\u0026nbspDijk, should be lauded and studied by fans, pundits and aspiring coaches such as me in understanding that success can be built even while losing top inidual attacking players if you have a fundamental style of play that enables a team to outweigh the sum of its parts and produce not just winning football but get supporters of all allegiances off their seats every time they play.Klopp has shown that you can improve a side while selling your best player if you cater to the needs of your most productive players in the way that you play and it is no coincidence that the signing of Alex Oxlade‑Chamberlain has tactically enabled the likes of Sadio Mané, Roberto Firmino and the outstanding Mo\u0026nbspSalah to be even more of a threat.Oxlade-Chamberlain, while a gifted footballer, does not have the technical ability of Coutinho but what he does bring is an athletic dynamism and power that Coutinho doesn’t possess and an extreme intensity which creates a platform for Liverpool’s lightning transitions where the likes of Mané and Salah cause havoc. It was evident in the first leg of the Champions League quarter-final against Manchester City where in that first half their pressing, counterpressing and attacking transitions were incredible and I question whether, if Coutinho had been playing instead of Oxlade-Chamberlain, Liverpool would have been quite as dynamic, intense and productive.Also, in addressing their need for a top centre-half Liverpool now possess an added defensive steel, giving their outstanding front three the opportunity and foundation to score and create goals. I also look at the fundamental way Klopp sets out his teams and the way that iniduals within his system have improved because they know what is expected of them.Andrew Robertson, Trent Alexander-Arnold, Mané,\u0026nbspSalah, Firmino and even a veteran in James\u0026nbspMilner\u0026nbspare raising their game week after week and have\u0026nbspplayed an integral part in implementing the principles of Klopp’s coaching while justifying the faith he places not on reputation or transfer fee but the performances of those he trusts.It all comes down to team functionality and forward planning, and this can be achieved only with a top manager who understands and is faithful to his style of play regardless of the inevitable criticism he faces when times get tough. Pep Guardiola and Klopp have been criticised in this country for sticking to their football principles when results have not been up to scratch but this comes with the territory and is understandable, while the bigger picture shows that recruitment and improving the players on an inidual level increases their monetary value and gives the football club a vision and plan for the longer term.Selling Coutinho for almost £150m is a great example of this. He has been replaced in the team by a relatively young player in Oxlade-Chamberlain, who possesses a completely different football profile but fits perfectly into the team’s philosophy at a fraction of the price and has improved the team’s functionality and chemistry overall.This is managerial genius and it not only keeps the fans happy but also the directors and shareholders who are always checking the club spreadsheets!This Liverpool journey has only just begun and I am excited to see where it ends both this season and in years to come – but it is also a story of how we need to see the whole picture, as fans, coaches and in the media, that matches are rarely won by one superstar but by the collaboration and collectivism of 11 players committed to the functionality of the team."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f69233fcc7a667a4cbe78bcb8dfbf1718052e1fb/0_165_3400_2040/master/3400.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=9b7848e42b8087c3cd97dc2bddab2c2d 1240w","title":"mousa dembele stuttering striker complete midfielder fa cup tottenham","story":"Never mind that his name is a mystery. A\u0026nbspplayer who, at the age of 30, is improving to the point where one his former managers describes him as the best midfielder in the world and Mauricio Pochettino has ranked him alongside Diego Maradona and Ronaldinho deserves to be remembered.But how? As Moussa Dembélé, which was how he was known from birth until a couple of years ago? Or as Mousa Dembélé, as everybody writes his name now? Mousa (let’s go with the latest version) had been coy about it. “It’s a long story,” he told a Belgian journalist before Euro 2016. Then he revealed in a Belgian magazine that it was in fact a short, simple one. When he extended his passport his name was put down with one ‘s’ by accident. Dembélé said he decided to keep it that way.There is another Moussa Dembélé in international football, a Frenchman, nine years younger, who plays for Celtic and who quality-wise does not come close. People who know the Belgian Dembélé say it is typical of him to keep a bit of a mystery, to not always want to come across as the nice, balanced guy he is. They also say it was probably out of kindness to his namesake that he did not take any action.One certainty as Dembélé prepares to play for Tottenham against Manchester United in Saturday’s FA Cup semi-final is that he is the complete midfielder. One team-mate describes him as a ballerina, another as a tank, but they all think he is the best player in this Spurs side.When Dembélé came to England in 2010, signed by Fulham, he was a striker now he is a midfielder, albeit one hard to categorise. He is not a typical playmaker, nor a holding midfielder or box-to-box-player. He is not merely a Zola-esque technician or a pure Keane-esque tackler he is all this combined and more.Dembélé the person is just as multifaceted. “Sometimes I think: ‘Am I crazy?’” he told the Belgian writer Raf Willems for his book Sympathy for the Devils about Belgian players in the Premier League. “I like African music but also R\u0026ampB, rap, alternative rock and classic. Put down Chinese instrumental, ballet, lounge and Malian kora as well.”As the child of a mother from the small Belgian town of Mol and a father from Mali and the streets of multicultural Antwerp, he understands different cultures. “I can empathise with different cultural expressions and am open to things that seem strange at first sight. I notice that I have both African and Belgian characteristics.”And English. Rather than watching football on television he goes to West End musicals, or at least he did until he became a father.He was never one for trouble. His mother could let him go on to the street and into gym halls to play football and he would be home for dinner without being asked. She motivated him to develop his skills by taping the light switch so he could turn it off and on by kicking a ball at it. The damage did not bother her. “I’m not the materialistic kind,” she has said.His parents watched all his games from Berchem Sport to Spurs, alongside Dembélé’s grandmother, who played football in Belgium but developed multiple sclerosis aged 40. Young Mousa and she were close.Dembélé made unorthodox choices. Rather than joining Anderlecht, Belgium’s biggest club with an excellent youth system who were desperate to sign him, he went to a smaller Dutch club, Willem II, because he loved the country’s adventurous, technical football. His coach there, Robert Maaskant, was impressed by the 17-year-old’s physique: “Some of my experienced, strong defenders thought they had bumped into a tree instead of a teenager.”At his next club, AZ, Dembélé did not score freely despite having top tutors in Louis van Gaal (head coach), Shota Arveladze (fellow striker then mentor) and Patrick Kluivert (trainee coach). But he made a big impact and helped AZ to an unexpected title in 2009. The goals he did score were mostly high quality. A dashing solo effort against Willem II has a prominent place in the virtual museum for the Dutch top flight’s most beautiful goals.At AZ Dembélé became aware of the importance of scoring more. “But I will never become a real killer,” he has said. He may be too nice. With Belgium he has not been a regular for a long time and did not start the last friendly, despite his strong form. He accepts it practically without mention and seems more upset when Radja Nainggolan, with whom he is competing for a place, gets criticised. Fitness problems do not help his case.“He does not beat players with speed but almost walks by them,” Maaskant says. “Then you can get a kick. He’s so tough, he didn’t really mind, just played on. Only afterwards we saw how thick his ankles were.”Strength is key to his game. “You can always count on him but he has been giving so much for 13 years,” says Martin Jol, who managed him at Fulham and regards him as the world’s finest midfielder. “Sometimes I thought of resting him but even the idea of starting without him made me sweat.”Jol gave Dembélé a permanent role in central midfield at Fulham, after Van Gaal tried him as a right midfielder. “In England, a striker has to score,” Jol says. “I wanted to take away that pressure. The stupid thing is, at training he banged balls in the top corner without a care. In midfield he was sensational, the one with the ideas, the passing ability but also the best ball winner.The comparisons Pochettino reached for were even more striking. “I think it was a joke,” Dembélé has said. “I’m not a Maradona and it’s not my intention to become one.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e45d6f5db979873710d3be7a1d3df4c95ec82db0/0_42_4461_2677/master/4461.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=b478c9142555650296540e3f8e285a0f 1240w","title":"sam allardyce fan survey give myself 11","story":"Sam Allardyce has received an apology from Everton’s chairman, Bill Kenwright, over the club survey that asked supporters to rate his performance as manager on a scale of zero to 10.The Everton manager blamed the club’s director of marketing and communications, Richard Kenyon, for the PR debacle that has increased his problems and revealed Kenwright called him with a personal apology.Season-ticket holders and club members were invited to rate Allardyce’s performance in a wide-ranging survey also issued last season, albeit not at a time when the club’s manager was coming in for fierce criticism from fans as Allardyce was at Swansea City last weekend.Allardyce addressed the issue before a question was asked at a press conference on Thursday. “I am only answering this question once,” he began. “In fact I’m not even taking the question. The survey: the director of marketing and communications has clearly slipped up. Our department has not been asked what we think of the survey, even though it has been passed out before.“From my point of view and the football side point of view it was a big mistake. I think it has allowed you to write some beautiful headlines. Our director of marketing is not a great understander of football and how football works because he is into marketing. He must have thought it was the right thing to do but clearly everyone else hasn’t and even the chairman I spoke to last night.”Asked if he had received an apology from Kenwright, Allardyce replied: “Off the chairman, yes. And don’t ask me how many marks I’d get out of 10 either.” That invited the inevitable follow-up question asking precisely that. “Piss off,” he added, laughing. “Eleven!”Allardyce is seething over a survey that has exposed the leadership of the club to criticism but insists it has not diminished his desire to stay at Everton long term. “It hasn’t made any difference for me concerning my position at the club,” he said.“If someone rings me up at the very highest level and says: ‘Sam, you’re not wanted any more’ then I’ll hold my hands up and say: ‘If that’s how you feel then fine.’ But I’d be extremely disappointed if that was the case. In fact I’d be much more disappointed than extremely.“When a season has been completely disrupted unexpectedly it throws a club into turmoil and chaos and when I arrived it was chaos. We have managed to overcome that side of it and bring a level of training, performance and try to get better consistency – particularly away from home – which we haven’t achieved yet.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8eb78a4bfdaa127db1312eea6845e0fe943b4346/583_147_1324_794/master/1324.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=a3678fe8dd94fda87a00c7ebae2394a1 1240w","title":"andy carroll surrounded by toddlers football weekly extra","story":"Max and the gang look back at the week in football including Andy Carroll surrounded by toddlers, World Cup morale boosters, half-time VAR, Instagram tie-ins and journalists passing colds on to playersRate, review, share on Apple Podcasts, Soundcloud, Audioboom, Mixcloud, Acast and Stitcher, and join the conversation on Facebook, Twitter and email.

The watchdog reported that a total of 33 aid charities funded by the Department for International Development (DfID) have now come forward with allegations of abuse.Ninety-two relate to incidents that had taken place over the last year, while 127 were historic, it said.The reports covered a wide spectrum of incidents and some related to risks of harm, rather than actual harm, the commission said. It could give no further details of the new allegations reported, or whether any of them involved criminal behaviour.In March, the commission said some of the 80 reports submitted the previous month included allegations of sexual abuse of children and rape of volunteers abroad.The commission refused to identify the charities involved as they were still under investigation.Earlier this month, the commission announced a formal inquiry into Save the Children, the global charity hit by allegations that it failed to investigate sexual abuse and inappropriate behaviour by staff. The watchdog also began a formal inquiry into Oxfam in February, over its handling of the allegations of misconduct by staff in Haiti in 2011.A safeguarding taskforce, set up by the commission in February to deal with the increase in reports and to review historic safeguarding, has now re-analysed half of all 5,500 serious incidents as far back as April 2014. It found that one, out of the 2,000 involving allegations of potentially criminal behaviour, had not been reported to the police at the time.It has now been reported to the authorities, it said.Last month, Penny Mordaunt, the international development secretary, said that DfID-funded charities had reported 80 safeguarding incidents to the commission. Mordaunt wrote to 179 aid charities and organisations after it emerged there were widespread concerns about the behaviour of aid workers and the way those concerns were being dealt with. The commission said it had seen a marked increase in reporting of serious incidents across all charities since early February, when allegations of sexual misconduct by Oxfam staff in Haiti first emerged in the Times.The commission reported 532 new allegations of serious incidents on safeguarding, across all charities, were received in February and March this year, compared with 176 during the same period in 2017."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e41cd337184577de9bf0c346cc2b4b5f56ac1a5/0_556_4640_2784/master/4640.jpg?w=1300\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=f820f2c13c69c6f48ae241ef7724fab0 2600w","title":"scavenging grime sewage gold mumbai streets india","story":"Along the narrow alleys of one of India’s largest bullion markets, men and women scrape a living scouring the dust and even the drains for specks of the precious metal When most of Mumbai is fast asleep at 5am each day, 41-year-old Tanu Behre sets out on her hunt.Armed with a little handbrush, she walks the narrow alleys of Zaveri bazaar, one of India’s largest bullion markets, and dusts the streets for gold. She enters drains outside goldsmiths’ workshops, and gathers the black sludge in her aluminium pan. If she’s lucky, the slime will turn up the precious metal.  Named after the Hindi word for the pans they use, ghamela, there are hundreds of “ghamelawallahs” in Zaveri bazaar – men and women who scavenge grime for gold.Congested, labyrinthine lanes house scores of jewellery workshops and factories, where gold is cut, carved, and shaped. Particles make their way into streets when craftsmen walk out – gold dust gets stuck to their hands, hair or shoes. The particles even get deposited in drains, when goldsmiths wash their hands.“On an average work day, I spend four hours collecting seven to eight pounds of filth and sludge from the streets,” says Wasim Sheikh, 32, a native of the northern Indian city of Agra who migrated to Mumbai a decade ago to pursue his ancestral occupation. As with most other ghamelawallahs, generations of Sheikh’s family have been in the informal trade.After he collects the waste, he submerges it in water. Gold, being heavier, sinks to the bottom, while the mud and dirt float out. He then carries the residue to a secluded corner outside his rented home in Zaveri bazaar, where he lights a tiny furnace to refine the yellow metal. “I add mercury to the residue so that gold particles stick to it, and the trash gets separated. In order to filter out the finer waste – magnetic dust and ferrous particles, I carefully run a tiny magnet over the remains. I then add this residue to a furnace, where I cook it with nitric acid for about 10 to 12 minutes. The acid reacts with mercury to form liquid salts, leaving behind a pellet of gold.”Not every day, however, is lucrative. Mohammed Amir, a 17-year-old, who quit school to join the profession, says the monsoons leave him and his four brothers, also ghamelawallahs, struggling. “All the dirt on the streets gets washed away with rainwater, while the gutters overflow, leaving no scope to identify sewage flecked with gold. Hence, during monsoons, my brothers and I take up other jobs – construction work, hawking at traffic signals or working as domestic labour in homes.”Ghamelawallahs usually collect a gramme or two of gold before selling it to small-time goldsmiths in the bazaar. Mohammed Babloo, 34, says the rates are often lower than market prices. “They tend to haggle with us because they think we’re scavengers, living off sewage from gutters. I normally check rates with at least five buyers before parting with my gold.”But now jewellers, aware of the ghamelawallahs’ work, are increasingly getting cautious about their waste, says Jaymin Zhaveri, a 30-year-old businessman, whose family has been running a jewellery store in the bazaar for 100 years. One shop owner has begun vacuuming and storing the dust. “Workshop owners have started giving uniforms to their craftsmen, which they have to leave behind after work so that gold dust on their clothes is retained with the employers. Others clean the pavements outside their stores themselves, and some even collect the water after goldsmiths wash their hands or shower. All of this waste is preserved over time, and sold to buyers from all over India in bulk,” says Zhaveri. For government street sweepers, meanwhile, the ghamelawallahs are a nuisance. Ranjan Mule, 37, who works with Mumbai’s civic authority, says: “Hundreds of these men and women are out every morning, searching for gold. They collect the dust and sewage, but throw everything else on the streets. There have been instances where ghamelawallahs have stolen garbage off our dumpsters, and littered the waste after.”But ghamelawallahs are undeterred. “Business is good,” says Behre. “In my slum settlement I’m the only woman who wears nose rings and earrings made of real gold.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2b51a27b62088b43d809fccaabf2a14db7da223c/0_22_8851_7056/master/8851.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=6a0e312ec86ab098c647fb225b639934 1240w","title":"the perfect shepherds pie recipe felicity cloake","story":"What could be simpler than lamb (always lamb) mince topped with mash? Yet even this domestic classic has a thousand variations. We cherry-pick the best to bring you an unbeatable shepherd’s pieThough they may not boast ancient pedigree, the two dishes are not as interchangeable as the likes of Martha Stewart – or indeed, and embarrassingly, the youthful me – would have you believe: just as roast lamb is not cooked in the same way as roast beef, shepherd’s and cottage pie deserve inidual attention. Having tackled the latter way back in 2010, when this column was still wet behind the ears, it feels high time we gave the shepherd his moment in the spotlight. Is this one of those dishes that’s so familiar you don’t need a recipe, or is there anything new to learn about shepherd’s pie?Originally, this was a dish designed to make the Sunday roast go further – the thrifty cook could stretch out the joint until Friday with clever cooking, and such pies were, and still are, often a Monday treat. Simon Hopkinson and Lindsey Bareham regard this as a second-best option, writing in The Prawn Cocktail Years that “there is no reason why a shepherd’s pie cannot also be made from a cooked lamb joint, but it turns out better and juicier when made from raw minced meat”.Tom Kerridge and Jamie Oliver clearly disagree, because they roast meat for the purpose: Oliver a lamb shoulder, cooked long, though not particularly low, and then slowly braised in its cooking juices and Kerridge lamb shanks. The testers are excited about these pies after I tell them how long they’ve taken to make, but confess themselves slightly thrown by their consistency, which is, they think, a bit stringy, though both lamb joints had plenty of fat on them.Even lamb mince can vary, however: Eastwood calls specifically for minced lamb shoulder, which she and my butcher explain is a fattier cut than some – and certainly better marbled, darker in colour and stronger in flavour than generic supermarket lamb mince. Whether this is down to the quality of the meat, the cut, or a bit of both is impossible to tell, because the packet stuff doesn’t specify origins, but this dish is certainly worth sourcing decent mince for: it’s never pricey (unless you go down the Ivy road and cut it with minced rib of beef, of course).If you don’t have any lamb drippings handy to cook it in (which you’re unlikely to, unless you’re making it with leftover meat), beef dripping makes a far better, meatier substitute than oil, adding an unmistakable whiff of animal to a dish that was never really going to make the vegetarian heart sing in any case.You can go rogue, if you like – the Ivy puts in shallots, Oliver red onion and Kerridge goes as far as garlic, but I prefer to keep things simple with the time-honoured trinity of yellow onion, celery and carrot, the last cubed, rather than grated as Hopkinson and Bareham suggest, because testers prefer the texture – though, sadly, they’re not keen on Oliver’s swede. I think it seems rather in keeping with the spirit of the dish, though I’d be tempted to bake it first to make it less watery.The Ivy and Eastwood both include mushrooms in their sauces, with the latter writing that many shepherd’s pies lack “depth of flavour. In poncy chef terms, it lacks umami. The mushrooms and mushroom ketchup give this recipe a savoury boost, as do the sun-dried tomatoes.” I agree with her: many recipes do indeed lack a bit of punch, but the testers aren’t keen on the texture of mushrooms here, however finely they’re chopped and the sun-dried tomatoes, though delicious, seem to belong to another dish entirely. “Too fancy,” apparently.But how to add umami without mushrooms or tomato? Meat stock seems the most obvious candidate: slow simmering the mince in lamb stock, as Brown and Hayley and Eastwood recommend, will deliver more savoury flavour than Bareham and Hopkinson’s water. If you can’t find good lamb stock, then beef stock is better than nothing (the Ivy’s veal stock will be, too).Tomatoes are also high in those all-important glutamates – the Ivy uses chopped tomatoes and tomato puree, and Eastwood, Bareham and Hopkinson ketchup, which has its fans, though I find it too sweet and vinegary. Everything ketchup touches ends up tasting of ketchup, so I’m going to use puree instead, plus a good dash of the Ivy’s Worcestershire sauce in place of the Prawn Cocktail Years’ anchovy essence and Kerridge’s red-wine vinegar, which gives his pie a tanginess that works very well with the richness of lamb and potato, but seems at odds with the culinary comfort blanket that is shepherd’s pie.A similar simplicity also seems wise in the herbs and spices department: Eastwood’s exotic star anise, Kerridge’s mace and the Ivy’s oregano are all great options, but you can’t beat thyme and rosemary with lamb.A good shepherd’s – or indeed cottage – pie, needs a solid, but fluffy top: too much milk or butter, and you’ll end up with a sloppy puree instead. Make sure you steam the potatoes dry before mashing, and season generously I like Bareham and Hopkinson’s nutmeg as well as the usual salt and pepper. If you’d like to increase the vegetable content, Eastwood’s butternut squash mash is wonderful, especially with the maple syrup to play off the natural sweetness of the meat, though there should be enough savoury flavour in the filling to negate the need for added cheese (though her parmesan works better than Oliver’s cheddar, and, inspired by Kerridge, I think a hard goat’s cheese would work best of all).Oliver lines his dish with potatoes, too, which I’m excited about – you can never have too much of a good thing – but the panel thinks it makes the dish too claggy, soaking up the gravy and blurring the satisfying distinction between molten filling and dense top. Sprinkle with breadcrumbs, if you think it needs extra crunch, but for me a shepherd’s pie needs no other adornment than its traditional crispy furrows, satisfyingly described by Dickson-Wright as “a ploughed field” of potato. And you don’t get much more rustic than that.2 tbsp good beef dripping (or lamb, if you happen to have some)800g minced lamb, goat, hogget or mutton, preferably from the shoulder, but anyway not “lean”1 large onion, thinly sliced2 large carrots, peeled and diced 3 celery sticks, diced2 sprigs each rosemary and thyme, leaves picked and roughly chopped1 tbsp flour300ml good lamb stock (or beef stock) 2 tbsp Worcestershire sauce 1 tbsp tomato puree1.5kg floury potatoes100g butter1 tbsp whole milkNutmeg, to grateHeat the fat in a large, heavy-bottomed casserole dish over a medium-high heat, then fry the meat in batches until crisp and well browned all over (not just beige). Transfer the browned meat into a bowl and repeat with the rest.Turn down the heat, add the onion to the pan and cook until it begins to soften. Add the carrots, celery and herbs, and cook until tender but not soft. Sprinkle over the flour and stir well to distribute, then add the stock and Worcestershire sauce, and scrape the bottom of the pan to dislodge any stuck bits.Return the lamb to the pot, bring everything to a simmer, then cover, turn down the heat and simmer for 45 minutes. Remove the lid and simmer uncovered for a further 15 minutes, then set aside to cool.While the meat is cooking, peel the potatoes and cut them into evenly sized chunks. Boil in well-salted water until tender, then drain well and return to the hot pan to steam dry. Mash with the butter and milk, then season with salt, pepper and nutmeg to taste. Heat the oven to 180C350Fgas 4.Spoon the meat mix into a 30cm x 20cm ovenproof dish, then cover with the mash. Smooth out the top, then use a fork to make furrows over the top – do not skip this stage. Bake for about 30 minutes, until lightly golden on top, then serve with greens.• Are shepherd’s and cottage pie interchangeable (having written this recipe without looking at my cottage pie of eight years ago, I find to my embarrassment the two are remarkably similar) and if not, what changes do you ring between the two?

Thirty four years ago, when Paul “St Paul” Peterson was the singer in the Family, a band Prince had assembled, he was sitting in his mother’s house in Minneapolis when he received a tape containing Prince’s recording of a song he wanted Peterson to learn for the album he was producing for the group. “I was told to learn Prince’s inflections, his emotions, and the melody line,” the singer remembers, describing how capturing the song’s themes of loss and abandonment meant he had to go “deep”. “So I thought about a girl called Julie, who broke my heart in high school.”It was Nothing Compares 2 U. Prince’s recording went unreleased, the Family’s version became a barely heard album track, but Sinéad O’Connor’s smash 1990 reimagining let the world hear what is now acknowledged as one of Prince’s greatest songs. Today, as Prince’s more electronic, rockier original is finally made public, Peterson – who has been married to Julie for 28 years – is back in his mother’s house. He has just listened to the recording he last heard in 1984 and admits: “I’m freaking out here, man.”Prince’s sound engineer, Susan Rogers, goes back further: she witnessed Nothing Compares 2 U’s birth. In summer 1984, Prince was working in the Flying Cloud Drive Warehouse – his huge rehearsal space before creating Paisley Park – and was on “a creative roll, cranking out a song a day”. He was also in a relationship with the Family’s Susannah Melvoin (who can be heard on backing vocals, alongside St Paul, on Prince’s Nothing Compares 2 U). “It was clear that she was becoming more important than the other girls he’d dated,” Rogers says. “Simultaneously, his young housekeeper, Sandy Scipioni, had to leave suddenly to be with her family because her father died of a heart attack. Sandy ran Prince’s life. He kept asking, ‘When’s Sandy coming back?’”One day, he went into a room with a notebook and, within an hour, emerged with the lyrics to Nothing Compares 2 U. Rogers, who witnessed many such bursts of creativity, remembers, “The song came out like a sneeze.” As usual, she rolled the tapes as Prince laid down instrument after instrument, mixing and overdubbing in the same session (Eric Leeds overdubbed the sax part three days later). Rogers felt the finished song was “exceptional, in his Top 10”, but has a compelling theory about why Prince didn’t release the song under his own name (a live duet with Rosie Gaines appeared years later, on the 1993 compilation, The HitsThe B-Sides).“He wasn’t living with anyone, but he was a young man writing about domesticity. The line ‘all the flowers that you planted in my back yard went out and died’… it would have been Sandy who planted those flowers. ‘And I know that living with me baby is sometimes hard, but I’m willing to give it another try…’ There was no romantic relationship with Sandy. It’s not a pained ‘Help me, baby’ track. It’s: ‘You’re gone and I miss you,’ which is probably why he felt comfortable giving the song away to the Family. He released his material based on what he wanted us to know about him and, wonderful as it is, he didn’t want it to represent him.”“Prince was the most courageous person I ever met,” Rogers explains. “He realised he had to socially handicap himself to be the artist he wanted to be, and that to do that without being an asshole he had to be a complete enigma. My gut feeling is that everything he recorded should be released, so that people can understand where he came from and keep his memory alive.”• Nothing Compares 2 U is available as a stream and digital single. A 7in picture disc is exclusively available via the Prince official store. A black vinyl 7in is out on 25 May. The Family now tour and record as fDeluxe, and appear at the annual Paisley Park celebration in Minneapolis, which runs until 22 April."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/98ed86694c5bd9c84ce1139b1b6d7651c45d49b4/4_0_2283_1370/master/2283.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=f008834cf684aec8e781c0a2703912b9 1240w","title":"jessie js cultural revolution how a middle grade pop monster saved china","story":"Well, it was the power ballad heard around the world – by which I\u0026nbspmean heard in a variety of Asian emerging markets, but not the UK. Anyway, Jessie\u0026nbspJ has won a Chinese TV singing competition! Not since Deng Xiaoping’s government allowed Bernardo Bertolucci to use the Forbidden City for The Last Emperor has a Chinese cultural engagement with the west felt quite so epic.Think of Jessie as The Last Empress. God knows, she does. I’m kidding, I’m kidding. It has been a few years since madam was explaining how her broken foot had given her “a different respect now for people who don’t have legs”. Still, let’s give the classic interview another hop-out.“Just after I broke my foot,” Jessie told Q magazine, “I was in the living room and I put on Beyoncé’s Save the Hero. Like, ‘If I’m not around, who saves the superhero?’ You give so much as an artist – you give, you give, you give. I break my foot and I’ve got fans going: ‘I’ve got a tummy ache, can I get a retweet?’ People think you go to a special hospital, get special casts and treatment. It’s like: ‘No, I’m the same as everyone else,’ and that was the moment when I had a proper cry.”I don’t mind admitting I cry in a happy way every time I reread that quote. Touring the vast Lost in Showbiz archive facility earlier today, I see I\u0026nbsphad filed Jessie away in a section entitled Middle-Grade Monsters of Pop. Although this latest Chinese escapade doesn’t require her to be formally reclassified, I\u0026nbspthink we can\u0026nbspbump her up to her own dedicated shelf.But first, a recap: for the past three months, popstar and former Voice judge Jessie J has been in China competing in a televised singing competition called Singer. Contrary to many reports, this is not the equivalent of The X Factor. All the singers competing are established, so it is rather less horrendous than Jessie J twerking in professionally to pluck the opportunity away from an angelic-voiced Chinese amateur, all the while singing that it’s not about the money, money, money. Or,\u0026nbspindeed, the cha-ching cha-ching.Here is Jessie’s version: “Last year, I was asked to compete in a singing competition in China. Performing alongside the biggest established singersartists across Asia.”Tantalisingly, the Do It Like a Dude legend doesn’t elaborate on how the request was communicated. For my part, I believe it to have been made in a bilateral Sino-British huddle during a session break of the UN security council. But I suppose it is conceivable they went via the record label. Either way, the message is that China actively wanted Jessie. She wasn’t just something atrocious we visited upon them, like the Opium wars.Why did Jessie say yes? “It was an opportunity to bridge a gap between two cultures,” she explains. “For them to see a western performer and hear music some had never heard before and vice versa.”Can’t help feeling vice versa is doing some heavy lifting there. But Jessie seems determined to effect – how to put this? – a sort of cultural revolution, whereby Chinese people are improved and spiritually elevated via exposure to her personage. The show’s formal victory publicity material shows her posing in floor-length diamanté with an arched eyebrow and talking about learning experiences, an aesthetic I’m afraid I’m going to have to call “re-education high camp”.“Seeing the boundaries break down,” Jessie goes on, “and the rules be shifted made this whole experience incredible … What we all won.” – Oh man, she is really doing this – “What we all won was the beginning of something really magical. I am so happy I got to play a part.”Only time will show whether historians of this era in Chinese history will ultimately judge Jessie’s part the more significant, or will plump for Xi Jinping’s recent constitutional amendment revoking the two-term limit on the\u0026nbsppresidency.What we know for sure is that Jessie won last Sunday night, singing I Will Always Love You in front of a\u0026nbspreported TV audience of one billion. “Jessie J could earn £20m” screams a typical headline, somehow resisting the temptation to predict a great leap forward for her career. The local news outlets have gone with a different line, meanwhile. According to Xinhua, the Chinese news agency: “She said she did not participate in the show for an award but to bring more good works to the audience.” Yes, it is almost as if Jessie … just wants to make the world dance? (You will note that even Chinese state media can’t get the wretched Price Tag out of their brains. Once heard, it is incurable. Your only hope is managing the condition.)Incidentally, if you have a spare 36 hours – and which of us doesn’t? – I\u0026nbspdo recommend a visit to Wikipedia to look at the full competition rules of Singer, which make the Glass Bead game look like Snap. So byzantine are the voting procedures that you feel they could only have been conceived in a non-democracy with the specific intention of convincing the audience that suffrage is such an arcane and impenetrable time-suck that they are all much better off without it.Which reminds me: it was Simon Cowell, the Karaoke Sauron himself, who a few years ago said of X Factor-style shows: “The great thing is where you start seeing it in places like China and Afghanistan. It’s democracy. We’ve kind of given democracy back to the world.” Thank you, Simon.Quick democracy update: Xi has dispensed with consensus rule and checks on his power the biggest star of the US reality era sits in the White House with the FBI investigating his phoneline support and Cowell’s oft-stated belief that British referendums were a great idea is ageing like a fine wine. So, do take a moment to appreciate Simon. The golden age of reality TV did so much for the age that followed it, in ways we are still only beginning to understand.None of which is to detract from Jessie’s victory, which – as she makes clear – flowed from the decision specifically to target her. “I was the first international artist to ever be askedcompete,” she declares. “An honour alone.”It is certainly the most audacious Chinese claim to a British property since the 1982 summit where Deng told Margaret Thatcher that China could forcibly requisition Hong Kong if it wanted to. In the end, of course, it didn’t need to. And so with Jessie J.I suppose these handovers are best done peacefully, and I am sure we Brits handled our end of things in that wistfully dignified, post-imperial way of ours. The studio audience for Jessie’s victory song presumably included a tearful Chris Patten. There would have followed a retiring of the flag, and a Last Post feat Jessie J. All the years in flashback, all the memories crowding in – but she is theirs now. God bless her. God bless China.

But what are these self-styled traders really selling? By  Symeon BrownThe original Wolf of Wall Street, Jordan Belfort, was a rogue trader convicted of fraudulently selling worthless penny stocks to naive investors. His biopic, starring Leonardo DiCaprio as the ostentatious, money-obsessed huckster, was a box-office hit in 2013. Although it may have been intended as a cautionary tale, to thousands of young millennials from humble backgrounds, Belfort’s story became a blueprint for how to escape an unremarkable life on low pay.Within months of the Wolf of Wall Street’s UK premiere in January 2014, a stocky 21-year-old named Elijah Oyefeso from a south London housing estate, began broadcasting on social media how much money he was making as a stock-market whizzkid. His thousands of young followers were desperate to do the same. As Oyefeso’s online fame grew, he caught the attention of TV producers. In January 2016, Oyefeso was featured in the Channel 4 show Rich Kids Go Shopping, in which he bought expensive jumpers to give to homeless people and showed viewers how easy it was to make stock trades online.Even before Oyefeso’s appearance on mainstream TV, his story had already gone viral. British tabloids, including the Daily Mail, the Evening Standard and the Mirror, as well as a host of online magazines targeted at young men, all ran pieces about his success. The Mail headline described him as a university dropout who supposedly used his student loan to start trading financial products online and “now claims he earns £30,000 on a BAD month – by working just ONE HOUR a day”.It’s an image of self-made wealth and ridiculous luxury, and one that Oyefeso has intensively cultivated online. The videos on his almost comedic YouTube channel, which have hundreds of thousands of views, feature him buying £250,000 cars and boarding private jets as nonchalantly as others his age might hail an Uber. His Instagram, which regularly shows him posing next to a blue and silver Rolls-Royce, describes him as the founder of DCT, his trading firm. DCT stands for “Dreams Come True”.“I’m never going to work for someone,” Oyefeso says in one of his videos, in a somewhat cartoonish, nasal voice, while he drives his Rolls dressed in a bathrobe. “Look what I’ve built: a foundation. A brand.”For many young people from areas such as the poorer part of Camberwell in south London where Oyefeso grew up, or those who have come across him on social media, Oyefeso’s portrayal as a self-made millionaire has given him the heroic status of a footballer or rapper.“I’m just a normal guy and most people who come from where I’m from, they see if I can do it, they can do it,” Oyefeso told me. He has described DCT Trading as a future Goldman Sachs or JP Morgan – except, unlike those mammoth financial institutions, which tend to recruit from a narrow pool of elite graduates from prestigious universities, Oyefeso appeared to be opening a closed door to young people who might otherwise be excluded from the trading floor.Oyefeso has sent out thousands of invitations with the message “join my team”. The problem is, his company does not have a trading floor. It does not have an office. Dreams Come True isn’t registered at Companies House. It does not exist as anything more than a website and some social media accounts. (Oyefeso claims the parent company, Gabs Fossard Ltd, is registered, although it was dissolved without posting any income.)Oyefeso is one of the most high-profile figures of an internet subculture that reveres Jordan Belfort and has taken his Wolf of Wall Street persona to social media. Posing as ultra-wealthy kids and posting internet memes taken from the movie, its followers aggressively sign up young people to what looks like an international pyramid scheme that has helped to generate billions of pounds for large companies selling highly risky financial trading products.They are the wolves of Instagram.The financial sector has a genius for creating new products that brush against the law. A former UBS trader told me that the sector had taken advantage of the grey area between what they know they can’t do and what they believe they can get away with. In 2008, as the economy reeled under the weight of trillions of dollars of bad debt in financial products called collateralised debt obligations, another risky and obscure proposition was being designed for the public: the binary option.The concept is simple: you sign up with a minimum deposit of £250 from a debit or credit card, click a button that says you are over 18, then bet on whether the price of a stock, currency or other financial security will go up or down and by how much. The binary option is part of a family of similar financial products such as spread betting and contracts for difference. If you have ever heard a rookie investor declare that they trade currency, these are probably what they are talking about.These products became popular alongside a proliferation of online trading software and mobile betting platforms. The craze was largely driven by two countries – Israel and Cyprus – in the late 2000s. Their regulatory frameworks meant that firms could access European markets without the heavy hand of European regulators, and new binary options companies spread like chain letters. After the financial crash, in Israel alone an estimated 100 firms popped up in the space of a few years.Over the past 18 months, these financial products have taken great leaps into public life with expensive marketing campaigns. Plus500, which is to online trading what McDonald’s is to fast food, is the main sponsor of European football giant Atlético Madrid, and 24Option have sponsored the renowned MMA fighter Conor McGregor and Italian football team Juventus.Binary options are considered so volatile that they have been banned outright in the US. However, in the UK, which has some of the most liberal financial regulations in the world, they were until January of this year classified as high-risk gambling products and regulated by the Gambling Commission. Since then, they have been under the auspices of the FCA, which published a list of unauthorised firms and guidelines for aspiring traders.The mystery is how such complex products became an internet youth craze. And this is where the wolves of Instagram swagger in. Oyefeso described himself as a social media “influencer”, which means he and others like him can use Instagram and Twitter to sell the trading platforms a supply of teenagers and young adults with limited knowledge of the money markets and a hunger for success.This is how it works. Oyefeso posts images of luxury goods he claims to have bought with his winnings. He gives the pictures hashtags such as #richkidsofinstagram and mass-follows young people online. One teenager told me he and his friends were drawn in by the sight of a young black man who grew up on a council estate similar to theirs, driving a Rolls-Royce. As soon as anyone follows Oyefeso back, he slides into their DMs with a message: “I’m offering a great opportunity to earn £100-400+ per week from trading, no experience required, all done from home and only requires 15-30 min per day.” If you’re young, poor and want to defy the odds against you, the next question is: where do I sign up?What wolves like Oyefeso fail to declare is that each of the trading platforms you sign up to (with a minimum deposit of £250) pays him around £40-80 – and that recruitment, rather than betting on these predatory financial products, is the way he makes his risk-free money (Oyefeso maintains he’s making money from trading). Young people join the platforms, make a few trades and can lose anything between £250 and several thousand pounds, then realise they can make it back by repeating the trick: becoming a paid marketing affiliate masquerading as a successful trader. It looks like a vintage pyramid scheme, rebooted for the social media era using a model of e-marketing that has boomed over the last 20 years.It is almost impossible to count the number of marketing affiliates masquerading as successful traders on Instagram, but we can count the number of promotional posts they’ve made using hashtags such as #binaryoptions (222,206), #traderlifestyle (64,151), and #richkidsofinstagram (529,574). Those numbers rise by the minute and the thousands of accounts generating them appear and disappear constantly.The companies making the real money from these financial gambling products are supposed to be kept in check by the ASA, the Gambling Commission and the FCA – but this pack of regulators appears to be outfoxed by the wolves. The National Fraud Authority estimated that £59m had been defrauded from UK residents in 2017 from binary options alone.“These binary options are almost no-win gambling products masquerading as complex financial instruments,” Labour’s deputy leader, Tom Watson, one of a number of politicians who have issued warnings about such products, told me. “It’s outrageous they are being targeted at the most vulnerable gamblers and young people.”Many of the most exploitative companies’ digital storefronts drift anonymously in the middle of the internet, virtually undiscoverable to people who don’t know they are there and aren’t looking for them. This is where the influencers and their social media accounts come in. In Oyefeso’s words: “I just saw a big hole and I filled it up, which any successful entrepreneur would do.”My first meeting with Oyefeso was on a summer’s afternoon in 2016. He and some of his friends were parked up on a private housing estate in Canary Wharf, having arrived in a convoy of supercars, including Oyefeso’s Rolls and a rented Audi R8. The neighbourhood was meant to serve as a backdrop to the world of opulence they were displaying on their Instagram feeds. It was not long before a resident came out to tell us we were trespassing. “This is a private estate, we don’t want to associate this estate with those kinds of people,” he said.Instagram – even more than Facebook or Twitter – is where people sell a version of their lives that they want people to believe. None more so than these young, self-proclaimed millionaires. They are part of the larger phenomenon of #richkidsofinstagram, a hashtag first used in 2012 to profile the genuine heirs of multimillion-pound estates – including a son of one of the West Ham football club owners – but then spread to people like Oyefeso, who were faking it. A search of the posts tagged #richkidsofinstagram reveals young men and women from across the world sharing pictures and videos of their extravagant lifestyles: suitcases filled with stacks of £10, £20 and £50 notes toddlers wearing customised Gucci denim jackets expensive cars and private jets, all set to the latest hip-hop anthems.For Oyefeso and many of his friends, the lifestyle is largely a costume drama. In his most recent video on YouTube Oyefeso appeared to hire a private jet – one that was parked up – to announce his return after he left prison. Oyefeso recounted how much money he could make in 15 minutes. Yet in reality, the only company I could find registered to Oyefeso’s address – IWANTTOTRADE Ltd, was dissolved in 2016 without posting a penny of income. Despite his glamorous trappings, Oyefeso, the son of Nigerian migrants, is, on paper at least, still residing at their council flat in south London.In reality, #richkidsofinstagram is mostly a feed of adverts selling everything from clothes to gambling products, featuring endless marketing affiliates trying to recruit young people who are under more and more pressure from friends and influencers on social media to buy their way to success. The @richkidslondon account, followed by more than 730,000 people, says it profiles the most impressive rich kids, but what it does not say is that it charges them £60 for a post or £350 for 10.According to a close friend, Oyefeso got his start in this world in 2014, when he began working at One Two Trade (OTT), a bucket shop operated out of a backstreet office in Wapping, east London, where unwitting investors could register bets online. OTT, which is not a regulated financial institution in the UK, but registered in Panama and Malta, would take a cut of every trade, and then try to hustle investors out of the rest of their money using excessive commissions and other exploitative terms. Former staff describe it as overrun with young people who had lost money on the platform, trying to make it back by signing up their friends with trading accounts.For young people with ambition but no access, who were attracted to the risk, ingenuity and wealth of investment banks and hedge funds but would not qualify for a job at a traditional Canary Wharf company, working at OTT felt like a genuine career in the City – despite being unpaid. Oyefeso began styling himself as a guru offering “signals”, or trading tips, while working as a marketing affiliate. According to one of his mentees, he was a frontrunner in a burgeoning scene of young black outsiders, most of whom knew each other, spinning stories about how they infiltrated the old white man’s world of finance.On Oyefeso’s website there is a section where he recommends a range of financial betting platforms. He also showed me a WhatsApp group he charged thousands of young people a £69.99 monthly fee to join, which would instruct them on what to bet on next. Unbeknown to his “clients”, they were the product he was selling.The flashy Instagram may have won him a following, but the biggest gift to Oyefeso was his TV appearance. “After Rich Kids Go Shopping, he was so exposed,” one of his close friends said. “Before, it was just a small black community that was going to him, people that wanted to make quick money would go to him, but when he got put on the TV he had clients in Scotland.”I asked Oyefeso who started the traders of Instagram subculture. “Without being cocky, I think I did,” he said. Without Oyefeso to “show people that you can have this, that you can buy this house, that you can buy this car”, there might not have been the traders of Instagram business model. A rival who copied him agreed. “It started from Elijah,” she said. “He was putting it all on social media. When they are seeing a young black man buy a Bentley or a Rolls-Royce and who is constantly on TV and he’s getting a lot of publicity, they’re thinking, what is this guy doing? I want to be involved.”Then came a binary options gold rush among one of the most unlikely of demographics – young people in Britain’s inner cities.Oyefeso marketed for a range of legitimate companies, including 24Option and AvaTrade, registered in Cyprus and Ireland, respectively, which have an estimated combined annual revenue of nearly $90m. (Neither company responded to a request for comment.) Oyefeso also introduced his young audience to Banc de Binary, a company he describes as “fully good”, even after it ceased trading amid fraud allegations.Banc de Binary was founded in 2009 in Israel. The man at the helm was a former Israeli paratrooper, Oren Shabat Laurent. At its peak, the company had a yearly revenue of $100m, making it a star among binary options companies. The firm sought respectability by sponsoring football teams such as Liverpool and Southampton, but both clubs dropped the company when it become embroiled in scandal.Banc de Binary faced a string of multi-million dollar lawsuits from clients, and was pursued by the US Securities and Exchange Commission. It was fined $11m for major regulatory breaches such as using shell offices in the UK and the US to evade financial regulations. The company was kicked out of the US in 2013, and was denied access to European markets when it lost its licence in Israel soon after that. In January 2017, the company ceased trading when it was revealed to have used software rigged against its users. Its founder, Laurent, has since reinvented himself in the world of cryptocurrency, with a bigger online following than any of the influencers who peddled binary options for him. Laurent did not respond to requests for comment.Part of what made Oyefeso and Banc de Binary’s practices so ruthless was the age of the people they were signing up. In the UK, you have to be 18 to gamble or speculate on financial transactions. But Oyefeso was openly targeting much younger teenagers. It appears that in doing so, he was violating advertising regulations on gambling products.When I spoke to Oyefeso before he went to prison, he did not exhibit much regret. “I’m not going to lie to you, there are some people under 18 who trade and use their parent’s name,” Oyefeso told me. I asked him if he had worked with anyone under 18 directly. “Of course,” he said. Aren’t you breaching the rules? I asked. “If I am, why aren’t I behind bars?” he said.It seems Oyefeso didn’t just see teenagers as a source of income. They were also a source of labour. I spoke to one 18-year-old who told me that when he was between 15 and 16, he received a message from Oyefeso telling him he could sign up to a trading platform using his mother’s details. Oyefeso then offered the boy and his school friends work running his social media accounts and messaging his followers with advertising scripts. The teenagers were paid a cut of the commission for every one they signed up.The pack of Instagram wolves has spread far beyond Oyefeso’s network in London. Twenty-three-year-old Eddy Samuel grew up on the outskirts of Manchester. The city has received billions in private and public investment, but Samuel was not well placed to benefit from the new jobs that new money created.“I hardly got any GCSEs,” Samuel recently told me. “I got one Btec. I never really had an education.” After a string of minimum-wage jobs, he did some landscape gardening. “That was my last ever job,” he said. Together with two friends, he was drawn into the supposedly glamorous Instagram-world of fast cars and designer clothes that young men the same age as them appeared to have. The pressure to join them was almost torturous.“We are all from council estates – every single one of us,” Samuel said. “Seeing other people do it and wanting to get involved in it ourselves, being broke. I’m out of a job, we’re like – we need something else to get things going.” The company they launched, called Trading XL, has never been registered at Companies House.Even those losing money on Banc de Binary and other platforms sometimes gained a sense of self-confidence and an identity they felt proud of. Young men soon started trading in their hoodies for three-piece, pinstripe suits even though they had no office to wear them to. The subculture even had an anthem. A one-time Instagram trader who goes by the handle 10KJunes released a rap track called Trading Life, which includes the line, “I be selling stocks and then I buy it back, I got the taxman thinking that I’m selling crack”.Technology has made some jobs extinct and endangered entire sectors, but in a tough jobs market, affiliate work seems like the most accessible route to money. There is no interview or licence required. All that is needed, in most cases, is an email address and a bank account. The marketers earn on commission only, so they provide a growing class of cheap labour.A decade ago, teenagers primarily used social media to keep up with their friends and interests. In 2018, many see curating their accounts as a career and there is a growing ecosystem making this a major challenge for advertising regulators. Adverts are supposed to be identifiable, but influencers blur the lines with account pages built as shop windows on their lives. This grey area allowed foreign firms reliant on UK-based influencers to operate with impunity. Experts suggest that the regulators could have gone after marketing affiliates as “facilitators of gambling” sales, but chose not to.Plus500, which is valued at over £1bn, has an estimated 100,000 marketing affiliates working for it alone. The @dailyforexsignals account on Instagram appeared to be promoting the company with posts that the Campaign for Fairer Gambling claimed were in breach of the guidelines. However, Plus500 said the account had signed up just eight clients and the company had long cancelled @dailyforexsignals affiliation. It says it offers customers a test to indicate they understand the terms of trading, and has measures to ensure protection of its customers, including limiting the amount clients can lose. It says it requires all affiliates to comply with industry standards, but it is difficult to see how a company such as Plus500 keeps tabs on the thousands of unmanaged digital workers making it money. This in turn makes it hard to stop it profiting from vulnerable consumers – in particular, from young people hooked in by the promise of easy wealth.In 2005, the Labour government liberalised gambling advertising and created the Gambling Commission to regulate commercial gambling and protect vulnerable people, including anyone under 25. Tom Watson, the current deputy Labour leader, admitted that the legislation didn’t take the digital era into account.“The yield taken from losers in the industry has gone up from £8bn in 2008 to £13bn in 2016,” Watson said. “That’s a lot of money, and when you combine that with recent news that companies are targeting the most vulnerable people who are susceptible to becoming problem gamblers – I think we’ve got a problem and our current regulations and laws are not fit for purpose.”Matt Zarb-Cousin, of the Campaign for Fairer Gambling, alleges that the wolves’ Instagram posts are breaching two ASA regulations, “the first of which is: you can’t market to young people, and the second is: gambling cannot be offered as a way of making money. So these adverts would never pass the regulators if they were conventional.”The Gambling Commission has admitted that it had received a growing number of complaints when it was in the process of trying to regulate binary options, but the Campaign for Fairer Gambling says neither it nor the ASA had taken strong enough action on the advertising of such profits to vulnerable young adults. The Gambling Commission acknowledged it had never even “written to Instagram relating to advertisements or posts promoting gambling, that breach the UK advertising codes” during the time of the steepest rise in complaints.Both regulators blame the 2005 legislation. The Gambling Commission said that although binary options were regulated, the rules only applied if the firm had “remote gambling equipment located in Great Britain, irrespective of whether there are offices in GB or not”. The law states that if equipment is not in Britain, any binary options that the firm offers will not be regulated. Last month, the European Securities and Market Authority decided to prohibit the sales of binary options and limit the marketing and distribution of related products to vulnerable retail consumers. However, the wolves of Instagram have already adapted their behaviour.“Everything is changing, so obviously I’ve got to change, too,” Oyefeso said to me last year, when the landscape began to shift.One of Oyefeso’s business associates has leapt headfirst into the latest gold rush. “I recently got into bitcoin about three months ago,” he said. “Young people have just jumped to it and it’s like the (binary options) trading bubble all over again.”The cryptocurrency craze is in many ways similar to the boom in binary options and digital gambling apps. There have now been over 1,560 different currencies launched. Most of them are worthless but a host of new platforms are trying to hawk them via dubious platforms that entice young people through marketing affiliates disguised as Instagram influencers.One of Oyefeso’s early proteges was a north Londoner called Olivia James, 23. She described the original Wolf of Wall Street as “a king in my eyes”, and in February tweeted “I’m do everything Belfort done and more lifestyle wise”. Hoping to take advantage of the popularity of bitcoin, James has now incorporated a new company called TRADEtoGAIN, with 20-year-old Armon Rabiee and 24-year-old Luke Arliss. The trio share a common story with many of the other young people founding pop-up sites to teach young adults how they can crack cryptocurrencies, for exorbitant fees. Arliss struggled at school, James was repeatedly turned down for entry level jobs in the City and Rabiee said he lost thousands during the binary options wave as a teenager. Together, they plan to make money as gurus of crypto.Arliss, who has a big Instagram following from his former company, which repaired bodywork on footballers’ cars, said that he gets “loads of messages” about crypto from young people “interested in the hype”. Rabiee piped in, claiming that with their special insight they “can charge people thousands”.As Oyefeso’s fairytale has unravelled, the internet has turned against him. People shared reports of his arrest and sentence with mocking comments, and published blogs accusing him of running scams. Oyefeso responded with a caption on a recent video post: “People don’t want to see a young black guy from the ends make it out to be successful,” he wrote.The problem, in Oyefeso’s case, has not been a lack of goodwill. There were many who shared his original rags to riches story, unaware that there was another version in which this apparently wealthy young trader was an invention, incentivised by companies happy to exploit the gap between the life millennials are persuaded they should be living, and the harsh economic reality they live in.• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e32572811d5bc2a9e75192960ee03716fa33e4c8/0_138_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7afecbabe4dda4ddb38063c61221f51f 700w","title":"backbench mps motion force vote eu customs union","story":"Three Tories among signatories demanding option of customs union kept on table after BrexitTheresa May next week faces a show of support from MPs fighting to keep the UK in a customs union with the EU, after 10 select committee chairs tabled a motion that will force a vote on the issueThe Conservatives Bob Neill, Nicky Morgan and Sarah Wollaston, are among the signatories to the motion, which urges the government to “include as an objective in negotiations ... the establishment of an effective customs union”.The government lost a vote in the Lords on Wednesday night by a hefty majority of 123, on a cross-party amendment that would force ministers to report to parliament on their moves to keep the UK in a customs union.MPs campaigning against a hard Brexit, including Anna Soubry and Chuka Umunna, have tabled amendments to the trade bill and customs bill demanding that the option of a customs union be kept on the table.But the government has so far delayed bringing the legislation back to the Commons, avoiding the risk of an embarrassing defeat. So the select committee chairs are using their power to raise issues in the Commons to force a vote.Other signatories include Labour’s Hilary Benn and Yvette Cooper, the Liberal Democrats’ Norman Lamb, and the Scottish National party’s Angus MacNeil.Those wanting to remain in a customs union – which would avoid border checks, but constrain the UK from striking its own trade deals – are concerned about the impact on the economy if the UK left.The motion “notes the government’s expressed aim to provide the freest and most frictionless possible trade” with the EU and “further notes the importance of frictionless trade without tariffs, customs or border checks for manufacturers and businesses”.Morgan, who chairs the Treasury select committee, and Cooper, who chairs the home affairs select committee, said: “With just six months to go before the Brexit deal needs to be concluded we are running out of time for parliament to help to shape the negotiations. “Yet many of our backbench committees have forensically gathered evidence on different Brexit options and the practical implications. That is why committee chairs at the liaison committee – including those who voted leave and who voted remain, supporters and opponents of a customs union – concluded that backbench MPs should get the chance of an early constructive debate and vote on this crucial issue, not bound by the party whips, but informed by committee evidence instead.”They added: “If parliament stays silent until after the deal is done, that is just a recipe for conflict and regret later on. Far better for us to debate this properly now and let parliamentarians express their view before it is too late.”The vote will be non binding, but after the defeat in the Lords on Wednesday, its proponents hope it will demonstrate that there is no majority in the Commons for leaving the customs union, something May has insisted on since her Lancaster House speech last January.The shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, said: “This is further evidence of the growing chorus of cross-party voices concerned that Theresa May’s position on a customs union is wrong in principle.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f606ba36433d974f189033cd504be6242e606a68/0_0_6585_3951/master/6585.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=2bf7a1ca2a3737f839d1ccfe6b4bddfc 1240w","title":"dont let over 55s settle local elections urges labour campaign chief","story":"Andrew Gwynne warns young voters who backed Labour in general election ‘not to leave these matters to over-55s’Labour’s election campaign chief has expressed fears that Jeremy Corbyn’s army of young supporters may not turn out to vote in the local elections, meaning the party might fail to live up to high expectations.Andrew Gwynne, who is also the shadow communities secretary, said there was a danger that the young voters who backed in Labour at the general election would stay at home.“That’s why we’ve been trying to make the case that local councils have a big impact on young people’s lives,” he said. “It is so important for young people not to leave local elections just to the over-55s.”In an interview during which he also suggested that Ken Livingstone should be kicked out of the party , Gwynne said that “odd things can happen” in local elections and that they were a chance to send powerful messages to the national parties. Labour is expected to perform strongly on 3 May, particularly in Tory “crown jewel” London seats such as Westminster and Wandsworth. It faces tougher contests elsewhere in the capital, such as in Barnet, which has a large Jewish vote, and in the north-west in Trafford, which is currently a speck of Tory blue in a sea of red.Gwynne said the polls had been “incredibly unhelpful” to Labour because they raised expectations when the last time the councils had been up for election four years ago the result was generally regarded as a high-water mark for the party. “We are cautious, we think there will be a good set of local elections for us, but some of the swings required go beyond even the huge swings we saw at the last general election,” he said. He made it clear that Labour would not reverse the much-criticised cuts to local government funding, saying that money would be committed directly to areas such as children’s services and adult social care instead. Gwynne, who represented the Labour leadership in the Commons during the debate on antisemitism earlier this week, acknowledged that the party had been far too slow to recognise the problem within its own ranks. He said Labour had a responsibility “not just to call it out, but to root it out” and that outstanding cases could be resolved by the new in-house legal team and disciplinary panel within weeks. “That should have been done long before,” he said. “We’ve got to get our act together and I’m sure that is happening now. It’s going to take time to rebuild confidence in the Jewish community, I accept that.” Asked whether Livingstone, who suggested that Hitler was a Zionist, should be expelled from the party as a symbolic gesture to show it had got to grips with the issue, he said: “It’s a matter for the disciplinary panel, but I don’t think there’s any place in the Labour party for antisemitism. End of.” Pressed over whether he believed that the former London mayor was an antisemite, he described his remarks as “abhorrent and reprehensible”: “Certainly, the views that led to his suspension I would consider to be antisemitic.”Gwynne’s comments came as Labour published an analysis showing that Tory cuts to local government are hitting Labour areas, the north of England and the most deprived councils hardest."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a473cc6b99d003980deb9d0cd87f1b5a0bbc591c/0_171_4752_2851/master/4752.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=45221993595df25e1ef1bd4af9b99a62 1240w","title":"gove says brexit has helped make uk most immigration friendly country in eu politics live","story":"Rolling coverage of the day’s political developments as they happenHunt said he wanted to commend Jowell’s campaigning on behalf of the whole cabinet. He said:Most people come to this place hoping to leave a legacy she has left not just one legacy, but two. Her amazing achievements with London 2012 and her amazing campaigning on cancer. It’s our privilege to take part in this debate and our duty to act on what she’s saying.And at the end of the debate Bercow took the unusual step of making a personal intervention. Addressing Jowell, who was in the gallery, he said:At the outset of the debate I asserted with absolute confidence that Tessa was about to witness and experience real parliamentary love, the embrace of parliamentary love. I hope that the warmth of that embrace of parliamentary love has been manifest to her and she cannot have been in any way disappointed by it. Tessa, you are the standing testament to the indomitability of the human spirit. And we’ve heard about that by people who know you so well in so many aspects of your life. I’m quite certain, though I don’t know it from personal experience, but I can see it in the impact of those around you, that it’s true of you as a wife and as a mother. It is assuredly true of you as a distinguished member of parliament. The member for so long for the people of Dulwich and West Norwood, and I thought that what your successor said about the affection and esteem in which you continue to be held there was worth everything.That’s all from me for today.I don’t always blog on Fridays, but I will be in tomorrow.Sir Vince Cable, the Lib Dem leader, gave a speech this morning about regulating internet giants. This is one of the big issues of her time and many politicians have spoken out on this - for example, Sadiq Khan, the London mayor, last month, and Matthew Hancock, the culture secretary almost all the time - but Cable’s speech is by some distance the best I’ve read on the subject, mainly because he seems to have thought through the economics of the issue in more detail than any of his political peers.One of my rules of politics is that the most interesting speeches are often those that attract no publicity and, true to form, Cable is not exactly leading the news bulletins. But, if you’re interested in this stuff, do read it in full - assuming the Lib Dems ever get round to putting it on their website. In the meantime, here are the main points.National government and, even more so, supranational bodies like the EU can and should look to break up enterprises where size is detrimental to the economic well-being of the country, its citizens and its capacity for innovation. There is a case for splitting Amazon into three separate businesses – one offering cloud computing, one acting as a general retailer and one offering a third-party marketplace. Other examples would be Facebook being forced to est itself of Instagram and WhatsApp as a condition for operating in the EU, creating two new social media networks. Divesting Google of YouTube would be another. What is striking is that the most effective compeition authority in the capitalist world- the European Commission- is probably the only body with the clout to take these decisions. The UK could quite obviously never do it alone.As the world grows closer together, Britain commits an act of serious self-harm by doggedly setting itself apart from the power of shared sovereignty with our neighbours. When it comes to regulating the growth industry of this century - data - Brexit will be like giving up shared influence over where, when and whether it rains, in return for absolute power over a tiny umbrella.While taxation remains stubbornly national, the tech companies’ business is inexorably global.Since that business is largely concerned with the dissemination of information, even long-held conventional concerns about the arrogance of monopoly do not get to the heart of the growing worries about the data giants. They have the capacity to filter the information we receive as consumers, turning the taps on and off to their own advantage. And they sell information about us to clients with not just business but political agendas. They can influence not just the goods and services we consume but how we vote and, indeed, what we think. Their algorithms can be used to disseminate information – true or false – to selected groups of people. The power this gives Facebook, for example, over its two billion users is immense. And even if today’s owners of such platforms are benign and well-intentioned iniduals, the systems they have created and now monopolise may threaten democracy as we know it.I am assuming that this audience would discount Chinese-style nationalisation – and control over the Internet. I do too. But the Chinese will argue that their model is superior to the Wild West system in our non-Communist world. Unless that Wild West is tamed the authoritarian model will grow in appeal.The challenge, is fundamentally different from the exercise of power by traditional monopolies or oligopolies – by oil majors, railway barons, electricity generators, diamond miners, steel cartels, auto and aerospace giants, and hardware and software manufacturers.All of these were able to exercise control over pricing and earn profits beyond what was obtainable in competitive markets. Most obviously these involved finite resources, whereas the supply of data is potentially infinite.And the new internet giants mostly provide a ‘free’ service to the public, albeit paid for indirectly by the sale of advertising space and the bundling and sale to commercial clients of ‘free’ user data. Whatever these companies do, they are not price ‘gouging’ – since their headline price is always ‘zero’. It is the forces underlying this apparently ‘free’ bounty that politicians must address.The internet giants have progressed from heroes to villains very quickly for several overlapping reasons. The first is that they have been used as a conduit for content which society regards as unacceptable: the promotion of terrorism, depictions of child sex abuse, and hate speech. Google (and YouTube, part of its empire) and Facebook in particular stand accused of complicity or incompetence. The second reason is that one particular type of content – online news – is no longer simply competing with established news providers but has been used systematically – by state and non-state actors – to spread false information and to corrupt democratic elections, as in the USA in 2016 and the ‘Brexit’ referendum. The inability or unwillingness of digital platforms, Facebook in particular, to curb the misuse of the data it collects has led to its being seen as the problem rather than the solution. Third, the new internet giants operate in a largely borderless world where their main source of profit is intangible intellectual property rather than measurable ‘things’. This is difficult to track and quantify and has turned national tax authorities into largely powerless bystanders. Fourth, as I’m sure many of you here in the audience today can attest to, there are real concerns that while the tech giants may have begun as innovative upstarts, they have by virtue of their sheer size become a barrier rather than a boon to entrepreneurship. I believe there is a case for setting up an independent standards body to act as watchdog for the digital platforms in moderating content. Platforms above a certain size would be compelled to join.This body would uphold common policies governing the identification, monitoring and deletion of content which offended an ‘offline criminality test’. That is where statements made online would breach incitement or harassment laws if made offline, the companies should act. The body could be funded by Government directly or by the tech platforms themselves through a compulsory levy, as in the case of the Pension Protection Fund.He also said the regulators should have access to the algorithms used by data companies.We should also look carefully at the fundamental economic issue of whether any company which uses data from iniduals to make money should pay the owner of that data for its use. A group of economists from Microsoft and the Universities of Columbia and Stanford have convincingly argued that data should be seen as a form of labour, and more specifically, regarded solely as the property of those that generate it, unless they agree to sell it.Looked at in another way, it is astounding that people have been so happy to give up something so valuable without charge. If iniduals were paid every time their data is used anywhere in the world, in a mirror of the worldwide copyright structure, there would be a mechanism for redistributing the profits of those with most to gain from technological advances, into the pockets of those who are most likely, in the short term at least, to lose.Nick Clegg, the former Lib Dem leader and former deputy prime minister, was the guest at an Institute for Government conversation about Brexit which strayed into other matters. As former chair of the cabinet committee on home affairs, he accused Theresa May and David Cameron of creating a poisonous environment at the Home Office.But his strongest condemnation was of the press barons and editors, in particular the Daily Mail’s Paul Dacre. He said:The breathtaking hypocrisy of unaccountable, unelected, secretive rich millionaires like Paul Dacre … who probably single handedly creating this vituperative climate which led to the victimisation of the Windrush generation and he now dares to shed crocodile tears for those same people and then go after Amber Rudd.If she took the rap for this, it would be a scandal because if there is anyone directly responsible for what’s happening it’s Theresa May not Amber Rudd.In his Daily Telegraph article Nick Timothy, Theresa May’s former adviser, says May never approved of the Home Office’s “go home” vans for illegal immigrants. (See 12.30pm.)My colleague Jessica Elgot and the Times’ Henry Zeffman have been looking at how this squares with what was said at the time.Michael Gove’s memory must be failing him. He claimed today to be a champion of liberal and welcoming migration policies, yet the Vote Leave campaign that he chaired engaged in disgraceful scaremongering about Turkey being on the verge of joining the EU.He also claimed the Brexit vote didn’t lead to worse communal relations, despite their being overwhelming evidence to the contrary, including an official Home Office report which found a sharp spike in hate crime.The reality is that this Government’s obsession with meeting its arbitrary net migration target by delivering an extreme Brexit is damaging lives, hurting businesses and the NHS, and shredding our international reputation.If true, these are deeply concerning revelations. The fact that a Tory donor could be allowed to potentially subvert the system will look bad to taxpayers who play by the rules. The Tories have serious questions to answer on this matter, and I hope the chancellor immediately comes forward to explain this behaviour by HMRC and ensure there was no undue pressure exerted by Conservative Party politicians or officials.Arlene Foster, the DUP leader, has said the ill-fated renewable heat Iincentive (RHI) scheme was not a “personal priority” for her and she wishes she had asked more questions about it. As the Press Association reports, Northern Ireland’s former first minister and former enterprise minister told the public inquiry into Stormont’s botched green energy scheme that she had a “false sense of security” due to the scheme “working” in Great Britain. She also said she was “surprised” that her special adviser, Dr Andrew Crawford, had shared government documents about the scheme with his farmer cousin, and defended the part-time role he currently has with the party. Foster was in charge of the planning of the scheme in 2012 before a series of fatal design flaws in the green subsidy project exposed Stormont to a huge overspend, paying out more than it cost to buy wood fuel. She told the inquiry: “It’s very difficult for me to go rooting about in a department to find out what isn’t being brought up to me.” Asked whether she felt she should have done more “rooting around”, Foster said:Through hindsight, of course one wishes that I had asked more questions in relation to the renewable heat incentive scheme. But putting myself back at that period of time, as I think I’ve indicated on a number of occasions, it wasn’t a personal priority of mine within the department. I had other personal priorities. It doesn’t mean I wasn’t interested - before somebody writes that tomorrow.A backbench debate on vaginal mesh is taking place in the Commons this morning, brought forward by Emma Hardy, Labour MP for Kingston upon Hull West and Hessle, following growing concerns about the safety of such surgery.Hardy says she remains “deeply concerned” that the mesh has not yet been completely suspended and new mothers are still not given universal access to physiotherapy, as happens in France, which could substantially lower the prevalence of problems such as stress urinary incontinence and prolapse, which mesh surgery is used to treat.Conservative MP Sarah Wollaston calls the effects “devastating”:More on Michael Gove and whether or not the UK is the most immigration-friendly country in the UK - if you are still interested.Gove’s office has finally got back to me. I quoted some figures earlier (see 11.18am) which broadly back up Gove’s claim. His adviser, however, has directed me to another chart, in this Ipsos MORI report (pdf) looking at international attitudes to immigration. The UK comes out better than any of the other EU countries in the table - although there are only eight other EU countries in the table, meaning that 19 are not included.The table lists countries according to how people respond to a question about whether immigration has had a positive effect on their economy. Saudi Arabia comes top, which highlights how data like this can be potentially misleading. Saudi Arabians may feel very positive about the contribution made to their economy by immigrant labour, but most people would not view the country as a beacon of tolerance and liberalism.And that takes us to the crux of the problem: when Gove said the UK was “the most immigration-friendly country in the EU”, what did he mean?As argued earlier, if Gove is referring to immigration-friendly neighbours, then his argument more or less stands up (see 11.18am) - unless the migrants happen to have the misfortune of ending up living next to Nigel Farage.If you judge the UK government by asylum applications (a very narrow measure of immigration, but an important one), it also looks very unwelcoming by EU standards.Senior backbenchers are going to force a Commons vote on staying in the customs union next week.It will be a vote on a backbench motion, which means that it will not be binding on the government and - if precedent is anything to go by - Tory MPs will just be encouraged to take the afternoon off instead of voting in the the ision.But the debate will allow pro-Europeans in the Commons to mount a show of strength. And, crucially, it will establish whether there are seven or more Tories willing to vote for staying in the customs union - enough to defeat the government customs union amendments to legislation get put to a vote later in the spring.The motion has been tabled by 10 select committee chairs. Two of them, Labour’s Yvette Cooper and the Conservative Nicky Morgan, have written a joint blog for HuffPost explaining why they back staying in the customs union. They write:With just six months to go before the Brexit deal needs to be concluded, we are running out of time for Parliament to help to shape the negotiations.Yet many of our backbench committees have forensically gathered evidence on different Brexit options and the practical implications.That is why committee chairs at the Liaison Committee – including those who voted leave and who voted remain, supporters and opponents of a customs union – concluded that backbench MPs should get the chance of an early constructive debate and vote on this crucial issue, not bound by the party whips, but informed by committee evidence instead.As two of those chairs, we both believe the case for a customs union is overwhelming - for the sake of British manufacturing, international trade, smooth borders and Northern Ireland peace.Cooper has posted a text of the motion on Twitter.Here is the key passage.This goes further than the customs union amendment passed by the House of Lords last night, which just urged the government to explore the option of staying in the customs union in the Brexit talks. (That amendment seemed to leave open the possibility of the government coming back and saying, having looked at it, it concluded customs union membership was a bad idea.) This motion doesn’t say the UK would definitely remain in the customs union it just sets that as an objective.Nick Timothy, who worked as Theresa May’s policy adviser when she was home secretary and then in Number 10 until after the general election, has used his Telegraph column (paywall) to write about the Windrush generation crisis and to defend (mostly) May’s record. Here are the key points.In the case of the Windrush generation – the people who came to Britain between 1948 and 1971 on their parents’ passports – the department has been slow to realise there was a systemic problem, rather than a handful of tough cases.This reads like a mild dig at Amber Rudd, who replaced May as home secretary in 2016.So ministers are right to make Britain a harder country to live in for people who are here illegally. In recent years, they have made it more difficult for illegal immigrants to rent property, get a job, claim benefits and obtain bank accounts and driving licences. Even sceptical studies find that this increases the number leaving the country voluntarily: ministers should not reverse the policy, but extend it to include other services.Labour want to blame Tory “callousness”.The trouble with this explanation is that the approach began under Labour home secretaries. In 2007, John Reid said “living and working here illegally” should become “ever more uncomfortable and constrained”. Under Alan Johnson, the Border Agency said it would “make the UK a hostile environment” for illegal immigrants.As home secretary, Theresa May was criticised for the notorious “go home or face arrest” vans that were deployed in 2013. In fact, she blocked the proposal, but it was revived and approved in a communications plan while she was on holiday. She killed off the scheme later that year, but by then the damage had been done.My colleague Heather Stewart previewed the Labour housing announcement overnight. Here is the text of Jeremy Corbyn’s speech at the launch this morning. Here is a Guardian article about the plans by John Healey, Labour’s housing spokesman. And here are the main points from Corbyn’s speech.Over the coming months we will go even further, throwing everything we can into building council capacity so that once again they can build on the scale that’s needed. It will mean a new era of social housing, in which councils are once again the major deliverers of social and genuinely affordable housing and set the benchmark for the highest size and environmental standards.When the post-war Labour government built hundreds of thousands of council houses in a single term in office, they transformed the lives of millions of people.People emerged from six years of brutal war to be lifted out of over-crowded and unhygienic slums into high quality new homes and introduced to hitherto unknown luxuries such as indoor toilets and their own gardens.Setting new benchmarks in size and energy efficiency, something that old council stock still does to this day council housing was not a last resort but a place where people were proud to live.Today’s challenges are different but the ambition needed is the same.Today, Labour set out our plan to turn this around and it involves two simple steps: build enough housing and make sure that housing is affordable to those who need it.That’s why we have promised today that the next Labour government will deliver one million genuinely affordable homes over ten years, the majority of which will be for social rent.Housebuilding has been in steady decline for decades, from over 350,000 a year at the beginning of the 1970s to well below 200,000 today. The only times we have built enough affordable housing is when councils have stepped up.We know by now that we cannot rely on arms-length incentives for private housebuilders, building for profit to solve the crisis.As they themselves openly acknowledge, it is simply not profitable for them to build houses for the less well-off. We need to do it ourselves.At the heart of the housing crisis we face today, is that housing has become a means of speculation for a wealthy few, leaving many unable to access a decent, secure home.As a country, we have lost the principle that a decent home is not a privilege for the few but a right owed to all, regardless of income. Let today mark a turning point, from which we start to get it back.The only way to do it is through social housing. And that’s what a Labour government will deliver. At the launch of Labour’s housing green paper Jeremy Corbyn reaffirmed his determination to tackle antisemitism in the party. He said:It’s disgusting, it’s appalling, it’s completely unacceptable in any place whatsoever in our society. I am determined along with others to completely root it out altogether in our society ...We are acting very rapidly on improving our procedures and ensuring that all those who have committed any kind of abusive act are brought to book.There wasn’t a live feed of his speech, but I’ve now got the text. I will post a summary shortly.Sunder Katwala, who runs the British Future thinktank, which focuses on migration and identity, says Michael Gove was right to say that British attitudes towards immigration have become more tolerant since the referendum.On his Twitter feed Katwala flags up various bits of research that back up this view.Rob Ford, an academic specialising in this topic, looks at the evidence in this Medium article. He cites various sets of data, but the key figures are probably the ones in this chart.Here’s the impacts data. This comes from the British Election Study panel fielded by YouGov on a regular basis to a very large representative sample of respondents. The panel regularly asks people whether they think immigration is good or bad for the economy, and whether they think it enriches or undermines cultural life.There is a big, sustained jump in the share of positive responses on both of these measures after the Brexit vote (shown by the red dashed line). Immigration optimists now significantly outnumber pessimists on the economic measure, while on the cultural measure optimists and pessimists are now balanced. Before Brexit, pessimists were the larger group on both measures.And he questions why this might be.Why has this change happened? Immigration policy hasn’t changed, and while migration levels have dropped somewhat, they remain high by historical standards and a long way above the government’s “tens of thousands” net migration target. The vote to leave the EU didn’t change anything on its own. Yet voters across the political spectrum seem to have taken it as a cue to worry about immigration less, and appreciate it more. Why?Michael Gove had an answer on Today - although, as I pointed out earlier, hate crime figures tell a different story. (See 10.19am.)Here is the chart from page 41.And this is what the report says about these findings.UPDATE: See my post at 1.50pm for more on how Gove’s claim can and cannot be justified.John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, has been at the heart of the City this morning pledging a “new start” for Labour’s relationship with the finance industry, though he warned that bankers may not like Labour’s policies on income tax, corporation tax or a financial taxation tax.McDonnell said that Brexit was one issue where Labour and the financial services industry had aligned interests, saying the party was disappointed that economic factors had fuelled the leave vote. He said:I think few people now dispute that these economic failures also contributed to the vote for Brexit in 2016, which we deeply regret.His speech, which launched a Labour conference at the finance giant, is the latest in his efforts to court the City, having spoken earlier this year in at Davos and held regularly private meetings with investors and asset managers. Opening in the speech, he joked that he was not “a raving extremist who is about to nationalise their company and send them on a re-education course somewhere up north.” Labour, he said, would be “open and transparent about our plans ... There are some policies that you will like and some of which you will be less enthusiastic about.”However, he said, Labour would be “a radical, progressive, intervening government” and said the “hands off” approach would not deliver the growth the UK needed. He said:We made it clear that Labour in government will intervene to shape the economy, and that willingness to intervene naturally includes the financial sector.McDonnell said he wanted to get the City onboard with Labour’s plans. “There are no tricks up my sleeve,” he said. When we go into government, we want you to come with us, alongside representatives from our manufacturers, our trade unions and wider civil society. There will be a seat at the policy making and policy delivery table for you. That’s the tone I have tried to engender at the many meetings I have had in the City.Here is a full summary of the main points from Michael Gove’s interview with Today.That is not the way the views of Conservative ministers on immigration have always been characterised. To cite just two example: Theresa May’s speech to the 2015 Conservative party conference, proposing “a tough new plan for asylum”, was roundly condemned as hostile and anti-immigrant. And Gove himself was accused of “stoking the fires of prejudice” when he was running Vote Leave campaign and it put alarmist claims about Turkish criminals and the threat they would pose to the UK if Turkey joined the EU at the centre of its campaign.The striking thing is that, however people want to characterise the Brexit vote, and I do respect the reasons why people were so passionately attached to remaining within the European Union, the characterisation of it as somehow having led to worse communal relations or a more hostile attitude to migration - that just isn’t borne out by the facts.The British people have a robust and pragmatic and liberal approach. They want to welcome people here who want to work. They want to make sure that people who come here contribute fully. But they also want to temper that with compassion towards those who are fleeing persecution.The striking thing is that Britain, like other countries - Canada, Australia - which have control of their borders, is a country which, because we have control, is capable therefore of exercising generosity.However, an official Home Office report says the opposite. A statistical bulletin published last year called Hate Crime, England and Wales, 201617 (pdf) said:The EU referendum campaign began on Friday 15 April 2016, with the result announced on Friday 24 June, the day after the referendum. Around this time there was a clear spike in hate crime. As stated in the introduction, offences with a xenophobic element (such as graffiti targeting certain nationalities) can be recorded as race hate crimes by the police. Anecdotal evidence suggests that there was an increase in these types of offences around the time of the EU referendum.The increase in hate crime can be seen by using racially or religiously aggravated offence data. As mentioned in the Introduction, the police can record offences as being racially or religiously aggravated. While not covering all hate crime offences, these offences make up over 70 per cent of race and religion hate crime ...There was an increase in these offences from April 2016, which reached a peak in July 2016. The number of aggravated offences recorded then declined in August 2016, but remained at a higher level than prior to the EU Referendum. These increases fit the widely reported pattern of an increase in hate crime following the EU referendum, with the level of these offences being 44 per cent higher in July 2016 compared with the previous July. That phrase has been paraded around as though it were somehow emblematic of Britain. It’s not ...My view is that what is emblematic of Britain is the welcome that we gave the Windrush generation, the welcome that we gave the people fleeing Idi Amin in the 1970s, the welcome that we continue to give those fleeing persecution. And also the fact that now, outside the European Union, we can have a truly colour-blind migration policy that, if the British people want to, treats people from the Bahamas in the same way we treat people from Bulgaria.I have never heard anyone make that comparison before Lord Kerslake did. It is not for me to criticise a distinguished former public servant like Lord Kerslake, but I respectfully disagree.I think Amber Rudd has taken a grip of this issue. I think she has done exceptionally well to focus Home Office attention on it. I think the gracious way in which she apologised to those affected was a model of how a politician should react to a situation like this.We are perfectly clear that we are going to ban these plastic items. The purpose of this consultation is to make sure that when we do bring in that ban - and we want to bring it in at pace - that we have it properly.Good morning. Theresa May is attending the formal opening of the Commonwealth heads of government meeting today. But the controversy about the government’s treatment of Windrush generation immigrants continues to dominate the headlines. Here are the latest overnight developments.This was a very contested piece of legislation across government departments ... There were some how saw it - I shan’t name them - as almost reminiscent of Nazi Germany and the way it’s working ... Some ministers were deeply unhappy.Kerslake was probably referring predominantly to Lib Dem ministers.The peer, who now advises the Labour party, also called for an investigation into who authorised the destruction of the Windrush landing cards.Something very striking was reported by the European Union, actually, a little earlier this year, which is that of all the countries in the EU, Britain is the country with the warmest attitude to migration from outside the EU. We’re the most immigration-friendly country in the EU ...In the aftermath of the Brexit vote, there were all sorts of people who said that it was motivated by darker feelings. The truth is that the Brexit vote allowed the British people to say ‘Look, we’ve taken back control, we can now determine what migration policy is in our interests and we can combine both what’s in our economic interests with proper humanity.’ And the really striking thing now is that Britain has the most liberal attitude towards migration of any European country. And that follows the Brexit vote.And I think the characterisation of this country and its people by some as somehow - all sorts of language has been used that I won’t dignify by repeating - I think that is wrong, and I think we can see in the national conversation that we have had about the Windrush generation that people are so glad that this country has had a tradition of welcoming people from abroad.Here is the agenda for the day.9.15am: John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, gives a speech at a Labour half-day conference on the future of the finance sector.10am: Jeremy Corbyn speaks at the launch of a Labour green paper on housing. As my colleague Heather Stewart reports, he will say that a Labour government would rip up the government’s definition of affordable housing and instead bring in a measure linked to people’s incomes.11am: Sir Vince Cable, the Lib Dem leader, gives a speech on “taming the tech titans”.And the Queen will formally open the Commonwealth heads of government meeting, where Theresa May has announced that cotton buds, plastic drinking straws and other single-use plastics could be banned from sale in England next year in the next phase of the campaign to try to halt the pollution of the world’s rivers and oceans.As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web.

Now new photos are revealing the fate of this important site as archaeologists continue to count the cultural cost of IsisThree weeks ago, the Syrian antiquities directorate released new photos showing another devastated archaeological site. Outside Syria the news has received fairly limited press attention, except in France, where Mari, the site in question, is much better known. French archaeologists have been excavating at Mari since 1933, the most recent expedition running until 2010 when the Arab Spring and growing unrest made the site inaccessible. In light of the level of damage which is now evident, perhaps it’s worth sparing a moment to look at why Mari matters to archaeologists, historians and the cultural heritage of Syria.When Islamic State emerged, the part of Deir ez-Zor province in which Mari lies was one of the first areas to fall under its control in early 2014. Under IS, the site suffered an immediate explosion of looting satellite images revealed the change from archaeological site to lunar landscape in a matter of months. More than 1,500 new looting pits were recorded at Mari between 2013 and 2015, likely representing the removal of a huge quantity of ancient objects, sold into the illegal antiquities market to fund Isis and its war.Sadly, this is a story common to many archaeological sites across the region, but Mari isn’t just another site. For archaeologists it’s one of the most important sites so far excavated for those interested in understanding the great urban centres of Bronze Age Mesopotamia, or in ing into the turbulent politics of the second millennium BC. Mari was home to an extraordinary palace. The earliest major structure dates to around 2500-2300 BC, and part of this early palace was restored and preserved at the site, providing a unique opportunity to walk through a third millennium BC Mesopotamian palace, standing almost to its roof beams. This palace area is now very badly damaged. Its protective roof was compromised by a sand storm in 2011, and the security situation at that time left it impossible to make repairs, but the recently released photos show that large parts of the palace’s 2m thick walls have now collapsed. Prof Pascal Butterlin, who directed excavations at the site up until 2010, believes such a level of destruction suggests that explosives, either ground based or more likely from air strikes, were probably involved, adding to the damage caused by looting for financial gain. Butterlin gave a paper detailing the plight of Mari at the International Congress on the Archaeology of the Ancient Near East conference in Munich two weeks ago, to general dismay.For archaeologists and historians, Mari’s royal palace is more famous in its later form. In around 1800 BC the palace was remodelled and expanded by the Lim dynasty and the excavation of this building has provided the most complete picture available of the life of a royal palace and the functioning of a Bronze Age city state. This is in part due to the good preservation of the architecture and the almost complete excavation of the palace’s 300 rooms, but also to the 25,000 cuneiform tablets recovered during the excavations, which mostly date to this time. The texts preserved on the tablets have left us the names of the rulers of Mari, provided a wealth of detail about the city and its people, and opened an exceptional window on the politics and diplomacy of the ancient Near East through the preservation of royal letters between the kings of Mari and the rulers of neighbouring kingdoms. Ruling Mari wasn’t an easy job the city was surrounded by more powerful kingdoms and beset by frequent internal troubles. King Yaggid-Lim was killed by his servants, while Yahdun-Lim was assassinated by his own son, who in turn was also assassinated after a reign of just two years. The best-known king of Mari was Zimri-Lim a contemporary of the mighty Hammurabi of Babylon, famous for the earliest surviving law code.Zimri-Lim, whose father also seems to have been assassinated by untrustworthy servants, managed to wrestle Mari back from a rival royal house. He married Shibtu, a princess from the kingdom of Yamad, centred at modern Aleppo. They had at least eight daughters and many letters between the king and his grown-up daughters survive to illustrate a close and fond fatherly relationship. Zimri-Lim was less successful in his relationship with Hammurabi. After being an ally of Babylon in its wars with Elam and the city state of Larsa, the diplomatic relationship between Zimri-Lim and Hammurabi gradually soured, culminating in a Babylonian army being dispatched to conquer Mari in 1761 BC. It’s impossible to tell how much more of this history may have been hacked out of the ground by the IS-sponsored looters, written on tablets which were sold to fund the fighting.Zimri-Lim disappeared from the historical record when his city fell, presumably because he didn’t survive the encounter, but his palace did survive along with the records of his fourteen-year reign. The palace constructed by the kings of Mari was of unusual magnificence, and the diplomatic texts suggest it was famous in its day as one of the largest and most luxurious royal palaces in existence, the envy of other rulers. The huge courtyards were planted with palm trees and the walls of the palace were painted with elaborate scenes and decorative designs, including a large fresco showing the investiture of Zimri-Lim as King, now displayed in the Louvre. The palace’s chapel contained a life-sized statue of a goddess, which was drilled through so that real water could run from the mouth of the vase held in the goddess’ hands. Sadly, the palace chapel and all the royal reception rooms are now a mass of huge looters pits.Given the wonders of the palace of Mari and the importance of this site, it’s disappointing that the destruction of the palace and the plundering of the site in search of tablets and other saleable objects hasn’t received more attention. The first explanation is that cultural destruction in the Middle East has been so widespread in recent years that it’s ceased to be news-worthy in all but the most extreme cases, which is a depressing thought. A second disadvantage Mari has over more high-profile sites, such as Palmyra, is that its buildings were made of mud, and not the classical stonework which produces photogenic ruins and screams its artistic worth to a general audience. Nevertheless, Mari deserves to be considered as a loss on the same scale as any of the more celebrated sites to have suffered during the Isis conflict.

But the cow skull, dating to at least 3,000 BC and found at the neolithic site of Champ-Durand in France, is the earliest example of such surgery on an animal.While removing part of the skull is a technique sometimes used in modern medicine to control pressure following a head injury that causes bleeding in the brain or brain swelling, the purpose of its precursor, trepanning, has been hotly debated, with some suggesting it was used as some sort of medical intervention, and others that it was a part of rituals.The cow skull is the earliest clear example of trepanation on an animal – while a wild boar skull with a hole, apparently made by cranial surgery, was reported in 1948, Ramirez Rozzi says it is not clear how old that skull is. Writing in the journal Scientific Reports, Ramirez Rozzi and co-author Alain Froment say they dismissed previous conclusions that the hole in the cow’s skull, which at its largest measures about 6.4cm by about 4.7cm, was made in a violent tussle with another cow as there was no sign of fractures or bone splinters. There was also no sign that it was the result of an infectious disease or a tumour.But careful examination showed the hole had the same sort of scrape marks as are seen in human skulls which have been trepanned. The team also found there was no sign that the hole had begun to heal, suggesting that it was made either when the cow was on its on its deathbed, or had already died.The researchers say it is unclear why the hole was made, but that there are two main theories: either stone age humans were honing their skills for making holes in the heads of their peers, making the latest find the earliest evidence of animal experimentation or the hole is the earliest evidence of some sort of veterinary procedure and was carried out in an attempt to save the cow’s life.In the latter case, the authors say, the intervention would likely have been a response to a behaviour change, possibly seizures, suggesting that neolithic humans had made the link between the brain and such problems.However Ramirez Rozzi said the idea of a neolithic vet is the less likely of the two options: the cow was one of many and the animals were eaten for food. “I don’t see why they would save the one cow in the middle of hundreds of cows,” he said.

Instead they rely on weights, handmade wooden goggles – and a single breath of air.But while the Bajau people’s talents have long been known, it was unclear whether the skill was the result of practice, as in the case of the excellent underwater vision of Thai “sea nomad” children, or the result of adaptations which have their roots in the Bajau people’s DNA.Now experts say they have the answer: over time the Bajau people have undergone natural selection, resulting in certain versions of genes becoming widespread – many of which are linked to biological changes, including having a larger spleen, that could help the Bajau to hold their breath underwater for many minutes at a time.The team say the findings could eventually prove useful in medical settings, potentially allowing experts to identify patients that might be at greater risk of death if they experience a lack of oxygen, for example during surgery.“There seems to be so much to learn from the Bajau and other ing populations about how the human body is able to react to oxygen deprivation, which is an important medical issue,” said Dr Melissa Ilardo, first author of the study who was at the University of Copenhagen at the time of the research. Writing in the journal Cell, the scientists reveal how they unpicked the mystery following a clue from previous research: species of seals which can e for longer have larger than expected spleens – an organ which, among its functions, can store oxygen-carrying red blood cells. As a result the team used an ultrasound device to measure the spleen in 43 Bajau people and 33 people from a neighbouring group of farming people, the Saluan.The team note the trend held regardless of whether the Bajau inidual was themselves a er, and even when factors such as age, sex and height were taken into account.Genetic testing revealed that certain versions of genes are more commonly found in Bajau people than would be expected, with many apparently linked to biological changes that could help iniduals cope with low-oxygen conditions. Among them is a form of a gene linked to an increased spleen size – an effect the team reveal is likely down to an increase in thyroid hormone levels. Crucially, a contraction of the spleen is one of the features of the so called “ing reflex” – a set of responses in mammals that occur when the head is submerged. A large spleen means even more oxygen-carrying red blood cells can be pumped into the circulatory system when the organ contracts, allowing iniduals to stay underwater for longer.Another is a form of a gene linked to a different feature of the ing reflex: narrowing of the blood vessels to the extremities, aiding delivery of oxygenated blood to organs such as the brain, heart and lungs.Further analysis by the team revealed that these genetic boons are not the result of chance, but evolutionary adaptations arising from natural selection. Stephen Stearns, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at Yale University who was not involved in the research, saidthe study adds to evidence for recent natural selection on certain genes in human populations – with previous examples including genes for lactose tolerance that cropped up with the advent of domestication of dairy animals, and genes for adaptation to high altitude in Tibetans and Native Americans in the Andes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/855a34d9c356a92b8a3b643b04753028ce769528/0_169_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=b954106829019741df06ecf630719ab8 1240w","title":"disney frozen musical broadway patti murin anxiety","story":"‘Even Disney princesses are terrified sometimes,’ wrote Patti Murin to explain why she missed the 17 April show of Disney’s FrozenBroadway star Patti Murin opened up about mental health to fans in an Instagram post on Wednesday, explaining that she missed a recent show due to an anxiety attack.“I’ve learned that these situations aren’t something to ‘deal with’ or ‘push through’,” Murin wrote. “Anxiety and depression are real diseases that affect so many of us.”Murin, who plays Anna in the musical version of Disney’s Frozen, went on: “Even Disney princesses are terrified sometimes.”Murin credited Disney with being supportive over the missed date, and the role was filled by stand-in Aisha Jackson.Murin’s candor was met with praise from commenters who said the post helped them feel better about their own struggles with anxiety.“I was hospitalized last September because of my anxiety – EKGs and blood work, the whole nine yards.

But while Simon Dormandy’s production, set in a luxury Sicilian spa hotel, fizzes with invention, it boasts one too many bright ideas and doesn’t always reconcile the play’s melodramatic and festive elements. Dormandy’s basic notion is that the play offers a running critique of a brutally patriarchal culture. Thus Don Pedro becomes a black-suited mafia boss, surrounded by armed guards and enjoying a few days’ rest and recreation after a bout of gang warfare. Leonato fits into the pattern as his obliging hotel manager, who apes the clan-chief’s cruelty by rejecting his daughter, Hero, the second her honour is called into question. Unusual attention is also given to normally marginal figures such as Borachio and Margaret: not only are they sexually hyperactive, but the latter’s delight in donning Hero’s wedding dress gives a spurious credence to the absurd idea that, by night, the two women are mistaken for each other. No one, however, goes to see Much Ado for its main plot: ever since Charles I identified the play as the story of Beatrice and Benedick, they have been its star attraction, and Dormandy has to work hard to fit them into his scheme. Giedroyc’s Beatrice, plausibly enough, becomes part of the hotel staff and a woman of fiercely independent character. At one point she brandishes a kitchen knife at Benedick as if taking part in The Great Sicilian Bake Off. She also blazes with fury at Hero’s wedding-day humiliation and scoffs derisively when the Friar suggests the battered bride be hidden away in “some reclusive and religious life”. What I missed in Giedroyc’s performance was any hint of a bruising past liaison with Benedick: when Beatrice, speaking of her heart, says “Marry, once before he won it of me with false dice”, the line goes almost unnoticed. Giedroyc is good but, even to the last, a bit too relentlessly aggressive. John Hopkins fits more easily into the pattern by playing Benedick as Don Pedro’s consigliere, who has absorbed his boss’s misogyny. But Hopkins makes something funny out of the device by which Benedick is tricked into believing Beatrice carries a torch, rather than a carving knife, for him: “Love me? Why?” he asks in tones of total bewilderment. Hopkins also suggests the injunction to “kill Claudio” is something to be taken seriously and displays real violence towards a man who has broken the honour code. It is a performance that confirms Hopkins as one of our best Shakespearean actors. Dormandy has more difficulty accommodating Dogberry: never the most hilarious of Shakespeare’s clowns, he is dutifully played by Stewart Wright as a Sicilian word-mangler with mysterious leanings towards t’ai chi. There are, however, sharply defined performances from Peter Guinness as a Don Pedro straight out of The Godfather, David Rintoul as a savagely authoritarian Leonato and Kate Lamb as a Hero rightly defiant towards the men who destroyed her reputation. Naomi Dawson has also created a massively detailed hotel set complete with fitness zones, sun terraces and disco-parlour. But, while the audience had a good time, I feel the play is more a celebration of Beatrice and Benedick’s unacknowledged love than an attack on an inflexible patriarchy.• At the Rose theatre, Kingston, until 6 May.

JimFree email services are usually paid for by showing you advertisements. Some email services scan your emails in order to show you personalised or targeted ads. You could argue that that’s a benefit, because you’ll see ads in which you might have some interest. You could also argue that your emails are private, so it’s an invasion of privacy. Either way, it’s different from scanning your emails to stop viruses and phishing attempts, which nobody wants to stop.There are several options, but the problem is bigger than you may think, and likely to get worse.When Google launched Gmail in 2004, it did indeed scan your emails for advertising purposes. You could only avoid it by using a paid-for version of the service. That changed last summer, when Google announced that it would no longer scan emails to tailor adverts.That didn’t mean you would get adverts picked at random. As Alex Hern explained here, “the adverts will now be targeted in the same way as other Google services, based on information gleaned from other activity on users’ profiles, such as their searches, browsing activity, and even physical locations”.Google has the world’s largest known tracking system, thanks partly to Google Analytics – which is used on far more websites than any Facebook tracker – and its DoubleClick advertising business. Add Google Search and it already knows so much about you that scanning your emails may well be superfluous. The good news is that you can delete a lot of it, with the help of a Guardian article by Dylan Curran: Here is all the data Facebook and Google have on you.The problem is that Google has lots of other reasons to read your email, and you may find some of them useful. For example, Google might tell you about traffic jams or flight delays, put appointments in your calendar, or offer to write quick email replies for you. These features involve AI software reading your emails, tracking your website visits, and your location. In the future, it may include information from home speakers (Google Home etc), household gadgets (Nest etc), fitness bands, smartwatches, cars (Waymo) and other connected devices.As AI gets smarter, there will be more and more opportunities for companies to track you, profile you, and help you.In other words, scanning emails to tailor advertising is a relatively minor issue in the great scheme of things. The larger problem is that the whole web economy is based on surveillance, and there’s very little you can actually do about it. Even if you try to stay anonymous and block cookies, you might be identified by techniques such as device profiling, fingerprinting, and AI systems that can recognise your typing.Neither of the two largest email services – Google’s Gmail and Microsoft’s Outlook.com – scans your emails for advertising purposes. If you want to avoid those, Zoho Mail is a good alternative. It’s primarily aimed at business users, and includes an online office suite and other features. It offers a free service with 5GB of mail storage space, so you can try it. You may find it’s worth paying €24 per year for 30GB of storage and other features such as domain aliases and Microsoft Active Sync support.ProtonMail, which is based in Switzerland, is one of the most privacy-conscious email services, and offers encrypted and self-destructing emails. However, it only provides 500MB of storage to non-paying users. ProtonMail Plus costs €48 per year for 5GB of storage, while ProtonMail Visionary costs €288 per year for 20GB. You’d be more likely to use this as a supplementary service than for all your emails.FastMail is a popular alternative, because it offers good support with no ads and no tracking, but it’s not free. The Basic service with 2GB of storage costs $30 per year, while 25GB costs $50 and 100GB costs $90 per year. There’s a 30-day free trial so you can test it first, and a migration guide to help you switch from another supplier.Most people now access their email service via a web browser. The pre-web alternative was to use an email client program to download new emails to your PC. If you use an email client then you won’t see any targeted adverts even if your emails are scanned.In the old days, email programs used POP3, the Post Office Protocol. The software downloaded your emails then deleted them from the mail server. This has mostly been replaced by IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol), which downloads emails and leaves them on the server, unless you delete them deliberately. This means you can download the same emails to several PCs, or read them online with a different smartphone, tablet or PC, etc.Email programs have fallen on relatively hard times, and Microsoft has discontinued the Windows Live Mail program that was popular with Ask Jack readers, (although it still works). This is partly because devices may already include a mail app, and the Mail and Calendar app in Windows 10 is actually pretty good for most users. It supports multiple accounts, not just Outlook.com, and there are companion Outlook apps for Android and Apple smartphones.Alternatives include Mozilla’s free and open source Thunderbird, which runs on Windows, MacOS and Linux, and Windows programs such as Mailbird and eM Client. Mailbird Lite is free but you can get Mailbird Pro for $39 (or $19.50 at the time of writing). eM Client is free for non-commercial use but there’s a Pro version for £35.94.Business users tend to use Microsoft Outlook, which is one of the main Office programs. Outlook is not included in the Home and Student edition, but you could pick up a cheap version of Office 2016 Professional. Alternatively, you could subscribe to Office 365 Personal (£$59.99 per year for one user), or Office 365 Home (£$79.99 per year for five users), and download it. Each Office 365 user gets 1TB of storage, which makes it economical.The online advertising industry has a self-regulatory body called the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA), which offers advice to consumers. There’s also the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI), a non-profit organisation that describes itself as “the leading self-regulatory association dedicated to responsible data collection and its use for digital advertising”.The NAI has an “opt out” page, which sets an opt-out cookie that will be respected by NAI members. You will still see ads, but most will not be targeted ads. It offered me the chance to opt out of targeted ads from 90 members, including Google, Microsoft and Yahoo. You have to run it in every browser you use.You can also install the EFF’s Privacy Badger andor the open source Ghostery browser add-on. Privacy Badger tries to enforce Do Not Track if you have that turned on in your browser.Another idea is to use Firefox’s first-party isolation (FPI) feature, which Mozilla has adopted from the Tor browser. To turn it on, paste the following into the address bar and set the top preference to True:This may create log-in problems so it’s better to use an extension instead.A more practical idea, currently, is to use a Firefox container to isolate a particular site. Mozilla offers a Facebook Container extension, which makes it easy. The full Multi-Account Containers extension lets you keep any site – or group of sites – separate. It was designed to let you, for example, log into two or more different accounts on one service in the same browser at the same time. However, you could use a container to isolate Gmail or any other service.Have you got a question?

Here, writers, rangers and guides reveal their favourite spotsExploring Britain and appreciating the charms of its incredible landscape wasn’t always a top priority for me. Like many, I ignored what was on the doorstep as I rushed abroad. Which is nothing new. Celia Fiennes, an early pioneer of the Great British road trip, argued in the 17th century that we should all get out more and explore our homeland to “cure the evil Itch of overvalueing fforeign parts”.Her words ring truer now than ever. In my case, it took a trip to the other side of the planet to jolt me out of my complacency. Back from New Zealand, raving about its scenery, I was swiftly put in my place by a friend: “Haven’t you been to the Highlands of Scotland?”I hadn’t. But since then, I’ve been making up for lost time. Glen Coe, one Britain’s most dramatic landscapes, is popular, being only 30 minutes from Fort William but it’s big enough to feel properly wild, with empty Rannoch Moor providing a suitably contrasting backdrop to the mountains. Some friends and I recently enjoyed a night’s bivvy at the top of Buachaille Etive Mòr, the iconic mountain, but not without incident.A large bird, possibly in league with Satan, tore into our food supplies while backs were turned and then cackled at us all the way down the hill the next day. An incredible place for a night’s sleep but consider bringing a scarecrow. Humphrey Butler, publisher of the Joyously Busy Great British Adventure Map (£14.99, marvellousmaps.com)While northern Dartmoor is beautiful and hilly, the south is vast open moorland with no one around, and Duck’s Pool is one of its remotest parts. We call it the Bermuda Triangle because a lot of Duke of Edinburgh groups tend to get lost there – it’s featureless, boggy and sometimes misty, so can be disorientating and a bit scary. It’s not for the fainthearted and you need to know how to navigate, but the solitude and beauty make it a wonderful place – you can walk for several hours across open terrain.For me, it’s real Dartmoor, the high moorland that only hardier walkers see. It is the site of one of the first “letterboxes”. Letterboxing is a hobby dating back to the 19th century, where walkers follow clues and document their experience by stamping a visitor’s book kept in a “letterbox”. This letterbox is also the site of a memorial stone for William Crossing, who wrote Crossing’s Guide to Dartmoor. John Diplock, director Dartmoor-based activity operator Spirit of AdventureMam Nick is the road that climbs steeply from Edale to Mam Tor, deep within the Peak District national park. The road looks pretty straightforward in cycling terms but once the overhanging trees disappear, the road swings lefts over the Noe river and kicks up twice, hardly giving you chance to appreciate the spectacular views of the valley towards Win Hill. As the road snakes around, there are great views of Back Tor, Lord’s Seat and Kinder Scout behind you, if you care to stop for a breather.I first discovered this route on my bike in 2009 and was surprised how quiet it was compared with the hum of tourists and traffic at better-known Peak District attractions. The road is quiet throughout the week, and used mainly by ramblers and walkers at weekends. The only sound is the occasional call of a red kite or buzzard. Perhaps this is because you won’t find it written on a map – only locals call it Mam Nick.It is one of the toughest cycling climbs and, in the opposite direction, one of the most exhilarating descents in Derbyshire, on what is left of the abandoned Shivering Mountain (Mam Tor) road and the hair-raisingly steep Winnats Pass. Both roads boast amazing views back towards the Hope valley. Thom Barnett, founder of Sheffield-based clothing company MamnickFrom the start of the drive from Llandovery (the nearest town, 10 miles away), you sense that you’re delving deep into the rugged heart of the Cambrian mountains, a truly undiscovered gem of Carmarthenshire. Gwenffrwd–Dinas is an RSPB reserve, set up to protect the habitat of this ancient Atlantic oak woodland. It covers 600 hectares and is best experienced on a circular walk over a couple of hours.Initially, the trail runs alongside the still-infant Towy river, which, even in the driest season, roars across the rocks through the gorge from its source at Llyn Brianne as it cuts through the mystical oak and alder woodland. Use the steps cut out of boulders to take on the challenge of finding the well-hidden cave of Twm Siôn Cati (the Welsh highwayman). The feeling of tranquillity and isolation is spectacular, as red kites, pied flycatchers and tree pipits soar overhead. My favourite time in Dinas is May, when bluebells cast a violet haze over the valley.Alan Warner, countryside rangerThe Lakeland landscape can be ided into four parts, each feeling and looking quite different. The east shifts from scoured fells to woody limestone crags. The south-west is spacious, wild-valleyed and overlooked by the scowling buttresses of England’s highest mountains. The north-west is all jumbled, knuckled hills plunging to lake-floored vales. Then there’s the far north. There are no lakes here. No roads. Here the fells swoop and bulge, looking more Scottish than English. Unbroken by the gapes of crags, it’s Arctic-esque in the snow, pristine white rolling into white.You can lose yourself in 100 sq km or so. It is rampart-edged and slashed by valleys, with a high central keep. Caught within the encircling noose of roads are familiar fells – Skiddaw, Blencathra – and odd, unfamiliar names: Dead Crags, Thief Gill, Trusmadoor. It’s not impenetrable: the Cumbria Way splits on the way in, running around its centre like a moat. There’s even a bothy, in awesome isolation. I’d tell you where but no explorer wants directions.Hesket Newmarket lies to the north, a stone village with the Old Crown pub serving beers named after the local fells: Brim Fell, Old Carrock, High Pike.You couldn’t call any part of the Lakes a wilderness in itself. But by night, under cloud, or in winter, this is as wild a place as you’ll find. Simon Ingram, editor of Trail magazineLand’s End is one of the busiest places in Cornwall. Yet just a mile to the south along the South West Coast Path, and two miles north of popular Porthgwarra, is a bay of towering cliffs and caves that has two names: Nanjizal and Mill Bay. I love exploring this one-mile stretch of heathland and disused copper-mining shafts, along a mainly vertiginous footpath between two craggy granite promontories. These headlands are called Carn les Boel and Carn Boel, and the latter is my favourite, with remnants of an iron age settlement.Here I can be alone and observe seals, seabirds and peregrines rearing their young. On a clear day in May, you’re immersed in yellow gorse, orange lichen, aquamarine sea and the light and dark browns of granite glinting with feldspar. I often bring my walking guests to this bay, where we sit up high, on one side or the other of Carn les Boel, depending on the wind direction, watching the breaking waves with the sound reverberating around the bay.

But don’t be fooled by gentle curves – the Sperrins’ heart is vastly bleak.Begin by following my favourite road through the foothills to Banagher Glen’s ancient forest of oak and ash. Here, having evaded St Patrick’s banishment, Ireland’s last serpent lurks in a pool swollen by the Altnaheglish and Glenedra burns. Climbing, the forest thins to mountain bog stretching across the uplands. The view pans to the Foyle Estuary. From Sawel, the highest peak in the range, you can gaze east all the way to the Mournes, and to Binevenagh on the north coast.Then turn around. There’s an aching wilderness of montane heath loping to the interior. With soaring buzzards to guide you, trek the lengths of eskers skirting peat-dark tarns and pools. If rough ground speckled with summer’s bog cotton keeps your eyes lowered, you’ll spy cloudberry and sundew among the coarse grasses and heather. But meadow pipit and wheatear will draw your gaze skyward to where a peregrine might slice it.Or you’ll stumble into the neolithic. Monuments, like Clogherny Wedge Tomb, cued by boulder erratics, litter the moorland with standing stones and circles. Heading west, past the Mullaghs, old bog roads descend to the glacial valleys of Glenelly and Owenkillew patchworked by gorse-seared hill-farms. Further pockets of forest shelter red squirrel and pine marten.

Mary Montague, poet and author of Tribe (Dedalus Press, £9)If you want wild and remote, head to Handa, off the Sutherland coast. It’s not far from the North Coast 500 route, which is attracting growing numbers of visitors, but as an island we are one of the most isolated spots along this coastline. We look out of our bothy on to nothing, just mountains. Handa was last inhabited in 1847, when the islanders were relocated to Nova Scotia (voluntarily). Now it is an internationally important breeding site for seabirds, protected by the Scottish Wildlife Trust. Much of the island is surrounded by spectacular sandstone cliffs, which provide nesting sites for fulmars, kittiwakes, one of the UK’s largest guillemot colonies and 200 pairs of puffins. But on the east side, there are pristine beaches and sand dunes. Inland, the boggy moorland is home to the great skua, or bonxie as it’s known here. Most people arrive by ferry from Tarbet on the mainland (April-Sept, handa-ferry.com) but it is possible to kayak over and wild camp – if you check with the rangers first. • scottishwildlifetrust.org.ukCraig Nisbet, ranger, Handa island Don’t be put off by images of people and trains chuffing up Snowdon – Snowdonia is one of Britain’s greatest wildernesses, second only to Scotland’s Cairngorms in size and emptiness.

The clear waters are home to numerous aquatic creatures, from shoal upon shoals of silvery darting fish to lobster-like crayfish crawling across the river bed. You may spot the iridescent flash of a kingfisher patrolling his “beat” and in search of his next meal, the unmistakable stream of fizzing bubbles as the elusive otter speeds off into the distance, or a Chinese water deer at the river’s edge.A footpath runs alongside the river for about nine miles from Aylesham to Coltishall, and the Bure Valley Steam railway roughly follows the same route, so you can walk one way and get the train back. Much of the river is privately owned so there are few boats on it, and it’s quite possible to canoe for two days and not see another soul. To have that tranquility just two hours from London is incredible.

But, after seven years, its time has comeThe rumours have been circling for a while, but it now seems that a final decision has been made. Claire Danes this week confirmed that Homeland’s eighth season would be its last. For many, this announcement will be greeted with nothing more than the Alan Partridge shrug gif. After all, everyone knows that watching Homeland stopped being a thing with the exit of Nicholas Brody, played by Damian Lewis, dangling 100ft in the air from a crane. Some even stopped watching at the end of season one, apparently appalled at Brody’s failure to assassinate the president and his cabinet when he had both proximity and a perfectly good suicide vest on his side. Homeland, the story runs, is old news.I submit that this is fake news. The truth is, a few wobbles aside, Homeland has maintained a high standard throughout its run. It is true that the chemistry between Danes’ brilliant but erratic Carrie Mathison and Lewis’s damaged beyond repair Brody was spectacular. It’s also true that very few shows could survive the exit of such a compelling figure as Brody. In Homeland’s case, though, Brody leaving was the making of it, forcing it to be recalibrated as an intense, thrill-a-minute roller coaster ride.It also retained an almost spooky relevance. Indeed, Homeland’s ability to mirror current world events is unrivalled in TV. Right from the start, events such as the mysterious circumstances of Bowe Bergdahl’s captivity were described by CNN as being “straight out of a Homeland episode” and the media delighted in pointing out similarities between his case and Brody’s. In season five, an attack on a European capital chillingly echoed the Paris attacks that took place that very same month. Then, in season six, an embattled president-elect at war with the National Security establishment offered an eerie parallel with President Trump’s woes. For a show that frequently took liberties with plausibility, it had an uncanny knack of looking like the real world. This was no accident. The show’s consultant, John MacGaffin, is a former CIA station chief. Each year before production begins, he brings together the Homeland writing team, along with Claire Danes and her fellow star Mandy Patinkin, and they conference together with intelligence professionals to get a sense of what their concerns are and what may be the big topics in the coming year. It’s due diligence such as this that has kept the show meaningful. Homeland began in the middle of Obama’s first term, in a world that now seems like a different century. Back then, the idea of a White House with a reality-TV star incumbent would have been laughed out of even the most outlandish writers’ meeting (and Homeland has had a few of those). That the show has managed to predict so much of the changes ahead of time is testament to its research and its purpose beyond the magical Carrie and Brody relationship. Homeland never needed a doomed romance to justify our love. Although it is still one of the better dramas on TV, I can accept that the cracks are starting to show. The generally strong current season has been hampered by an all-too-familiar subplot involving Carrie going off her meds and off the rails. Storylines repeat themselves first as tragedy, then as farce, and even though Danes is an actor gifted enough to sell anything, it’s hard to escape the sense that the show might be running out of ideas. Similarly, there are only so many times her lovers can die in horrible circumstances before it starts losing emotional impact. She is now statistically a more dangerous girlfriend than Downton Abbey’s Lady Mary, and when you’re in that company, self-parody is never far away. So the timing is right. I don’t ever want Homeland to be that washed-up pug, convinced that they’ve got one last fight left in them. . And as berserk and implausible as it often was, it will still go out feeling more realistic than the clown show currently playing out on the world stage.

Cohen has repeatedly denied the allegation.The alleged trip to Prague, the Czech capital, was said by Steele’s sources to have been “a cover up and damage limitation operation”, after news reports had disclosed payments made to Trump’s campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, by pro-Kremlin authorities in Ukraine, and meetings held in Moscow by Carter Page, an adviser to the Trump campaign. Both deny any wrongdoing.Cohen’s complaint against Fusion GPS and its founder, the former investigative reporter Glenn Simpson, said that he was “collateral damage” in a hostile political operation conducted by the company.Cohen’s team did not immediately respond to an email asking whether his decision related to the McClatchy report.“The decision to voluntarily discontinue these cases was a difficult one,” his attorney Schwartz told Politico, which first reported that the lawsuits had been dropped. “We believe the defendants defamed my client, and vindicating Mr Cohen’s rights was – and still remains – important. But given the events that have unfolded, and the time, attention and resources needed to prosecute these matters, we have dismissed the matters, despite their merits.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a7ca37cd5c7656851300f0f6a7b631bc0b5c7353/0_10_4588_2749/master/4588.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=f855c829b4f087aa53cc5669ec6fdbfc 1240w","title":"berlins famous berghain nightclub should lose licence says afd","story":"Rightwing populist party distances itself from request to district office that says continuous opening hours ‘provoke’ drug useBerlin’s most famous nightclub, Berghain, should be stripped of its trading licence, according to a formal request submitted to a district office in the German capital on behalf of the rightwing populist party Alternative für Deutschland.The AfD request calls for Berghain’s opening hours to be limited to 10pm to 6am to align with “natural circadian rhythms”, and for sexual activity in the club’s “dark rooms” to be suppressed by use of “appropriate lighting and personnel”.Berghain is widely seen as Germany’s most famous techno club, regularly drawing dance music fans who visit the city with the sole purpose of getting past the strict door policy and spending a weekend inside the disused power station on the border of Berlin’s Kreuzberg and Friedrichshain districts.In 2016, Berlin’s fiscal court ruled that the nightclub should be taxed at a lower rate because it was providing high-culture entertainment comparable to a classical concert venue.The request submitted on behalf of the AfD references the death by overdose of a 30-year-old American woman in Berghain last year, and argues that the club’s policy of continuous opening hours was “provoking” the use of amphetamines. Sybille Schmidt, a district councillor and the author of the paper, suggested that Berghain’s organisers should learn lessons from nightclubs in “Manchester, London, Rio, or on Sardinia” to improve door policy. She dismissed the club’s bouncers as “unintelligent, unsightly posers”.Frank Hansel, an AfD delegate in the Berlin assembly, distanced his party from Schmidt’s request on Thursday: “The applicant is an independent and cannot speak for the party,” Hansel said on Twitter.Maximilian Schirmer, a Left party councillor who uploaded the formal request on Twitter, said: “The AfD wants to close down Berghain.

It adds: “Variants of the strategy exemplified in Iraq have been implemented again and again. Colonel Gaddafi in Libya, President Mubarak in Egypt, President Mobutu in Zaire and oppressive rule over South Sudan and the Taliban in Afghanistan: the ousting of all these regimes have been followed by ‘pop-up democracy’. Yet none of these societies duly became flourishing democracies. Instead each disintegrated into varied degrees of disorder.”Cameron himself makes a similar point in a Guardian opinion article summarising the report, without specifically referencing his role in the Libyan intervention. The report, he writes, “concludes that the building blocks of democracy – the rule of law, checks and balances, the protection of minorities – matter more than the actual act of holding an election, important though that seminal moment of democracy can be”.“The report argues that the rush to multi-party elections is often a mistake,” he adds. “Far better to take time in resolving disputes and conflicts, forging a genuine national consensus on power-sharing, and putting in place checks and balances that may help to prevent another slide towards violence and state failure.”Cameron’s remarks do not mean he regards the whole Libyan intervention as a mistake, though they draw attention to the fact that, as in Iraq, post-conflict planning was misguided in pushing for elections before seeking reconciliation. The same mistake was made even though the Iraq disaster prompted Whitehall to undertake a thorough re-evaluation of interventions.Parliamentary elections in Libya were held in the summer of 2012, within a year of Gaddafi’s death in October 2011. Ever since those elections, factional and tribal disputes have left the country in a state of chaos, with a faultline between between east and west. Abuse of migrants trying to make their way north into Europe is rife. The arrival of thousands of people in Italy via the Mediterranean helped fuel the success of populist parties in the Italian election in March.Barack Obama privately referred to the post-conflict era in Libya as a “shit-show”, and told the Atlantic magazine in 2016: “When I go back and I ask myself what went wrong … there’s room for criticism, because I had more faith in the Europeans, given Libya’s proximity, being invested in the follow-up.” Cameron in particular “became distracted by other things”, Obama said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/04e5bb11b968afe273e38fedbf9d2c07213ac999/0_32_3472_2084/master/3472.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=ef3aa70101b67d1a6f300ee6ebb2b99a 1240w","title":"daphne project meps and authors crank up pressure on maltese authorities","story":"Salman Rushdie, Margaret Atwood and Tom Watson among those calling for more to be done to investigate murder of journalist Daphne Caruana GaliziaMalta’s government has been told to take urgent action to implement EU anti-money laundering rules, as MEPs rang the alarm about the dangers for journalists investigating financial crime following the murder of Daphne Caruana Galizia.The pressure intensified as the country’s prime minister, Joseph Muscat, attended the Commonwealth heads of government summit in London amid further calls for him to provide reassurance that her death is being fully and impartially investigated. Labour’s deputy leader, Tom Watson, called on the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, to challenge Muscat “over this very serious case … It is clear not enough progress has been made in the investigation of this terrible murder.” The intervention came two days after the launch of the Daphne Project, a collaboration between international media organisations, including the Guardian, that came together in response to her murder and have pledged to continue her work.The reverberations from the launch continued today across the political and cultural spectrums. Seventy-two MEPs, from six political groups, added their names to an open letter from 250 international authors, including Salman Rushdie, Margaret Atwood and Ian McEwan, demanding the removal from office of Jason Micallef, the chairman of Valletta 2018, the European Capital of Culture.In a letter to the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, they accused Micallef of ridiculing Caruana Galizia. The commission itself piled pressured on Malta, one of eight EU member states that missed a deadline last year to put an EU anti-money laundering directive into national law. The EU directive, agreed in 2015, tightened up anti-money-laundering checks, requiring authorities to create registers that disclose the true owners of companies.The European commission said on Thursday that it was “in dialogue with the Maltese authorities” on the implementation of the rules. “There are ongoing infringement proceedings against several member states, including Malta, and we expect them to transpose the relevant EU rules urgently,” a commission spokesperson said.The European Banking Authority has also been asked to ensure “that financial institutions established in Malta satisfy the requirements laid down in union anti- money laundering and counter terrorism legislation”, the spokesperson added.Malta’s government announced last week a three-year strategy to combat money laundering and terrorist financing. Police will be required to create an anti-money-laundering unit, while courts will be asked to do more to trace and freeze the proceeds of crime. Other measures include more staff at Malta’s financial intelligence unit and the creation of transparency registers to reveal the true owners of companies, trusts and charities.Transparency registers for companies will eventually have to be available to all citizens, not only government officials, after MEPs on Thursday backed measures to extend EU anti-money-laundering checks. Under the 2015 version of the law, which Malta has failed to implement, only national officials have access to a register of beneficial owners of companies, but the EU has now agreed to open these registers to journalists, NGOs and other citizens.The change, which will take at least 18 months to be implemented, has been hailed by anti-corruption campaigners as a big step in the fight against tax evasion, although trusts will escape scrutiny.Demands for transparency gained momentum after the Panama papers exposed how secretive offshore companies were used to evade tax, shelter criminal funds and hide political bribes. Terrorist attacks in Paris and Brussels also exposed loopholes used by terrorists to move funds across borders.A fearless anti-corruption journalist, Daphne Caruana Galizia’s reporting came to international attention with her exposes in the 2016 Panama Papers project.On 16 October the following year, the Maltese reporter was murdered by a bomb placed under the driver’s seat of her car.The Daphne Project was created to continue her investigations. It is a collaboration of 18 media organisations in 15 different countries, including the Guardian, Reuters, Le Monde and the New York Times.The project is the first to be led by\u0026nbspForbidden Stories, an international network of journalists who stand ready to take over when colleagues are silenced through imprisonment or murder.The project will publish a series of fresh revelations, setting out the dangers that alleged political corruption and poor controls on money laundering inside Malta pose to law and order in Europe.Separately on Thursday, MEPs backed a resolution calling for better protection of journalists and whistleblowers across the EU. The text, approved by 573 of the parliament’s 751 members, was drawn up largely as a response to the murder of Slovak journalist Ján Kuciak, who had been investigating extortion of EU agricultural funds by the Italian mafia, allegedly supported by local politicians. Kuciak and his fiancee, Martina Kušnírová, were murdered in their home, prompting Slovakia’s biggest street protests since the fall of communism and the resignation of the prime minister.In the resolution, MEPs said they were concerned about “the allegations of corruption, misuse of EU funds, abuse of power and conflicts of interest in Slovakia, which could cause the deterioration of democracy”.The European parliament’s special committee on financial crimes should “evaluate the allegations of VAT fraud, money laundering and misuse of European funds … with special regard to the work of Ján Kuciak and other investigative journalists”, it said.The parliament “is appalled by the fact that this is the second fatal attack on a journalist in the EU in the past six months after journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia was assassinated”.The European parliament hopes to step up pressure on Maltese and EU authorities over the killing of Caruana Galizia. A special delegation of MEPs has called for meetings with the Maltese authorities and the European commission’s vice-president in charge of safeguarding the rule of law, Frans Timmermans. Sven Giegold, the German Green MEP who convened the group, has long accused the commission of not doing enough.“The European commission has to overcome its light-touch policy on the rule of law problems in Malta and urgently act as the guardian of European values,” he said.Malta’s “cash for passports” scheme is also under the scrutiny of EU authorities. There are fears that the country is selling EU citizenship to wealthy non-residents with little connection to the island. Campaigners are planning protests outside a gala dinner event to promote Malta’s “inidual investor programme”. Muscat is expected to attend the event in central London on Friday.

All they are expressing is the end of hostile policies against North Korea, followed by a guarantee of security.”There has never been a summit between a sitting US president and a North Korean leader, though Bill Clinton came close to agreeing to meet Kim’s father, Kim Jong-il, in late 2000.“As you know, I will be meeting with Kim Jong-un in the coming weeks to discuss the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula,” the US president told reporters at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. “Hopefully that meeting will be a great success and we’re looking forward to it.”North Korea has defended its weapons programmes, which it pursues in defiance of UN security council resolutions, as a necessary deterrent against perceived US hostility. There are 28,500 US troops in South Korea, a legacy of the 1950-53 Korean war.North Korea has said over the years that it could consider giving up its nuclear arsenal if the US removed its troops from South Korea and withdrew its so-called nuclear deterrence umbrella from South Korea and Japan.The North may have found a way to make a nuclear warhead small enough to put on a missile, but firing one at the South is likely to provoke retaliation in kind, which would end the regime.\u0026nbspPyongyang has enough conventional artillery to do significant damage to Seoul, but the quality of its gunners and munitions is dubious, and the same problem – retaliation from the South and its allies - remains.In the event of a non-nuclear attack, Seoul\u0027s residents would act on years of experience of civil defence drills, and rush to the bomb shelters dotted around the city, increasing their chances of survival.South Korea announced on Wednesday that it was considering how to convert a decades-old armistice with North Korea into a full peace agreement. Reclusive North Korea and the rich, democratic South are technically still at war because the 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce, not a peace treaty. Moon said he saw the possibility of a peace agreement and even international aid for North Korea’s economy if it denuclearises.Trump confirmed this week that Mike Pompeo, the CIA director, had travelled to North Korea to meet Kim, paving the way for Trump to hold the summit.The mission, which came shortly after Pompeo was nominated as secretary of state, was the highest level meeting between the two countries since 2000, when Madeleine Albright met Kim’s father, Kim Jong-il, in Pyongyang. It also marked the first time Kim Jong-un had met a senior western official.Speaking at a joint press conference with the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, Trump said: “We’ve never been in a position like this with that regime, whether it’s father, grandfather or son, and I hope to have a very successful meeting. If we don’t think it’s going to be successful, we won’t have it, we won’t have it. If I think that it’s a meeting that is not going to be fruitful, we’re not going to go.“If the meeting when I’m there is not fruitful, I will respectfully leave the meeting and we’ll continue what we’re doing or whatever it is that we’ll continue, but something will happen.”Abe said no reward should be given to North Korea just because the country was responding to dialogue over its development of nuclear weapons. “Maximum pressure should be maintained,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f25e53176648c27748ffc56201dd7a0d4433ce0/0_294_5031_3019/master/5031.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=753f2b464146f4376fe921880da0eddd 1240w","title":"queen suggests prince charles should be next commonwealth head","story":"Wish expressed as leaders of member states meet in London for biennial two-day summitThe Queen has expressed her desire for Prince Charles to succeed her as the leader of the Commonwealth, voicing her views the day before top government officials from the 53-nation body meet at Windsor Castle to discuss the issue.Her unusually candid declaration was made at what will almost certainly be her last attendance at the Commonwealth heads of government meeting (CHOGM) as she welcomed presidents, prime ministers and foreign ministers to the two-day biennial summit at a ceremony at Buckingham Palace.“It is my sincere wish that the Commonwealth will continue to offer stability and continuity to future generations and will decide one day the Prince of Wales should carry on the important work started by my father in 1949,” she said.Decision day, according to Downing Street officials this week, is likely to be on Friday, when the leaders retreat to Windsor Castle in Berkshire without aides or advisers present to mull over issues confronting the organisation, not least the vexed question of its next leader.The position is not hereditary and not automatically held by a British monarch, and there has been speculation for years over whether Charles would become its titular head. It seems unlikely Commonwealth leaders will defy such a directly expressed wish of their host, especially the day before the Queen’s 92nd birthday on Saturday.The Queen, who presides over the summit but does not take part in discussions, revealed her hand at the first CHOGM to be held in London for 32 years. As she no longer goes abroad, the current summit will almost certainly be her last. Charles has represented her at recent CHOGMs.A 53-gun salute in London’s Green Park marked the formal opening of the gatheringwith a ceremony in the ballroom at Buckingham Palace. Forty-six government leaders from the 53 nations attended, along with foreign ministers. They arrived in motorcades driven on to the palace forecourt where they were greeted by a guard of honour formed by the Coldstream Guards, whose officers and soldiers lined up in their scarlet tunics and bearskins. The flags of all of the Commonwealth’s 53 member states were flown, as senior royals including Charles, the Duchess of Cornwall, Duke of Cambridge and Prince Harry, turned out to greet them.Inside the ballroom the opening ceremony was hosted by the BBC presenter Reeta Chakrabarti. The singer Emeli Sandé sang the national anthem and a group of Commonwealth singers performed Natasha Bedingfield’s song Unwritten.The prime minister, Theresa May, paid tribute to the Queen. “Over many years you have been the Commonwealth’s most steadfast and fervent champions,” she said.Charles had earlier addressed leaders and highlighted his Commonwealth credentials. “For my part, the Commonwealth has been a fundamental feature of my life for as long as I can remember, beginning with my first visit to Malta when I was just five years old,” he said.“I pray that this Commonwealth heads of government meeting will not only revitalise the bonds between our countries, but will also give the Commonwealth a renewed relevance to all citizens, finding practical solutions to their problems and giving life to their aspirations. “By doing so, the Commonwealth can be a cornerstone for the lives of future generations, just as it has been for so many of us.”Joseph Muscat, Malta’s prime minister and the Commonwealth’s chair-in-office, hinted at rubber stamping the Queen’s wish for her son to succeed her when he becomes king. He told delegates of the vigour with which Charles participated in Commonwealth affairs. “We are certain that, when he will be called upon to do so, he will provide solid and passionate leadership for our Commonwealth,” he said The prime minister of Grenada, Keith Mitchell, said he had no difficulty with Charles taking over. “It would be good news, the Queen herself does very well and certainly we have been fortunate to have her stable leadership over this period. But having the Prince of Wales would certainly not be an unhelpful act at this point in time,” he told the BBC’s World at One. Charles later joined the Queen for a lunchtime reception in the palace’s 1844 Room, held for new government leaders including New Zealand’s prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, and the South African president, Cyril Ramaphosa. Welcoming delegates, Theresa May spoke of the shared values of the Commonwealth, the challenges of climate change, the health of the oceans, trade and cyber security. There was no mention of the issue that has dominated headlines since the Commonwealth leaders arrived in the UK – Britain’s treatment of the Windrush generation. During the summit leaders will be urged to follow the UK work in reducing plastic waste in the seas. The UK is due to consult on proposals to ban plastic straws and cotton buds as part of effforts to tackle the pollution issue. May said she would rally member states. “The Commonwealth is a unique organisation with a huge ersity of wildlife, environments and coastlines,” she said.The Queen told delegates: “It remains a great pleasure and honour to serve you as head of the Commonwealth and to observe, with pride and satisfaction, that this is a flourishing network.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eb5168ed88e600d37a65f2186c5f372a3a9ed94e/0_0_2048_1229/master/2048.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=c9f3be56456404b1837f9208a14f4147 1240w","title":"swaziland king renames country kingdom of eswatini","story":"King Mswati III declares name change 50 years after independence from British ruleThe king of Swaziland, Africa’s last absolute monarchy, has announced that his country has changed its name to the Kingdom of eSwatini to mark 50 years since independence from British rule.Meaning “place of the Swazi”, eSwatini is the Swazi language name for the tiny state landlocked between South Africa and Mozambique. Unlike some countries, Swaziland did not change its name when it gained independence in 1968 after being a British protectorate for more than 60 years.King Mswati III declared the name change during independence day celebrations at a packed sports stadium in the second city of Manzini. “I would like to announce that Swaziland will now revert to its original name,” he said, wearing red military uniform. “African countries on getting independence reverted to their ancient names before they were colonised. So from now on, the country will be officially be known as the Kingdom of eSwatini.”The name Swaziland angers some citizens as it is a mix of Swazi and English.The move had been mooted for years, with lawmakers considering the issue in 2015. The king had used the new name in previous official speeches.Mswati, who was crowned in 1986 aged 18, rules by decree. Political parties are banned from taking part in elections and only candidates approved by chiefs loyal to the king can stand for office. The country has a population of about 1.3 million people.The name change could mean the country’s constitution is rewritten, as well as changes for the royal Swaziland police force, the Swaziland defence force and the University of Swaziland.After independence, Rhodesia became Zimbabwe, Nyasaland became Malawi, and Bechuanaland became Botswana."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Court told Vicky Phelan (43) should have \u0026lsquo40 years to look forward to\u0026rsquo but only has months to liveDefendant (49) charged with serial rape and sexual assault in Co Waterford in 1980sNorthern Ireland Ambulance Service says no patients were taken from crash scene\u0026lsquoWe frequently didn\u0026rsquot agree when we worked alongside each other\u0026rsquoCompany says man\u0026rsquos actions mean it cannot access 150 acres purchased in Co WexfordChristy McCann to vacate role pending outcome of inquiry into how rape allegation was handledAisha Chithira travelled from Ireland to England for termination in January 2012People like Chuck Feeney \u0026lsquocome along once in a lifetime, once in a generation\u0026rsquoTUI members in the institutes of technology vote overwhelmingly for industrial actionTomas Gajowniczek \u0026lsquodelusional\u0026rsquo when he attacked Alicja Kalinowska, psychiatrist saysMichelle Walsh sought damages after lacerating head on radiator in Dublin apartmentUgandan lawyer sued Facebook Ireland over allegedly defamatory posts by an anonymous bloggerCourt of Appeal upholds murder conviction of John Joseph MaloneF\u0026oacutersa says issue of public service pensions settled on foot of additional contributionsClare County Council outlay including \u0026euro817.95 each on 22 chairs labelled \u0026lsquoextravagance\u0026rsquoImportant judgment has implications for more than 100 asylum cases raising similar issuesODCE concerned \u0026lsquopotentially unlawful conduct\u0026rsquo has taken place at listed media groupThank you for signing up.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3466275.1524084930!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"eu might integrate more smoothly once permanently reluctant uk leaves","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tWill the EU Survive Brexit?: former European Commission secretary general Catherine Day gave the Barrett Family Lecture at Newman University Church. Photograph: Nick BradshawThe European Union might integrate more smoothly after Brexit, once it no longer has a “permanently reluctant member in the room”, the former European Commission secretary general Catherine Day has said.Speaking at Newman University Church in Dublin, where she gave the Barrett Family Lecture 2018, Ms Day said that she saw “no room to hope” the UK would change its mind about leaving the European Union. But she also said that she saw no “domino effect” and that Europe would continue to enlarge, taking in countries in the Balkans “one or two at a time”.In the absence of the UK, she predicted in Will the EU Survive Brexit?, the “euro and Europe” would become synonymous, with smaller states that had resisted the single currency now being “pushed” into joining it. She also said that security and defence were “an area where Europe would have to step up to the plate”. Although most states would remain in Nato, “economies of scale” in European defence forces could deliver similar “boots and helicopters”.Ms Day told the audience, many of whom were students of the Nanovic Institute for European Studies at the University of Notre Dame, the steward of the church, that Brexit could ultimately be good for relations between Britain and Ireland, as Britain seeks an external relationship with the EU. “It is just that we need a bit more enlightenment in certain parts of London for that to happen.”She said in many ways the EU had not played fair with Turkey, keeping it “dangling” for 40 years. But she added that there were many things to consider, including that Turkey would become the unions’s largest member state on entry and that some countries would raise the issue of Christian and Muslim differences.

Video: Margo O\u0027Donnell\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBig Tom at the funeral of Irish country singer Larry Cunningham in Co. Longford in 2012. Photographer: Dara Mac DónaillTHE IRISH TIMES Nobody could fill a hall at the height of the showband era like the late Big Tom McBride. Long queues would form outside the local ballroom when Big Tom and his band, the Mainliners, came to town. Generally, dancing was 9pm to 1am, with a relief band getting proceedings underway.In the 1960s, as Ireland was slowly changing, the ballrooms replaced as dance venues the parish halls, which had been frequently run by the local parish priest, whose task sometimes was to guard against the perils of close dancing.Not so the ballrooms, where close dancing ceased to be a moral threat.Many of the ballrooms were exotic, by comparison, and they introduced an element of glamour in a grey Ireland. Their opening saw the emergence of the showbands, vocally more sophisticated than the parish hall band, with the singers and musicians sporting bright suits and modern hairstyles. Big Tom and his band, the Mainliners, became the country stars of that new world. When he recorded the sentimental Gentle Mother in 1967, it became an instant hit, reaching the coveted number one spot in RTÉ Radio’s top 10 records.An overnight success, he went on to enjoy a huge following at home and among Irish emigrants.Yet the showband business was run on an informal basis, with mainly cash transactions.In the midlands, a young businessman, Albert Reynolds, later to become Taoiseach, opened a series of ballrooms. He was later spoken of as a good promoter the band was always paid and a hot meal provided before going on stage. In Tralee, Co Kerry, a ballroom attached to the Mount Brandon hotel, opened by then Taoiseach Sean Lemass in the 1960s, was a hugely successful venue for Big Tom. It had a chandelier and a large balcony. Like the other ballrooms, though, it sold nothing stronger than soft drinks.The women queued on one side of the hall and the men on the other. If there was a large crowd, there was a rush to ask a woman to dance. This was the entertainment world dominated by Big Tom, Dickie Rock, Brendan Bowyer, Brendan O’Brien and Philomena Begley in the sixties and seventies.With the exception perhaps of Bowyer, nobody rivalled Big Tom as a crowd-puller. His country audience followed him faithfully, sometimes driving miles to see him play, not least in the summer when the venue could be a marquee in a country village where the local carnival was being held. He understood his audience. He came from Castleblayney, Co Monaghan, and knew rural Ireland. He had spent some time as an emigrant in London. His songs were about love affairs, many of them ending in remorse and melancholy, old Irish ballads, and some modern songs. Despite being the lead singer and playing the guitar in the band, he was intensely uneasy with fame.I interviewed him many years ago when he was playing at the Festival of Kerry at the height of his fame.He was a courteous, diffident, shy man. He told me he found public recognition difficult.He had just turned down his own series on RTÉ television at the time because the station wanted to use professional session musicians rather than his own band members, all of whom hailed from his native Monaghan.“They would be the best in the business,’’ he said. “But they would have no interest in country music.’’Big Tom and his music were lampooned, of course. In an Ireland struggling for sophistication, having watched too much television, Big Tom and his likes were not cool.His country fans dismissed the lampooning, followed him in the dancehalls and bought his records in abundanceIn recent times, he would get due recognition on a country music special on The Late Late Show, presented by Ryan Tubridy, who helped the visibly ailing Big Tom to the microphone to sing his trademark Four Country Roads. Some 400,00 people emigrated from Ireland between 1951 and 1961 alone, most of them poorly educated and ill-prepared. Many headed for British building sites and factories. “They were a silent generation,’’ the novelist John McGahern later wrote,”and they left in silence.’’They followed Big Tom when he came to London to play in the then thriving Irish dancehalls, such as the Galtymore in Cricklewood, the National in Kilburn, and the Gresham in Holloway Road. They played his records at home and sang his songs at Irish emigrant gatherings, the poignancy of his voice in harmony with the bitter-sweet experience of forced emigration.It is very easy today to dismiss all this as crass sentimentality. It would be wrong, because it was no such thing.Big Tom’s songs and music were a lifeline for a dispossessed people, forced out of their own country, which could not even provide them with the basic human right of a job. Many of those songs were melancholic. But our history of forced emigration is laced with melancholy.A good friend, John Mulrooney, from Sligo, was a close friend of Big Tom. Some years ago, we said we would meet up at one of his concerts. We never did.I regret that now.The Ireland which made Big Tom a country star is gone.

The chief scout at Scouting Ireland has stepped aside from his position while an independent inquiry is completed into how senior volunteers at the group handled a rape allegation in 2016. In a statement on Thursday, Christy McCann announced he had informed the organisation’s board that he was “temporarily” standing down.“I believe it is in the best interests of our organisation that I do so in order to give adequate time to bring our investigation to a conclusion” he said. “As chief scout and as a co-respondent in the process currently underway, I believe my standing aside is the right thing to do and will help ensure the current process is allowed to continue without delay and further distraction”, he said. Mr McCann said it was important the organisation “continues to focus on the young people we serve” and that safeguarding remains a “priority.”A barrister-led investigation is looking at the actions of Mr McCann, Scouting Ireland chief commissioners David Shalloo and Thérèse Bermingham, and board member Ollie Kehoe in handling of the rape allegation. A confidential review by child protection expert Ian Elliott, into the treatment of the 2016 complaint, in which a female leader claimed she was raped by a male leader on a camping trip seven years earlier, criticised the actions of the four senior volunteers. The male leader was readmitted to Scouting Ireland after the Director of Public Prosecutions decided not to prosecute. However, garda advice to resubmit the man for garda vetting was not followed. The barrister-led inquiry is expected to be completed next month, at which point the board may consider disciplinary action.Earlier on Thursday, Minister for Children Katherine Zappone told the Dáil: “I have been informed that the chief scout will be stepping aside from this evening pending the completion of the independent investigation.”Ms Zappone is due to meet Scouting Ireland chief executive Dr John Lawlor and Mr McCann on Thursday evening at her department’s offices. Last week Ms Zappone suspended State funding to the organisation, worth nearly €1 million a year, due to governance concerns over the board’s response to Mr Elliott’s report. Publicly funded organisations must be required to meet “strong governance standards,” Ms Zappone told the Dáil.“In view of this I decided to withhold any further drawdown of funding to Scouting Ireland until such time as I can be satisfied that the organisation’s governance standards are up to the required level. As of now I am not satisfied” she said. So far this year the organisation, which has 40,000 juvenile members, has drawn down €438,168 in State funding. “This means that Scouting Ireland is funded up until the end of June,” the Minister said. “It is my sincere hope that Scouting Ireland will utilise this time to engage constructively with myself and my officials, to address all outstanding issues relating to the standards of governance within the organisation.” The Scouting Ireland board held an emergency meeting on Wednesday night which lasted more than four hours. Pressure was put on Mr McCann and other senior volunteers criticised in Mr Elliott’s report to consider their positions, according to sources present. Annette Byrne, Scouting Ireland’s national treasurer, is expected to take over as chair of the organisation’s board, Ms Zappone informed the Dáil. The Minister said she would decide the “next steps” in relation to the organisation’s funding following her meeting with the group on Thursday evening.Ms Zappone was speaking after Fianna Fáil TD Anne Rabbitte and Labour TD Seán Sherlock raised the issue of Scouting Ireland’s suspended funding. Since details of Mr Elliott’s report were first published in The Irish Times, Ms Zappone said she has “received other confidential correspondence about additional matters of grave and serious concern” in relation to Scouting Ireland. Last Saturday the organisation’s national council re-elected Mr McCann to the role of chief scout for a second three-year term.In March, an internal crisis management group, set up in response to the Elliott report, recommended that Mr McCann, Mr Shalloo, and Ms Bermingham should step aside, but none did so at the time. Several local scout groups - including St Patrick’s in Dundalk and 34th Tipperary troop - have called for all senior volunteers criticised in Mr Elliott’s report to step aside, until the independent investigation is completed. Representatives from Scouting Ireland are due to appear before the Oireachtas committee on children and youth affairs on Wednesday, to answer questions over governance and safeguarding standards.Thank you for signing up.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3466934.1524132395!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"taoiseach raises prospect of republic day to mark birth of irish republic","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach Leo Varadkar during an event in the National Gallery, Dublin this month. File photograph: CollinsTaoiseach Leo Varadkar has suggested the Decade of Centenaries should end in 2024 with events to mark the 75th anniversary of the Republic of Ireland.The State became the Republic of Ireland on April 18th, 1949. Prior to that the British monarch still signed letters of credence accrediting Irish ambassadors and Britain signed international treaties on Ireland’s behalf.The Republic of Ireland Act abolished the last vestiges of British rule in Ireland and established the State as a republic.Speaking at an event to mark the 69th anniversary on Wednesday night, Mr Varadkar said both the 70th anniversary next year and the 75th anniversary in 2024 should be marked as State occasions.He raised the possibility of a “Republic Day” every year, but he said it would need to be low key except on significant anniversaries as St Patrick’s Day and Easter Monday occur around the same time.Mr Varadkar suggested that the Decade of Centenaries which is due to end in 2023 would end with a “downbeat note” if it ended with commemorations to mark the Civil War.Instead, he proposed that marking the 75th anniversary of the Republic in 2024 would end it on an “upbeat and optimistic note”.He said he would raise the issue with the expert advisory group on the commemorations chaired by Dr Maurice Manning.Members of the Fine Gael party gathered at O’Connell House in Merrion Square, Dublin to mark the 69th anniversary and discuss ways to mark the forthcoming anniversaries of the Republic.Mr Varadkar told them that any celebrations to mark anniversaries relating to Ireland as a republic should not be Fine Gael-led events, but non-party political as the commemorations to mark the Easter Rising had been.He also stated that Fine Gael did not celebrate its own “really proud history”.He said Fine Gael had twice in his lifetime “rescued and rebuilt an economy that had been laid waste by others”.There had been five previous declarations of a republic in Irish history, but only one which was recognised by international governments – the one declared in 1949 by the Fine Gael Taoiseach John Costello, he said.Copies of The Irish Times from the day after the declaration of the Republic were circulated among members of the party. The paper recorded that there was widespread jubilation in the street after the State became the Republic of Ireland at midnight on April 18th, 1949.The Taoiseach added: “I believe we could organise a similar spectacular for midnight, the 18th of April 2024, and have music, entertainment and a light display for people of Ireland. And why limit it to only Dublin?“I believe we should have similar events in Cork, in Galway, and Limerick and Waterford, and events throughout the country if towns were interested in taking part.”Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney said any celebration of a Republic had to consider the context of Northern Ireland.“The declaration of a republic means different things to different people. If we are going to have a national celebration of that, which we should have, we should consult quite widely.”Junior minister Patrick O’Donovan said a celebration of the Irish republic would “taken back what it means to be republican”. He said the established parties had surrendered the term republican to “ a very narrow set of people who do nothing to embrace the values of a republic, but instead seek to ide”.Fine Gael executive council chair Gerry O’Connell said there ought to be a “Republic Day” every year.He said Costello’s declaration of a Republic ended all ambiguity about the nature of the Irish State.He suggested the declaration of a republic in 1949 vindicated Michael Collins’s stance on the treaty that it gave Ireland “the freedom to achieve freedom”.The contention from Fianna Fáil that Fine Gael was somehow less Irish than they were could never be thrown at the party again, he added.Thank you for signing up.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3467379.1524153792!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"mary lou mcdonald won t run away with herself on sf poll bounce","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald: “I saw it on the front of The Irish Times, of course if there are polls you want to see you have gone up rather than gone down.”  File photograph: Stephen CollinsCollins PhotosSinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald has insisted she will not get carried away with the party’s bounce in the latest Irish TimesIpsos MRBI poll.

Photograph: Simon DawsonEPASenior Indian leaders from prime minister Narendra Modi’s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) claim that the internet was in use during prehistoric times of the Mahabhharta, the legendary Sanskrit war epic in which good defeats evil. “Internet and satellite communication had existed in the days of Mahabharata,” Biplab Kumar Deb, chief minister of India’s northeastern Tripura state and a BJP politician, said on Wednesday at a regional workshop on computerisation. He said in the West many claimed the internet was their invention, but it was actually ancient Indian technology. “My country had the technology years ago, which no country had. I am proud of that, and I think every Indian should feel proud. I want to repeat that we should accept the truth, and should not get confused.” The BJP-appointed state governor of Tripura, Tathgata Roy, endorsed Mr Deb’s claim on Thursday, saying his views were accurate and “topical”. This is not the first time that BJP leaders have made tall claims with regard to science and technology. In January, Satyapal Singh, federal minister for higher education, was criticised by scientists for demanding that Charles Darwin’s Theory of Evolution be removed from school curriculums because no one “ever saw an ape turning into a human being”.He said no books people had read or tales told to them by their grandparents had mentioned such a thing. Mr Singh, who holds a postgraduate degree in chemistry, said he was speaking as a “man of science”.In 2014, Mr Modi, the prime minister, told an audience of doctors and scientists in Mumbai that plastic surgery, genetic science and stem-cell study existed thousands of years ago in ancient India. He said that was how the Hindu god Ganesha’s elephant head was attached to a human body, and how the warrior god Kartikeya was born outside his mother’s womb. Since the BJP came to power four years ago other party supporters and members have claimed that motorcars, aircraft and space vehicles capable of inter-planetary travel existed millennia ago. Warring kings even left behind a helmet on Mars, which was discovered by Nasa scientists, it had been claimed. The head of the Indian Council for Historical Research, Y S Rao, who was appointed to that post by the BJP government in July 2014, has stated that fables from the Mahabharata and the Ramayana, the other major Hindu epic, were truthful historical accounts and did not merit questioning.Thank you for signing up.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":null,"title":"there s a hole and someone went out southwest pilot tells air traffic control","story":"  April 18, 2018Plane violently depressurized after fragments from the explosion burst through window   April 19, 2018With horrifying suddenness, an engine exploded and a passenger was partly sucked through a broken window Invalid email or password."},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/04/12/TELEMMGLPICT000002395664_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq6L3Bx11x18zbsv4k04trOP3QFo7fDZgyggOOCRYToPs.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"cant think rationallywithout emotions feature not bug","story":"Future AIs might be susceptible to something like depressionDoes intelligence have to be conscious?

However Brits are very conservative in their palates so they would take some convincing!Brits could soon be eating jellyfish and chips \u0026quotIn other counties people are more adventurous and happily eat jellyfish. Jellyfish populations are very boom and bust so no-one in the UK has worked out how to harvest them for food yet, but it could be done. There are already two companies in South Wales who are harvesting barrel jellyfish to extract collagen from them.\u0026quot  Jellyfish are known to increase in number in areas of the ocean in which other species are dwindling, and are one of the few marine species to be increasing in number. Not all of them are edible. Last month researchers from the University of Southern Denmark said they had developed a way to create jellyfish chips with a crispy texture. While jellyfish have been a staple in Asian cuisine for centuries, they remain an oddity to the western palate.To prepare jellyfish, traditionally the bell or body of the creature is marinated in salt and potassium alum for several weeks to produce a crunchy texture. But the Danish researchers\u0027 technique produces the same results in just a few days.Dr Mathias P. Clausen, who led the study, said \u0026quotUsing ethanol, we have created jellyfish chips that have a crispy texture and could be of potential gastronomic interest.\u0026quotThe researchers also looked at how the long fibrous filaments in the gelatinous jellyfish bell are transformed during the curing process to produce the crunchy texture. Common British flowers can stay dormant underground for 20 yearsScientists confirm \u0026#39mad cow disease\u0026#39 in camels sparking fears it could be passed to humansNicola Sturgeon: SNP held talks with Cambridge Analytica before 2016 Holyrood electionNHS surgeon accused of racism and \u0026#39forced out of job\u0026#39 after raising concerns about three Asian colleaguesRuth Davidson named in Time\u0026#39s 100 most influential people of 2018Comment: The Commonwealth nations need to act together as a united lobby for free tradeRoyal wedding procession route 2018 - map and timetable to help you follow the special dayNicola Sturgeon refuses to sack Health Minister over \u0026#39failure to take NHS Tayside warnings seriously\u0026#39£350m superyacht given to ex-wife of Putin-linked billionaire in Britain\u0026#39s biggest orce case The \u0026#39true\u0026#39 horror of Heol Fanog: what really happened at the Welsh Amityville?US air force members punished over viral video of dinosaur puppet military ceremonyGreek court rules migrants must no longer be detained on Aegean islands in \u0026#39big worry\u0026#39 for EUDon\u0026#39t take it easy after a heart attack - exercise halves risk of early deathComment: ‘Thank you, comrades!’ How John McDonnell is trying to befriend the bankersEarth Day 2018: The shocking facts about the scale of plastic pollution choking our seas Girl killed herself weeks after police released stepfather accused of sexual abuse on bail, court hearsMeet Miguel Diaz-Canel, the first man to lead Cuba after the CastrosMiguel Díaz-Canel confirmed as Cuba\u0026#39s new presidentItaly closes net on mafia godfather in Sicily with dawn raids and arrestsWe rely on advertising to help fund our award-winning journalism.We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The Telegraph website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Thank you for your support.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/04/19/TELEMMGLPICT000160853239_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"commonwealth nations need act together united lobby free trade","story":"Coldstream Guards carry flags of the 53 Commonwealth nationsWorking in concert, the Commonwealth could unlock the global economy As the heads of government of the 53 Commonwealth countries gather in London this week, they converge at a time of great uncertainty in the world.The global economy is facing a systemic pattern of low economic growth, brought on by a dramatic increase in regulatory protection and uncontrolled market distortions since 2005.The international trading system has been stalled, with 23 years and counting since the conclusion of the last multilateral negotiating round – over a third of the lifetime of the entire post-war economic order established in 1947.Continued economic growth has relied on the successive negotiation of further...To continue reading this articleStart your free trial of PremiumAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekAccess one Premium article per weekRegister for freeTo continue reading this article log in to your Telegraph account.

or in 1952, when I became Head of the Commonwealth - would have guessed that a gathering of its member states would one day number 53, or that it would comprise 2.4 billion people?Members of the Royal Family watch the ceremony\u0026quotPut simply, we are one of the world\u0027s great convening powers: a global association of volunteers who believe in the tangible benefits that flow from exchanging ideas and experiences and respecting each other\u0027s point of view.\u0026quotAnd we seem to be growing stronger year by year. The advantages are plain to see.\u0026quotThe CHOGM opening ceremony saw leaders move to pay tribute to the Queen’s service to the Commonwealth in a ceremony attended by 46 Commonwealth heads of government and seven foreign ministers representing their countries to make up 53 member states.The Queen delivers her speechDr Joseph Muscat, Prime Minister of Malta and outgoing chair-in-office of the Commonwealth, said: \u0026quotWhen your father, His Majesty King George, started what he started, you have not only continued, but also elevated to unprecedented levels.\u0026quotWe are equally elated by the vigour with which His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales actively participates in Commonwealth affairs, and puts a strong Commonwealth dimension in his various national and global initiatives.\u0026quotWe are certain that when he will be called upon to do so, he will provide solid and passionate leadership for our Commonwealth.\u0026quotA Guard of Honour for CHOGMTheresa May, the Prime Minister, received prolonged applause after addressing the Queen directly, saying: “This week you have opened your homes to us – here in London and in Windsor. Over many years you have been the Commonwealth’s most steadfast and fervent champion.“You have been true to the deepest values of the Commonwealth – that the voice of the smallest member country is worth precisely as much as that of the largest that the wealthiest and the most vulnerable stand shoulder to shoulder.“You have seen us through some of our most serious challenges. And we commit to sustaining this Commonwealth, which you have so carefully nurtured.Soldiers of the Coldstream Guards carry flags of the 53 Commonwealth countries at Buckingham Palace “For your service, for your dedication, for your constancy – we thank you.”The Prince of Wales, who walked into the ballroom at the side of the Queen and made the first address, said: “For my part, the Commonwealth has been a fundamental feature of my life for as long as I can remember, beginning with my first visit to Malta when I was just five years old.“And so, Ladies and Gentlemen, I pray that this Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting will not only revitalize the bonds between our countries, but will also give the Commonwealth a renewed relevance to all citizens, finding practical solutions to their problems and giving life to their aspirations.Theresa May delivers her speech at Buckingham Palace“By doing so, the Commonwealth can be a cornerstone for the lives of future generations, just as it has been for so many of us.” He raised a smile from Canadian leader Justin Trudeau, as he name-checked his father Pierre during a list of “giants of the Commonwealth” he has been “fortunate” enough to meet.The ceremony, hosted by broadcaster Reeta Chakrabarti, also saw guests treated to musical performances, with the Queen looking on intently.Emeli Sande gave a rendition of the national anthem, before a group of six “Commonwealth Voices” performed a version of Unwritten, a pop song now considered by organisers to be a “youth anthem”.The Queen and Prince of Wales arrive at the opening of CHOGM togetherYoung musicians played Shepherd’s Hey, a folk song, and two winners of the Queen’s Young Leaders programme, Devika Malik and Philip Cole, told their stories.While the Queen took her seat on stage with the heads of government and Secretary-General Baroness Scotland, the Prince of Wales watched with senior members of the Royal from a small audience.The formal opening of the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in the ballroom at Buckingham PalaceHe was joined by his wife, the Duchess of Cornwall, and sons the Duke of Cambridge and Prince Harry.

It bases this scenario on the Prime Minister’s recent Mansion House speech which outlined the Brexit she hopes to deliver.This would mean leaving the single market and customs union whilst maintaining access to EU markets with minimal tariff and non-tariff barriers. It would also include the flexibility to erge from Brussels regulations, negotiate trading relationships with other non-EU countries and implement restrictions on immigration.The research estimates that this outcome would leave the country better off than a no-deal Brexit but worse off than under the “Norway model” or under an average free-trade agreement such as the one Canada has with the EU.The Norway model, in which the UK would stay in the single market and adhere to EU rules and regulations but leave the customs union, would have a negative fiscal impact of £262m per week while the Canada option would cost around £877m per week, Mr Portes finds. The figures are the equivalent of  9 per cent and 31 per cent of the current NHS budget respectively. A no-deal Brexit in which the UK trades with the EU under World Trade Organisation terms is estimated to cost £1.25bn per week. No scenario is more beneficial than staying in the EU.The analysis takes into account the benefits from lower financial contributions to the EU budget and a new trade deal with the US as well as costs arising from new customs controls, tariffs, and reduced migration. A survey conducted as part of the research found that 72 per cent of Leave voters thought that £615m a week would be too high a price to pay for a bespoke Brexit deal, while 78 per cent said it was worse than they had hoped for when they cast their vote in June 2016.Among all EU referendum voters polled, just 23 per cent said they thought the estimated cost would be worth paying.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

But with economic growth expected to come in weaker in Q1 owing to the snowy weather, and the need for further evidence of rising wage pressures, it will be a less clear-cut affair than anticipated,” said Tej Parikh of the Institute of Directors.Earlier this week sterling had risen to its highest level against the dollar since the Brexit vote - $1.4335 – as expectations grew of a May rate rise by the Bank of England.Sterling suffered a record intra-day plunge against the dollar of more than 11 per cent on the night of the June 2016 referendum, falling to $1.32.In January 2017 it hit a low of $1.21, before recovering over the course of the year.Despite the pound’s gradual clawing back of post-referendum losses against the dollar, the trade-weighted value of sterling – which values the UK currency against a basket of the currencies of our major trading partners – still stands 10 per cent down on its level before the Brexit vote.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Job prospects and and a disillusionment with politics are among the issues still pushing many millennials, like generations before them, to move away. Except now, things are supposed to be different. Brexit has the potential to undermine the Good Friday AgreementTwenty years ago, on 10 April 1998, peace came to Northern Ireland. After 30 years of brutal sectarian conflict, in which more than 3,600 people were killed, political groups agreed to reject violence and work together to solve problems democratically. It was called the Good Friday Agreement. A devolved assembly would be established for both sides to govern together and while unionists were assured of their British identity, a united Ireland was acknowledged as a legitimate political goal for republicans. Some 71 per cent of people in Northern Ireland voted to accept the agreement in a referendum, with the DUP being the only party to reject it. David Trimble and John Hume were pictured on stage with Bono after brokering the Good Friday Agreement (AFPGetty)The years that followed saw continued political instability and fringe paramilitary activity but largely, the deal held. By 2003, voting patterns in Northern Ireland shifted considerably. While Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader David Trimble and Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) leader John Hume had been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for their efforts in 1998, their parties were gradually sidelined.Instead, the electorate moved towards more hardline options. The DUP, led by the formidable Rev Ian Paisley, with their staunch Presbyterian values, and unwavering loyalty to Britain overtook the UUP and Sinn Fein, the unapologetically republican party with former IRA prisoners among its ranks, effectively replaced the SDLP.And yet, they managed the unthinkable. In 2008, Ian Paisley and Martin McGuinness led the two parties into power sharing for the first time, and were seen not just working together, but laughing together.But while violence faded from the streets, a cultural battleground began to open up politically – not just over the very narrative of the Troubles, but over parading, flags and language, with the DUP fighting for a retention of all things British, while Sinn Fein vouched for Irish culture to be given the equal weighting it was promised in the agreement. Naomi Long is the leader of Alliance, a small, centre ground party with members from both communities. She says even at the height of the conflict, politics was not as starkly ided as it is now.“I think there has been a reliance on the use of the politics of fear, and using that as a rather lazy means to garner votes in elections,” she explains. “The big political parties essentially ask people to vote for them to keep other people out, rather than as a positive expression of what their ambitions and aspirations for the future might be.”Power sharing has now been suspended at Stormont in Belfast since January 2017 (Getty)But whether the parties are setting the agenda from their offices at Stormont, or whether they are merely responding to the wishes of the people on the street, both the DUP and Sinn Fein are totally in step with their ever hardening bases.One of the best litmus tests is The Nolan Show, “the biggest show in the country” broadcast every morning on BBC Radio Ulster. The impassioned, angry, and often downright bigoted views expressed by callers have made the very name of the show synonymous with sounding off. A recent standoff heard a unionist man refuse to call Sinn Fein’s Mairtín O Muilleoir by his Irish name, because a previous republican caller refused to even call the country “Northern Ireland”. As they argued among themselves, Stephen Nolan spoke for many listeners when he muttered, “This is pathetic.”The DUP have found themselves on the unfashionable side of social issues that Sinn Fein have championed, including LGBT rights (PA)It would be pessimistic to suggest that the show’s more colourful callers are representative of Northern Ireland as a whole, but it would be a blatant dismissal of the region’s political stalemate to suggest it is not. Just as the callers cannot agree, increasingly, Sinn Fein and the DUP can’t either.On 9 January last year, Martin McGuinness resigned his position as deputy first minister over a political scandal that implicated DUP leader Arlene Foster – although she denies any wrongdoing. Declaring it “the right time to call a halt to the DUP’s arrogance”, Northern Ireland’s mandatory power sharing coalition meant his resignation also removed Foster from her position as first minister, collapsing the assembly.His statement, an astonishing swansong delivered two months before his death, also laid out a litany of claims against the DUP. After 10 years of working together, McGuinness concluded that, “the equality, mutual respect and all-Ireland approaches enshrined in the Good Friday Agreement have never been fully embraced by the DUP.”Martin McGuinness resigned in protest against the handling of a botched energy scheme (Getty)This brought everything crashing down, and in the election which followed, both the DUP and Sinn Fein increased their popular vote, but one side had clearly benefited. Unionism lost its overall majority for the first time ever, and Sinn Fein were suddenly just a hair’s breadth behind their rivals.To their detriment, the DUP have also found themselves on the unfashionable side of social issues that Sinn Fein have championed, including LGBT rights and abortion reform. The general election of June 2017 brought this to the attention of the British mainstream after their confidence and supply agreement with Theresa May’s Conservatives. Talks to restore power sharing remain unresolved, with Sinn Fein requests for parity with the rest of the UK on language rights and marriage equality being rejected by the DUP. Arlene Foster has been criticised for saying she would leave the country in the event of a united Ireland (Getty)Michelle Gildernew was part of the first Sinn Fein delegation ever received at Downing Street by Tony Blair in 1997 and is now a Westminster MP. She doesn’t feel her party is asking for anything more than what people are entitled to.“We’re looking at rights that people have across these islands,” she says, “whether that’s legacy rights, rights for LGBT citizens, for Irish, Scots, Welsh language speakers. There are rights for people everywhere across these islands, except for the six counties. I think that is a completely unacceptable situation. I’m raising three children here and I want them to have the same rights as their friends and neighbours, wherever they are.”Talk to the average person on the street in Northern Ireland and they’ll criticise politicians, for putting cultural issues and minority rights ahead of health, housing and education – budgets for which have all been squeezed during the impasse. But every election returns the same reality. People vote in huge numbers for the DUP and Sinn Fein to hold their corners.Former Irish taoiseach Bertie Ahern signed the Good Friday Agreement alongside Tony Blair, and maintains that bigger hurdles were overcome then. The restoration of power sharing, as ingrained in the Good Friday Agreement signed by Tony Blair and Bertie Ahern, is vital (PA)“I think everybody has to compromise,” he tells me. “If you cast your mind back 20 years ago we were dealing with the big issues of prisoners’ release, decommissioning, a new criminal justice system – they were major issues. Now I don’t want to trivialise the issues now and say they’re minor, but they’re certainly not at the magnitude of what we had to crack in 1998.”The fundamental problem is that while the war is over, unionists and republicans remain locked in a psychological battle for the very soul of Northern Ireland. Is its future still within the United Kingdom, or are we moving towards a united Ireland? While the Good Friday Agreement acknowledged that Northern Ireland would remain a part of the UK, it was also agreed that when a majority of people in the north and the south of Ireland wanted to reunify, a referendum could be held, and the result would be honoured. Republicans saw this as a starting gun for their goal of reunification, and while this angered some unionists, most seemed confident it wasn’t of immediate concern – something leaders within the DUP and the UUP have felt the need to reiterate in recent weeks, with diminishing certainty.Murals in Belfast serve as a reminder of Northern Ireland’s violent past (Getty)For most of the past two decades, the public discourse has maintained that republicans cannot hope to win over a majority for a united Ireland because most centre ground voters are too well off in the UK – including many nationalists who are quietly accepting of the situation. But now that seems about to change.If Brexit stunned the country, it shook Northern Ireland to its core, where 56 per cent of people voted to remain. The European Union served not just as a guarantor for the Good Friday Agreement, but accommodated a kind of harmonisation across Ireland that contented many nationalists. An invisible border allows people to move, live and work across the island, as if it were indeed united.Gildernew’s Fermanagh and South Tyrone constituency shares a great length of that border with four counties of the Irish Republic.“I cross it probably every day,” she says. “People cross it for work, for business, for school, for caring responsibilities, to visit family, even just to walk the dog. We’ve spent decades trying to remove the border, not just the physical infrastructure, but in people’s hearts and minds, and any changes to that will be resisted by the communities on either side of it.”The invisible border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland allows people to move, live and work across the island, as if it were indeed united (Getty)Indeed, the prospect of a border returning has also mobilised politicians in the south to take a stand, with taoiseach Leo Varadkar claiming that “no Irish government will ever again leave Northern nationalists and Northern Ireland behind”.It’s increasingly clear that by campaigning for a patriotic cause they probably never believed would have consequences, the DUP shot unionism in the foot. Suddenly, Sinn Fein were handed a card to play which made a united Ireland a plausible, realistic and economically sensible option. It would be lazy to assume that the 56 per cent who voted remain would automatically want to remain within the EU by means of a united Ireland, but it has certainly made the option much more appealing. In the past two weeks, Sinn Fein vice president Michelle O’Neill has called for a unity referendum to be held within five years, while Arlene Foster was criticised after saying she would leave the country in the event of a united Ireland. The DUP were asked to provide comment for this feature, but neglected to put anyone forward.Alex Kane is a former communications director for the UUP and believes there are strong arguments to be made for staying within the UK.“Even if there was a referendum, I’m not convinced unionism would lose it at this point,” he says. “But I think there are more challenges for unionists now than there have been in my lifetime. I think it’s an existential challenge for unionism.”Michelle O’Neill (left) wants a unity referendum to be held within five years (Getty)Kevin Meagher is the author of A United Ireland: Why Unification Is Inevitable and How It Will Come About. He believes it could happen by 2022, as a result of a demographic shift in nationalism’s favour, and quite possibly, Jeremy Corbyn in 10 Downing Street. He warns that the vote could be won despite the apparent polarisation of Northern Irish politics.“An agreed Ireland is not a precondition for a united Ireland,” he stresses, “and what I’ve been saying to British politicians is if you think you can kick the can down the road until everybody gets on and everything is forgotten, you’re not going to have that option. The reality is, by 2022 you could have an electoral majority who want a united Ireland, and you’re going to have to facilitate that.”The ultimate irony is that by so flagrantly risking the interests of Northern Ireland to carry out the will of Little Englanders, the Conservatives have put Irish reunification further up the agenda than Sinn Fein ever could have done alone. Unionists may see this as their worst nightmare, but Meagher – a former special adviser in the Northern Ireland Office – believes it wouldn’t bother the British government much at all.“If presented with a way out that was reasonable and effective for British ministers of either party, frankly they would have had to take an option of Irish unity 20, 30, 40 years ago. It’s been looming in British politics that this is the direction of travel.”Theresa May is promising no return to a hard border in Ireland (Getty)As government predictions show the GDP of Northern Ireland would be reduced by 12 per cent under a no deal Brexit, economic safety within the UK is no longer a certainty. The Irish economy, on the other hand, is growing three times faster than any other European country. The question now shifts from whether people want to risk their livelihood by joining a united Ireland, to whether people can actually afford to stay in the UK.As it currently stands, Theresa May is promising no return to a hard border in Ireland, which is pleasing nationalists, republicans, the Irish government and the EU. She is also promising no border down the Irish Sea, to keep the DUP happy. And yet, she is carrying out the will of a British majority, whose primary concern in voting for Brexit was immigration Loughs, Brexit and fishermen in Northern IrelandLoughs, Brexit and fishermen in Northern IrelandEnda Craig, a member of the Loughs Agency Advisory Forum, holds a map of Lough Foyle in Moville, IrelandOyster farmer William Lynch puts on his wellington boots on his oyster farm on Lough Foyle in Culmore, Northern IrelandWomen walk along the shores of Carlingford Lough with Northern Ireland seen across the lough in CarlingfordA poster hanging on a wall of a house reads: No to the ferry, referring to a proposed new car ferry that would run from Northern Ireland to the Republic of Ireland through Carlingford Lough in GreencastleSkipper Shay Fitzpatrick (L) and boat owner Brian Cunningham navigate out of Warrenpoint harbour into Carlingford Lough in Warrenpoint, Northern IrelandA woman with flowers walks past an old fuel station in Carlingford, IrelandA boat is seen at sunset on Carlingford Lough in Greenore, IrelandA mandries off after swimming in Carlingford Lough in Omeath, IrelandA derelict house is seen on the shore of Carlingford Lough in Omeath, IrelandSkipper Shay Fitzpatrick dredges mussels from Carlingford Lough in Warrenpoint, Northern IrelandBagged-up farmed oysters at a cleaning facility to get them ready for overseas shipping in Moville, IrelandA man walks his dog in matching hi-vis outfits on Carlingford Lough in Greenore, IrelandCarlingford Lough and in the distance Northern Ireland are seen at sunset from Omeath, IrelandA sign that reads: \u0027In 1771 nothing happened here\u0027 is seen on the shores of Carlingford Lough in Carlingford, Ireland. Will they really stand for the kind of soft or non-existent border the prime minister is promising Ireland? Someone, somewhere down the line, is going to be betrayed.Deputy leader of the SDLP Nichola Mallon says it’s now time for May to deliver solutions of substance, not just empty rhetoric.“This for us is not an orange and green issue, it’s not about the constitutional question on the island, this is about ensuring we have the best deal for people across the island, and we believe this is best served by Northern Ireland remaining in the customs union and the single market,” she says.The prospect of a hard border returning has mobilised politicians in the south to take a stand (AFPGetty)So Northern Ireland is waiting for a solution on the border, but also for a political landscape that works for everybody. Surely, after two decades, that isn’t too much to ask?“I thought within 20 years, something is bound to be different other than the fact we’re not shooting each other,” Alex Kane says, “and that’s good, but it’s not enough. Not killing each other is normal, but also normal is parties making decisions, going into government together, having choices. We don’t seem any closer to that.”I\u0027m ashamed of the state of the world, says PopeClinton says Good Friday Agreement anniversary is an chance for peaceThreat of \u0027serious trouble\u0027 in Northern IrelandBut the restoration of power sharing, as ingrained in the Good Friday Agreement, is a must. It may require unpalatable concessions from both sides, but a Stormont assembly is essential, whether you want to remain in a UK of devolved governments, or – as Bertie Ahern points out – if you are aiming for that referendum on Irish unity.“You have to have stable institutions and sustainable development going forward before you do that,” he believes. “The clause to have referendums is part of the Good Friday Agreement, so it doesn’t seem logical in my view to be talking about a referendum when you don’t even have the agreement fully in place.”The evidence suggests that the winds of change are blowing in favour of Northern Ireland’s nationalists, but the hard work of honouring the Good Friday Agreement is crucial to achieving a new Ireland of equals for all.Email cannot be used.

The UK is also a top destination for wealthy Russians to spend their money on art collections, expensive cars and private schools for their children. In return, the UK often grants them visas and, in some cases, citizenship“We are going after the money,” Boris Johnson promised after being questioned on the absence of specific measures to impose sanctions and financial penalties on the UK assets of Russian oligarchs closely aligned to President Putin. But when pressed by MPs on why decisive action was not being taken, the foreign secretary replied: “This is not a country where we in the government can say ‘Oi! We think this so-and-so deserves to have his or her collar felt’. This is not how it works.” While Theresa May may yet impose sanctions against Putin-supporting billionaires in response to the attempted murder of the Russian spy Sergei Skripal, her government’s track record has been marred by procrastination and prevarication.   Privately, the prime minister regards the exploitation of London as a haven for dirty Russian money as a serious problem. She once listened in stunned silence as a senior MI6 officer briefed her on the activities of Russian organised crime and certain oligarchs in the UK. And in 2016 she authorised the National Security Council to review why and how wealthy Russians buy property in London. But she has been nervous about taking action. For the past three years she has dithered on implementing a legally-enforceable register that will force all foreign companies that own UK property to disclose the identity of their owners.Russia claims Skripals poisoned using toxin possessed by UK and USRussia has been spying on the Skripals for at least five years- UKRussia stock market crashes after US imposes sanctions on oligarchsFreezing property assets is the key to inflicting pain on the Russian state and its compliant plutocrats. Since 2004, £190m of UK property has been subject to criminal investigation as suspected proceeds of corruption. The London property market has been skewed by laundered money, as The Independent revealed exclusively in 2014. Prices are being artificially driven up by wealthy, influential, foreign men who want to hide their assets in the UK.Multi-million pound payments are accepted without their origin being questioned. Oligarchs hide ownership behind anonymous shell companies registered in secretive jurisdictions while a London address offers a veneer of legitimacy and prestige that helps launder reputations as well as cash. Transparency International estimates that Russians account for £729m of the £4.4bn acquired in UK property via what it regards as “suspicious wealth”.There is no suggestion that all London property bought by Russian oligarchs is derived from illegal or criminal sources. For some Russian plutocrats buying luxury property in London is a symbol that they have been accepted by the British establishment. This is illustrated by the eleven bedroom Regency house on Belgrave Square that Oleg Deripaska, regarded as one of Putin’s favourite oligarchs, snapped up for £17m through an offshore company registered in the British Virgin Islands in 2003 and now worth £45m.Oleg Deripaska’s 11-bedroom Regency house on Belgrave Square is seen as a symbol of acceptance by the British establishment (Alamy)Built in the 1820s, it was formerly the home of Sir Henry “Chips” Channon, society host, Conservative MP and notoriously indiscreet diarist. It was designed for entertaining royalty and diplomats with its grand staircase, Madame Récamier sofas and flamboyant decor. When Harold Nicolson arrived at the house for dinner, he exclaimed: “Oh my God, how rich and powerful Lord Channon has become.” The equally grand and historic mansion Beechwood House, set in 11 acres of land in Highgate, north London, was bought by the powerful oligarch Alisher Usmanov in 2008 for £48m from the Emir of Qatar. Usmanov is a major shareholder in Arsenal football club and has amassed a £14bn fortune from metals and commodities and has long been regarded as a pro-Putin figure. And his fellow football-loving oligarch Roman Abramovich owns houses on Kensington Palace Gardens and Chester Square, Belgravia, and apartments on Eaton Square and Manresa Road, Chelsea.  One Hyde Park, one of the wealthiest residencies in the world, was famously bought up by Russian oligarchs (Alamy)It is not just prestigious houses that attract Russian billionaires. The UK is also a top destination for wealthy Russians to spend their money on art collections, expensive cars and private schools for their children. In return for their cash, the UK often grants them visas and, in some cases, citizenship.  Since 2008 iniduals have been able to obtain “golden visas” if they invest as little as £2m in a UK business. And for £5m, they gain the right to become a UK resident on a temporary basis and then, after five years, a British citizen. By 2014, almost 700 rich Russians had paid for entry using this method, with Roman Rotenberg, son of Putin’s former judo partner Boris Rotenberg, being the most prominent example. He owns a mews house on Cadogan Lane in Belgravia.The government is taking some action to stop London becoming what David Cameron described as a haven to hide “dodgy foreign cash”. The National Crime Agency (NCA) is investigating a list of wealthy iniduals, not just oligarchs, to assess if they have used the UK to launder their fortunes.An estimated 149 iniduals are restricted on their travel and ability to conduct business in the UK. And the Unexplained Wealth Orders is now law, whereby the NCA can demand that the oligarch explain the origin of his wealth. But the problem with this order, according to a Russian businessman, is that the inidual in question could too easily lie about his source of wealth and instead produce a document that shows his fortune was based on, for example, share idends. Roman Rotenberg gained entry to the UK using the ‘golden visas’ method (Getty)Boris Johnson protests that the government cannot act directly against the pro-Putin brigade because it cannot interfere in criminal investigations. But it could make specific changes to the law, notably an amendment to the Sanctions and Money Laundering Bill, which would give Magnitsky-type powers to freeze the UK assets of relevant iniduals, including intelligence agents or other officials who have abused human rights.  The government could also implement the register of inidual owners of foreign and offshore companies that own UK property. But that bill has been delayed until 2021 and campaigners smell a cover-up after the government announced that one reason for the delay is that the Business Department has commissioned research on the impact of the register on investment decisions. “This is a crucial moment for the UK’s future trading relationship with the rest of the world, and we must proceed with as good an understanding as possible of the potential impacts on legitimate inward investment,” said foreign office minister Lord Ahmad. Skripal attack aftermath – in picturesSkripal attack aftermath – in picturesInvestigators in protective clothing remove a van from an address in Winterslow near Salisbury in Wiltshire, as police and members of the armed forces continue to investigate the suspected nerve agent attack on Russian double agent Sergei SkripaA police officer on duty near the protective tent which covers the bench where a man and woman were apparently poisoned with what was later identified as a nerve agent, in SalisburyMilitary in protective clothing prior to removing vehicles from a car park in SalisburyPersonnel in protective coveralls and breathing equipment cover an ambulance with a tarpaulin at the Salisbury District HospitalHome Secretary Amber Rudd visits the scene of the nerve agent attack in SalibsuryMembers of the emergency services in hazard suits fix the tent over the bench where Sergei and Yulia Skripal were foundOfficials in protective suits check their equipment before repositioning a forensics tent A poice officer stands guard outside a branch of the Italian chain restaurant ZizziDetective Sergeant Nick Bailey, who assisted the Russian ex-spy targeted with a nerve agent, was also hospitalisedSergei Skripal days before he was exposed to a mystery substance that has left him fighting for lifeSergei Skripal speaks to his lawyer from behind bars seen on a screen of a monitor outside a courtroom in Moscow.Yulia Skripal, who is thought to have been poisoned along with her father, Sergei SkripalProgress to legislation has thus been painfully slow. An insight into why political rhetoric has not resulted in legislative action can be gleaned by the recent flotation on the London stock exchange of the Russian energy company En+, then owned by Deripaska and chaired by former Conservative energy minister Lord Barker. For it revealed a fundamental dispute between MI6 and the financial regulators on how to make oligarchs who park their assets in London more accountable and transparent.MI6 and the prime minister’s national security advisor, Sir Mark Sedwill, were furious with the Stock Exchange and Financial Conduct Authority for failing to consult them and conduct the required due diligence of En+. Their main concern was about whether Rusal, a subsidiary of En+, had been manufacturing aluminium powder used by Russian arms firms for military purposes. Rusal adamantly denied it – yet its own website previously indicated that the defence industry was among the users of the type of aluminium powder it manufactured.Sir Mark Sedwill was furious when the required due diligence of En+ was not carried out ahead of its flotation on the London stock exchange (Getty)The En+ group could be a candidate for new sanctions as the Russian state-owned VTB Bank is a major shareholder with a 4.35 per cent holding, while Deripaska is known for being close to the Russian President. Leaked US diplomatic cables described Deripaska as “among the two to three oligarchs Putin turns to on a regular basis” and is “a more-or-less permanent fixture on Putin’s trips abroad”.Indeed, when the US imposed sanctions on seven oligarchs and the 12 companies they own or control last week, shares tumbled. Deripaska was among those affected, as was Rotenberg.  Still, Britiain cannot follow suit. And the anger of National Security officials and MI6 En+\u0027s flotation last year stemmed precisely from their belief that it typified the complacent approach to Russian money in London, which the infamous oligarch Boris Berezovsky once told me was “70 per cent dirty”. The inability to impose sanctions is similarly emblematic.The London Stock Exchange has long been a vehicle for Russian companies and oligarchs to raise money in shares and bonds – an estimated $200bn (£140bn) since 2004. Last summer, Russia’s largest gold producer Polyus, controlled by Suleyman Kerimov, a Russian senator awarded the Order of Merit by Putin, raised $879m. There are now 57 predominantly-Russian companies listed on the London Stock Exchange, more than anywhere else outside Moscow.   The wealthiest Russian oligarchs who call London homeA little-noticed loophole to avoid sanctions is that Russian sovereign debt is permitted to be sold in London. “We are allowing Russian sovereign debt to be sold in the UK and that debt is being used to reimburse Russians to bring back their money onshore in Moscow terms,” said the Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee. “As that gold is moving towards Moscow, we are quite extraordinarily enabling those bond and debt auctions...This is one of those areas where sanctions on businesses are being compensated by the Russian state.”Just hours after Theresa May’s retaliation against the poisoning of Sergei Skripal, Gazprom issued a $750m eurobond in London and the following day the Russian government joined in by issuing a $4bn bond in the capital. Within hours, the Russian Embassy issued a revealing tweet: “Business as usual?”Could the nerve-agent attack in Salisbury be the unwitting catalyst for finally cleaning up dirty Russian money in London? (Getty)But the irony is that it is the attempted assassination of a Russian spy and double agent living in Salisbury and the murder of Russian businessman Nikolai Glushkov in Surrey that could be the unwitting catalysts for finally cleaning up dirty Russian money in London.Mark Hollingsworth is the author of “Londongrad – From Russia with Cash’’ Email cannot be used.

Within the hour, Hockey, a retired sociology professor, would become one of three neighbours arrested and locked up for eight hours.227-year-old tree planted by George Washington pulled down by windBut this dramatic pre-dawn raid – described by Nick Clegg, then the local MP, as like something “you’d expect in Putin’s Russia” – was not carried out in search of terrorists or criminals.Rather, it was in support of council contractors hired to chop down eight street trees, which residents had spent more than a year petitioning to save.Amid the confusion, Hockey and two others – including another woman in her seventies – attempted to stand under one of these century-old limes, only to be detained. All charges were later dropped.“We wanted to protect something we loved,” she says. “And our right to do that – our democratic right – was taken away, really, by state force. It was so horrible and disempowering.”Indeed, by the time the trio were freed, the trees which had always overlooked their homes were no more.Contractors cut down the final tree in Rustlings Road (PA)Yet a bigger battle was just beginning: one which has since spread across the city, seen mass protests and riot police on suburban streets, and ultimately revealed an astonishing secret plan – hidden within a £2.2bn PFI contract – to cut down almost 20,000 street trees…Sheffield has long boasted of being Europe’s greenest city – in part because a third of it sits in the Peak District. But it is also due to the sheer number of trees that line the roads. Some 36,000 of them arch over highways and footpaths.But around 2015, talk of what the Woodland Trust called a “tree massacre” started to emerge.Sheffield’s Labour council had agreed for 17,500 street trees to be axed as part of a highways improvement scheme  (PA)The eight limes in Rustlings Road were not the only ones marked for the chainsaw. Under then-redacted clauses in a £2.2bn contract, Sheffield’s Labour council had agreed for 17,500 street trees to be axed as part of a vast highways improvement scheme being undertaken by the infrastructure giant Amey.Company and council both said – and still say – such felling was necessary. Targeted trees, they argued, were either dying, dangerous or had roots causing irreparable damage to roads and footpaths. Every one taken down, they added, was being substituted with a younger sapling: “We assess every single tree and only replace them as a last resort,” says Darren Butt, account director with Amey, today.Targeted trees, the council argued, were either dying, dangerous or had roots causing damage to roads and footpaths (Sheffield Tree Action Group)Yet, as this felling increased, questions started to be asked. There was shock when two cherries commemorating Second World War heroes disappeared one day. At Christmas, a row decorated with charity festive lights were hacked back – with fellers cutting through wires and all.A feeling spread that perfectly healthy and safe trees were being chopped unnecessarily. A suspicion grew that the policy was actually about increasing Amey’s profit margins. Over the length of the company’s 25-year highway maintenance obligations, so ran the theory, a newly planted sapling is far cheaper to look after than older, larger arboreta.“People were going to work in the morning and coming home to entirely different-looking streets,” says Paul Selby, a city resident and leading member of Sheffield Tree Action Groups, known as Stag. “It was ecological destruction carried out, in secret, by a multinational company with the explicit support of the local authority and the police.“And people were angry. These trees were part of their lives and they didn’t want them taking. These weren’t anarchists or hardline activists from other towns. They’re Sheffielders furious they hadn’t been given a voice in what was happening in their streets. So they came out and fought to be heard.”Almost 6,000 trees have been chopped down. But in the face of overwhelming and increasingly nationalised pressure, a pause on felling was announced last week.Sheffield City Council has put this down to the “dangerous tactics” of protestors. Yet the support in favour of Stag – both within the city and from names including Jeremy Corbyn, Michael Gove, Ken Loach and Jarvis Cocker – probably had something to do with it too.Hopes are now high the whole policy can be reconsidered. “We don’t take anything for granted,” says Selby, a civil servant with the Department for Work and Pensions. “But, after so long fighting, surely dialogue is now the sensible way forward.”Tensions rose, with fellers and protestors accusing each other of intimidation (Sheffield Tree Action Group)Certainly, it has been a troubled road to here: the irony perhaps being that this all started with a real city victory.In 2012 the government handed Sheffield £1.2bn to improve its roads, an economic godsend for a place locals had taken to calling Pothole City. Amey – a subsidiary of the Spanish company Ferrovial – won the work contract, promising to upgrade and maintain every highway, pavement, bridge, subway and street light for 25 years.“This is work that is good for everyone living here,” says Paul Billington, director of culture and environment with the city council. “It is already bringing investment and opportunities back into the city because it is making our infrastructure world-class.”Replacing damaging or dying trees, he argues, is key to that success continuing. Doing it now, he adds, is important because, as a 2007 survey showed, a large majority of trees are so old that to delay action would store problems for future generations.“No one disagrees that dying or damaging trees should be looked at – if they really do fall into those categories,” says Alison Teal, a Green Party councillor in the city. “But this went beyond that. We still didn’t know how many were due to come down but everywhere you looked, these magnificent trees were disappearing.”Demonstrations were civil enough to start with. People at home would spot Amey vans and go out to stand under targeted trees so they couldn’t be axed. Others started taking the bus to work, leaving their cars blocking access to endangered arboreta.Cups of tea were offered while people stood about. They debated the merits of the trees: their beauty, the environmental benefits, the wildlife. Occasionally, they talked about their favourite. An endangered elm in the Nether Edge area ended up being shortlisted for the 2016 England Tree Of The Year Award.Yet things hardened after the Rustlings Road raid (“In hindsight, it was poorly handled,” says Darren Butt). While many still supported the replacement scheme, opinion started to harden in favour of the so-called tree-huggers.

Stumps of trees already cut were painted blood red as a mark of anger. Stag supporters – now numbering in their thousands – took to organising daily spotter patrols and flying pickets.“When someone saw an Amey van near an endangered tree, they put a message in a WhatsApp group or online, and whoever was available would go and protect that tree,” says Teal.In this way dozens of limes, cherries, oaks and birches across several neighbourhoods were saved.But as tensions rose – with both fellers and protestors accusing each other of intimidation – police started to appear.Jenny Hockey (left), Freda Brayshaw and a third neighbour were arrested and locked up for eight hours (PA)At one demonstration in leafy Chippinghouse Road in January 2017, nine people were arrested, some while stood in their own gardens. None were ever charged. At another picket last month, a specialist police protest removal unit turned up. It was the first time it had ever been deployed on South Yorkshire’s streets.Arrest numbers grew – yet there were vaguely comedic elements to many. A 57-year-old woman was detained after blowing a pink trumpet, while a retired couple – Dr John and Sue Unwin – found themselves being questioned by CID officers (and later cleared) about the suspected poisoning of a cup of tea they gave a feller.“It sounds like the plot from an Agatha Christie novel,” Dr Unwin told the Daily Mail.One 73-year-old was detained for intimidation. Alan Simpson, a retired firefighter and great-grandfather, says: “I’ve never been in trouble in my life and was there with my wife. I don’t think I could have cut a less intimidating figure if I tried.” His charge, too, has been dropped.“If it wasn’t so serious,” says James Whitworth, cartoonist on local newspaper The Star, “it would be farcical, and I mean that literally: there is enough material here to make an actual farce.“As a cartoonist, it’s a dream because the whole thing is so ridiculous. You think you can’t possibly say anymore on the issue – and then they arrest a woman for blowing a plastic trumpet. But as a city resident: I’m pretty neutral but, really, maybe leave our trees alone?”Local newspaper cartoonist James Whitworth’s take on the Sheffield tree massacre (James Whitworth)As news of the ongoing demonstrations spread, meanwhile, concern grew it was damaging the city’s reputation. When Sheffield was left off The Sunday Times Best Places to Live list this year, authorities blamed the campaigners: “it is regrettable the increasingly extreme actions of a small number of protestors is having this impact,” a council spokesperson declared.Demonstrators themselves were not above ridiculous assertions either: at a packed council meeting, one compared Amey’s workers to Nazi guards, just doing their jobs.Lavender and tea tree oils could be giving boys breasts, study warnsChina reassigns 60,000 troops to plant trees in bid to fight pollutionHow the Japanese fought suicide in the ‘Sea of Trees’For now, however, the potential turning point arguably came in March when a freedom of information request, asked by Paul Selby, forced the council to reveal it had indeed asked for 17,500 trees to be chopped down. The figure was so astonishing all three city MPs – all Labour – called for a rethink.In a disastrous interview on local radio, council cabinet member for environment Bryan Lodge – who declined to be interviewed for this piece – denied the figure was a target but could not explain what it actually was. Days later the suspension of felling was announced.What happens next is the question the city is asking itself.“We’ve already lost 6,000 trees,” says Selby. “Of course, there are some that should come down if they really are dying or doing irreversible damage to footpaths. But all other solutions should be sought first. Trees are a sign of a civilised city. We should be doing everything we can to save them.”Email cannot be used.

But with economic growth expected to come in weaker in Q1 owing to the snowy weather, and the need for further evidence of rising wage pressures, it will be a less clear-cut affair than anticipated,” said Tej Parikh of the Institute of Directors.Earlier this week sterling had risen to its highest level against the dollar since the Brexit vote - $1.4335 – as expectations grew of a May rate rise by the Bank of England.Sterling suffered a record intra-day plunge against the dollar of more than 11 per cent on the night of the June 2016 referendum, falling to $1.32.In January 2017 it hit a low of $1.21, before recovering over the course of the year.Despite the pound’s gradual clawing back of post-referendum losses against the dollar, the trade-weighted value of sterling – which values the UK currency against a basket of the currencies of our major trading partners – still stands 10 per cent down on its level before the Brexit vote.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

They expect to discover hundreds of new exoplanets within that larger set.It was the latest successful launch for SpaceX, a company founded by Tesla CEO Elon Musk that has in recent months deployed a fleet of communications satellites and hurled the world’s most powerful rocket into space.In addition to sending TESS into space, SpaceX caught a tumbling rocket component in a seaborne vessel.Nasa\u0027s canny decision to commission sumptuous vintage-inspired posters by Seattle design firm Invisible Creature has firmly placed space travel back where it belongs: in the imagination of travellersIt is particularly fitting that the Nasa commission went to Don and Ryan Clark, who have been running Invisible Creature since 2006, undertaking projects for the likes of Nike and TargetWe were ecstatic, just because our grandfather was an illustrator at Nasa for 30 years, says ClarkThe artwork harks back to the Jet Age-era posters commissioned by Howard Hughes\u0027 Trans World Airlines and its rival United in the 1950s and 1960s, when the work of David Klein (for TWA) and Stan Galli (for United) glamorised and essentially branded this new age of air travelIt doesn\u0027t matter that Nasa has no plans for a Grand Tour of Jupiter, Saturn, Neptune and UranusIf global travel is for daydreamers, going beyond the atmosphere is for true space cadetsThe Falcon 9 rocket’s first stage landed on a drone ship in the Atlantic Ocean named “Of Course I Still Love You”.As SpaceX has demonstrated the potential for privately funded space flight, the Trump administration has pledged a renewed commitment to space exploration.Donald Trump signed an executive order reviving a defunct national space council and has mused repeatedly about sending American astronauts back to the moon and, eventually, to Mars.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

One of the people Dr Ilardo met told her he once stayed underwater for 13 minutes while hunting.The Bajau village of Jaya BaktiJaya Bakti homes from the waterA Bajau villager demonstrates the use of traditional wooden gogglesA young Bajau girl looks on in excitement as her father, a traditional Bajau er, returns to Jaya Bakti from a two-week fishing tripThe population was interested in learning about their genetic heritage, and Dr Ilardo used a portable ultrasound machine to measure spleen size in 59 Bajau.She then measured spleen size in 34 people from a neighbouring village inhabited by non- Bajau people so she could make a comparison.When she took her data back to Denmark to analyse, Dr Ilardo found Bajau people had spleens around 50 per cent larger than their neighbours. Spleens are involved in the so-called “human e response”. When a body is submerged in cold water the heart rate slows, blood vessels in the extremities shrink and the spleen contracts.This contraction injects a spurt of additional oxygen-rich blood cells into circulation, allowing the body to survive for longer underwater. Dr Ilardo and her collaborators estimated the enlarged spleens of the Bajau could provide them with around 10 per cent more blood cells than someone with a normal-sized spleen.As well as measuring spleen size, Dr Ilardo took spit samples from the study participants so she could investigate the genetic basis for the differences she was seeing. She identified several genes that were observed far more frequently in the genomes of Bajau participants, including one – PDE10A – that is involved with the production of thyroid hormone, which in turn is associated with spleen size.We believe that in the Bajau they have an adaptation that increases thyroid hormone levels and therefore increases their spleen size, said Dr Ilardo. It\u0027s been shown in mice that thyroid hormones and spleen size are connected. “If you genetically alter mice to have an absence of the thyroid hormone T4, their spleen size is drastically reduced, but this effect is actually reversible with an injection of T4.This is the first adaptation for ing ever observed in humans. Previous work appeared to show that sea nomad children had superior underwater eyesight, but those results have since been disproved.The findings were published in the journal Cell. Despite initially warning Dr Ilardo against undertaking the work due to the likelihood she would find no significant results, her supervisors Professor Eske Willerslev and Professor Rasmus Nielsen think her findings are significant for a number of reasons.This is the first time that we really have a system like that in humans to study, said Dr Nielsen. “Nature has made experiments for us that tell us how humans react and adapt genetically to a whole new set of physiological conditions, so that we can explore and learn much more about the interaction between genetics and physiology.Understanding the genetics underpinning the Bajau’s abilities could even have applications in medical research – specifically for those trying to treat the condition of acute hypoxia, when body tissue experiences a rapid depletion of oxygen.There is also a fundamental need to understand the ersity of genes found in the world’s indigenous populations, said Professor Willerslev.This really tells us how valuable and important indigenous populations are around the world that are living extreme lifestyles, in terms of understanding the function of various genetic traits and finding the underlying genetic background for various physiological traits, he said. Most of these populations are completely understudied, and I think there is a huge benefit, not only potentially to them, but also to the rest of mankind by actually paying some attention to them.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

They said if Florida were a separate country, it would be the world’s 26th largest carbon polluter.“The Sunshine State gets less than one per cent of its energy from solar power,” said Oscar Psychas, 20, from Gainesville, the oldest of the plaintiffs.Speaking at a press conference in the state’s capital, Tallahassee, he added: “Last spring I walked to 280 miles from my home in Gainesville to Tallahassee to demand our state’s leaders protect our wild places. During my walk I saw climate change firsthand during the hottest spring ever recorded in Florida and forests dying from sea level rise along the Gulf Coast. “I’m back in Tallahassee today because I’ve seen that when our leaders destroy a stable climate, everything we care about — our wild places, our communities, our basic rights to life, liberty, and property – is endangered.”Guy Burns, who is serving as lead counsel for the young plaintiffs said that Florida had an amazing opportunity to make use of its renewable energy sources, that included solar, wave and wind. Instead, he claimed the state government had promoted the use of fossil fuels. “It is the responsibility of the state to uphold the constitution, and these young people have a fundamental right to a stable climate system,” he said.The civil lawsuit is not seeking financial damages. Rather, it wants the court to order a science-based climate recovery plan and for the state government to acknowledge climate change is real and that climate change impacts are harming the youth plaintiffs. Outgoing Cuban President Raul Castro  raising the arm of Cuba\u0027s new President Miguel Diaz-Canel after he was formally named by the National Assembly, in Havana.

Fidel Castro, the driving force behind the country’s revolution and who ruled it it with a fist that was frequently cast of iron, died in 2016.Reports said there was little surprise about the ascension of Mr Diaz-Canel, of which little is said to be known by the international community he was the sole candidate in the assembly secret ballot and therefore all but guaranteed of victory in Cuba’s single-party system.In his first televised address to the nation, Mr Diaz-Canel vowed to continue the socialist revolution that was established by the Castros. He said that Cuban foreign policy would not change and he would not negotiate the nation’s principles.At the same time, he said Cuba was always ready to to engage in dialogue with those who “treat us as equals”.The replacing of the 86-year-old Mr Castro by the 57-year-old vice president, marks an obvious generational shift and underscores that many in the country – 70 per cent of people are aged below 54 – have no first hand experience of the early, dramatic days of the revolution, that made the Castros heroes to many around the world, yet which would set them against the US for decades.Rather, many have grown up knowing years of both plenty and shortage. For years, the island was supported financially and strategically by the Soviet Union. But after the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, the subsidies that had helped maintain life in Cuba dried up daily calorie intake fell from 2,908 calories per day in the 1980s to a reported 1,863 calories per day in 1993.This moment was when many in the US believed Castro’s regime would collapse. As it was, the country re-engineered its agriculture system, being forced to adopt an almost organic approach across the island in the absence of imported fertilisers.In more recent years, Cuba developed an important relationship with the late Venezuelan leader Hugo Chavez, a man who idolised Fidel Castro and sought to spread their ideology across the region. In exchange for Cuban doctors who were dispatched to work in Venezuelan clinics, Chavez dispatched oil.As the Venezuelan economy has imploded following Chavez’s death and the era of incompetence and apparent corruption that has played out under his successor Nicolas Maduro, Cuba has looked to develop tourism, allow some private business and loosen some of the state-imposed economic regulations that marked many of the Castro years.The funeral procession carrying the ashes of Fidel Castro departs after a ceremony in Santa Clara, CubaPeople line a road to watch as the caravan carrying Cuba\u0027s late President Fidel Castro\u0027s ashes passes by in Camaguey, CubaPeople line a road to watch as the caravan carrying Cuba\u0027s late President Fidel Castro\u0027s ashes enters Camaguey, CubaPeople line a road to watch as the caravan carrying Cuba\u0027s late President Fidel Castro\u0027s ashes goes pastDaniel Hernandez, 4, salutes while awaiting the caravan carrying the late Cuban President Fidel Castro\u0027s ashes in Camaguey, CubaA military jeep is taking the ashes of Fidel Castro on a four-day journey across Cuba, with islanders lining the roads to bid farewell to the late communist iconA military jeep is taking the ashes of Fidel Castro on a four-day journey across Cuba, with islanders lining the roads to bid farewell to the late communist iconA boy and a girl in their special position waiting for the arrival of the convoy carrying the remains of Cuban revolutionary leader Fidel Castro in Cienfuegos, 240 km southeast from HavanaA military jeep is taking the ashes of Fidel Castro on a four-day journey across Cuba, with islanders lining the roads to bid farewell to the late communist iconPeople wait along the Carretera Central to see the convoy carrying the urn with the ashes of late Cuban leader Fidel CastroPeople watch the funeral procession carrying Fidel Castro\u0027s ashes through Santa Spiritus province in CubaCubans wait for the passage of the convoy carrying the remains of Cuban revolutionary leader Fidel CastroA woman holds an image of Cuba\u0027s late President Fidel Castro while awaiting the caravan carrying Castro\u0027s ashesYenia Coutinio poses for a picture while waiting for the funeral procession carrying Fidel Castro\u0027s ashesA military jeep is taking the ashes of Fidel Castro on a four-day journey across Cuba, with islanders lining the roads to bid farewell to the late communist iconA man waits for the caravan carrying the ashes of Cuba\u0027s leader Fidel Castro at a sugar cane plantation in Carlos Manuel de Cespedes, CubaA student holds an image of Cuba\u0027s late President Fidel Castro while awaiting the caravan carrying Castro\u0027s ashes in Camaguey, CubaA child reacts to the camera as he stands next to a truck used to carry people to a spot where they could watch the convoy carrying Fidel Castro\u0027s ashes in Gaspar, CubaWearing signs that read in Spanish \u0027I am Fidel\u0027, men sit on their horses as they wait to see the convoy carrying the ashes of Cuba\u0027s leader Fidel Castro on its way to the east of the country in Florida, CubaPeople paint stones laid out as a tribute to Cuba\u0027s late President Fidel Castro in Las Tunas, CubaThe changes presaged a remarkable announcement at the end of 2014 when Raul Castro and Barack Obama revealed they had been secretly negotiating to end the diplomatic standoff that has existed for 54 years, during which time Washington had tried to assassinate Fidel Castro on countless occasions.The rapprochement saw a lifting of US sanctions that had been aggressively enforced for decades, and the opening of embassies in the countries’ respective capitals. That re-engagement has somewhat faltered since the election of Donald Trump, who rolled back some of the Obama administration’s changes.Mr Castro will remain head of the Communist Party, which is designated by the constitution as “the superior guiding force of society and the state”. As a result, he may still be the most powerful person in Cuba for the time being.“I like sticking with the ideas of President Fidel Castro because he did a lot for the people of Cuba, but we need rejuvenation, above all in the economy,” Melissa Mederos, a 21-year-old schoolteacher, told AP. “Diaz-Canel needs to work hard on the economy, because people need to live a little better.” or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The whole descent took about 15 minutes.It was reported that the passenger who died, Jennifer Riordan, was a Wells Fargo banking executive and well-known community volunteer from Albuquerque, New Mexico.She was reportedly on the way back from a New York business trip, where she had sent a tweet on Monday showing the view from her hotel in Midtown Manhattan with the caption: “Great business stay.” Her Facebook page shows she was married with two children.After the emergency landing ensured the survival of everyone else on board, Ms Shults was unofficially identified by passengers, rather than by Southwest Airlines.She is now being compared to Chesley ‘Sully’ Sullenberger, the pilot who in 2009 successfully landed a stricken US Airways passenger jet on the Hudson River, and whose life saving feat was turned into a film starring Tom Hanks. Many of Flight 1380’s passengers took to social media to praise her, with one, Amanda Bourman, saying: “The pilot Tammy Jo was so amazing! She landed us safely in Philly.“God sent his angels to watch over us.”And yet, Ms Shults, originally from New Mexico, has previously revealed that she might never have become a pilot.She was quoted on fighter plane blog F-16.net saying she tried to attend an aviation career day at high school but was told they did not accept girls.Ms Shults, however, never lost the urge to fly and, after studying medicine in Kansas, applied to the US Air Force. It would not let her take the test to become a pilot, but the US Navy did.She was one of the first female F-18 pilots and became an instructor before she left the Navy in 1993 and joined Southwest, according to the blog.A Christian, who is married to a fellow pilot and has two children, Ms Shults said that sitting in the captain’s chair gave her “the opportunity to witness for Christ on almost every flight.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

But, it is still too soon to determine what went wrong, NTSB Chairman Robert Zumwalt said Wednesday.“I know people would want answers right away. We would do a very methodical investigation,” Mr Sumwalt told reporters. “Right now, we just want to document everything that we can.”The NTSB is looking into whether a crack on the inside of a fan blade could have caused the engine to fail. The crack, according to Mr Sumwalt, was “certanily not detectable from looking at it from the outside.”Investigators have determined that one of the cracks on the blade was consistent with metal fatigue, and that the blade itself had broken twice in total — nearly halfway through the piece, and again the blade was attached to the hub.Southwest Airlines has said that workers had performed a visual inspection of the engine that failed, and that an X-ray and ultrasonic inspection was scheduled for December. The X-ray and ultrasonic inspections help inspectors to see the cracks that are harder for the human eye to detect.Jennifer Riordan died after being partially sucked out of a shattered plane window following an engine explosion.Tammie Jo Shults, hero pilot of Southwest 1380, kept calm and saved her passengers.Marty Martinez, left, appears with other passengers after a jet engine blew out on the Southwest Airlines Boeing 737 plane.The window that was shattered after a jet engine of the Southwest Airlines airplane blew out at altitudeA National Transportation Safety Board investigator examines damage to the engine.The Southwest Airlines jet sits on the runway at Philadelphia International Airport after it was forced to land with an engine failure.Pennsylvania Game Commission employees recover a piece of the Southwest Airline engine covering that landed in Penn Township, Berks County.Tammie Jo Shults was hailed a hero by passengers.The window that was shattered.A National Transportation Safety Board investigator photographs a Southwest Airline engine covering that landed in Penn TownshipThe exploded engine of Southwest Airlines flight 1380 during the flight from a passenger\u0027s window.US Navy Lieutenant Tammie Jo Shults in front of a Navy FA-18A in 1992.Damage to the Southwest Airlines plane after Jennifer Riordan died when the jet blew an engine at 32,000ft.Emergency personnel monitor the damaged engine.The Federal Aviation Administration has said that it will issue a new directive to airlines that would require the more thorough inspections after a certain number of cycles, and that airlines will be asked to quickly perform the inspections on the type of engine that failed.The Southwest Airlines plane was forced to land in Philadelphia after the engine exploded at 32,000 feet, resulting in a loss of cabin pressure after pieces of shrapnel hit the cabin. One woman was pulled partway out of the plane before being pulled back in, but later died. Several others were injured, but not seriously.The pilot was able to put the plane down after 22 minutes of chaos in which passengers managed to take videos and pictures. Some of those show people with the overhead oxygen masks over their mouths. Other photos, from after landing, show the damaged engine.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Others wrote “#Iambreakingthelaw”.Weibo, which is similar to Twitter in format, appeared to then ban the hashtags and deleted many of the 150,000-plus comments related to them.The company’s Nasdaq shares fell in value on Friday amid the controversy.In an update on Sunday, Weibo said the “clean-up” would “no longer target gay content”.Censors will “primarily focus on pornographic and violent material,” the social network said, adding: “Thank you everyone for your discussions and suggestions.” The company had previously said it was acting in accordance with China’s cybersecurity laws.The Cyberspace Administration of China, the country’s internet regulator, has not commented.But the People’s Daily, the official paper of China’s ruling Communist Party, also appeared to criticise Weibo in an editorial on Sunday. “Intellectually speaking, there should be a consensus around respecting other people’s sexual orientation,” the column said, adding that comparing homosexuality to pornography and violence and regarding it as “abnormal” would go down badly with the public. Outgoing Cuban President Raul Castro  raising the arm of Cuba\u0027s new President Miguel Diaz-Canel after he was formally named by the National Assembly, in Havana.

However, a traditional, conservative preference for conventional marriage and childbearing creates barriers for LGBT+ people. Following Weibo’s initial announcement on Friday, more than a million users have viewed hashtags in support of LGBT+ rights.Hua Zile, the founder of Voice for China LGBT, Weibo’s first LGBT-themed account, said he was encouraged by the widespread anger over the site’s censorship plan. “The response shows that we LGBT people in China are slowly realising our rights,” Mr Hua said. “Gay people who would not have spoken out years ago are now letting their voices be heard.” He said a Weibo manager had told him to stop posting while the “clean-up” was taking place.He complied, and his announcement that Voice for China LGBT would be going on hiatus was shared nearly 40,000 times. After Weibo’s u-turn, Mr Hua called on the firm to apologise to the LGBT+ community. “Like China, which has developed so quickly in such a short time, sex education in the country is a work in progress,” he said. On Sunday, an LGBT+ group of more than 100 people took part in a marathon in the city of Nanjing, holding rainbow flags to raise awareness of gay rights.The group had planned to take part in the marathon months in advance, but its organiser, Lucas Chen, said Weibo’s announcement gave it “added significance”. The main objective of joining the marathon was to “help everyone courageously come out of the closet,” Mr Chen said. “So it was meaningful that people online were also bravely speaking out and showing that they were not defeated by negativity.” or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The most important thing is not to react on such and such instrument at this stage, but to be sure that we share the same goals and to have a joint political objective,” he said.“You will notice we don’t lack work to do, and we don’t lack the will either.” The two leaders both agree that the Eurozone needs reform but disagree on the specifics.
