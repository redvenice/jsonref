Pictured: The Lewis home But giving evidence, Mrs Fenton steadfastly denied doctoring the plan to her Grade-II listed home and said, as far as she is concerned, the wall is all hers.\u0027Of course it\u0027s my wall, it\u0027s always been my wall,\u0027 she told Central London County Court.\u0027I was transferred a house with four walls. No one since 1969 has ever suggested to me that I have a house with a party wall.\u0027I didn\u0027t do it. I\u0027m absolutely sure that I have never made alterations to anything. To be accused of altering documents, I\u0027m astounded.\u0027I am being castigated here. I have been harassed by this man (Mr Lewis) for years.\u0027The neighbours have been at loggerheads since the late 1990s when the Lewises moved into the street, which is close to Abbey Road studios.Both neighbours were friendly with McCartney, with a judge in an earlier hearing describing Mrs Fenton\u0027s relationship with the Beatle as \u0027excellent\u0027.However, the relationship between the Lewises and Mrs Fenton has been less cordial, with arguments dating back to their first years living next door.          They are neighbours with Paul McCartney and are friendly with him, with a judge in an earlier hearing describing Mrs Fenton\u0027s relationship with the Beatle as \u0027excellent\u0027. Pictured: McCartney\u0027s home Mrs Fenton lost a case brought against her by her neighbours in 2005 over her installation of fence panels on the shared garden wall.She won the next battle in 2015 when a judge ordered the Lewises to remove a roof from which water had flowed from their extension onto Mrs Fenton\u0027s property.They have since taken down the roof, but now plan to build an enlarged structure, which they say would finally solve the rainwater problem.Last year, an independent surveyor issued a Party Wall Award, which authorises them to raise the boundary wall to build their extension.But that only led the neighbours back to court, as Mrs Fenton launched her challenge to the surveyor\u0027s decision.  Sir Paul\u0027s home is separated from the two homes and is not involved Her barrister, Stuart Frame, claims that the Party Wall Award should be overturned as the wall in question is not actually shared.\u0027It is Mrs Fenton\u0027s case that the works authorised by the award cannot be executed due to the fact that the configuration of the walls in the immediate vicinity of the proposed works are not as assumed by the surveyor making the award,\u0027 he said.Mr and Mrs Lewis say their neighbour should not be allowed to argue that the wall is hers alone, claiming she agreed informally through solicitors 21 years ago that the boundary runs down the middle of the wall.She then stood by \u0027in silence\u0027 while the original extension was built off the wall, Mr Rainey told Judge Nicholas Parfitt.Much of her case also referred to the plan which contains the allegedly fraudulent annotations, indicating that Mrs Fenton owns the whole wall.\u0027The current proposed extension is by way of compliance with the order in 2015, requiring Mr and Mrs Lewis to replace the roof of their extension,\u0027 said Mr Rainey.\u0027The judge was told that if the roof had to come off, the opportunity would be taken to build the additional storey.\u0027Mrs Fenton has done everything in her power, including issuing these proceedings, to interfere with Mr and Mrs Lewis\u0027 attempts to comply with that order.\u0027The judge reserved his decision on the case until a later date."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/20/13/4D7038CF00000578-5865075-image-a-52_1529497473032.jpg","title":"Shed converted pub bar fruit machine 200","story":"    Wayne Hyland (pictured), from West Drayton, west London, has transformed his garden shed into a fully functioning pub          The 43-year-old HGV driver spent six months and £200 converting the structure into a cosy \u0027pub shed\u0027 - which he calls \u0027Lenny\u0027s Bar\u0027          \u0027People said I was crazy when I said what I wanted to accomplish with my tiny shed.

Comcast\u0027s was all cash while Disney\u0027s new offer of $38 per share is half cash and half stock.  Disney said on Wednesday it is raising its offer because Fox\u0027s value increased due to \u0027tax reform and operating improvements\u0027.\u0027After six months of integration planning we\u0027re even more enthusiastic and confident in the strategic fit of the assets and the talent at Fox,\u0027 said CEO Bob Iger in a statement.In a call with analysts, Iger said he believes Disney\u0027s bid is superior to Comcast\u0027s from a regulatory perspective, and said that six months of dealing with regulators both in the U.S. and internationally has given Disney a \u0027meaningful head start.\u0027Murdoch\u0027s £11.7billion bid to buy Sky is set to go ahead...AT\u0026T closes sale of Time Warner for $85 billion just two...Lurking Lauer: Disgraced NBC anchor hides his face under...Share this articleThe battle for Fox\u0027s entertainment business, which has produced hit films including Avatar and Ice Age, reflects a new imperative among traditional players in the industry to amass more programming to compete with Netflix and AmazonThe deal would include Fox film and TV studios, some cable networks and international assets, but not Fox News Channel or the Fox television network.Fox CEO Rupert Murdoch said the company \u0027firmly believes\u0027 that the combination with Disney is a good fit.\u0027We remain convinced that the combination of 21CF\u0027s iconic assets, brands and franchises with Disney\u0027s will create one of the greatest, most innovative companies in the world,\u0027 he said in a statement.But the New York company also said it is still weighing both offers, and noted that Disney\u0027s new bid doesn\u0027t have any provisions in it that prevents Fox from considering other offers.Fox and Disney shareholders had been scheduled to vote on Disney\u0027s original bid July 10, but that meeting has been postponed.In morning trading, shares of 21st Century Fox rallied 6 percent to $47.47.

Pictured is a graffiti artist painting a Tube train in London          The \u0027Three Musketeers\u0027 tagged this train and others in the street art community have said this is the \u0027holy grail\u0027  A new photograph shows Loughborough Junction victim Harrison Scott-Hood riding a bike along a railway line apparently carrying his spray cans (left). Criminologist Nicola Harding (right) says graffiti artists are now using social media like Instagram to gain notoriety  Leeds Trinity University criminologist Nicola Harding, who has spent years studying graffiti artists in Britain and around the world, has said that street art is increasingly becoming a pursuit for the wealthy middle classes using social media like Instagram to gain notoriety          This is the final piece of graffiti painted on the night the \u0027Three Musketeers\u0027 known as K-Bag, Lover and Trip died just 350 yards from where they were all run down and killed by the same train          The final hours of their lives have started to emerge as it appears they walked up the railway line and were killed close to their final artwork togetherThe three young men killed at Loughborough Junctions were spraying graffiti on a bridge where they had no hope of escaping trains.All were from respectable homes and either worked full time or were students. Nicola Harding said: \u0027From my research it does appear that those who are engaging in graffiti are increasingly now from more affluent backgrounds, as they have the money and time to devote to perfecting their skills.\u0027In the 1980-90s graffiti writers would have usually started by stealing paint from car workshops. Spray paint is now kept caged if on the high street, and is more often than not sold online. This is quite expensive and requires a certain level of disposable income to be graffiti writing regularly\u0027. She added: \u0027Instagram is a good way for graffiti writers to show off their graffiti skills, and identify with the culture. By using wild style graffiti or showing spray cans and masks, they can hone the craft of graffiti without getting arrested, but are still part of the graffiti culture\u0027. Final graffiti tags of \u0027Lover, K-Bag and Trip\u0027 painted just...Husband shoots dead his wife and her father before killing...Grieving families call for GP \u0027responsible for HUNDREDS of...Full steam ahead!

The thing writers go to jail for is trains, so you\u0027re seeing a lot of people up on the street now\u0027. MailOnline today revealed  the final piece of graffiti painted on the night the so-called \u0027Three Musketeers\u0027 died just 350 yards from where they were all run down. The friends walked along a stretch of line close to Brixton Station and did a \u0027hang over\u0027 on a bridge - where you lean over the side to paint - in what friends have called their \u0027final mission\u0027 hours before they died.Paying tribute to his friend Harrison a former schoolmate said: \u0027He was an amazing human being, a kind-hearted and generous person, someone with an infectious laugh and smile, and a man with infinite wisdom, who worked hard and paid his dues to society. There is so much more to him than the catastrophe that ensued on Sunday night, and this, first and foremost, must be remembered\u0027.He added: \u0027Graffiti is an infectious and often untreatable bug, for some, no matter how much you try to shake it, it remains a part of your life no matter how many run-ins with the law. Those in the graffiti community do not seek for you to understand why they do it, but simply to comprehend that there is far more to these graffiti artists than meets the eye\u0027.   The parents of Alberto Fresneda Carrasco (pictured left and right) said today that they had last heard from their son, a keen Everton and Sevilla fan, on Sunday night at 10pm saying he would be coming home for dinner - but he never arrived  The final victim was 23-year-old Jack Gilbert, nicknamed K-Bag, whose work is on walls and trains (pictured) all over LondonA privately educated fine arts student and a teenage photographer were among three graffiti artists killed by a train.The body of Harrison Scott-Hood, 23, known as Harry, was found close to those of his two friends on a busy South London railway line on Monday morning.The budding artist from Muswell Hill, who attended £7,000-a-term Hampstead Fine Arts College, was a well-known figure in the capital\u0027s underground graffiti scene.Known by his tag \u0027Lover\u0027, he had been commissioned to undertake professional graffiti murals for firms.The \u0027Three Musketeer\u0027 graffiti artists killed by a train at a notorious and \u0027dangerous\u0027 vandalism hotspot were named by their \u0027heartbroken\u0027 parents on Tuesday.Mr Scott-Hood, whose mother Susie is a successful painter and art agent, was found dead alongside 19-year-old Alberto Fresneda Carrasco, who was known as Trip and also lived in north London.The final victim was Jack Gilbert, a 23-year-old nicknamed K-Bag, and all three friends are believed to have been hit by an out of service passenger train shortly after 1am as they painted on walls in south London after dark.  Alberto\u0027s father Carlos is the UK correspondent of Spanish daily and his parents said today that they had last heard from their son, a keen Everton and Sevilla fan from Hampstead, on Sunday night at 10pm saying he would be coming home for dinner - but he never arrived.

But in a statement, they paid tribute to their \u0027intelligent and wonderful\u0027 son who they described as a \u0027beautiful artist\u0027. The couple said: \u0027We are completely heartbroken by the loss of our only son, Harrison.\u0027He was the love of our life, a kind and beautiful young man and we were beyond broken by this news. Harrison was loved by everyone, he was an intelligent and wonderful boy who had so many close friends.

Prime Minister Viktor Orban has accused George Soros, above, of encouraging mass immigration to undermine Europe – a charge Soros deniesHis right-wing Fidesz party tightened its grip on parliament in an April election fought on a fiercely anti-immigration platform that demonised US billionaire Soros and liberal NGOs he backs.  Orban accuses Soros of encouraging mass immigration to undermine Europe – a charge Soros denies.Interior Minister Sandor Pinter wrote in an attempt to justify the toughened stance: \u0027The Hungarian people rightfully expects the government to use all means necessary to combat illegal immigration and the activities that aid it.          Prime Minister Viktor Orban, above, has been a vocal critic of German Chancellor Angela Merkel\u0027s open-door migrant policy\u0027The STOP Soros package of bills serves that goal, making the organisation of illegal immigration a criminal offence. We want to use the bills to stop Hungary from becoming a country of immigrants.\u0027The Parliament, where Fidesz has a two-thirds majority, also passed a constitutional amendment stating that an \u0027alien population\u0027 cannot be settled in Hungary – a swipe at Brussels over its quota plan.Immigration has become a major concern for voters across the European Union, helping to propel anti-migrant populists to power in Italy and Austria and threatening to fracture Merkel\u0027s three-month-old coalition in Germany.US becomes top global destination for asylum seekers,...Europe is facing a migrant \u0027catastrophe\u0027 to rival the 2015...Share this articleOrban has drummed up support for his tough measures by exploiting Hungarians\u0027 memories of the large numbers of mostly Muslim migrants fleeing conflicts in the Middle East who surged into the country in the summer of 2015.The vast majority of them moved on to wealthier western European countries, but Orban has branded the migrants a threat to Europe\u0027s Christian civilisation and built a border fence along Hungary\u0027s southern borders to deter more from coming.STATISTICS Hungarian statistics show 3,555 refugees living in Hungary, a country of 10 million, as of April. Only 342 people were registered as asylum seekers in the first four months of this year, mostly from the Middle East, and 279 were approved.The Hungarian Helsinki Committee, a rights group that often represents migrants, said on Wednesday the narrowing definition of who counts as a refugee essentially means nobody entering Hungary by land would be entitled to such treatment.          Orban has also tightened state control over the media, major business sectors and the courts since taking power in 2010\u0027Instead of giving protection against persecution, the Hungarian government has decided to join the ranks of the persecutors,\u0027 Helsinki Committee Co-Chair Marta Pardavi said. The Orban government expects possible legal action by the European Commission, the EU\u0027s executive arm, over the new law.Two leading European rights bodies, the Council of Europe and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), have criticised Hungary\u0027s new law as \u0027arbitrary\u0027 and vague and said it contravenes European law.          Budapest: Hungary\u0027s parliament has defied the European Union and human rights groupsThe Venice Commission, an expert body at the Council of Europe, had asked Hungary to refrain from approving the new law until a report it co-authored with the OSCE is published.Orban has also tightened state control over the media, major business sectors and the courts since taking power in 2010.In other constitutional changes approved on Wednesday, parliament agreed to set up a new judicial branch for administrative cases that critics say may increase political influence over judges. Another change narrowed the right to free expression and assembly."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/20/16/4D5F9AEE00000578-5865805-image-a-117_1529507428944.jpg","title":"Core Grenfell cladding panels burned hot flaming petrol turned fiery droplets","story":"    The core of Grenfell cladding panels burned as hot as flaming petrol and turned into fiery droplets, raining down from the tower blaze, an expert told an inquiry todayThe inquiry was told that a range of flammable materials had been strapped around Grenfell Tower during a refurbishment in 2016. Professor Bisby spoke at the hearing at Holborn Bars in central London about the flammable cladding panels, also referred to as cassettes. The cladding panels were described in expert analyses as the main source of the fire\u0027s spread last summer. The professor explained that the cladding panel core was made from polyethylene, which is \u0027a highly flammable, synthetic thermoplastic polymer.\u0027He added: \u0027Upon exposure to heat, polyethylene will melt and drip, possibly flowing while burning or generating flaming droplets.\u0027 In addition to the flammable cladding, voids ran vertically from the fourth floor  to the tower\u0027s crown at certain points in the cladding system.The Reynobond 55PE panels, which shrouded the cladding core in aluminium, formed the outer shell of the cladding system, with a cavity sitting between it and the insulation.     The inquiry was told that a range of flammable materials had been strapped around Grenfell Tower during a refurbishment in 2016The professor said: \u0027To form the product into rainscreen cassettes, flat sheets of the material are cut and folded.\u0027Displaying a picture of a \u0027typical\u0027 cladding panel taken from Grenfell Tower after the fire, he continued: \u0027This image is showing the back of a typical rainscreen cassette, by which I mean it is showing the face of the cassette that would have been looking into the ventilated rainscreen cladding.\u0027The black areas in this image therefore present surfaces of polyethylene that would be directly exposed to any flame or heat within the cladding cavity, should a fire penetrate by essentially any means into the cladding system.\u0027 Professor Bisby continued: \u0027You will no doubt have noted the commentary in the media comparing the polyethylene within the rainscreen cassette at Grenfell Tower with petrol or diesel this is likely to be on the basis that the heats of combustion of petrol or diesel are similar to the PE used in Reynobond PE (aluminium composite material) products.Ministers say they will ban combustible cladding on...Dramatic moment firefighters battled blaze in fourth-floor...Grenfell cladding banned and \u0027was unlawful\u0027 on tragic tower...Work on exposed gas pipes at Grenfell Tower should have...Share this article\u0027It\u0027s perhaps worth reiterating here, however, that the heat of combustion is only one of the important parameters dictating how a material will burn.\u0027The probe previously heard that the fire last June escaped into the external face of the building after eating through the flammable material which lined the windows of Flat 16, on the fourth floor.The window boards surrounding the frames were made of uPVC, the expert said - a material which promotes the spread of fire less than other polymers, but which will soften at a lower heat.Prof Bisby continued: \u0027This is significant, highly significant in my view, in the context of Grenfell Tower because, as I\u0027ve already explained, uPVC window boards form the initial barrier for flames to prevent fire spread from the kitchen of Flat 16 into the cladding cavity beside the kitchen window.\u0027          Survivors of the Grenfell Tower fire claim that a culture of \u0027incompetence and indifference\u0027 towards social housing tenants continuesMr Daffarn - who leads advocacy group Grenfell United - was one of a number of representatives of victims of the fire who addressed MPs over their treatment at the hands of the council and the ongoing issues survivors face.When asked if he thought that residents in social housing felt they were being treated as second-class citizens, he replied: \u0027There is definitely a group of people in the RBKC that get treated very differently from another group in RBKC.\u0027That feeling of being treated with indifference and contempt is just an overriding feeling - we are a year down the line and there are still a significant amount of people living in hotels. It beggars belief.\u0027He continued: \u0027The properties that were bought by RBKC were bought without a fire risk assessment being carried out.\u0027When residents were shown the properties, they weren\u0027t told that they hadn\u0027t been fire risk assessed.\u0027Mr Daffarn said the lack of fire risk assessment was just one example of social housing tenants being treated with indifference by RBKC.He blamed the toxic relationship between RBKC and its tenants on a \u0027cabal\u0027 of senior officers for systematically asset-stripping the borough because it was a \u0027gold mine\u0027.He added: \u0027RBKC (council) was a property development company masquerading as a local authority.\u0027They failed to keep us safe because they had higher priorities - the priorities were getting us off the land.\u0027The tenant management organisation in charge of the tower has now been dissolved, but Mr Daffarn voiced his concern that a number of its officers had simply been absorbed into the employment of the council.          Kensington and Chelsea Council leader Elizabeth Campbell and chief executive Barry Quirk arrive at Portcullis House in Westminster, London\u0027What are the council doing to monitor the performance of the council that came from Kensington and Chelsea Tennant Management Organisation?\u0027 he asked.Jacqui Haynes, chairwoman of the Lancaster West Residents Association, said: \u0027This is years of disempowerment, years of being looked upon as if we don\u0027t matter.\u0027We have been suffering this level of service, this kind of treatment for years -decades.\u0027It\u0027s just because this disaster happened that it blew up in their (the council\u0027s) faces and they realised that it can\u0027t continue.\u0027Mr Daffarn criticised the Government for failing to place the council into special measures immediately after the fire.\u0027There\u0027s a vast chasm between the council and the community which at the least will take many, many years to rebuild,\u0027 he said.RBKC chief executive Barry Quirk - who was appointed in the aftermath of the disaster - said they were now examining council staff\u0027s \u0027cultural competencies\u0027 and not just their experience, and that the £50 million budget allocated to help survivors of the fire matched that of the children\u0027s social services department.\u0027Turning around an organisation like (RBKC) does take time and we need to evaluate the competencies of managers, we need to change some frontline staff and we need to monitor delivery,\u0027 he said.Council leader Elizabeth Campbell thanked the victims for the way they have treated councillors in the wake of the fire.\u0027I think the way survivors and bereaved have treated us is nothing short of amazing - there has been unbelievable generosity of spirit,\u0027 she said.\u0027If my child had died, would I be talking to the council like that? The answer is probably not.\u0027Both Ms Campbell and Mr Quirk said they were committed to reforming attitudes within the council, but Mr Quirk estimated it would be many years before he was satisfied with the levels of empathy among staff for social housing tenants."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/20/20/4D757B6400000578-5866069-image-a-35_1529523836393.jpg","title":"DHS writing order END child separations border","story":"    Both the first lady and the first daughter (pictured) were in the Oval Office on Wednesday when Trump signed the directive          President Trump indicated that lobbying from his daughter Ivanka, who showed him pictures of the caged and kenneled children, and wife Melania (Pictured in the Oval Office Tuesday) had caused him to have a change in positionImmediately after her father signed the order, Ivanka made her first public comments on the matter.\u0027Thank you @POTUS for taking critical action ending family separation at our border,\u0027 she said. \u0027Congress must now act + find a lasting solution that is consistent with our shared values the same values that so many come here seeking as they endeavor to create a better life for their families.\u0027The president said Congress would have to take action - and that he still wants his border wall funded.   \u0027And also, there may be some litigation. We’re also wanting to go through Congress. We will be going through Congress. We’re working on a much more comprehensive bill,\u0027 he said. \u0027And ultimately, we want to see it done right, and it will be done right.\u0027 Of the order he\u0027d just signed, he said, \u0027You\u0027re gonna have a lot of happy people.\u0027 \u0027People haven\u0027t dealt with it, and we are dealing with it...This is one that has gone on for many decades. So we\u0027re keeping families together, and this will solve that problem,\u0027 he stated.\u0027At the same time, we are keeping a very powerful border and it continues to be a zero-tolerance,\u0027 he added. \u0027We have zero tolerance for people that enter our country illegally.\u0027As Trump acknowledged, he did not end the \u0027zero tolerance\u0027 provision of his policy that requires the prosecution of all unlawful immigrants as criminals. His order merely authorizes DHS to hold families together while prosecution is pending. DHS will bear the costs of constructing facilities to house migrant parents and their children while their cases are being adjudicated. The order directs the attorney general to prioritize the cases as quickly as possible.Trump also told Attorney General Jeff Sessions to put in a request with a U.S. District Court in California to modify a settlement agreement that would permit DHS under present resource constraints to detain illegal immigrant families together \u0027throughout the pendency of criminal proceedings for improper entry or any removal or other immigration proceedings.\u0027 The president tipped his hand earlier on Wednesday when he said that he would be signing something dealing with the issue as he spoke to reporters in the Cabinet room.\u0027I\u0027m going to be signing an executive order in a little while before I go to Minnesota but, at the same time,\u0027 Trump said. \u0027I think you have to understand, we\u0027re keeping families together, but we have to keep our borders strong. We will be overrun with crime and with people that should not be in our country.\u0027 His Department of Homeland Security secretary was said to be drafting an order to end the child separation policy that\u0027s become a political albatross for the Trump administration.           President Donald Trump first revealed his plans to sign an executive order addressing family separation during a meeting earlier today with lawmakers          The Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirsjen Nielsen was earlier said to be drafting an order to end the child separation policy that\u0027s become a political albatross for the Trump administrationDHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen was at the White House on Wednesday morning and was by the president\u0027s side in the afternoon, standing opposite to the vice president, when he took the executive action. \u0027I just thank you for your leadership, sir. We look forward and expect the House to act this week. We ask them to do their job,\u0027 she said minutes before making a trip of her own to Capitol Hill. \u0027The laws need to be changed. This is a problem that President after President has dealt with for decades. This one is willing to stand up and fix it. We ask Congress to do their part.\u0027Ivanka and Melania Trump were also present at the afternoon signing just before he left the White House for Minnesota. The about-face came hours after the president publicly racheted his attacks on Democrats opposing his immigration agenda via Twitter.It also followed a press conference on Capitol Hill where  House Speaker Paul Ryan at which the GOP leader refused to entertain the prospect of a stand-alone bill to handle family separation.Ryan did not know about the executive order at the time, a person familiar with the situation told DailyMail.com, and was at the White House on Wednesday at the president\u0027s invitation to discuss immigration legislation he is about to bring up for a vote in the House.The GOP leader was at the White House with a group of roughly 25 lawmakers who DailyMail.com\u0027s source described as on the fence. Even with Trump\u0027s forthcoming executive order, Congress will still have to take the lead in making the policy shift permanent.\u0027It doesn\u0027t take away the fact that this needs to be changed into law at some point,\u0027 the person said. \u0027The courts could challenge what the president does in terms of executive action.\u0027 The president\u0027s U-turn came at an immediate cost to Members of Congress, who had been looking forward to a summer picnic at the White House on Thursday.President Trump said during a surprise media avail on Wednesday morning that he was cancelling the event.\u0027I do want to say that, because we\u0027re also busy....that we are going to cancel and postpone tomorrow\u0027s congressional picnic,\u0027 he stated.Trump met yesterday on Capitol Hill with GOP lawmakers to talk about a broad range of issues. He hosted two sets of legislators at the White House on Wednesday.Tomorrow\u0027s picnic would have offered him a chance to speak to the very same Democrats he\u0027s been clobbering for not supporting his immigration agenda. The president who is holding a political rally tonight in Minnesota said he did not think the optics of a festive picnic with legislators and their families would be appropriate. He insinuated that he did not want to reward the opposing party that he\u0027s repeatedly called obstructionist.\u0027I was just walking over to the Oval Office and I said, you know, it doesn\u0027t feel right to have a picnic for Congress when we\u0027re working on doing something very important,\u0027 he stated. \u0027It didn\u0027t feel exactly right to me. We\u0027ll make it another time when things are going extremely well.\u0027   Trump indicated in his Cabinet Room remarks that the images of children at the border in cages and kennels had affected him outlook. \u0027Those images affect everybody,\u0027 he said of the photos that have been dominating the national news since Father\u0027s Day.The president told lawmakers, \u0027The dilemma is that if you\u0027re weak, if you\u0027re weak – which some people would like you to be – if you\u0027re really, really pathetically weak, the country\u0027s going to be overrun with millions of people. And if you\u0027re strong, then you don\u0027t have any heart. That\u0027s a tough dilemma. Perhaps I\u0027d rather be strong, but that\u0027s a tough dilemma.\u0027 Democrats have been pummeling the Trump administration as cruel and inhumane for splitting families up at the border in order to prosecute parents for unlawfully crossing the border.\u0027President Trump and his enablers in Congress have taken these children hostage to try to enact their anti-immigrant agenda into law. Don’t be fooled: this crisis does not need a bill to fix it—it requires the GOP to stand up and call for an end to this monstrous Trump policy,\u0027 Sen. Dick Durbin, a Democratic leader, tweeted.They continued their assault even after Trump signed his order, saying the administration also needed to say how it plans to reunite already-separated children from their families.\u0027Today the American people, through their forceful and justified outrage, proved they can drive change even during the Trump administration. But we must not be fooled: We need to ensure that the 2,500 children already separated are promptly reunited with their families,\u0027 Sen. Patrick Leahy tweeted. Rep. Robin Kelly similarly said, \u0027We can’t let @realDonaldTrump off the hook just for ending his cruel and immoral program. There are still NO plans to reunite 2,300+ children with their families.\u0027 Democratic Congressman Keith Ellison said the directive that Trump did sign \u0027doesn\u0027t fix this mess. \u0027\u0027We shouldn\u0027t be putting kids in cages, with or without their families. And Nielsen must go,\u0027 the former DNC official said, calling for the ousting of the DHS secretary. The order had Rep. Ed Perlmutter and others claiming that it proved Trump \u0027had the authority to stop these inhumane practices all along\u0027 despite what his administration said.   \u0027For weeks @realDonaldTrump claimed only Congress could end this merciless policy. Today’s executive order is an admission both that he lied to America \u0026amp his attempt to hold children hostage has failed because of Americans’ outrage,\u0027 said House Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer.Leahy noted that Trump\u0027s order explicitly does not end the zero tolerance policy for illegal border crossings.\u0027Pres. Trump’s “zero tolerance” policy needs to go. It makes zero sense to delay civil proceedings to criminally prosecute migrants with no records, who pose no threat, and who are only seeking refuge from unimaginable violence and terror in their home countries,\u0027 Leahy said.At his executive order signing, President Trump said he is not backing down and rejected suggestions to the contrary.\u0027No, no, the border is just as tough, but we do want to keep families together. This is a problem. If you look at some of those horrible scenes from a few years ago — to me, they were horrible scenes. They were just terrible. And that was during the Obama administration,\u0027 he said. \u0027Other administrations have had the same thing. We’re keeping the family together. And so this is it.\u0027           DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen went to Capitol Hill to talk to lawmakers after President Trump signed the executive order that needs to be back up by congressional actionPresident Trump said Wednesday that he wants \u0027security for our country, and we will have that.\u0027 \u0027At the same time we have compassion, we want to keep families together. It\u0027s very important,\u0027 he stated. \u0027I\u0027ll be signing something in a little while that\u0027s going to do that.\u0027He noted that Republicans are also working on legislation that meet the same end.\u0027But I\u0027ll be doing something that\u0027s somewhat preemptive but ultimately will be matched by legislation I\u0027m sure.\u0027  His exercise of executive power also flew in the face of Republican complaints about immigration directives put in place by the previous administration - and his own claims last week that he couldn\u0027t end family separation.\u0027You can’t do it through an executive order,\u0027 he told reporters a week ago on Friday.Trump made reference to Obama\u0027s alleged abuse of power today when he brought up Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, claiming that Obama acknowledged he shouldn\u0027t be signing the order and did anyway.\u0027He actually said, I’m not allowed to sign this, never going to hold up,\u0027 Trump said of the program and ongoing litigation. \u0027And they got a judge who held it up, and they got another one who held it up. Then we had a couple that turned it down, and it’s going to be a Supreme Court issue.\u0027The Republican president found himself in a similar bind this week as the opposing party stymied his immigration reform agenda.\u0027We\u0027re having a lot of problems with Democrats that don\u0027t want to vote for anything,\u0027 he said. \u0027They don\u0027t care about lack of security. They really would like to have open borders where anybody in the world can just flow in, including from the Middle East, from anybody anywhere they can just flow into our country. \u0027Tremendous problems with that, tremendous crime caused by that. We\u0027re just not going to do it.\u0027 Trump said in a tweet this morning that Democrats \u0027want open borders which means crime\u0027 as he saddled them with the burden of changing America\u0027s immigration laws, which he said are the \u0027weakest and worst anywhere in the world.\u0027He said in another vague message, whoever, that he is \u0027working on something\u0027 pertaining to immigration without saying what it is.            Immigration reform legislation in Congress was no closer on Wednesday to gaining majority support in the House, even after a closed-door session between Republicans and the president, meetings at the White House and a visit to Capitol Hill by Nielsen.GOP leaders were looking at two pieces of legislation that would fund the president\u0027s border wall, one of which also takes steps to end family separation for Central American migrants.Conservative lawmakers were also crafting a \u0027back-up\u0027 bill that they hoped to sub in if the other two fail. Their bill sets aside most of Trump\u0027s other immigration priorities and deals solely with the detention of children coming across the border in family units.Trump said in a speech Tuesday that he supports a \u0027third option\u0027 and even claimed credit for it.Ryan said at a morning news conference that he was moving forward with the leadership-approved immigration reform bills that were scheduled for a vote tomorrow.The GOP leader refused to entertain questions about stand-alone bills that narrowly deal with the issue of young children being detained in cages and tents while their parents await prosecution for the crime of unlawfully entering the country.\u0027We\u0027re trying to pass this legislation right now. This is very good compromise legislation,\u0027 Ryan told reporters.It solves the border crisis, he claimed, and stabilizes the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, better known as DACA.\u0027And then when other situations arise, whatever the circumstances are, we\u0027ll cross this bridge when it comes to it,\u0027 he asserted.Ryan rejected Democrats\u0027 allegations that the GOP is using the immigrant children as bargaining chips to get more of the president\u0027s immigration priorities passed.\u0027That\u0027s a ridiculous assertion,\u0027 Ryan said as he stormed out, having already deemed it the last question.             Immigration reform legislation was no closer on Wednesday to gaining majority support in the House, however, even after a closed-door session between Republicans and the presidentIn morning tweets in which Trump insisted that Democrats are to blame for family separation because they will not bend to his will, he alluded to the measure again as he said he was \u0027working on something\u0027 that he suggested would change the conversation.\u0027It’s the Democrats fault, they won’t give us the votes needed to pass good immigration legislation,\u0027 he said. \u0027They want open borders, which breeds horrible crime. Republicans want security. But I am working on something - it never ends!\u0027Coming out of the meeting with GOP lawmakers, the White House said that Trump was \u0027100 percent\u0027 behind the two bills House leadership plans to bring up for a vote.Trump reportedly did not talk to lawmakers at all about family separation. Democrats have pummeled the GOP for coupling family separation - a policy introduced in April by the Trump administration - with comprehensive immigration reform.Sen. Chris Van Hollen, head of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, said in a Tuesday email to members, \u0027There is no universe in which forcibly separating now thousands of young children from their parents is acceptable. The practice is an abomination. It’s not part of any solution to fix our immigration system.\u0027Van Hollen said he spent his Father’s Day visiting immigrant detention centers on the border and \u0027there is no doubt that the Trump administration’s family separation policy is cruel and inhumane.\u0027\u0027In McAllen, Texas, I saw a facility people called “the dog kennel” which housed children separated from their mothers and fathers lumped into holding pens made of chain-link fence. It was a disturbing and shameful scene that should have no place in America,\u0027 the Maryland Democrat wrote.House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi similarly wrote in an email on behalf of the lower chamber\u0027s campaign arm: \u0027I have never been more horrified by this President. His choice to separate immigrant children from their mothers at our border is heartless. It’s cruel. It’s immoral. And -- it’s all for political leverage.\u0027 House Homeland Security Chairman Mike McCaul, a Texas Republican, admitted to Fox News on Tuesday after the meeting with the president that family separation was a policy of this president. \u0027The parents are now being prosecuted but we would like to see the family stay together and not separated,\u0027he said. \u0027But I think most importantly from my position as the chairman of homeland security is to have a border security bill passed.\u0027          Unless Congress acts, he said, smugglers and traffickers will continue to sell entry to the United States for for $6,000 a person.\u0027We will never stop this problem until we dry up the deterrent issue and the legal loopholes that existed currently,\u0027 he stated. Even some staunch allies of the president said they couldn\u0027t get behind him when it comes to the detention of families, though. His former lawyer on Wednesday quit the national party as deputy finance chair, citing the president\u0027s border policy and the special counsel investigation. \u0027As the son of a Polish holocaust survivor, the images and sounds of this family separation policy is heart wrenching,\u0027 Cohen said in a resignation letter according to ABC News. \u0027While I strongly support measures that will secure our porous borders, children should never be used as bargaining chips.\u0027First Lady Melania Trump was also said to be lobbying her husband to take action.She has pressed him privately, CNN reported, as well as publicly to address family separation.\u0027Mrs. Trump hates to see children separated from their families and hopes both sides of the aisle can finally come together to achieve successful immigration reform,\u0027 her communications director, Stephanie Grisham, said. \u0027She believes we need to be a country that follows all laws, but also a country that governs with heart.President Trump suggested Tuesday that he could cut down on unlawful migration by ending aid to the Central American countries that he claimed are \u0027sending\u0027migrants to the U.S. as part of his plot to secure the border.Trump said he\u0027d be asking for authorization to end assistance to the region that includes Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras.\u0027We\u0027re not going to give any more aid to those countries,\u0027 he asserted during a Washington, D.C. speech to the National Federation of Independent Business. \u0027Why the hell should we?\u0027   The president told attendees of the conference, \u0027I don\u0027t want children taken away from parents. And when you prosecute the parents for coming in illegally, which should happen, you have to take the children away.\u0027\u0027Now, we don\u0027t have to prosecute them. But then we\u0027re not prosecuting them for coming in illegally. That\u0027s not good,\u0027 he added.The president said then that he\u0027d be championing legislation to make sure that families that are flooding the border from Central America are not being separated as he lit into lawyers for migrants and judges he claimed are abusing the system.\u0027We want a great country. We want a country with heart,\u0027 Trump said. \u0027But when people come up, they have to know they\u0027re not going to get in. Otherwise it will never stop.\u0027 Vice President Mike Pence was coincidentally meeting at the White House on Wednesday afternoon with the Honduran president. A White House official suggested to DailyMail.com just before the meeting that Trump was just saber-rattling and had not actually requested that the aid be cut off.The official said, \u0027No decisions have been made on that at this time.\u0027 The president has repeatedly said that doesn\u0027t like that children are being separated from their legal guardians- even though it\u0027s a policy that was implemented by his administration.\u0027We can\u0027t let people pour in. They\u0027ve gotta go through the process,\u0027 he stated Tuesday. \u0027And maybe it\u0027s politically correct or maybe it\u0027s not - we\u0027ve gotta stop separation of the families.\u0027Standing his ground then, Trump said, \u0027But politically correct or not, we have to be a country that needs security, that needs safety, that has to be protected.\u0027 \u0027And remember, these countries that we give tremendous foreign aid to in many cases, they send these people up, and they\u0027re not sending their finest.\u0027  The president rejected Democratic demands that the country hire more judges to adjudicate the cases of legitimate asylum seekers faster as part of the solution.\u0027I don\u0027t want to try people. I don\u0027t want people coming in,\u0027 he asserted. They\u0027re \u0027posing as families\u0027! Homeland security chief says...\u0027That\u0027s the law and that\u0027s what the Democrats gave us!\u0027...Share this articleTrump said the ease of entry has led to a 1,700 percent increase in asylum claims. \u0027They game the system. They game it. It\u0027s so easy for them. They\u0027re smart. They didn\u0027t go to the Wharton School of Finance,\u0027 he said, name-checking his alma mater, \u0027but you know what. They\u0027re really smart.\u0027 Trump pounded Democrats for refusing to back his immigration agenda, which he said earlier in the day was allowing violent criminals \u0027to pour into and infest our Country, like MS-13,\u0027 a violent illegal immigrant gang.   \u0027They don\u0027t want to give it, because Democrats love open borders. Let the whole world come in. Let the whole world. MS-13 gang members from all over the place, come on in -- we have open borders,\u0027 he said.\u0027And they view that possibly intelligently, except that it\u0027s destroying our country. They view that as potential voters. Someday they\u0027re going to vote for Democrats. Because they can\u0027t win on their policies, which are horrible. They found that out in the last presidential election.\u0027            Immigrant children are led by staff in single file between tents at a detention facility next to the Mexican border in Tornillo, Texas          A view from Mexico of the US Customs and Boarder Protection is housing underage people caught illegally entering the United States at the Tornillo Port of Entry in Guadalupe Bravos          US Border Patrol agents patrol the bed of the Rio Grand in front of where the US Customs and Boarder Protection is housing underage people          Locals walk along the Mexico side of the U.S.-Mexico border in Tijuana          A remark on Tuesday about crime-committing illegals that \u0027infest\u0027 the U.S. immediately stoked controversy, with the president\u0027s detractors saying the blanket description was not only wrong but inhumane. Another incident earlier this year caused outrage when the president called gangster immigrants \u0027animals\u0027 in another statement his critics cast as incendiary.  The White House has spent the past week fighting with Democrats accusing theTrump administration of exploiting migrant families instead of taking an expected post-Singapore Kim summit victory lap.Each side has condemned the other for using children as \u0027pawns\u0027 in a raging illegal immigration debate.     A view of inside U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) detention facility shows detainees inside fenced areas at Rio Grande Valley Centralized Processing Center in Rio Grande City, Texas, U.S., June 17, 2018.

Rashan Charles\u0027 father Esa, left, at a vigil last year where he called for peace in the midst of the cry for answers          Mr Charles died in hospital in the early hours of July 22 last year shortly after he was chased by an officer into a shop in Dalston, east London, and tackled to the ground before being restrainedThe Met Police constable who detained Mr Charles, known only as BX47, has been on restricted duties, the force said.He told the inquest how he had feared Mr Charles had a weapon, having chased him into the shop after he was seen running from a dark-coloured Ford Focus which he believed was suspicious.He said that following a struggle he used a \u0027seatbelt\u0027 hold to take Mr Charles to the floor where he then tried to get him to open his mouth, first by pressing his jaw and then by pushing on his abdomen.Under questioning, the officer said he did not follow parts of his first aid training when dealing with the incident and admitted he probably should have called for an ambulance sooner.          The incident sparked protests in London with furious people calling for answers in the wake of Mr Charles\u0027 death Asked why he had not asked Mr Charles if he was choking, or deemed him to be an immediate medical emergency and called an ambulance, BX47 said: \u0027That would probably be that I was not aware he was choking.\u0027He was not exhibiting the signs I would have been looking for, which all made the situation harder to gauge.\u0027His fellow officer, who was referred to only as BX48, said she arrived on the scene shortly after BX47 had called for back-up and found Mr Charles was still breathing and had a pulse.The qualified police medic, who is working on full duties, said she would not have done anything differently, after using an oropharyngeal airway - a plastic tube - to try and help Mr Charles breathe before starting CPR.The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) took no further action against one officer after considering a common assault charge following a referral from the IOPC.Mr Charles\u0027 family said they have asked the CPS to review the decision. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/20/17/4D548C0800000578-5866269-Yoga_has_surged_dramatically_in_popularity_across_Western_nation-a-41_1529512477752.jpg","title":"International Yoga Day 2018 need know","story":"    International Yoga Day was established by the United Nations back in December 2014 to promote awareness of the ancient practice and recognize its contributions across the worldWhat is International Yoga Day?International Yoga Day is a global event that raises awareness throughout the world of the benefits of practicing yoga.The idea for International Yoga Day was first proposed by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his 2014 United Nations General Assembly address.Modi stated: ‘Yoga is an invaluable gift of India\u0027s ancient tradition.

The boatneck is also a favourite of Meghan\u0027s, memorably worn during the Trooping the Colour this month.Meghan also opted for Givenchy with the caped dress she wore for her outing with the Queen in Cheshire earlier this month.

She is pictured in August 1964 in Ireland with her father Meghan\u0027s parents, Doria Ragland and Thomas Markle, orced in 1988 after nine years of marriage, when she was just six years old.\u0027It was the late Seventies when my parents met,\u0027 she wrote in a 2015 article for Elle magazine. \u0027My dad was a lighting director for a soap opera and my mum was a temp at the studio.\u0027Though she has never spoken about her parents\u0027 orce, it was thought to be amicable, with Thomas leaving a bouquet of flowers outside Doria\u0027s Los Angeles home ahead of their daughter\u0027s wedding last month.Audrey, too, came from a broken home, with parents from very different walks of life. Her father, Joseph Ruston, was born in Austria-Hungary and worked for a trading company, while her mother, Ella van Heemstra, was a Dutch noblewoman.Audrey was six — the same age as Meghan — when her father left the family and moved to London, a sudden departure she described as \u0027the most traumatic event of my life.\u0027          Meghan started her charity work at a young age, volunteering at an LA soup kitchen from the age of 17. Since then, she\u0027s lent her star power to several international charities, including One Young World and UN Women (trip pictured)          Similarly, Audrey turned her hand to humanitarian work, becoming a goodwill ambassador for Unicef and going on trips to Ethiopia (pictured), Vietnam and SomaliaAudrey married actor Mel Ferrer in 1954, just eight months after meeting him at a cocktail party. Their son, Sean, was born in 1960 — but the marriage was far from happy.Rumours swirled about Mel\u0027s controlling behaviour and Audrey\u0027s mother hated him, calling him a \u0027frog-faced delinquent\u0027.After 14 years together, the pair orced in 1968. Audrey met her second husband, psychiatrist Andrea Dotti, on a cruise that summer. They married the following January, and their son, Luca, was born in 1970. This marriage lasted 13 years.Meghan has also been married before — to TV producer Trevor Engelson, whom she wed in a Jamaican beach ceremony in 2011.But their long-distance relationship — Meghan lived in Toronto, while Trevor was based in Los Angeles — became impossible to sustain and they separated after two years and orced in 2013.According to royal biographer Andrew Morton, Meghan returned her rings to Trevor by post.

Ms Markle, 36, once pictured a book about Hepburn on her Instagram (pictured)Though Meghan\u0027s career on the small screen (she starred in legal drama Suits from 2011 to 2016) was successful, her film roles were rather less triumphant.Over the years she\u0027s had bit-parts in several turkeys — including 2005 rom-com A Lot Like Love and 2011 comedy Horrible Bosses.And even Audrey wasn\u0027t immune to a box office flop. Her 1964 film, Paris When It Sizzles, was uniformly panned. Bloodline, in 1979, was reviewed as \u0027the worst film of the year\u0027.As the Mail recently revealed, Meghan has a dazzling diamond collection, worth an estimated £1 million. Audrey, too, adored diamonds, famously sporting the 128-carat Tiffany Yellow Diamond in publicity for the 1961 film Breakfast At Tiffany\u0027s.Even Meghan\u0027s pre-Harry jewellery box echoed Audrey\u0027s taste, with her penchant \u0027stackable\u0027 rings mirroring Audrey\u0027s.

There is strong evidence it increases loneliness and can speed up major health conditions such as dementia.It is most common in the elderly and is expected to affect 13 million people – a fifth of the population – by 2035.The guidelines note that the psychological, financial and health burden of hearing loss can be reduced by prompt and accurate referral, assessment and with proper management.NICE says care currently offered to those with hearing difficulties varies widely. Many face delays in having their hearing loss identified and managed.In October 2015 North Staffordshire Clinical Commissioning Group stopped handing out hearing aids to those with mild hearing loss and limited provision for those with moderate hearing loss.          Doctors should be giving out hearing aids quickly, instead of waiting for \u0027arbitrary thresholds\u0027 according to health watchdog NICEMother-of-two, 40, stabbed and bit her deaf girlfriend and...Elderly woman with dementia is found dead in a power plant...Share this articleOverall just one third of those who could benefit from hearing aids are thought to have them, with many given only one device despite needing two.The guidelines state that they should be offered to any adult whose hearing loss affects their ability to communicate and enjoy music.Patients with hearing loss in both ears should always be offered two devices, the document adds.Around two-fifths – 38.4 per cent – of over-50s and almost two-thirds – 63.8 per cent – of over-70s have moderate hearing loss.          Hearing aids will be given to 13million people by 2035, according to NICE. New guidelines will be enacted in the UKIt costs the NHS £390 on average for all of a person’s appointments, two hearing aids and repairs for three years.Campaigners say rationing the devices is a false economy as treatments further down the line cost far more.The guidance also tells doctors to advise patients not to clean their ears with cotton buds as this can damage the ear and push wax further in.NICE instead recommends ‘ear irrigation’, which involves a machine pumping water into the ear at a controlled pressure to remove problem wax. This can be done at GP surgeries and community clinics.Paul Breckell, chief executive of Action on Hearing Loss, said: ‘We campaigned for the existence of a NICE guideline on hearing loss and the recent publication is hugely welcome, as is their clear acknowledgement that treatment must be based on need and not on arbitrary and often misleading hearing thresholds.‘NICE has stated in the strongest possible terms that hearing aids – the only available treatment for the majority of those living with hearing loss – should be provided to all who need them and that restricting provision raises serious questions of inequality of access.’ "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/21/00/4D778E0700000578-0-image-a-32_1529538516379.jpg","title":"Philip Hammond described morally reprehensible two year delay gambling crackdown","story":"    A cross-party group of MPs has written to Chancellor Philip Hammond to condemn the decision as ‘indefensible\u0027Philip Hammond was described as ‘morally reprehensible’ last night after it emerged there would be a two-year delay in cracking down on addictive gambling machines in bookies.Last month ministers pledged that the maximum stake on fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs) would be slashed from £100 to £2.But campaigners are furious after being told the change will not take place until April 2020.Punters can bet £100 every 20 seconds on the machines, which have been nicknamed the crack cocaine of gambling. As a result, they can lose thousands of pounds in a single session.Now a cross-party group of MPs has written to Chancellor Mr Hammond to condemn the decision as ‘indefensible’.The All-Party Parliamentary Group on Fixed-Odds Betting Terminals has also launched an inquiry and demanded that the policy come into force next April.Its chairman, Labour MP Carolyn Harris, told Mr Hammond: ‘When the harm being caused by FOBTs to families and communities is taken into account, this proposal to delay implementation by two years is indefensible.‘It is now 600 days since the Government began consulting on this issue, and over £3billion has been lost, often by the most vulnerable in our society.‘Day after day we all receive tragic letters from people and families whose lives have been devastated by the addictive nature of these machines.‘They do no good to people’s lives or communities, they are purely a further means of bookmakers profiteering from the poor and vulnerable. This cannot go on.’          Punters can bet £100 every 20 seconds on the machines, which have been nicknamed the crack cocaine of gamblingThe letter is also signed by former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith, the group’s vice-chairman, and has the support of 30 other MPs and Peers.It came after the group met junior Treasury minister Robert Jenrick, who gave them the details of the timetable.Crackdown on fixed-odds betting terminals where ministers...Campaigners blast Gambling Commission for allowing players...Fury as ministers appear to back away from plans to set a £2...Eric lost so much on \u0027crack cocaine\u0027 betting machines he...Share this articleThe Treasury was opposed to cutting the maximum stake over fears that it would hit tax revenues. A deal was agreed to raise other gambling taxes to cover the difference.Following the meeting, Mrs Harris revealed that ‘remote gaming duty’ – a tax on online gambling firms – would be increased from April next year to cover any drop in tax income from bookmakers.           As a result, they can lose thousands of pounds in a single sessionShe claimed it was ‘morally reprehensible’ that the Government was ‘propping up its finances through taking revenue from FOBTs’.She added: ‘It is important not to forget that the bookmakers make £1.8billion each year from these machines. It is clearly in their interests to delay implementation for as long as possible.’Mrs Harris told the Mail she was ‘furious’ about the delay, adding: ‘I think there was a deal done, and I’m not prepared to stand by and watch this happen.’Since Labour’s Gambling Act was introduced in 2005, the number of FOBTs has increased from 20,000 to nearly 35,000. Each one generates an average income of £50,000 a year for bookmakers.The Mail is campaigning against the toll of gambling on society.          However, the machines are blamed for increasing levels of gambling addiction, crime, debt, violence and family breakdown.Those who use them most are also concentrated in some of Britain’s poorest communities.Ministers said the industry needed ‘sufficient time’ to make the ‘technological changes’ needed to reduce the stake.A Government spokesman said: ‘We are changing the rules so they balance the needs of vulnerable people, those who gamble responsibly and people who work in this sector. \u0027But we must get this right, and are engaging with the industry to ensure it has sufficient time to implement these technological changes.’"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/21/00/4D75F5BF00000578-0-image-a-2_1529538869633.jpg","title":"Go figure Stonehenge built using Pythagoras theorem","story":"    The builders of Britain’s ancient stone circles are said to have used complex geometric rules, according to a new book          The authors of Megalith say that one of Stonehenge’s earliest incarnations, dating from 2750BC, includes a stone rectangle which forms a perfect Pythagorean triangle when split in halfSummer Solstice: All you need to knowTraffic snarls up in New York even more than usual as people...Share this article    The book was published to coincide with today’s summer solstice.

Pictured: The Lewis home But giving evidence, Mrs Fenton steadfastly denied doctoring the plan to her Grade-II listed home and said, as far as she is concerned, the wall is all hers.\u0027Of course it\u0027s my wall, it\u0027s always been my wall,\u0027 she told Central London County Court.\u0027I was transferred a house with four walls. No one since 1969 has ever suggested to me that I have a house with a party wall.\u0027I didn\u0027t do it. I\u0027m absolutely sure that I have never made alterations to anything. To be accused of altering documents, I\u0027m astounded.\u0027I am being castigated here. I have been harassed by this man (Mr Lewis) for years.\u0027The neighbours have been at loggerheads since the late 1990s when the Lewises moved into the street, which is close to Abbey Road studios.Both neighbours were friendly with McCartney, with a judge in an earlier hearing describing Mrs Fenton\u0027s relationship with the Beatle as \u0027excellent\u0027.However, the relationship between the Lewises and Mrs Fenton has been less cordial, with arguments dating back to their first years living next door.          They are neighbours with Paul McCartney and are friendly with him, with a judge in an earlier hearing describing Mrs Fenton\u0027s relationship with the Beatle as \u0027excellent\u0027. Pictured: McCartney\u0027s home Mrs Fenton lost a case brought against her by her neighbours in 2005 over her installation of fence panels on the shared garden wall.She won the next battle in 2015 when a judge ordered the Lewises to remove a roof from which water had flowed from their extension onto Mrs Fenton\u0027s property.They have since taken down the roof, but now plan to build an enlarged structure, which they say would finally solve the rainwater problem.Last year, an independent surveyor issued a Party Wall Award, which authorises them to raise the boundary wall to build their extension.But that only led the neighbours back to court, as Mrs Fenton launched her challenge to the surveyor\u0027s decision.  Sir Paul\u0027s home is separated from the two homes and is not involved Her barrister, Stuart Frame, claims that the Party Wall Award should be overturned as the wall in question is not actually shared.\u0027It is Mrs Fenton\u0027s case that the works authorised by the award cannot be executed due to the fact that the configuration of the walls in the immediate vicinity of the proposed works are not as assumed by the surveyor making the award,\u0027 he said.Mr and Mrs Lewis say their neighbour should not be allowed to argue that the wall is hers alone, claiming she agreed informally through solicitors 21 years ago that the boundary runs down the middle of the wall.She then stood by \u0027in silence\u0027 while the original extension was built off the wall, Mr Rainey told Judge Nicholas Parfitt.Much of her case also referred to the plan which contains the allegedly fraudulent annotations, indicating that Mrs Fenton owns the whole wall.\u0027The current proposed extension is by way of compliance with the order in 2015, requiring Mr and Mrs Lewis to replace the roof of their extension,\u0027 said Mr Rainey.\u0027The judge was told that if the roof had to come off, the opportunity would be taken to build the additional storey.\u0027Mrs Fenton has done everything in her power, including issuing these proceedings, to interfere with Mr and Mrs Lewis\u0027 attempts to comply with that order.\u0027The judge reserved his decision on the case until a later date."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/20/19/4D394C2C00000578-5865695-image-m-3_1529519145632.jpg","title":"Hungary approves STOP Soros law defying EU rights groups","story":"    Hungary Prime Minister Viktor Orban, above, has drummed up support for his tough measures on immigrationLawyers and activists risk being thrown in jail for a year if they help asylum seekers settle in Hungary after a tough new law was passed.A raft of bills was approved by Hungary\u0027s parliament today (Wednesday), which criminalises some help given to illegal immigrants.Under the new law, officially called \u0027STOP Soros\u0027, people or groups who help migrants submit requests for asylum, or who help illegal migrants gain status to stay in Hungary, when they are not entitled to protection, will be liable to a prison term.The controversial legislation was named after George Soros, as it targets several organisations funded by the billionaire philanthropist, and the parliament has accused him of supporting Muslim migrants.But the move defies the European Union and human rights groups, and narrows the scope for action by non-governmental organisations (NGOs).Prime Minister Viktor Orban has been a vocal critic of German Chancellor Angela Merkel\u0027s open-door migrant policy and has led eastern European opposition to EU quotas that aimed to distribute asylum seekers around the bloc.          Prime Minister Viktor Orban has accused George Soros, above, of encouraging mass immigration to undermine Europe – a charge Soros deniesHis right-wing Fidesz party tightened its grip on parliament in an April election fought on a fiercely anti-immigration platform that demonised US billionaire Soros and liberal NGOs he backs.  Orban accuses Soros of encouraging mass immigration to undermine Europe – a charge Soros denies.Interior Minister Sandor Pinter wrote in an attempt to justify the toughened stance: \u0027The Hungarian people rightfully expects the government to use all means necessary to combat illegal immigration and the activities that aid it.          Prime Minister Viktor Orban, above, has been a vocal critic of German Chancellor Angela Merkel\u0027s open-door migrant policy\u0027The STOP Soros package of bills serves that goal, making the organisation of illegal immigration a criminal offence. We want to use the bills to stop Hungary from becoming a country of immigrants.\u0027The Parliament, where Fidesz has a two-thirds majority, also passed a constitutional amendment stating that an \u0027alien population\u0027 cannot be settled in Hungary – a swipe at Brussels over its quota plan.Immigration has become a major concern for voters across the European Union, helping to propel anti-migrant populists to power in Italy and Austria and threatening to fracture Merkel\u0027s three-month-old coalition in Germany.US becomes top global destination for asylum seekers,...Europe is facing a migrant \u0027catastrophe\u0027 to rival the 2015...Share this articleOrban has drummed up support for his tough measures by exploiting Hungarians\u0027 memories of the large numbers of mostly Muslim migrants fleeing conflicts in the Middle East who surged into the country in the summer of 2015.The vast majority of them moved on to wealthier western European countries, but Orban has branded the migrants a threat to Europe\u0027s Christian civilisation and built a border fence along Hungary\u0027s southern borders to deter more from coming.STATISTICS Hungarian statistics show 3,555 refugees living in Hungary, a country of 10 million, as of April. Only 342 people were registered as asylum seekers in the first four months of this year, mostly from the Middle East, and 279 were approved.The Hungarian Helsinki Committee, a rights group that often represents migrants, said on Wednesday the narrowing definition of who counts as a refugee essentially means nobody entering Hungary by land would be entitled to such treatment.          Orban has also tightened state control over the media, major business sectors and the courts since taking power in 2010\u0027Instead of giving protection against persecution, the Hungarian government has decided to join the ranks of the persecutors,\u0027 Helsinki Committee Co-Chair Marta Pardavi said. The Orban government expects possible legal action by the European Commission, the EU\u0027s executive arm, over the new law.Two leading European rights bodies, the Council of Europe and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), have criticised Hungary\u0027s new law as \u0027arbitrary\u0027 and vague and said it contravenes European law.          Budapest: Hungary\u0027s parliament has defied the European Union and human rights groupsThe Venice Commission, an expert body at the Council of Europe, had asked Hungary to refrain from approving the new law until a report it co-authored with the OSCE is published.Orban has also tightened state control over the media, major business sectors and the courts since taking power in 2010.In other constitutional changes approved on Wednesday, parliament agreed to set up a new judicial branch for administrative cases that critics say may increase political influence over judges. Another change narrowed the right to free expression and assembly."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/20/16/4D5F9AEE00000578-5865805-image-a-117_1529507428944.jpg","title":"Core Grenfell cladding panels burned hot flaming petrol turned fiery droplets","story":"    The core of Grenfell cladding panels burned as hot as flaming petrol and turned into fiery droplets, raining down from the tower blaze, an expert told an inquiry todayThe inquiry was told that a range of flammable materials had been strapped around Grenfell Tower during a refurbishment in 2016. Professor Bisby spoke at the hearing at Holborn Bars in central London about the flammable cladding panels, also referred to as cassettes. The cladding panels were described in expert analyses as the main source of the fire\u0027s spread last summer. The professor explained that the cladding panel core was made from polyethylene, which is \u0027a highly flammable, synthetic thermoplastic polymer.\u0027He added: \u0027Upon exposure to heat, polyethylene will melt and drip, possibly flowing while burning or generating flaming droplets.\u0027 In addition to the flammable cladding, voids ran vertically from the fourth floor  to the tower\u0027s crown at certain points in the cladding system.The Reynobond 55PE panels, which shrouded the cladding core in aluminium, formed the outer shell of the cladding system, with a cavity sitting between it and the insulation.     The inquiry was told that a range of flammable materials had been strapped around Grenfell Tower during a refurbishment in 2016The professor said: \u0027To form the product into rainscreen cassettes, flat sheets of the material are cut and folded.\u0027Displaying a picture of a \u0027typical\u0027 cladding panel taken from Grenfell Tower after the fire, he continued: \u0027This image is showing the back of a typical rainscreen cassette, by which I mean it is showing the face of the cassette that would have been looking into the ventilated rainscreen cladding.\u0027The black areas in this image therefore present surfaces of polyethylene that would be directly exposed to any flame or heat within the cladding cavity, should a fire penetrate by essentially any means into the cladding system.\u0027 Professor Bisby continued: \u0027You will no doubt have noted the commentary in the media comparing the polyethylene within the rainscreen cassette at Grenfell Tower with petrol or diesel this is likely to be on the basis that the heats of combustion of petrol or diesel are similar to the PE used in Reynobond PE (aluminium composite material) products.Ministers say they will ban combustible cladding on...Dramatic moment firefighters battled blaze in fourth-floor...Grenfell cladding banned and \u0027was unlawful\u0027 on tragic tower...Work on exposed gas pipes at Grenfell Tower should have...Share this article\u0027It\u0027s perhaps worth reiterating here, however, that the heat of combustion is only one of the important parameters dictating how a material will burn.\u0027The probe previously heard that the fire last June escaped into the external face of the building after eating through the flammable material which lined the windows of Flat 16, on the fourth floor.The window boards surrounding the frames were made of uPVC, the expert said - a material which promotes the spread of fire less than other polymers, but which will soften at a lower heat.Prof Bisby continued: \u0027This is significant, highly significant in my view, in the context of Grenfell Tower because, as I\u0027ve already explained, uPVC window boards form the initial barrier for flames to prevent fire spread from the kitchen of Flat 16 into the cladding cavity beside the kitchen window.\u0027          Survivors of the Grenfell Tower fire claim that a culture of \u0027incompetence and indifference\u0027 towards social housing tenants continuesMr Daffarn - who leads advocacy group Grenfell United - was one of a number of representatives of victims of the fire who addressed MPs over their treatment at the hands of the council and the ongoing issues survivors face.When asked if he thought that residents in social housing felt they were being treated as second-class citizens, he replied: \u0027There is definitely a group of people in the RBKC that get treated very differently from another group in RBKC.\u0027That feeling of being treated with indifference and contempt is just an overriding feeling - we are a year down the line and there are still a significant amount of people living in hotels. It beggars belief.\u0027He continued: \u0027The properties that were bought by RBKC were bought without a fire risk assessment being carried out.\u0027When residents were shown the properties, they weren\u0027t told that they hadn\u0027t been fire risk assessed.\u0027Mr Daffarn said the lack of fire risk assessment was just one example of social housing tenants being treated with indifference by RBKC.He blamed the toxic relationship between RBKC and its tenants on a \u0027cabal\u0027 of senior officers for systematically asset-stripping the borough because it was a \u0027gold mine\u0027.He added: \u0027RBKC (council) was a property development company masquerading as a local authority.\u0027They failed to keep us safe because they had higher priorities - the priorities were getting us off the land.\u0027The tenant management organisation in charge of the tower has now been dissolved, but Mr Daffarn voiced his concern that a number of its officers had simply been absorbed into the employment of the council.          Kensington and Chelsea Council leader Elizabeth Campbell and chief executive Barry Quirk arrive at Portcullis House in Westminster, London\u0027What are the council doing to monitor the performance of the council that came from Kensington and Chelsea Tennant Management Organisation?\u0027 he asked.Jacqui Haynes, chairwoman of the Lancaster West Residents Association, said: \u0027This is years of disempowerment, years of being looked upon as if we don\u0027t matter.\u0027We have been suffering this level of service, this kind of treatment for years -decades.\u0027It\u0027s just because this disaster happened that it blew up in their (the council\u0027s) faces and they realised that it can\u0027t continue.\u0027Mr Daffarn criticised the Government for failing to place the council into special measures immediately after the fire.\u0027There\u0027s a vast chasm between the council and the community which at the least will take many, many years to rebuild,\u0027 he said.RBKC chief executive Barry Quirk - who was appointed in the aftermath of the disaster - said they were now examining council staff\u0027s \u0027cultural competencies\u0027 and not just their experience, and that the £50 million budget allocated to help survivors of the fire matched that of the children\u0027s social services department.\u0027Turning around an organisation like (RBKC) does take time and we need to evaluate the competencies of managers, we need to change some frontline staff and we need to monitor delivery,\u0027 he said.Council leader Elizabeth Campbell thanked the victims for the way they have treated councillors in the wake of the fire.\u0027I think the way survivors and bereaved have treated us is nothing short of amazing - there has been unbelievable generosity of spirit,\u0027 she said.\u0027If my child had died, would I be talking to the council like that? The answer is probably not.\u0027Both Ms Campbell and Mr Quirk said they were committed to reforming attitudes within the council, but Mr Quirk estimated it would be many years before he was satisfied with the levels of empathy among staff for social housing tenants."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/20/18/4D739BFC00000578-5866063-The_43_year_old_was_brought_crashing_to_the_floor_as_lunchtime_s-a-5_1529514872776.jpg","title":"Take Dramatic moment hero tackles thief swiped 170 cash woman","story":"    A man rugby tackle the suspected thief in Manchester\u0027s bustling Market Street amid claims that a woman had £170 stolen from her           The 43-year-old was brought crashing to the floor as lunchtime shoppers and commuters looked on in amazement           Police this afternoon confirmed that a man is being questioned on suspicion of theft but the woman is understood to have had her money returned Revealed: Gangs are selling your bank details and passwords...Car-theft kit for sale on Amazon: How web giants are...Share this articleOfficers later confirmed a suspect was being questioned on suspicion of theft.

We’re also wanting to go through Congress. We will be going through Congress. We’re working on a much more comprehensive bill,\u0027 he said. \u0027And ultimately, we want to see it done right, and it will be done right.\u0027 Of the order he\u0027d just signed, he said, \u0027You\u0027re gonna have a lot of happy people.\u0027 \u0027People haven\u0027t dealt with it, and we are dealing with it...This is one that has gone on for many decades. So we\u0027re keeping families together, and this will solve that problem,\u0027 he stated.\u0027At the same time, we are keeping a very powerful border and it continues to be a zero-tolerance,\u0027 he added. \u0027We have zero tolerance for people that enter our country illegally.\u0027As Trump acknowledged, he did not end the \u0027zero tolerance\u0027 provision of his policy that requires the prosecution of all unlawful immigrants as criminals. His order merely authorizes DHS to hold families together while prosecution is pending. DHS will bear the costs of constructing facilities to house migrant parents and their children while their cases are being adjudicated. The order directs the attorney general to prioritize the cases as quickly as possible.Trump also told Attorney General Jeff Sessions to put in a request with a U.S. District Court in California to modify a settlement agreement that would permit DHS under present resource constraints to detain illegal immigrant families together \u0027throughout the pendency of criminal proceedings for improper entry or any removal or other immigration proceedings.\u0027 The president tipped his hand earlier on Wednesday when he said that he would be signing something dealing with the issue as he spoke to reporters in the Cabinet room.\u0027I\u0027m going to be signing an executive order in a little while before I go to Minnesota but, at the same time,\u0027 Trump said. \u0027I think you have to understand, we\u0027re keeping families together, but we have to keep our borders strong. We will be overrun with crime and with people that should not be in our country.\u0027 His Department of Homeland Security secretary was said to be drafting an order to end the child separation policy that\u0027s become a political albatross for the Trump administration.           President Donald Trump first revealed his plans to sign an executive order addressing family separation during a meeting earlier today with lawmakers          The Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirsjen Nielsen was earlier said to be drafting an order to end the child separation policy that\u0027s become a political albatross for the Trump administrationDHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen was at the White House on Wednesday morning and was by the president\u0027s side in the afternoon, standing opposite to the vice president, when he took the executive action. \u0027I just thank you for your leadership, sir. We look forward and expect the House to act this week. We ask them to do their job,\u0027 she said minutes before making a trip of her own to Capitol Hill. \u0027The laws need to be changed. This is a problem that President after President has dealt with for decades. This one is willing to stand up and fix it. We ask Congress to do their part.\u0027Ivanka and Melania Trump were also present at the afternoon signing just before he left the White House for Minnesota. The about-face came hours after the president publicly racheted his attacks on Democrats opposing his immigration agenda via Twitter.It also followed a press conference on Capitol Hill where  House Speaker Paul Ryan at which the GOP leader refused to entertain the prospect of a stand-alone bill to handle family separation.Ryan did not know about the executive order at the time, a person familiar with the situation told DailyMail.com, and was at the White House on Wednesday at the president\u0027s invitation to discuss immigration legislation he is about to bring up for a vote in the House.The GOP leader was at the White House with a group of roughly 25 lawmakers who DailyMail.com\u0027s source described as on the fence. Even with Trump\u0027s forthcoming executive order, Congress will still have to take the lead in making the policy shift permanent.\u0027It doesn\u0027t take away the fact that this needs to be changed into law at some point,\u0027 the person said. \u0027The courts could challenge what the president does in terms of executive action.\u0027 The president\u0027s U-turn came at an immediate cost to Members of Congress, who had been looking forward to a summer picnic at the White House on Thursday.President Trump said during a surprise media avail on Wednesday morning that he was cancelling the event.\u0027I do want to say that, because we\u0027re also busy....that we are going to cancel and postpone tomorrow\u0027s congressional picnic,\u0027 he stated.Trump met yesterday on Capitol Hill with GOP lawmakers to talk about a broad range of issues. He hosted two sets of legislators at the White House on Wednesday.Tomorrow\u0027s picnic would have offered him a chance to speak to the very same Democrats he\u0027s been clobbering for not supporting his immigration agenda. The president who is holding a political rally tonight in Minnesota said he did not think the optics of a festive picnic with legislators and their families would be appropriate. He insinuated that he did not want to reward the opposing party that he\u0027s repeatedly called obstructionist.\u0027I was just walking over to the Oval Office and I said, you know, it doesn\u0027t feel right to have a picnic for Congress when we\u0027re working on doing something very important,\u0027 he stated. \u0027It didn\u0027t feel exactly right to me. We\u0027ll make it another time when things are going extremely well.\u0027   Trump indicated in his Cabinet Room remarks that the images of children at the border in cages and kennels had affected him outlook. \u0027Those images affect everybody,\u0027 he said of the photos that have been dominating the national news since Father\u0027s Day.The president told lawmakers, \u0027The dilemma is that if you\u0027re weak, if you\u0027re weak – which some people would like you to be – if you\u0027re really, really pathetically weak, the country\u0027s going to be overrun with millions of people. And if you\u0027re strong, then you don\u0027t have any heart. That\u0027s a tough dilemma. Perhaps I\u0027d rather be strong, but that\u0027s a tough dilemma.\u0027 Democrats have been pummeling the Trump administration as cruel and inhumane for splitting families up at the border in order to prosecute parents for unlawfully crossing the border.\u0027President Trump and his enablers in Congress have taken these children hostage to try to enact their anti-immigrant agenda into law. Don’t be fooled: this crisis does not need a bill to fix it—it requires the GOP to stand up and call for an end to this monstrous Trump policy,\u0027 Sen. Dick Durbin, a Democratic leader, tweeted.They continued their assault even after Trump signed his order, saying the administration also needed to say how it plans to reunite already-separated children from their families.\u0027Today the American people, through their forceful and justified outrage, proved they can drive change even during the Trump administration. But we must not be fooled: We need to ensure that the 2,500 children already separated are promptly reunited with their families,\u0027 Sen. Patrick Leahy tweeted. Rep. Robin Kelly similarly said, \u0027We can’t let @realDonaldTrump off the hook just for ending his cruel and immoral program. There are still NO plans to reunite 2,300+ children with their families.\u0027 Democratic Congressman Keith Ellison said the directive that Trump did sign \u0027doesn\u0027t fix this mess. \u0027\u0027We shouldn\u0027t be putting kids in cages, with or without their families. And Nielsen must go,\u0027 the former DNC official said, calling for the ousting of the DHS secretary. The order had Rep. Ed Perlmutter and others claiming that it proved Trump \u0027had the authority to stop these inhumane practices all along\u0027 despite what his administration said.   \u0027For weeks @realDonaldTrump claimed only Congress could end this merciless policy. Today’s executive order is an admission both that he lied to America \u0026amp his attempt to hold children hostage has failed because of Americans’ outrage,\u0027 said House Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer.Leahy noted that Trump\u0027s order explicitly does not end the zero tolerance policy for illegal border crossings.\u0027Pres. Trump’s “zero tolerance” policy needs to go. It makes zero sense to delay civil proceedings to criminally prosecute migrants with no records, who pose no threat, and who are only seeking refuge from unimaginable violence and terror in their home countries,\u0027 Leahy said.At his executive order signing, President Trump said he is not backing down and rejected suggestions to the contrary.\u0027No, no, the border is just as tough, but we do want to keep families together. This is a problem. If you look at some of those horrible scenes from a few years ago — to me, they were horrible scenes. They were just terrible. And that was during the Obama administration,\u0027 he said. \u0027Other administrations have had the same thing. We’re keeping the family together. And so this is it.\u0027           DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen went to Capitol Hill to talk to lawmakers after President Trump signed the executive order that needs to be back up by congressional actionPresident Trump said Wednesday that he wants \u0027security for our country, and we will have that.\u0027 \u0027At the same time we have compassion, we want to keep families together. It\u0027s very important,\u0027 he stated. \u0027I\u0027ll be signing something in a little while that\u0027s going to do that.\u0027He noted that Republicans are also working on legislation that meet the same end.\u0027But I\u0027ll be doing something that\u0027s somewhat preemptive but ultimately will be matched by legislation I\u0027m sure.\u0027  His exercise of executive power also flew in the face of Republican complaints about immigration directives put in place by the previous administration - and his own claims last week that he couldn\u0027t end family separation.\u0027You can’t do it through an executive order,\u0027 he told reporters a week ago on Friday.Trump made reference to Obama\u0027s alleged abuse of power today when he brought up Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, claiming that Obama acknowledged he shouldn\u0027t be signing the order and did anyway.\u0027He actually said, I’m not allowed to sign this, never going to hold up,\u0027 Trump said of the program and ongoing litigation. \u0027And they got a judge who held it up, and they got another one who held it up. Then we had a couple that turned it down, and it’s going to be a Supreme Court issue.\u0027The Republican president found himself in a similar bind this week as the opposing party stymied his immigration reform agenda.\u0027We\u0027re having a lot of problems with Democrats that don\u0027t want to vote for anything,\u0027 he said. \u0027They don\u0027t care about lack of security. They really would like to have open borders where anybody in the world can just flow in, including from the Middle East, from anybody anywhere they can just flow into our country. \u0027Tremendous problems with that, tremendous crime caused by that. We\u0027re just not going to do it.\u0027 Trump said in a tweet this morning that Democrats \u0027want open borders which means crime\u0027 as he saddled them with the burden of changing America\u0027s immigration laws, which he said are the \u0027weakest and worst anywhere in the world.\u0027He said in another vague message, whoever, that he is \u0027working on something\u0027 pertaining to immigration without saying what it is.            Immigration reform legislation in Congress was no closer on Wednesday to gaining majority support in the House, even after a closed-door session between Republicans and the president, meetings at the White House and a visit to Capitol Hill by Nielsen.GOP leaders were looking at two pieces of legislation that would fund the president\u0027s border wall, one of which also takes steps to end family separation for Central American migrants.Conservative lawmakers were also crafting a \u0027back-up\u0027 bill that they hoped to sub in if the other two fail. Their bill sets aside most of Trump\u0027s other immigration priorities and deals solely with the detention of children coming across the border in family units.Trump said in a speech Tuesday that he supports a \u0027third option\u0027 and even claimed credit for it.Ryan said at a morning news conference that he was moving forward with the leadership-approved immigration reform bills that were scheduled for a vote tomorrow.The GOP leader refused to entertain questions about stand-alone bills that narrowly deal with the issue of young children being detained in cages and tents while their parents await prosecution for the crime of unlawfully entering the country.\u0027We\u0027re trying to pass this legislation right now. This is very good compromise legislation,\u0027 Ryan told reporters.It solves the border crisis, he claimed, and stabilizes the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, better known as DACA.\u0027And then when other situations arise, whatever the circumstances are, we\u0027ll cross this bridge when it comes to it,\u0027 he asserted.Ryan rejected Democrats\u0027 allegations that the GOP is using the immigrant children as bargaining chips to get more of the president\u0027s immigration priorities passed.\u0027That\u0027s a ridiculous assertion,\u0027 Ryan said as he stormed out, having already deemed it the last question.             Immigration reform legislation was no closer on Wednesday to gaining majority support in the House, however, even after a closed-door session between Republicans and the presidentIn morning tweets in which Trump insisted that Democrats are to blame for family separation because they will not bend to his will, he alluded to the measure again as he said he was \u0027working on something\u0027 that he suggested would change the conversation.\u0027It’s the Democrats fault, they won’t give us the votes needed to pass good immigration legislation,\u0027 he said. \u0027They want open borders, which breeds horrible crime. Republicans want security. But I am working on something - it never ends!\u0027Coming out of the meeting with GOP lawmakers, the White House said that Trump was \u0027100 percent\u0027 behind the two bills House leadership plans to bring up for a vote.Trump reportedly did not talk to lawmakers at all about family separation. Democrats have pummeled the GOP for coupling family separation - a policy introduced in April by the Trump administration - with comprehensive immigration reform.Sen. Chris Van Hollen, head of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, said in a Tuesday email to members, \u0027There is no universe in which forcibly separating now thousands of young children from their parents is acceptable. The practice is an abomination. It’s not part of any solution to fix our immigration system.\u0027Van Hollen said he spent his Father’s Day visiting immigrant detention centers on the border and \u0027there is no doubt that the Trump administration’s family separation policy is cruel and inhumane.\u0027\u0027In McAllen, Texas, I saw a facility people called “the dog kennel” which housed children separated from their mothers and fathers lumped into holding pens made of chain-link fence. It was a disturbing and shameful scene that should have no place in America,\u0027 the Maryland Democrat wrote.House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi similarly wrote in an email on behalf of the lower chamber\u0027s campaign arm: \u0027I have never been more horrified by this President. His choice to separate immigrant children from their mothers at our border is heartless. It’s cruel. It’s immoral. And -- it’s all for political leverage.\u0027 House Homeland Security Chairman Mike McCaul, a Texas Republican, admitted to Fox News on Tuesday after the meeting with the president that family separation was a policy of this president. \u0027The parents are now being prosecuted but we would like to see the family stay together and not separated,\u0027he said. \u0027But I think most importantly from my position as the chairman of homeland security is to have a border security bill passed.\u0027          Unless Congress acts, he said, smugglers and traffickers will continue to sell entry to the United States for for $6,000 a person.\u0027We will never stop this problem until we dry up the deterrent issue and the legal loopholes that existed currently,\u0027 he stated. Even some staunch allies of the president said they couldn\u0027t get behind him when it comes to the detention of families, though. His former lawyer on Wednesday quit the national party as deputy finance chair, citing the president\u0027s border policy and the special counsel investigation. \u0027As the son of a Polish holocaust survivor, the images and sounds of this family separation policy is heart wrenching,\u0027 Cohen said in a resignation letter according to ABC News. \u0027While I strongly support measures that will secure our porous borders, children should never be used as bargaining chips.\u0027First Lady Melania Trump was also said to be lobbying her husband to take action.She has pressed him privately, CNN reported, as well as publicly to address family separation.\u0027Mrs. Trump hates to see children separated from their families and hopes both sides of the aisle can finally come together to achieve successful immigration reform,\u0027 her communications director, Stephanie Grisham, said. \u0027She believes we need to be a country that follows all laws, but also a country that governs with heart.President Trump suggested Tuesday that he could cut down on unlawful migration by ending aid to the Central American countries that he claimed are \u0027sending\u0027migrants to the U.S. as part of his plot to secure the border.Trump said he\u0027d be asking for authorization to end assistance to the region that includes Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras.\u0027We\u0027re not going to give any more aid to those countries,\u0027 he asserted during a Washington, D.C. speech to the National Federation of Independent Business. \u0027Why the hell should we?\u0027   The president told attendees of the conference, \u0027I don\u0027t want children taken away from parents. And when you prosecute the parents for coming in illegally, which should happen, you have to take the children away.\u0027\u0027Now, we don\u0027t have to prosecute them. But then we\u0027re not prosecuting them for coming in illegally. That\u0027s not good,\u0027 he added.The president said then that he\u0027d be championing legislation to make sure that families that are flooding the border from Central America are not being separated as he lit into lawyers for migrants and judges he claimed are abusing the system.\u0027We want a great country. We want a country with heart,\u0027 Trump said. \u0027But when people come up, they have to know they\u0027re not going to get in. Otherwise it will never stop.\u0027 Vice President Mike Pence was coincidentally meeting at the White House on Wednesday afternoon with the Honduran president. A White House official suggested to DailyMail.com just before the meeting that Trump was just saber-rattling and had not actually requested that the aid be cut off.The official said, \u0027No decisions have been made on that at this time.\u0027 The president has repeatedly said that doesn\u0027t like that children are being separated from their legal guardians- even though it\u0027s a policy that was implemented by his administration.\u0027We can\u0027t let people pour in. They\u0027ve gotta go through the process,\u0027 he stated Tuesday. \u0027And maybe it\u0027s politically correct or maybe it\u0027s not - we\u0027ve gotta stop separation of the families.\u0027Standing his ground then, Trump said, \u0027But politically correct or not, we have to be a country that needs security, that needs safety, that has to be protected.\u0027 \u0027And remember, these countries that we give tremendous foreign aid to in many cases, they send these people up, and they\u0027re not sending their finest.\u0027  The president rejected Democratic demands that the country hire more judges to adjudicate the cases of legitimate asylum seekers faster as part of the solution.\u0027I don\u0027t want to try people. I don\u0027t want people coming in,\u0027 he asserted. They\u0027re \u0027posing as families\u0027!

They\u0027re really smart.\u0027 Trump pounded Democrats for refusing to back his immigration agenda, which he said earlier in the day was allowing violent criminals \u0027to pour into and infest our Country, like MS-13,\u0027 a violent illegal immigrant gang.   \u0027They don\u0027t want to give it, because Democrats love open borders. Let the whole world come in. Let the whole world. MS-13 gang members from all over the place, come on in -- we have open borders,\u0027 he said.\u0027And they view that possibly intelligently, except that it\u0027s destroying our country. They view that as potential voters. Someday they\u0027re going to vote for Democrats. Because they can\u0027t win on their policies, which are horrible.

The incident sparked protests in London with furious people calling for answers in the wake of Mr Charles\u0027 death Asked why he had not asked Mr Charles if he was choking, or deemed him to be an immediate medical emergency and called an ambulance, BX47 said: \u0027That would probably be that I was not aware he was choking.\u0027He was not exhibiting the signs I would have been looking for, which all made the situation harder to gauge.\u0027His fellow officer, who was referred to only as BX48, said she arrived on the scene shortly after BX47 had called for back-up and found Mr Charles was still breathing and had a pulse.The qualified police medic, who is working on full duties, said she would not have done anything differently, after using an oropharyngeal airway - a plastic tube - to try and help Mr Charles breathe before starting CPR.The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) took no further action against one officer after considering a common assault charge following a referral from the IOPC.Mr Charles\u0027 family said they have asked the CPS to review the decision. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/20/20/4D74E04A00000578-0-image-m-5_1529522768683.jpg","title":"Guards disastrously tangled Garter Ceremony Windsor","story":"    The troop from \u0027five and-a-half company,\u0027 clad in bearskins and ceremonial regalia, were watched by dozens of onlookers as they desperately tried to get back in line          They were filmed marching outside the castle walls before being ordered to come to a haltIs it a bird?

There is strong evidence it increases loneliness and can speed up major health conditions such as dementia.It is most common in the elderly and is expected to affect 13 million people – a fifth of the population – by 2035.The guidelines note that the psychological, financial and health burden of hearing loss can be reduced by prompt and accurate referral, assessment and with proper management.NICE says care currently offered to those with hearing difficulties varies widely. Many face delays in having their hearing loss identified and managed.In October 2015 North Staffordshire Clinical Commissioning Group stopped handing out hearing aids to those with mild hearing loss and limited provision for those with moderate hearing loss.

Hearing aids will be given to 13million people by 2035, according to NICE. New guidelines will be enacted in the UKIt costs the NHS £390 on average for all of a person’s appointments, two hearing aids and repairs for three years.Campaigners say rationing the devices is a false economy as treatments further down the line cost far more.The guidance also tells doctors to advise patients not to clean their ears with cotton buds as this can damage the ear and push wax further in.NICE instead recommends ‘ear irrigation’, which involves a machine pumping water into the ear at a controlled pressure to remove problem wax. This can be done at GP surgeries and community clinics.Paul Breckell, chief executive of Action on Hearing Loss, said: ‘We campaigned for the existence of a NICE guideline on hearing loss and the recent publication is hugely welcome, as is their clear acknowledgement that treatment must be based on need and not on arbitrary and often misleading hearing thresholds.‘NICE has stated in the strongest possible terms that hearing aids – the only available treatment for the majority of those living with hearing loss – should be provided to all who need them and that restricting provision raises serious questions of inequality of access.’ "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/20/21/4D75EDF400000578-0-image-a-5_1529527724184.jpg","title":"New Zealand PM Jacinda Ardern 37 gives birth child","story":"    \u0027Welcome to our village wee one,\u0027 the New Zealand prime minister posted on Instagram    New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, 37, went into labour with her first child on Thursday morning          The Prime Minister arrived at Auckland City Hospital accompanied by her partner Clarke Gayford on Thursday morning (pictured together)Ms Ardern is the first world leader in nearly 30 years to give birth while in office.Ms Ardern\u0027s office said mother and child are doing well.\u0027I\u0027m sure we\u0027re going through all of the emotions new parents go through, but at the same time feeling so grateful for all the kindness and best wishes from so many people,\u0027 Ms Arden said in a statement.Her office said it would announce later when the family leave the hospital, who are expected to speak to a crowd of reporters, who have been camped outside the hospital since Ms Ardern arrived there early Thursday morning.Ms Ardern was due on June 17. \u0027I hope we don\u0027t find ourselves in Barnaby\u0027s situation\u0027:...\u0027What if I get caught out?\u0027 Pregnant NZ PM Jacinda Ardern...Share this articleThe 37-year-old worked right up until she went into labour on Thursday morning.The New Zealand Government will be led by Winston Peters, 73, for the next six weeks.Ms Ardern assured she would still be on call, and the government would be business as usual. For more than a month, Ms Arden has talked down the significance of her leave, saying she\u0027ll still be receiving briefings and be available for major decisions or to discipline ministers if necessary.\u0027The thing to keep in mind is: I\u0027m not dead,\u0027 she told TVNZ.But while Ms Ardern has been working to assure the nation, Mr Peters has been causing a stir.He lodged a privacy breach lawsuit against a government department the day Ms Ardern left Wellington, recently scuttled a major piece of Labour policy and has attacked the leadership of the country\u0027s largest company.

Even before Donald Trump’s emergence as a presidential candidate, it was clear that the global trend away from authoritarian regimes to democratic ones had slowed down his rise was accompanied by a barrage of authors’ warnings that we are heading back into the 1930s. Never have the last days of Weimar seemed so worthy of study. Historians have developed a nice sideline in self-help manuals for a life of underground resistance to tyranny.David Runciman’s bracingly intelligent new book is both a contribution to this debate and a refutation of it. How Democracy Ends shares the widespread sense that representative democracy is not doing well, but argues powerfully against screaming fascism at every turn. History, as Runciman states at the outset, does not repeat itself. The challenge he sets himself is to use the past to see what has happened to democracy today, in particular to diagnose its ailments, without assuming that the only alternative is the one imprinted on our collective memory.That memory, after all, is a short one. The ancient Greeks may have invented democracy but they felt deeply ambivalent about it, regarding it as just one of the phases in the political cycle. It was not until the start of the 19th century that a democratic wave began to emerge again, in the Americas and briefly in southern Europe, and not until the second half of the 20th that representative democracy in the sense we have known it spread around the world. In that relatively brief  of time, it was fought over by liberals and socialists, rejected – in its “bourgeois” form – by communists, and smothered by dictators who could rarely decide whether what they were doing was superseding or perfecting it. After the second world war, parliamentary democracy got a new lease of life. When the cold war ended, the collapse of the Soviet Union seemed to leave democracy as the only game in town. By the beginning of this century, most political scientists, especially but not only in the US, had come to believe that liberal democracy was the new normal, something to which the entire world should aspire. The crushing of the Arab spring, and the rise of Recep Tayyip Erdoğan in Turkey and Viktor Orbán in Hungary, could be written off as backsliding in polities whose democratic roots were shallow. It was the 2016 US presidential elections that, in a single moment, changed an implausibly rosy (and complacent) outlook, replacing it with an equally implausible pessimism.Runciman says democracy is in a funk, for reasons that go far beyond Trump, but that unless we can stimulate our political imaginations to understand the new ways in which democracies can fail, we will not appreciate the scale of the problem before us. He identifies three contemporary challenges in particular. The first, paradoxically, is that levels of political violence have gone down. This means that, in such places as the US or Europe, democratic failure is not likely to happen in the old-fashioned way, through a military coup d’état. Those will still occur elsewhere, but the stability of democratic institutions suggests it is more likely that democracies will be undermined invisibly, from within.A corollary of this is the spread of conspiracy theories. It becomes harder and harder to detect what is actually happening and to tell the difference between fear and reality. Runciman draws the contrast between the situation in Greece in 1967, when there was a very visible military coup with tanks on the streets of Athens, and 2015, the year of the referendum on whether to accept the European commission’s bailout deal, when some have argued the Greek government caved in the face of what amounted to a silent coup by its European partners. It becomes harder to say what is a real coup d’état and what is normal politics.A second challenge is posed by the way we respond to the existential threats that surround us. In the past, Runciman argues, societies were galvanised by such threats: one need think only of the mass mobilisation that occurred around nuclear disarmament or the international response in the 1970s to rising pollution. World war itself created a sense of collective action but the dwindling of mass conscription makes that unlikely in future. And today people seem paralysed when threatened with global warming or a nuclear accident: the prospect of catastrophe leads not to collective action but passivity.Then there is the impact of the digital revolution, which is undermining democracy in numerous ways. We simply don’t sufficiently understand the impact of current forms of communication and information gathering. The problem with huge corporations such as Facebook is not their malevolence, nor the danger that they might rival states. They are run by people who are principally interested in profits not politics, and they are far less legitimate and more hierarchical than the political systems that govern us. But the modes of communication they encourage make a mockery of democracy for other reasons. They encourage instant gratification when democracy presupposes a capacity for frustration and patience. They encourage a pretence of authenticity, making politicians seem even more fake and contrived. The politicians who flourish are the ones who play along. Populism is the natural condition of democratic politics in the age of Twitter. The most successful democratic politicians are the ones who try to turn parties into social movements – the one thing Trump, Jeremy Corbyn and Emmanuel Macron have in common. The trouble is that this can work for only so long.As one would expect from an analyst of conspiracy theories, Runciman sees the basic problems as rooted not in nasty internet Machiavellians but in good intentions and weak wills. He thinks we can overdo the threat posed by surveillance mechanisms. The real erosion of democracy comes when it falls into the hands of attention-grabbing narcissists who turn it into a constant struggle for advertising space. The problem of the Trump presidency is not that there is an evil plot to take over America it is that nothing is being done to tackle all the very real policy issues confronting the country, as policy-making is drowned out by the frenetic pace of the news cycle. Meanwhile gun violence, the opioid crisis and all the other urgent social ills are ignored.How Democracy Ends is a wonderful read and contains much good sense. It is fond of the contrarian position, overfond perhaps. After all, behind the noise and fury of Twitter-era politics, real struggles of interests are still taking place. But what Runciman captures well is the sense of living in an age in which democracy is taken for granted and thus allowed to disintegrate from within. He goes further: it is not just that it is taken for granted, it is that the “battles are all won”. It is now the preferred political system of elderly populations muddling through, and this is hardly a recipe for restoring democracy’s lustre. If all that holds it in place is the sense that the alternatives are worse, then what happens when people no longer believe this to be the case? • How Democracy Ends is published by Profile.

Shortly after announcing the campaign they pulled it due to backlash. Burger King posted a statement on VK apologizing and said it had removed all materials related to the promotion. However, evidence of the stunt lives on in screenshots. Burger King’s Russia ision has a history of horrific publicity-baiting stunts.

A set of institutions and services designed for a different era now looks threadbare and beyond repair. They can sometimes help us in an emergency, but in many cases, from our health, to work, to care in our old age, they cannot support us to flourish. In recent years, our public services have been devastated by cuts. Invest more money, argue those on the left. Better management, counter those on the right. The truth, I have learned in my work with communities across Britain as a social entrepreneur, is that our troubles run deeper.I don’t think we can fix these systems, but I think we can reinvent them, with human connection at their heart. When people feel supported by strong relationships, change happens. And when we make collaboration and connection feel simple and easy, people want to join in. Yet our welfare state does not try to connect us to one another, despite the abundant\u0026nbsppotential of our relationships. Most of our services – for young and old people alike – are aimed at managing risk and getting by.“A good adolescence? It’s getting through, innit? I’ll get to the other side without a criminal record and stuff,” is how Mo, 19, puts it. But too many people are not making it. Adolescence was a concept that did not exist when the welfare state was designed, and yet today we know that these in–between years are a vital time of\u0026nbspdevelopment and, crucially, that if things went wrong in the early years, adolescence is a second chance. If the help is there.Ten years ago, as part of an effort to understand what young people really needed from services, I rented a bus stacked with pizza and parked at night on London estates and in seaside towns. I hung out on rough ground and, when it rained, I fled with my new friends to the youth centre. I wanted to listen and to think about what could be. What I heard again and again was a hunger for connections, for the relationships needed to get on. Ben wanted to be a chef, Amelia to write. They knew they had little chance. Others like Mo were frustrated and angry. They didn’t want better youth services. They felt imprisoned in youth–only spaces. They wanted to get out. With the young people, I started an experiment. We knocked on doors – of arts centres, workshops, hotels and more. Could they spend time with a young person doing something of shared interest together? “Yes!” came the almost universal reply. “Thank you for asking, we would love to be involved.” And, powered by mobile phones and a website, we invented something new: a way to knit young people back into the communities around them.It was low-cost, so we could include everyone – those who were thriving, those who had the connections and those who needed help and encouragement. Through doing things together – cooking, dancing, making – then meeting up to share experiences, relationships grew between the young people and the adults they got to know. Demeanours changed, possibilities opened up and those who grew came back to help others.This mismatch between the services on offer and the challenges of today goes well beyond adolescence. Most\u0026nbsppeople who are poor today are in work. Almost half\u0026nbspof\u0026nbspBritish families rely on low-paid jobs, dependent\u0026nbspon in–work benefits to survive as they rotate between one precarious job and another. No one wants to live on handouts, but research shows most decent jobs are not advertised.“Get me out of here!” read the poster emblazoned across a false door I hastily erected in a jobcentre. I asked people to cross the threshold and join our effort to\u0026nbspdesign a new approach to finding work and progressing in it. Those out of work know that they will\u0026nbspnot find work in the queue – like those looking to climb the ladder, they need new relationships. But where can they\u0026nbspstart?In modern Britain, we don’t know each other any more. As inequality bites, we live in different neighbourhoods, go to different schools and join different clubs. But social research shows conclusively that it is who we know that will determine the shape of our lives: what work we find, how healthy we can be and, at the end of our lives, what care we will receive.The British welfare state was perhaps the biggest social revolution the world has ever seen. The principles laid out by William Beveridge in 1942 transformed the nation: we were offered healthcare, good education, decent housing and support when out of work or unwell. Just six years after the publication of his bestselling report, Beveridge wrote another pamphlet on voluntary action. In it, he declared he had made a mistake. His welfare state left out people, communities and the bonds between us.In this century, we need new collaborative models that can support us in our current economic transition. The labour movement in Britain was informed by a long history of mutual self–help: the work of Octavia Hill, Samuel Smiles, the co–operatives and the new forms of organising found within communities and the unions. Today, we need to start where Beveridge left off and learn again from this history and from the work that is growing across Britain. The approaches I am describing are all around us, but they are marginal and often have to work in spite of our formal welfare systems. We need to invest in the new and move it to the centre ground. We must create a new framework that better supports us collectively to expand our capabilities and address both the internal feelings and the external structural realities that hold us back. Some 70 years ago, we created a transformation out of the ruins of war and the economic depression that preceded it. We can do this again – if we start in the right\u0026nbspplace, in people’s lives. Beveridge did not reinvent\u0026nbspfrom scratch. Instead, he told a powerful story\u0026nbspof what could be and developed a new structure within which good things that already existed could grow, and other things could be transformed. We can and must do the same.• Hilary Cottam is a social activist and the author of Radical Help"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b14a4942b3cd95129f6725307bd80e7a5892f8ff/0_503_2700_1620/master/2700.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4dd14a2aa0a5887e957aa2328c5ea240","title":"jacinda ardern shows that no doors are closed for women","story":"New Zealand is breaking new ground with a prime minister giving birth and her partner becoming a stay-at-home father The birth of Jacinda Ardern’s baby is first and foremost a time of great happiness for Jacinda and her partner, Clarke Gayford. Their daughter is very much a wanted child for these happy parents.But for the public in New Zealand and beyond, the new arrival in our country’s first family also has considerable significance.Ardern becomes only the second serving second prime minister in history to give birth. As well, she is not married to her partner.Conventional wisdom may have said that this combination of factors would not have been helpful to a political career at the highest level. Fortunately, that has proved to be wrong.Ardern is a remarkable woman who crashes through glass ceilings with apparent ease. She became leader of the New Zealand Labour party and of the opposition a mere seven weeks before last September’s general election. In that short time, she took her party out of a near death zone of low polling to a highly credible election result, and then through the successful coalition negotiations which resulted in her becoming prime minister in October at the age of 37.Ardern’s pregnancy came as a surprise to her and Gayford, but they took it in their stride. Arrangements were made for Ardern to work until very close to the birth, and then for the deputy prime minister to act in her place while she takes some six weeks maternity leave – although no one really believes that Ardern will be far from her phone! After that, Gayford takes over as primary carer for the foreseeable future.These are the kinds of practical arrangements working women make the world over – the novelty here is that it is a prime minister who is making them. The signal this sends, however, is that this is life in the 21st century. Women can choose to combine family and career as Ardern has done.For young women, the example Ardern is setting is an affirmation that they too can expect to have that choice. For young men, Gayford being the full time carer of a baby sends a powerful message that they too can exercise that choice.New Zealand is known for being, by and large, a socially progressive country. Ardern is its third female prime minister it has had three female governor generals and women have held significant positions across the public and private spheres. 125 years ago, it became the first country where women won the right to vote.Now it is breaking new ground with a prime minister giving birth and her partner becoming a stay-at-home father. But in the context of New Zealand, this is evolutionary, not revolutionary. Overwhelmingly positive interest across the political spectrum is being taken in the addition to the first family.What lessons are there in this for our world? In my view, New Zealand is showing that no doors are closed to women, that having a baby while being prime minister can be managed, and that it’s acceptable for male partners to be full-time carers. This is very positive role modelling for the empowerment of women and for gender equality.In a world where there are still glass ceilings to be smashed and where many countries continue to have laws, policies, and practices that discriminate against women, the message from New Zealand is one of hope – that women can break through all barriers and do it in their own way as Ardern has done. I hope that New Zealand will continue to be a leader in the full inclusion of women in all spheres of its society – and I expect it will be."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9b5bb7c0848f98917544fdd32a768e6116fa63af/0_192_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0d5ea02721573b9030054c1288423312","title":"universal credit welfare savings human beings lives","story":"Theresa May’s pledge of £20bn for the NHS without any evidence of how she’d pay for it other than the phantom “Brexit idend” is the sort of fudging of numbers we’ve become used to seeing from Conservative ministers. The National Audit Office released a damning report last week into the ever-delayed universal credit, finding, among other failings, that it might actually cost more than the previous system of benefits it replaces. Current running costs are at £699 a claim – about £500 more than the government’s long-term ambition.This is ineptitude soaked in hypocrisy. While the feckless poor can go to food banks and be told it’s because they’re “not best able to manage their finances”, ministers can waste billions of pounds of public money with impunity.\u0026nbspMeanwhile, a combination of a chronic shortage of social housing is seeing private landlords pocket vast sums of public money for temporary accommodation while more than 1 million renters are teetering on eviction. It means the finances of local government – already on a knife-edge – are mopping up the result of high rents and squeezed wages as rising homelessness pushes people into crisis.A vast removal of state support has taken place over the past decade, much of it under the guise of prudent management of a so-called bloated “welfare” bill. And yet, from David Cameron to May, the government has been the one guilty of a brazen waste of taxpayers’ money. It is the ultimate betrayal underneath the austerity lie: create a narrative that says it is benefit claimants who are bleeding the public purse dry, and then throw away billions of pounds engineering ever-counterproductive ways to cut their support.Be it for housing, low wages, parenting or ill-health, safety nets work because they pay for themselves in multiple ways: in-work “top-up” benefits enable low-income workers or young parents to stay in employment and pay into the economy while anything from disability benefits to child tax credits help nurture healthy citizens, ultimately taking the burden off the NHS, police and child social care. Remove them and not only do families suffer the other parts of society take the pressure. This week, the MS Society found benefit cuts are costing the NHS at least an additional £7.7m a year in GP and A\u0026ampE services for people with MS, alone. These are disabled people who used to maintain their health with the support of social security, but, after losing their benefits, are having to turn up to hospitals for emergency help.When a social security system is in disarray, maximising the value of the welfare state becomes ever more difficult. Rightwing politicians talk of so-called “welfare dependency” when, in fact, it is poorly constructed social security systems such as universal credit that prevent families flourishing. Withhold the benefits a low-paid care assistant needs to help her pay her rent to avoid eviction, and you’re pushing a secure person into crisis, meaning she will ultimately need more support from the state. Take away wheelchair users’ mobility vehicles, and they’ve lost their transport to get to work or even engage in society. The government claims its “welfare reform” is intended to “make work pay”, but their policies have just made it harder for workers to make ends meet while penalising those, such as chronically ill people, who are in need of a safety net through no fault of their own.\u0026nbspWe are repeatedly told it’s the left that is irresponsible with budgets. That there is “no magic money tree”. That somehow one of the richest nations on Earth can’t afford a safety net that adequately helps people when they are starving or in ill health. In reality, the Conservatives are overseeing one of the most economically illiterate social programmes in living memory. Universal credit stands out because of the sheer scale of its failing, but it is not a lone error in an otherwise workable system. Rather, it is reflective of a decade in which ministers have crowed over “welfare savings” at the expense of human beings’ lives – and have actually cost the public more in the process. Britain’s broken welfare state is increasingly a costly lesson: zealot ideology and incompetence can be dangerous traits for a government but, together, they are a disaster."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d47f99a0fad5a8ab4e66fb7437298f8210bdaf7e/0_0_1000_600/master/1000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0623a5994ad998858b40d8e80ae96f9a","title":"20000 losses and late night casino binges the student gambling epidemic","story":"Three former addicts tell their stories of gambling at university – and explain what can be done to prevent more young people falling into the trapThe cocktail of new-found freedom at university, easy availability of borrowed money and the ever-present opportunity to gamble has driven some students to academic failure, bankruptcy and mental health problems.Gambling is a growing issue for students at British universities. The Gambling Commission estimated that more than 100,000 students are in debt due to their habit, with one in four of those indebted beyond £10,000.Stopping gambling is more difficult than it might seem. Online bookmakers have plied ex-gamblers with targeted ads attempting to lure them back, while thousands of people who self-excluded have still been able to access their accounts. Meanwhile, there is precious little support for this type of problem on university campuses, beyond traditional counselling. The issue was highlighted by the NUS last month when it partnered with Gamban, an app which blocks gambling sites. Here, three ex-students describe how they became addicted to gambling at university and what can be done to prevent more young people falling into the trap.I would lose my student loan almost as soon as I received it. Hours of free time during the day at university did not suit me well. Every man and his dog in my year gambled it was so widespread that among a group of friends you may be the odd one out if you haven’t had a flutter on a game you were watching. Soon, that bet on the football becomes an expensive, drunken night at the casino that you regret the next day. Then you’re always trying to make your losses back.The late night rollercoasters of online gambling and casino trips took their toll and led to me not attending classes at university at all. You get depressed and it’s all downhill from there. Losing the money I relied on to live made university seem pointless and it altered my mindset to such an extent that I didn’t care about my education anymore. They were dark days and it still runs deep.I ended up dropping out of university and working full-time to pay back thousands of pounds of debt. A large student debt was bad enough, but when that is coupled with payday loans, credit card and overdraft debt with a much closer deadline it really doesn’t put you in very good stead for normal life.Gambling addiction can be hidden and lied away. I compulsively lied to family and friends to borrow money. I think universities should offer Gamblers Anonymous meetings. I was unable to get to a GA until after I dropped out, which delayed my recovery.I self-excluded from websites throughout uni, which did stop me gambling with that specific company – but there is always another bookie lurking around the corner. I also self-excluded from a casino but soon after, due to regulatory changes, you didn’t have to give a name so there was never a doubt that I would be able to enter.I gambled as a form of escapism. I was incredibly bored and, on a deeper level, I wanted to distract myself from being emotionally honest because I wasn’t at all happy at university.Universities need to be much more proactive in preventing addiction taking root. They need to raise gambling to the same level of conversation as that which already exists for drugs and alcohol on campus.The poker society I was part of was offered £100,000 in bonuses from gambling sites in exchange for sponsorship. Yet there were no guidelines from the university or union with how to deal with these approaches – they are designed to get people addicted, not to help a fledgling poker society pay for blazers. I ended up losing more than £20,000.Gambling is a distraction from everyday life. It’s like being in another universe. Theoretically, you are able to control events at a poker table, where you’re able to make controlled decisions – such as wagering a certain bet, at a certain time, in an otherwise uncontrollable environment. That’s a relieving feeling in the modern world.As a problem gambler you don’t set out to lose money, what you’re doing is spending an amount you’re comfortable wagering, and if you lose that, for some people it ends there. It’s when £20 – which could be considered light entertainment – becomes £100, or £1,000 and soon you’re playing catch up to make back your losses. That’s why the bookies offer you a free £10 here, a free £20 there, because they know it gets people hooked.Gambling addicts need the ups and downs of it, the ecstasy and excitement of winning and the crippling agony of losing. Flirting with the two is the thing that makes gamblers tick. The activity is one thing but it’s what it’s doing with your brain that’s the main thing. For me, I would rather have been losing and playing than not playing at all because if you’re trying to escape from your own mood, you would take the low – over the absence of a low. Left untreated, addicts seek a higher thrill – by betting more money – to get that euphoric, dopamine-driven high again.I remember one day I played for 14 hours straight. There’s always a game of poker going on online and if you’re really into poker, why wouldn’t you play? I now have a piece of gambling exclusion software on my computer which helps me fight the urge to play.When you don’t have much money, it sometimes seems that you don’t have much to lose. Most gambling today is intertwined with compulsive smartphone usage as most betting is now done at the touch of a button. This is partly why it is a growing problem.I played online poker over a long period. But because my losses were broken up by big wins, it took longer to see my behaviour as problematic and that it massively impacted all areas of my life. I had developed a serious gambling problem while I was at university. For me, becoming addicted was an incremental process. I started playing for pennies and at the end I was losing £1,500 in a single hand.It’s an addiction that doesn’t at first have any visible effects and can be hidden by people who want to keep their gambling secret. Therefore, universities need to offer support in the same way they do in other areas because there is currently little to no support for this type of addiction.Gambling at university was a burden that I, and many others, could easily hide. I certainly didn’t contact my university about my problem so more education on the addiction and visibility would help.I attempted to self-exclude many times but often relapsed. The self-exclusions can be undermined by making new accounts, but this could easily be solved if every site required a picture of a passport and there was a central database of excluders.It was only when I had a total block put on my devices, with the password held by my mother, that I was able to get over my gambling addiction. Eventually, I only avoided bankruptcy when my parents bailed me out of several thousand pounds of payday loan debt."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b973c9b26afc40a7bbaa8c4d4112809a9ddb54ee/0_149_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fb82ae158b23a8d586ec1ca5406de9ac","title":"barnacled angels the whales of stellwagen bank a photo essay","story":"Off the tip of Cape Cod, pods of humpbacks return every summer to feed. For the past 18 years,  Philip Hoare has been joining them to witness this incredible displayOff the tip of Cape Cod, pods of humpbacks return every summer to feed. For the past 18 years,  Philip Hoare has been joining them to witness this incredible displayAt the tip of Cape Cod, a sandy spit reaches out into the Atlantic, like an arm, towards a vast underwater plateau where humpbacks gather each summer to feed. This is the US marine sanctuary of Stellwagen Bank, where for the past three weeks I’ve been a guest on the Dolphin Fleet whalewatch boats, working out of Provincetown. I’ve been coming here for 18 years it’s where I learned about whales. I’m inordinately fond of these animals and like me, they come back here too. Every spring, the whales return from their mating grounds in the Caribbean where they’ve spent the winter, fasting: those clear blue waters hold no sustenance for a whale. The grey-green seas of the Cape are filled with food: the cycle of upwelling nutrition feeds phytoplankton, that feed zooplankton, that feed the sand-eels, that feed the whales. They’re unconcerned by the clouds of gulls that follow them, in the same cycle, after the same food – even stealing fish out of the whales’ mouths. Like other rorqual whales, humpbacks’ throats expand in rubbery pleats reaching down to their navels. Opening their mouths wide, they strain their food using the strips of baleen – made of keratin, the same substance found in human fingernails – that hang from their upper jaws. Humpbacks co-operate in one of the most spectacular sights in the natural world. Blowing precisely calibrated streams of bubbles from their mouths, they swim round in circles, creating curtains of air around their prey. Then they rise, open-mouthed like giant crows. As they do so, they seem to alter the shape of the water itself. This whale is thwacking its tail up and down in behaviour known as lob-tailing. But only the humpbacks of Stellwagen Bank use another technique, ‘kick-feeding’, to stun their prey. It’s learned, local culture.This may be the most closely studied population of great whales in the world. The Provincetown Center for Coastal Studies (PCCS) was founded in 1976 to observe and document these animals. At that time, whaling was still widely practised. A veteran captain of the Dolphin Fleet told me that back in the 1960s, one Provincetown diner used to serve humpback steaks. With the advent of the Dolphin Fleet whalewatch, founded in 1975 by the Avellar family (Portuguese in descent, like many of the fishing community in Provincetown), commerce was allied with science. With naturalists on the boats, PCCS was able to gather an immense database, sustained by tourist dollars. The result is a catalogue of 2,000 inidual whales. One of the first to be named, Salt, has had 14 calves, and is now a great-grandmother.  Humpbacks have unique black and white patterns on the underside of their flukes, enabling the identification of inidual animals. Each receives non-gender-specific names not because Provincetown is a gender-fluid town – which it certainly is – but because it is difficult to sex a whale.This whale is an exception. She’s displaying her genital mound, which is usually impossible to see.Some whales are truly striking. This speckled female has been called Ventisca –Spanish for “snowstorm”. She’s one of the first whales I ever saw, back in 2000. She’s a popular performer, partial to rolling on her back. Humpbacks show no fear of the whalewatch boats. These whales may also be among the most habituated to humans. Sometimes on the boat we joke that we’re providing a ‘human watch’ for whales. As to what they really make of us, we may never know. Dennis Minsky, veteran naturalist on the Dolphin Fleet, has a wild theory. “Every day I announce a whale’s name over the tannoy system,” he says. “If my dog Dory recognises her name, what’s to say these whales don’t?” This whale rose perpendicularly through the water to peer at us. It’s called “spy-hopping” to me it looks like curiosity. Fascinated by whale-human culture, Minksy has compiled a “whalewatch glossary” of terms used by the captains. A breaching whale is a “Hail Mary”. Irritating leisure craft are generically “plastic”. It’s a sort of update on Moby-Dick. With more swear words.Fin whales – the next biggest animals on Earth after blue whales – also scythe through these waters. Vast and enigmatic, nicknamed the greyhounds of the sea, they can reach 24 knots, as fast as our boat. They have uniquely asymmetrical markings – pale on one side of their bodies, dark on the other. They use the white side to scare fish with a sudden flash – then gulp down their prey. A pair of lunge-feeding fin whales once lurched so close to our prow that our captain, Todd Motta, shouted, “Whoa!”, But far from colliding with us, they seemed to be using our boat as a fish-stop. On calm days, this ocean becomes hypnotic. Below its silvery surface - which Herman Melville called “the ocean’s skin” - white-sided dolphin surfed into view, leaping and foraging around the whales. They’re beautifully marked, with grey and mustard stripes that seem to streamline their bodies. One came close to the boat, visible through that watery skin like a super-realist art work by Gerhard Richter.  Of all great whales, humpbacks are most prone to breaching. No one knows why. Are they trying to dislodge troublesome parasites or communicating with other whales? Anyone who sees a 15-metre whale launch itself out of the ocean is sure of one thing: it looks like fun. Melville observed of the humpback: “He is the most gamesome and light-hearted of all the whales, making more gay foam and white water generally than any other of them.” As this calf leapt, it looked close to landing on a dolphin. Hanging there in the air, a humpback demonstrates its kinship with us. No whale so well deserves its binomial: Megaptera novaeangliae – “big-winged New Englander”, a barnacled angel.• With grateful thanks to the Dolphin Fleet, its crew and its naturalists.Philip Hoare’s RisingTideFallingStar (4th Estate) is published this month in paperback.

Many people think local councils are legally responsible for maintaining local parks and open spaces but unfortunately, unlike waste collection, that’s not the case yet.” He said the charter called on politicians “to take action to ensure these essential and highly-popular public resources are properly funded, managed, maintained, and protected for current and future generations.”He added: “As the voice of the movement of more than 6,000 local Friends of Parks Groups throughout the UK we recognise the immense contribution that these community volunteers are playing. Now it’s time for government to show an equal commitment to act. The public will not forgive political leaders who let the sun set on the UK’s parks.”Helen Griffiths, chief executive of Fields in Trust, one of the groups supporting the new charter, said its research proved parks and green spaces “have proven physical and mental health benefits.”“These are valuable places places where we can all move, breathe, run and play.

The ersity of habitats in your garden is really key.”While the garden survey does not provide definitive population data, Hayhow said it provided “another flag” to raise awareness of amphibian declines.“We’ve got reasons to be cautiously optimistic with some of the conservation measures that people are putting into their gardens appear to be helping hedgehogs,” said Hayhow."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/80260fdf9daf7ae634eec12938e121626948c3dd/0_16_1024_614/master/1024.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c105d4fd3db3fcf2509a0dc34fd5c374","title":"i dont want to be upskirted are there any outfits i should avoid","story":"It says a lot about attitudes to women that people haven’t been angrier about upskirting before. Here’s what the current row tells us about clothes, power and shameWhat can I wear to prevent anyone taking a photo of my crotch at a festival?Mary, by emailA vagina. As most of us now know, the practice of “upskirting” – taking a photo of a woman’s crotch without her consent – has now become so widespread that one young woman, Gina Martin, felt compelled to launch a bill to make it illegal after some troglodyte upskirted her in Hyde Park. But, as most of us also now know, a Tory MP, one Sir Christopher Chope, blocked this bill’s progress – not, he has been crossly saying ever since, because he is such a fan of seeing random strangers’ crotches. No, he is just upset about the legislation process, you see. And truly, who could doubt the strong good morals of Sir Christopher Crotch? OK, so he voted against same-sex marriage and against the equal pay bill, he referred to parliamentary staff as “servants” and, just to add the toxic cherry on top, charged £881 to his parliamentary expenses for repairing his sofa. And yes, on the same day he blocked the upskirting bill, he also blocked a bill to protect police dogs and horses. But this is all because he is such a morally upstanding kinda guy.And speaking of upstanding, let’s talk upskirting. It says a lot about how little people care about female consent that they haven’t been angrier about this before now, because it is not like upskirting has been a secret – upskirt shots of celebrities have been in the tabloids for decades. In fact, most of us have borne witness to the most notorious upskirt shot of all time, when Paul Verhoeven tricked Sharon Stone into taking off her underwear for the shooting of one infamous scene. Verhoeven promised Stone that nothing would be visible, only for Stone to realise too late that Verhoeven had not just upskirted her, but was putting the results in every multiplex around the world.Maybe people told themselves that upskirting happens because women – those silly women! – insist on wearing skirts so short it turns the world into their gynaecologist, to quote the eternally quotable Patsy from Ab Fab. Those poor photographers – those women will not stop shoving their gussets in their lenses.A lawyer, Nick ‘Mr Loophole’ Freeman, brought the noble Freeman name into disrepute last weekend when he tweeted: “While this is totally unacceptable conduct, if women assumed some responsibility for their attire, they would not be in jeopardy.” This point was so absurd even Freeman’s daughter, Sophie,  replied to her father to tell him that this was “one of the top 3 stupidest comments you’ve ever made.” Nick then replied, wrongly: “it’s most stupid, not stupidest”. And that, Nick, goes into your top four.Last month, I saw some paparazzi using selfie sticks to take upskirt shots of young women leaving a movie premiere, and some of those women were wearing dresses so long the photographer had to wiggle his selfie stick under their hems, which were literally dragging on the ground.So shall we get something straight? Upskirting – like all forms of sexual assault, which is what upskirting is – has nothing to do with a woman’s hemline, but everything to do with that woman possessing genitals. And that’s because sexual assaults have nothing to do with sex. There is nothing sexy about a blurry camera phone shot of an oblivious stranger’s vagina, unless you find humiliation sexy. This is about young women being shamed for going out and having fun, and men wanting to tell them they have power over them. It’s telling that the kind of men who victim-shame are the kind who patronise their own daughters.A couple of years ago, there was some talk about whether it’s possible to tell a funny rape joke. To date, only Wanda Sykes has managed it, with her riff about how vaginas should be detachable so women could go out at night and not risk rape. Now we know another factor in favour of the detachable vagina, which is that women can go to Hyde Park and not have a stranger’s phone camera act like a speculum on her anatomy. So until the upskirt bill passes, I urge Sir Christopher to investigate detachable vaginas. We could even refer to them as our “chope” in his honour."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1db8647ad328bda72a31ca88d1b40b4bdaa38bb3/44_8_2376_1425/master/2376.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2fe59ea0e1b50e9d6446685a3f4b1a02","title":"boom for real review jean michel basquiat","story":"Sara Driver’s documentary about the artist’s early years draws a vivid picture of 70s New York but fails to get under its subject’s skinThe most powerful moments of this documentary about the early years of artist Jean-Michel Basquiat come just before the closing credits. We see, unadorned and in simple succession, half a dozen or so of his pictures, and finally get a sense of why we are here and what the fuss is about. Otherwise film-maker Sara Driver is apparently concerned to embed Basquiat deeply, and at first almost invisibly, into his social milieu: the exciting and almost lawless creativity of New York in the late 1970s, with punk, Warhol, subway graffiti, and so on.Driver interviews any number of people of that era, including street graffiti artist Al Diaz and film-maker Jim Jarmusch, about what it was like in those days and what Basquiat himself was like. He emerges as an enigma, a rumour, almost a hallucination, always flitting in and out of the story, easily and apparently effortlessly bringing off a series of brilliant street-art coups. But who exactly was Basquiat? Where had he come from?Exasperatingly, Driver never sets out to give us the simple facts about his family and his Haitian and Puerto Rican heritage, and stops short of describing his death of drug abuse – just content to let him emerge as some cloudy force of nature. It is, maybe, a rather naive and even condescending view of this complex and sophisticated man. (My colleague Jonathan Jones makes a similar observation about the recent Basquiat retrospective at London’s Barbican. Perhaps, like Tamra Davis, director of the 2010 film Jean-Michel Basquiat: The Radiant Child, Driver left out this kind of biographical detail in return for cooperation from the artist’s family. Either way, the film doesn’t quite get under Basquiat’s skin, but does a thorough job of reconstructing that forgotten city of late-70s New York in which Basquiat came of age."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0599ad79681faaf9c909d16047e337c5ab0a2ec7/70_235_2686_1612/master/2686.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aa087e8b6fac5c51f47e37cdcae2ad44","title":"lionel messi sun king argentina blind world cup","story":"Fame, fame, fatal fame. It can play hideous tricks on the brain. Here’s an unexpected World Cup statistic. With the opening seven days of Russia 2018 now done, one outfield player has run less over 90 minutes than anyone else in any position in any team. His name? Why, it’s Lionel\u0026nbspMessi!Yes, that Messi: many people’s choice as the most gloriously talented player at his tournament and a man consumed with a sense of voracious personal destiny that he might still drive Argentina on to win this World Cup.But only, it seems, at his own speed, and in a way that reflects both his extraordinary status within this Argentina team, and a sport that is geared more than ever toward the cult of the star.Argentina play their second Group D game against Croatia on Thursday. For now that opening fixture against Iceland stands as a genuine curiosity. Messi’s penalty miss took the headlines. But behind it are a set of numbers that sketch out a performance of bizarre and sedentary monotony.Messi ran 7.61km. Five days on this is still less than any other outfield player to complete 90 minutes. Unsurprisingly Messi has also run less without the ball than any other outfield player, less even than Kasper Schmeichel and Hugo Lloris who are, of course, goalkeepers.Run more, move more: it is an English footballing obsession, a recipe for success that has harvested precisely zero World Cups over the past 50 years. But in that time even the most gifted of World Cup winners has tended to show some degree of urgency.Against Iceland Messi made 17 sprints, half as many as Philippe Coutinho and Mesut Özil in their opening games. The word “sprint” is used advisedly here. The quickest player at the World Cup so far is Cristiano Ronaldo who clocked 34kph against Spain, perhaps while he was running off to celebrate\u0026nbspone of his goals. Messi’s top speed is 25kph, slower than David Silva, Andrés Iniesta and even Sergio Busquets.On the flipside the things Messi did he did a lot of. These were mainly shooting and dribbling. Despite playing only one game Messi still has four more World Cup 2018 shots than the next player on the list, Denis Cheryshev. Messi is still top of the dribble charts with 15. And despite not running much, he still has more runs into the attacking third than anyone else.There are mitigating factors. This will surely be a one-off in terms of sheer degree. Argentina had an unusually large number of shots as a team and an unusually high ratio of possession. But Messi still ran than less in a whole game than his teammate Lucas Biglia in 53 minutes, and made seven more sprints than Cristian Pavón mustered in 20 minutes.It adds up to a team geared to an extraordinary degree around their star. Anyone who has watched Argentina over the last decade knows about Messi-dependence. But this felt like reductio ad absurdum, an entire game spent shooting and dribbling, portered around the pitch in his gilded sedan chair, a talent that seemed to have overwhelmed his own team.There has been a shift a little further out at this World Cup. The the climate of tearful piety around Messi is striking, with an entire hand-wringing science devoted to speculation over how to get the most out of his precious gifts.On the other hand, it is very easy to become a little blinded by possibility. This sense of unease was there in comments before the tournament by Jorge Sampaoli, who spoke about Messi in the same way others talk about Jehovah or oxygen or a mother’s love.“We’re at the point where Leo is untouchable,” Sampaoli told World Soccer magazine, insisting there was absolutely nothing about football he could teach his captain. “His vision is much more developed than ours,” Argentina’s manager concluded, going on to gush about a time Messi turned up exhausted for training, which “only empowered everyone else”.Which is fine but is it working? The idea of Messi playing free, the sun around which every other body rotates, made for a curious kind of team in Moscow, a group of otherwise exceptional footballers\u0026nbspwith their heads down, god-blinkers on, servicing the\u0026nbspprinceling.No other team play like this. The inevitable comparison – deflector shields to maximum, social media mentions muted – is with Ronaldo, who is the star to an even greater degree with Portugal. But somehow it works, helped by the fact Ronaldo plays as a centre-forward, the task for his plus-10 simply to get the ball to the golden goal-hammer. Whereas Messi in his free role is there in every move, a helicopter parent of a footballer, always intervening, a constant presence at the edge of the picture.There is, of course, a wider point here about star players and about star interference. One of the glories of international football is the enforced human variation. In the past really talented players would often spend years playing with inferior teammates, a natural stage in the climb to the top.The top players just do not do this any more, are instead whisked away to some suitably elite level at a young age. Messi has played with teammates beneath his level really only when he is with Argentina and only to any great degree in the last two years. It shows.In addition football culture at every level has a more excitable view of star players now, extension of a wider world intoxicated by celebrity, dazzled by all those brilliant moments on constant repeat.In reality there is little in football history to suggest a player such as Messi should be able to turn a moderate team into World Cup contenders. The obsession with the power of one might insist otherwise but this is not how it tends to play out. Diego Maradona is the exception, George Best the rule. Football remains, defiantly, a team sport.It is still possible Messi will emerge from his chrysalis and assert those all-time powers. He has the talent to make any dynamic work but it is also hard not to wonder what other gears Argentina could find with a little\u0026nbspbalance, reimagined as something resembling the old-fashioned, relentlessly successful notion of a team."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/710e8a61ae015137772cb46cf071e2d666d3af9a/0_68_2480_1487/master/2480.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8e579fe9bcd98b5c0ba25604d6755f95","title":"manchester city jorginho fee agreed napoli","story":"Manchester City are close to completing the signing of Jorginho after agreeing an initial fee of €49m (£43m) with Napoli for the Italy midfielder.After weeks of negotiations with their Napoli counterparts over the Brazil-born 26-year-old City finally made a breakthrough this week and are now hopeful of finalising the deal in the next few days.

They chanted it in Moscow, above ground in the fan zone and below, in the metro. They chanted it in the restaurants and bars, and later, inebriated, they chanted it in the fountains. The main chant of this World Cup is not complicated. It’s the name of the host country, drawn out over three long syllables, and repeated ad infinitum: “Ros! Si! Ya!”It was Uruguay’s win against Saudi Arabia on Wednesday afternoon that confirmed Russia’s advance to the next stage, but with two wins and a goal difference of +7, Russia’s progression was all but wrapped up at the end of the Egypt game the evening before.If the proficiency of Russia’s 5-0 victory over Saudi Arabia in the opening game had caused the country’s collective jaw to drop in admiration and amazement, the emphatic follow-up against Egypt found the disbelief transitioning to joy and naked patriotism.It is not just the team’s performance that is making this such a fun World Cup to experience on the streets of Moscow and other cities. The arrival of hundreds of thousands of fans from across the world, turning the centre of the capital into a never-ending carnival of smiles and dancing, has a lot to do with that. But the sheen would have been taken off the celebration had the home team played as disastrously as predicted.The attitude towards the national team had been summed up by a popular meme doing the rounds on social media in the days before kick-off. A sign in a pub showed different footballers using the toilet: Cristiano Ronaldo curling it in from a distance, Zlatan Ibrahimovic urinating backwards overhead-kick style. The graphic for the Russia team was simple: a man standing in a puddle of his own piss.The grim pessimism of Russian supporters was hardly surprising. This, after all, was a team who had not won in seven matches and looked sluggish and uninspiring in the warmup matches. Just before the tournament, the veteran defender Sergei Ignashevich, who turns 39 in July and looked dangerously slow even at the Euros two years ago, was recalled to the squad and put in the starting lineup.Despite all the ominous portents, the action on the pitch has been a revelation, with two wins that have exceeded the expectations of even the most patriotic optimists. True, Russia’s opponents so far have been a woefully inept Saudi side and Egypt with a half-fit Mo Salah, but Russia could only play the opponents put in front of them, and it is worth remembering that according to Fifa rankings, Russia were a worse side than Saudi Arabia.Russia have never qualified for the knockout stage of the World Cup – the last time it happened was in 1986 when the country was still the Soviet Union. The last time a Russian or Soviet side won their two opening games at the tournament was 1966, an indication of just what a start the hosts have managed this time.Football is not a national obsession in Russia, with most people only taking notice during rare successes such as the run to the semi-finals of Euro 2008. “I think half the country will find out that we have a World Cup when the whistle blows,” the coach, Stanislav Cherchesov, said before the tournament. “It takes a long time for us to start driving but I think when we press the foot on the pedal, we go all the way.”That is now starting to happen, as those who were previously disdainful of the national side or apathetic begin to rally around the flag. At the Luzhniki on Wednesday afternoon, as a capacity crowd watched Portugal beat Morocco, there were loud cheers for Ronaldo’s goal from one end but the loudest roar of all was a few minutes into the second half, when the inevitable chant of “Ros! Si! Ya!” went up from the locals sitting in all four sides of the stadium.Over the past few years, patriotism in Russia has been isive, with the chest-beating and flag-waving over the annexation of Crimea in 2014 making some of the liberal minority queasy about patriotism. Viktor Shenderovich, a Russian satirist and radio host who is strongly critical of the Kremlin, wrote on Facebook on Tuesday: “Great match, the lads were brilliant, we deserved victory. But then you listen to the patriotic hysteria on the state channels – ‘WE DID IT’ – and you brain tells your heart: you’ve been used again. All very predictable.”But for many, the performance of the national team appears to have rehabilitated the flag, providing a form of patriotism the whole country can rally behind. Igor Rabiner, one of Russia’s leading football journalists, wrote in the Sport Express newspaper that more Russians are interested in winning than are interested in football per se, but said history was being made: “The young people who are waving flags and shouting: ‘Russia’ will remember all of this 50 years from now.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1bf2828e59fbd979bedf5f8369ab213fab522112/52_18_3617_2170/master/3617.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=875cac675666b5c95a5c85e2b317f4d1","title":"world cup 2018 day seven buildup australia denmark france argentina live","story":"Some painstaking number-crunching has created this beauty:On the menu a little later, after Australia’s match-up with Denmark, is Peru’s clash with France and Argentina v Croatia. The latter will see Barcelona team-mates Ivan Rakitic and Lionel Messi pit their wits against each other in Nizhny Novgorod, with Jorge Sampaoli’s side, finalists in 2014, under pressure to deliver after stuttering to a draw against Iceland. Speaking of Messi, Rakitic said: “My impression is not just that he’s motivated, but that he’s uber-motivated. When he goes to Argentina, he has a special smile on his face. I don’t think there is a player more proud to wear the jersey than he is.

I might not be celebrating any goals as athletically in future. The doc has made it clear that punching the air is not an option. Здравствуйте! Let’s kick-off with a serious topic: concussion. Nordin Amrabat, the Watford defender, returned to the Morocco lineup against Portugual on Wednesday, five days after not remembering anything for “five or six hours”. The players’ union, FIFPro, are not happy about it, highly critical of what it called “yet another alarming example of a player being put in harm’s way.”The Morocco coach, Hervé Renard, defended his decision to pick the player, saying: “He’s a warrior he wanted to play. It’s because his spirit is amazing and I was lucky to have a player like this.” As for Amrabat, who also accused the referee Mark Geiger of trying to bag Cristiano Ronaldo’s shirt – “it’s not a circus” – the 31-year-old insisted: “I am my own doctor.” All in all, not great. And with that, it’s over to Ben Fisher once again. Thanks for your company, until next time.Kieran Pender has been chatting to the Australian ambassador in Moscow, Peter Tesch, before the big game in Samara. “In the worse case we plan for the large-scale contingencies,” Tesch says. “If there is some sort of significant incident that affects Australians en masse. It does not even have to be a terrorist scare – it could simply be an infrastructure failure, a breakdown in public transport – anything that is going to inconvenience Australians and put them at risk. The other end of the spectrum is the much more likely: the day to day experience of people who lose a passport, use it as a beer coaster, put it through the washing machine etc, or are hospitalised. These are the more practical consular contingencies that we have been preparing for.”English hangovers, certainly in Leeds, seem to have been pretty severe after the opening win over Tunisia. More than four times the average number of sick days were taken in the Yorkshire city on Tuesday, apparently.How are those Russian hangovers? After their jubilant qualification for the last 16, a wave of optimism is lighting up the nation, writes the ’s central and eastern Europe correspondent Shaun Walker. reporter Chris Knaus is in Samara, and he has this dispatch on the feel on the streets:“The anticipation is building among Australian fans here in Samara. There’s a feeling of cautious optimism about the team’s chances. The general consensus? The Socceroos are a real shot at causing an upset, but no one – not even the most hopeful of armchair experts – can say where the goals will come from. There’s one thing the Aussies have already won hands down. Their fans significantly outnumber the Danes on Samara’s streets. The city’s pubs were crammed with Socceroos’ gold last night and you could scarcely go half an hour without hearing a drunken rendition of Waltzing Matilda or I Am Australian. This morning, it’s all gold along Samara’s main promenade, and down on the banks of the Volga River. The Danes that have made it here are understandably confident of their prospects. They offer confused looks when you rattle off a list of Australia’s best players – Aaron Mooy, Mat Ryan, or Mat Leckie. Australian fans are hoping the names will register a little more recognition after this afternoon.”Archie Thompson, the former Australia striker who once scored 13 in one game, is on the telly now and he doesn’t believe the Socceroos should mix it up too much after being impressed by their performance in the opening defeat to France. “I don’t think you really need to change too much,” he says. “They were pretty solid throughout.” Like many in Australia, he’s tipping a Socceroos win. “With the confidence from the first game, there a bit of belief. There’s a big belief, not just in the team, but across Australia.” Never, ever underestimate the power of big belief.And of course, Argentina are also in action, against Croatia later today. Here’s (possible Smiths fan) Barney Ronay with a nod to Frankly Mr. Shankly and, armed with some interesting and, perhaps, surprising statistics, a look at Lionel Messi:In the hope that a croissant and a slice of a tres leches cake miraculously lands on my desk, I’ll acknowledge the other Group C match to be played today, between France and Peru. Les Bleus are the clear favourites, and with Olivier Giroud back in the starting XI, supported by Antoine Griezmann and Kylian Mbappé, it’s going to be difficult for the South Americans to avoid a second defeat – and an exit from the tournament.Treats! A package has just arrived at  Towers (Sydney chapter), containing a Danish pastry and a Lamington, a loosely football-related gift from a popular social media platform. I should really tweet about it...Much of Australia’s focus pre-match has been on how they can stifle the creativity of Christian Eriksen, but it’s at the other end of the pitch where they perhaps face their biggest challenge. Because standing in between the sticks is Kasper Schmeichel, the Leicester City keeper who has not been beaten in a monster 533 minutes. “We’ll need to pray hard for Australia to have any sort of chance. Cahill’s forehead needs to pull off another miracle,” James Minglis writes below the line, offering one possible solution.sgGibson asks what we’ve all been thinking: “How is it even possible to dislocate your shoulder while jogging? Was he running upside down?” It’s scientific fact that it’s possible for footballers (and by extension managers) to injure themselves while performing seemingly innocuous tasks. See exhibit A (folding down an ironing board), B (shaving legs), C (jogging again, but in style) and D (mowing the lawn), to list but a few examples of the genre. More here:“Has anyone asked Princess Mary who she is hoping will win - we want to know Mary?” writes Weakaspiss below the line. Somebody has indeed asked, although we’re still in the dark. This is from an Australian betting company, who say they got in touch with an offer of a charity bet if her tip won the match: “Understandably, it seemed picking between her head and her heart was too hard, and we have received word that she has politely declined the offer.”Amazingly, it took until the penultimate first-round group game for a red card to be brandished in Russia, the dubious honour of becoming the first player to be sent off this tournament going to Colombia’s Carlos Sánchez in the Group H game against Japan. Does that make this the cleanest World Cup so far? If red card knowledge is your thing, test yourself with this quiz, which includes posers such as, “How many red cards were there in matches involving Argentina during the 1990 World Cup in Italy?” (And, for that matter, poseurs such as David Beckham.)Australia’s World Cup hopes hang in the balance later, when Bert van Marwijk’s side meet Denmark in Samara. Lose and the Socceroos can start planning what they’re going to do next month. Win, and it’s a different story. Draw, and, well, it’s not quite so clear cut.The feeling in a nation that so desperately wants its sporting teams to do well is that points can be won off a Danish side that failed to convince in a patchy opening victory over Peru. That, coupled with a decent enough showing in their own opener against France, has Socceroos fans believing a dream run out of the group stage will still be a possibility come full-time against the Danes.Who will be charged with carrying those hopes in Samara later remains unknown. Van Marwijk has kept his cards close to his chest so far, and there are still questions over who will lead the line: will Andrew Nabbout get another run out, or is it time for Tomi Juric to assume the starting striker’s role? May Jamie Maclaren get the nod? And what about Daniel Arzani? Could the youngest player at this tournament squeeze into the side, possibly at the expense of Robbie Kruse, with the need to unsettle the Danes at the back so important? Sadly, I don’t have the answers. But Van Marwijk has and one assumes he will let us know soon enough. Here’s Kieran Pender’s preview of the match to get your teeth into in the meantime:Before yesterday’s victory over Morocco, Ronaldo’s teammate Pepe said Portugal were “privileged” to have to have the Real Madrid man in the squad and that there is “no doubt that the most important thing for our team is that Cristiano Ronaldo is in top shape”. I’ll leave you to judge whether that is the case.Martin Laurence has come up with some ratings to compile a best XI of the opening round. No surprises to see Ronaldo and Costa leading the team from the front, but what about the rest? Take a peek for yourselves:On that final point, Southgate’s unfortunate injury – sustained while going for a jog, of all things – has rendered him incapable of celebrating any goals, apparently. “The doc has made it clear that punching the air is not an option,” he said. “It is better this is me than one of the players,” he added. “They were a bit surprised in the team meeting and were asking: ‘What have you been doing?’ As always, they were probably quite amused. It is good that we have had a quiet day today so I had prepared the meeting before and we are on to preparations for Panama. I am just a bit gutted because I was on for my record 10k time.”And let’s get an early plug in for this, yesterday’s daily podcast, in which Max Rushden, Barry Glendenning and Sam Diss analyse day seven’s events with the help of Barney Ronay, who calls in from Russia to talk about Gareth Southgate’s running injury. As usual, it’s well worth a listen.What better way to get things started today than with an outrageous story from Russia involving Burger King, an incredibly ill-judged and poor-taste social media campaign, a hardly surprising backlash and an inevitable apology. The headline speaks volumes. Incredible stuff.Something of a natural order, if you like, has been restored to the World Cup. How long this state remains is unknown, but after an opening round that contained a number of upsets, it was with a sense of comfortdisappointment (depending on your disposition) that day seven’s round two results went as expected. Not only were the wins for Spain (1-0 over Iran), Uruguay (1-0 over Saudi Arabia) and Portugal (1-0 over Morocco), but the identity of all three goalscorers also came as little surprise. Diego Costa grabbed his third of the tournament to give La Furia Roja their first win, Luis Suárez opened his account on his 100th international appearance to send Uruguay into the last 16 and, perhaps most inevitably of all, Cristiano Ronaldo thundered home a brave header to put Morocco out.Ronaldo’s effort, in the fourth minute at the Luzhniki Stadium, was his fourth of the tournament and ensured the already short odds for him to become the tournament’s top scorer were trimmed even further. The coveted Golden Boot appears well within the Real Madrid striker’s reach.Lionel Messi will be hoping to trouble the scorers for the first time later today when he leads out Argentina against Croatia in Nizhny Novgorod. But before that there is the small matter of two Group C games – and possibly some World Cup fates – to be settled: Denmark v Australia and France v Peru. Much more on those to come in due course.It’s the usual deal again: I’ll take you through the next three hours, before Ben Fisher takes over and guides you through to the first kick-off of the day – that crunch Denmark-Australia clash in Samara.

I call my approach Root to Fruit eating. It is a philosophy that aims to make it easier for people to cook good food, blending a little chef’s knowhow with academic research, and making it applicable to home cooks and professionals alike. My shopping list comes in at just over £18 a week – cheaper than the average national weekly spend per person of £24. Over a year, that’s a saving of about £300 while still enjoying top-quality food (I buy everything from my local independent health-food shop or market, or organic items from the supermarket. Of course, if you need to bring the cost of your shopping down further, buy non-organic). I’m a vegetarian, so there is no meat on my shopping list, and eating less meat is certainly a good way of keeping costs down. However, if you are buying meat, opt for cheaper cuts of higher-welfare animals.That margin is there to cover the cost of rent, staff, utilities and, if you’re lucky, a profit. But chefs love good produce, so they devise other ways to keep their costs down, turning scraps that cost pennies into a fine meal for which patrons are happy to pay pounds. Noma, for example – one of the best restaurants in the world – serves cod’s head as a main course. Taking on board a chef’s thrift in the kitchen will help you save money while eating healthily and sustainably – as my guide and recipes show.The best chefs will buy local and seasonal ingredients where possible. Pineapples and pomegranates are luxuries to be enjoyed, but base the bulk of your weekly shop on seasonal produce from the market or through a veg box scheme and you will have a double win, improving the taste and economy. Alongside your basics (eggs, milk, butter, cheese, bread etc) choose a variety of fresh fruit and vegetables including legumes, brassicas and roots. Chefs buy in bulk it’s cheaper in the long run and reduces unnecessary packaging. Store cupboard items are an investment – you can build up a variety over time. Having a few key items in the store cupboard is a great way to ensure there is always an affordable meal in the house. Dried pulses come with a low price tag – even when they are organic – and a little goes a long way. Just 5p’s-worth (60g per person) will provide the bulk of a meal. Other items such as lentils, grains, dried fruit, nuts and seeds will give you a variety of delicious ingredients to experiment with making your own dishes.

Otherwise, invent your own dish. With fresh vegetables, you can’t go wrong. Roast, saute or simmer vegetables, toss them with herbs or toasted spices and serve them with a grain of your choice. About 50g of rye, barley, spelt or rice (10-16p) is a good portion. Or be inventive and concoct your own soup or stew to use up the withered vegetables hiding at the back of the fridge.Spiced rice, roasted broccoli, carrot and peanut saladI live off salads such as this.

With fellow East Enders David Bailey and Terence Donovan, Duffy brought new ideas and a new energy to celebrity photography.The Aladdin Sane image, an orange haired Bowie with a red and blue painted lightning flash painted on his face, is one of Duffy’s most famous.Chris Duffy, son of Brian and director of the Duffy Archive, said it “is one of the best known and most copied images of the late 20th century. Today, it is instantly recognised around the world.“My father greatly enjoyed his unique creative partnership with David. I think he would be delighted that his work is joining the V\u0026ampA’s collection and that it has contributed to the continuing public interest in one of the UK’s great creative forces.”The gift was welcomed by the culture secretary Matt Hancock who said it celebrated “David Bowie’s seismic cultural importance and the huge contribution Brian Duffy made to 20th century photography.”The V\u0026ampA’s exhibition is the museum’s most visited international touring show in its 165-year history. Around 312,000 visitors first saw it in London in 2013 and it has since toured to Toronto, Sao Paulo, Berlin, Chicago, Paris, Melbourne, Groningen in the Netherlands, Bologna, Tokyo, Barcelona and now New York where it will end, forever, on 15 July."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/795afdcc407bf5820a312675a7b3ab38a00f11b2/0_88_2128_1276/master/2128.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=775d5dd041ddbeaf648b44d75923b27d","title":"chancellor to promise a series of post brexit financial partnerships","story":"Philip Hammond will use speech to outline a plan for striking deals outside the EUThe government plans to safeguard London’s position as the world’s leading financial centre after Brexit by signing a series of financial partnerships with non-EU countries.Philip Hammond will use his keynote Mansion House to the City’s elite on Thursday to say that the government intends to strike deals outside of the single market that will make the UK a gateway to financial markets.The chancellor will also call on the EU to negotiate a wide-ranging post-Brexit financial services deal that would provide access to EU markets for UK firms and allow EU governments and companies to borrow money cheaply in London.The chancellor’s insistence that London can be the gateway to global financial markets will be aimed at reassuring the City that London will continue to thrive after Brexit.“Connectivity was always at the heart of London’s success. And to succeed in the future, we must remain connected to the world – including the important emerging markets,” Hammond will say.The chancellor’s proposal involves bringing together governments, regulators and industry to build a system for opening up cross-border financial services, with the aim of improving access to global financial markets and reducing business costs.Britain has already started a series of financial dialogues with leading emerging market countries, such as China and Brazil, and these will form the basis of new partnerships.In the Mansion House speech, the chancellor will also emphasise that the government will stick to its plans for eliminating the budget deficit and reducing the UK’s debt despite this week’s pledge to spend more on the NHS.Making it clear that taxes will be raised in this autumn’s budget, Hammond will say: “We are getting debt down, while investing in Britain’s infrastructure, supporting our vital public services and helping hard working families, across the United Kingdom.“This week the prime minister announced a five-year NHS funding package that will boost spending on health by over £20bn a year in real terms in England alone.

Grasses had perfect growing conditions over late April and in May with warm sunshine and showers. That was followed in June by hot dry conditions when the grass flowers matured and shed clouds of pollen on light breezes and up people’s noses.The strange thing is that hay fever was incredibly rare when it was first reported by John Bostoc, a London doctor, nearly 200 years ago. Yet in those days far more people lived and worked in the countryside, where grasses grew everywhere. Today, hay fever has reached epidemic proportions and afflicts more than a fifth of the British population, even in towns where you might imagine grass pollen is less of a problem.This statistic has been blamed on modern lifestyles, including factors such as obsessive hygiene and excessive use of antibiotics.Above all, air pollution from traffic is a huge factor in the upsurge of hay fever. Exhaust fumes help weaken pollen grains, making them split open more easily and spew out the allergic substances that trigger the condition. And polluting gases, such as ozone and nitrogen dioxide, also make hay fever sufferers more sensitive to pollen allergens."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b5d812c1a10d62059b899b1e7a5ff5ccfb6d4e50/49_308_3255_1954/master/3255.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cfca8b14d78ce0d7d00b16582ef78cd5","title":"bernard hinault tour de france strike chris froome","story":"• Riders should refuse to race, says Tour de France legend• Hinault: ‘Chris Froome should not be at the start of the Tour’Bernard Hinault, the five-times winner of the Tour de France, has called on riders in this year’s race to strike in protest at the presence of Chris Froome, who is awaiting the outcome of an adverse analytical finding for the asthma drug\u0026nbspsalbutamol.Since news of the test result from a sample taken during his victory in the Vuelta a España in 2017 was published in the  in November, Froome, the defending Tour champion, has maintained his innocence of any wrongdoing and reiterated his certainty that he will be cleared when the case is resolved.Speaking to the newspaper Ouest-France, Hinault, who no longer has an official role with the Tour de France organisers ASO since his retirement last year, said the riders should refuse to start when the race begins in the Vendée on 7 July. “The peloton should put its feet to the ground and say, if he is starting the race, we won’t start.”Hinault was known as a spokesman among the riders during his career which lasted from 1975 to 1986, and during his first Tour de France exactly 40 years ago he became celebrated for leading a riders’ strike after the organisers attempted to make them race three stages in a single day.“Christopher Froome should not be at the start of the Tour,” Hinault said. “Quite simply because he has tested positive, for me this is not an abnormal test. As always, people do not take the decision when it should be taken. The people at the UCI should have said, you have been caught, so you should not be racing.”Salbutamol is classified in a different way to other substances in that it is permitted up to a certain threshold – which Froome’s A and B samples exceeded – after which a rider has to explain the result. Until the case is resolved an athlete is permitted to race, although teams who are members of the voluntary Movement for Credible Cycling, which does not include Team Sky, go a step further and impose a ban on its cyclists.There is no indication when Froome’s case will be resolved.

England demolished South Africa by 121 runs to begin their T20 tri-series campaign in rampaging style. But that margin, the biggest ever, warrants only a passing mention, such was the mismatch at Taunton with Heather Knight’s side posting a world record 250 for three, led by Tammy Beaumont’s third international century in nine days.From the earliest exchanges on a rock-hard surface this was all about the records, which included the opener claiming the fastest T20 ton for an England woman, lowering the mark from 52 to 47 balls. She and Danielle Wyatt (56) combined for 147 at the top, equalling England’s highest partnership in the format.Three hours earlier, in the first game of the double-header, South Africa had already coughed up the record once, New Zealand piling on 216 for one with Suzie Bates unbeaten on 124. “We saw the Kiwi girls,” Beaumont said. “Mark Robinson told us not to try and break the record.”So much for that. They overtook New Zealand’s mark with 14 balls to spare. By the time they were done, there had never been a higher score made in a professional women’s T20. Five of the six highest totals in T20 international women’s cricket have now been posted in 2018. The game is changing fast.Scores like this prompt images of a slogathon, yet this was far from that. England’s openers hit 21 fours before they cleared the rope from the final ball of the 10th over. Muscle played a role as the innings wore on but it was set up by the brains of Beaumont and Wyatt, dancing and pulling and driving their opponents into submission.Beaumont broke Wyatt’s fastest hundred record, her innings a masterclass of footwork, striking 18 fours and four sixes in a stay of 52 balls. For Wyatt’s part, her half-century came in 31 balls. By the halfway mark they were already 116 without loss with the sense growing that the record was going to be extended again.Katherine Brunt and Nat Sciver came together with the score at 185 and carted 25 from the 18th over to push it beyond 200. The former ended unbeaten on 42 from 16 balls, the latter out for 33 from 15 lusty swings.Chasing that many, the visitors were never in the same postcode. In sharp contrast to what went before, Anya Shrubsole bowled two maidens and finished with figures of 4-2-8-0. For South Africa, their captain Dane van Niekerk batted wonderfully for 72, her second half-century of the afternoon, but there was nothing she could do alone. In the long journey to the World T20 tournament coming this November, England are out of the blocks in the best fashion possible."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/705c89c40f773d164a0cf48fd3b35df2ffe16da3/0_272_4773_2864/master/4773.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=621b560c3984d790e047f11af7a90a9a","title":"from stonehenge to icelands arctic henge by motorbike photo essay","story":"Stonehenge is the springboard for a motorbike and ferry trip to a modern, pagan-inspired monument in Iceland, taking in Germany, Denmark, and the Faroe Islands – and some seriously unkind weather for those on two wheelsStonehenge is the springboard for a motorbike and ferry trip to a modern, pagan-inspired monument in Iceland, taking in Germany, Denmark, and the Faroe Islands – and some seriously unkind weather for those on two wheelsLike Stonehenge in southern England, Arctic Henge acts as a kind of huge sundial, capturing sunlight and casting shadows. It has four aligned six-metre-high gates with a 10-metre central column. When completed it will be 52 metres in diameter. It is still being built from locally quarried basalt rock on an outcrop of land in north-east Iceland, overlooking the remote village of Raufarhöfn – the corner of the mainland closest to the Arctic Circle. Once one of the most important ports for fish processing and the export of herring products, Raufarhöfn fell into decline after the collapse of the industry in the 1960s. The late Erlingur Thoroddsen, a resident hotelier, conceived and began construction of the Arctic Henge in 1996, partly to help revive the town.When I relocated to Iceland from London in 2015 to write a book, I sold both my motorcycles. I had been riding since I was 16 and withdrawal soon set in. Then last summer, I heard that a friend from the UK was selling a 250cc Kawasaki TR250. In September I flew to London and bought the bike. I mapped a route to ride it back to Iceland, from Stonehenge to Heimskautsgerðið (Arctic Henge). To avoid the motorways I decided to take the scenic route on what would be the longest solo journey on a motorcycle I had ever made, 3,500km from southern England through France, Belgium, Germany, Denmark, the Faroe Islands and across Iceland. Arriving in Amesbury, Wiltshire, traffic was bumper to bumper on the A303, but on the bike, I was able to make good progress. At Stonehenge, instead of getting the bus to the actual site, I doubled back and found a turning onto a potholed lane where a few motorhomes were parked up. I had a picnic, and from across the field of sheep, peacefully observed the ancient stones and their swarm of visitors.After crossing the channel on Eurotunnel, I drove around 350km nearly every day as I made my way through Europe to the ferry in Hirtshals, in the north of Denmark. I stopped off at the homes of friends, or hotels when needed. As I drove further north the land transitioned from the green end of summer, to the burgundy of autumn. All 250km of tree-lined winding roads from Osnabrück to Hamburg were bathed in beautiful sunshine. National elections were coming up in a few weeks and posters were festooned everywhere. The occasional wrong turn had me driving past farmhouses and cornfields.In Hamburg I sailed around the city’s waterways on the no. 72 harbour commuter ferry, taking in the sights and the soothing sensation of being on a boat in calm water. The smokestacks of factories puffed swirling clouds into the blue sky as we floated past cranes and modern buildings.Arriving in Copenhagen, I headed straight to Wrenchmonkees, a custom motorcycle garage. Here Jonathan, who races professionally, invited me for a ride at Malmö Motorstadion the next day. Driving from Denmark to Sweden across the towering, 8km-long Øresund bridge had my heart pounding and a huge smile plastered on my face.The voyage from Hirtshals on the northern tip of Jutland to Tórshavn, capital of the Faroe Islands, takes 36 hours on the MS Norröna (Denmark to Iceland with a stop in Tórshavn from about €320 one-way low season with motorbike and some meals, single cabin, smyrilline). It was low season so the ship was not very crowded. Other passengers included senior tourist groups, young European travellers, and commuters. We sat on the top deck under heaters enjoying the view and draught beer.A day and a half after leaving Jutland we docked in Tórshavn, the capital of the Faroe Islands at 5am. I rolled off the ship in darkness. The ground was steady but my stomach still swayed. I slowly made my way up the harbour to the nearby Hotel Hafnia.The Faroes are an archipelago made up of 18 islands connected by sea tunnels, bridges and ferries. The next morning I drove to the island of Vágar in near zero visibility and strong winds. The winding mountain roads along rocky cliffs (without railings) were breathtaking but terrifying on the motorbike. I was grateful for the windless 5km sea tunnel that joins the main island of Streymoy (where Tórshavn is) to the island of Vágar.On Vágar I took a walk from my hotel. I could see roads snaking like a distant continuation of the path I was on, just beyond the ocean’s bay. Sheep and traditional black houses dotted the fjord which felt more sombre than the images I’d seen on Instagram.The 19-hour voyage to Iceland was forecast to be more turbulent than the one from Denmark. As soon as I checked in, I took motion sickness pills. With medication on my side, I spent the evening enjoying a meal of fish tempura and roasted vegetables despite the boat taking on six-metre swells.A calm sunrise arrival into Seyðisfjörður was overshadowed by news that a storm was due to hit the area that evening. I was booked into Grásteinn (doubles from about £150 B\u0026ampB) on Holt sheep farm in Þórshöfn, 225km to the north (five hours drive away) on a working sheep farm in Þórshöfn. If I left immediately, I would make it. The promise of friendly faces and roast lamb was enough to galvanise me. On just a couple of hours’ sleep, I began the ascent from Seyðisfjörður.Taking the ring road out of Egilsstaðir, the wind picked up and the chill began to penetrate. There was snow on the peaks ahead. After 83km I turned off onto Route 85 and climbed to Vöpnafjörður. This road traverses gorges and rivers. I felt like I was driving into endless sky.I was greeted at Grásteinn guesthouse by the dogs first, then the farmers Hildur and Siggi, their children and their German “workaway” Romi who showed me to my cabin. Unplugged from world media for weeks, I learned that the Iceland football team was due to play a key World Cup qualification match against Kosovo. Needless to say, the country was dizzy over it.The ram auction that Saturday in Raufarhöfn meant we would all go together. The farmers loaded their rams into a truck and I readied my bike for the one-hour drive to the Arctic Henge. After winding my way through the green and burnt-orange moss-covered lava fields, I turned into the stark area around Raufarhöfn. Not many tourists make it this far off the ring road, but the Arctic Henge is changing that. As the triangular peaks of the four gates emerged on the horizon, the hairs on the back of my neck stood up. A handful of tourists were walking among the stone columns and marvelling at their size with outstretched arms. I parked the bike and Romi drove up behind me. Grinning, I asked her to take a photo of me in full gear.It was October 7 and I had covered more than 3,500km. After one more night’s rest, I completed the journey to Reykajvík via the northern ring road stopping overnight in Akureyri. I then drove the familiar majestic winding blacktop roads towards Borgarnes on the west coast, across the bridge ning the Borgarfjörður fjord, and was home.

The most recent comments about Oliver or the show were on 14 June, before his segment on Xi aired, suggesting newer ones had been deleted.In his take down of Xi’s China, Oliver also highlighted the expansion of the social credit scoring system, the elimination of term limits made earlier this year, and China’s heavy economic influence around the world.“Under Xi Jinping China is becoming more authoritarian just as it has major plans for expansion on the world stage … China has significant economic leverage and it has been using that to silence criticism even when criticism is very much warranted.”The show ended with a parody of an advertisement promoting China’s massive Belt and Road infrastructure project with children singing, “This is the China Xi doesn’t want you to see, and that’s the reason why you better watch this guy.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a2e250caa55b53ff9f20ef9b51da3d5845e0d29a/120_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=48cc82ff3545400ac45d336020848ed4","title":"what we want from the game of thrones prequel hbo","story":"As HBO confirm the direction of its next Thrones project, one loyal subject makes the case for a savage successionThe only solace that can be taken from Game of Thrones coming to an end next year is the knowledge that our time in Westeros is far from over. Nary does a cash cow the size of GoT go unmilked, so we’ve got at least one more Thrones TV show coming our way.HBO has been busy developing “four to five” treatments for possible companion series. Each is a prequel of sorts to the main show, with none actually touching directly upon George RR Martin’s parent narrative. The names attached to these scripts are no two-bit hacks: Jane Goldman (Kick-Ass, Kingsman), Brian Helgeland (LA Confidential, Legend), Max Borenstein (Godzilla, Kong: Skull Island ), Carly Wray (Westworld, Mad Men) and Bryan Cogman (a Game of Thrones old-timer). In the end, HBO decided to take a punt on Jane Goldman’s idea: a pilot’s been ordered, and if it’s picked up Goldman and George RR Martin will act as co-creators of a whole new series set in the Thrones universe. We’ll likely see it in 2020, and Goldman will be steering the ship as showrunner. Itches of concern only arise when you start to pore through the details. HBO’s official statement reads: “Taking place thousands of years before the events of Game of Thrones, the series chronicles the world’s descent from the golden Age of Heroes into its darkest hour. And only one thing is for sure: from the horrifying secrets of Westeros’s history to the true origin of the white walkers, the mysteries of the east, to the Starks of legend … it’s not the story we think we know.”The Ringer recently scoured this opaque precis for clues as to where the series might go, and deduced that the “darkest hour” was the fabled Long Night, and the Stark of Legend was most likely Bran the Builder, who is said to have used sorcery to build The Wall, along with basically any other ancient structure in Westeros that wasn’t made of wattle and daub. We’ve seen the origins of the White Walkers already, of course – the Children of the Forest made them, the feckless little idiots – so we may be delving deeper into the forest imps’ war with the human invaders. You might be thinking, this is all great. That more Thrones can only be a good thing. That Jane Goldman and George RR Martin are so brilliant on their own that together they should probably fight crime or something. That this new series – with its mythic beings, magic walls, faery wars and Night Kings – will surely be epic fantasy on a scale never before seen on TV. And it will be. But that, right there, is the problem.As the show has grown in scope over the years, so too have its flaws become more numerous. Seasons six and seven, lacking solid, densely plotted George RR Martin source material to draw upon, upped the stakes in terms of spectacle, but at the cost of jettisoning the complex minutiae of political backstabbery that made the first few seasons so helplessly addictive. They were spectacular, yet illogical. Massive, yet weirdly weightless. No multimillion dollar set-piece, from the Battle of the Bastards to the death of Dany’s dragon, has ever come close to replicating the breathless, dizzying rug-pull of The Red Wedding. Or poor Prince Oberyn’s squishy eye-ectomy. Or Tyrion killing Shae. Or Ned Stark having his entire body chopped off. Or any of the gamechanging moments that were born from simple drama. Game of Thrones was never exactly a quiet, low-key kitchen-sink soap, but the genius of the early seasons lay in the underhand way in which fantasy elements were gradually smuggled in under the radar. Myth and magic were introduced early, yet so subtly that mainstream viewers who would usually balk at dragons and magic were hooked before they even realised they were being hoodwinked. It was, at its beginning and through to its peak, a political drama about the lengths people – fallible, vulnerable, rounded, real people – are willing to go to in the acquisition of power. It was the captivating brutality of the Game of Thrones itself. The action and fantasy were an, admittedly very welcome, bonus.According to Westerosian scholars (ie George RR Martin and the internet), it’s quite likely that Brandon Stark didn’t even exist – that he was, Ragnar Lothbrok-style, made up of the deeds of several iniduals, all rolled into one handy, pocket-sized myth. If so, why don’t we know who these people are? Getting down into the nitty gritty of these unknown heroes’ interactions, and the reasons behind their removal from the history books, would be one fascinating avenue to take. If Brandon is real, watching he and Lann the Clever (who founded House Lannister) squabble and bicker as they form proud dynasties that will still be squabbling and bickering 10,000 years later also promises for some delicious knife-in-back action. This new series will also be set within the era of the first Night’s Watch, and seeing the erstwhile sentries’ embryonic years would also be excellent. And not just to witness the moment someone tried to convince them that celibacy is the best way forward for everyone. We’ll only be on shakier, more BBC1-at-teatime ground if we end up with sillier characters such as The Grey King, who shacked up with a mermaid and lived for a millennium. Or too much of the Children of the Forest. Who, and this can’t be emphasised enough, really are a bunch of little pillocks.George RR Martin’s hands-on attitude with this new series is encouraging, as is Jane Goldman’s pedigree as a screenwriter. If they sit down together and agree that one good, believable, flawed character is worth a thousand dead CGI dragons, then we could be on to something very special. HBO will surely be hurling tens of millions of dollars at them. The very best thing they could do is resist the urge to spend them all. Goldman and Martin should, instead, get back to Thrones basics. Throw in some action, sure, but not to the detriment of the very same human drama that made Game of Thrones the phenomenon it became. Don’t let the tail wag the dragon, as it were. Give us murder and intrigue and betrayal and knotty, devious skulduggery in dark rooms. Oh, and if you can think of some way of getting The Hound in it too, then please also do that. Thanks."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2099bd402c979fd00b3f1d87c295b10c6a7fc111/0_0_2570_1542/master/2570.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cf1209b7deb733b534abc0febd697e52","title":"national enquirer michael cohen karen mcdougal subpoena","story":"Federal prosecutors are investigating Cohen’s links to $150,000 paid to Playboy model alleging Trump affairFederal prosecutors issued a subpoena to the National Enquirer’s publisher for records pertaining to a $150,000 payment the magazine made before the 2016 presidential election to Karen McDougal, a former Playboy model who has said she had an affair with Donald Trump.The subpoena, first reported by the Wall Street Journal, was issued this spring by prosecutors in the southern district of New York, who are investigating the former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen for alleged wire fraud, bank fraud and campaign finance violations.David Pecker, the National Enquirer publisher, is a friend and supporter of Trump. After paying McDougal six figures for exclusive rights to her story of an alleged affair with Trump, the magazine, which bolstered Trump throughout his presidential campaign, declined to publish the story.Prosecutors reportedly want to know whether a side deal was attached to the payment from Pecker to McDougal.Phone records show that Cohen and Pecker were in frequent contact around the time of the payment to McDougal in August 2016, the Journal quoted an unnamed source familiar with the matter as saying.Two months after the McDougal deal, Cohen arranged a $130,000 payment to the porn star Stormy Daniels, who had her own story of an alleged affair with Trump to tell. Daniels, whose legal name is Stephanie Clifford, has sued Trump to be released from a hush agreement.Both McDougal and Daniels were ostensibly represented in their respective six-figure deals by the same lawyer, Keith Davidson, whom Daniels has sued, alleging that Davidson “acted in concert” with Cohen to “manipulate” her. Davidson has denied all wrongdoing.It is unclear what involvement, if any, Cohen had in the National Enquirer deal with McDougal.FBI agents raided residences and an office tied to Cohen, who worked closely with Trump for 10 years, in April. Cohen has not been charged with a crime but is waging a court battle to limit prosecutors’ access to documents seized in the raid.The parent company of the National Enquirer, issued this statement to the Journal: “American Media Inc., has, and will continue to, comply with any and all requests that do not jeopardize or violate its protected sources or materials pursuant to our first amendment right.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/114c1973192d9ac9497f72454885130870d924fc/0_278_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f2c7abbcbf18f5331c0a43ef13cb52cf","title":"italys treatment of roma people reflects a centuries old prejudice","story":"History of persecution includes enslavement, forced sterilisation and massacresWhen Italy’s new government attacked the country’s Roma population, threatening to expel thousands from the country, they were tapping into centuries-old prejudices against the group.Persecution of the Roma in Europe dates back at least several hundred years. The Council of Europe details a history of extreme persecution including enslavement, forced sterilisation, separation from children and massacres.Roma have Indian roots, and migrated slowly westwards over hundreds of years, appearing in historical records from Europe by the 14th century. Originally nomadic, though now settled in many areas, they were first targeted by European officials over 500 years ago.“Roma were banned from the Holy Roman Empire in 1501 and, as of this date, could be caught and killed by any citizen,” the Council of Europe explains. In France less than two centuries later, Louis XIV ordered that all Gypsy men be condemned to forced labour for life without trial, women be sterilised and children be sent to poorhouses.As the Enlightenment spread across Europe in the 18th century, Roma were among the many excluded. Spain in 1749 launched an operation known as the “great Gypsy round-up” Roma were enslaved in parts of what is now Romania until 1856. The Austro-Hungarian empire ran a fierce “assimilation” policy that involved separating children and parents, the Council of Europe explains.Roma were among the targets of Nazi laws introduced in the 1930s, and Italy’s own fascist ethnic cleansing rules of the 1920s, and during the second world war hundreds of thousands were killed in massacres and at concentration camps.In the immediate aftermath of the war, many Roma concentration camp survivors were refused help and compensation. In the decades that followed, stigmatisation and discrimination has continued across much of Europe.As late as the 1970s, Switzerland was taking children from their parents, arguing that they couldn’t educate them to be good citizens. A recent study in Britain found a huge rise in Romany and Traveller families having their children taken away, a trend blamed on institutional prejudice. This decade alone they have been segregated in schools in Hungary, Czech Republic and Slovakia and databases or other surveys such as the one proposed in Italy are not unprecedented in other parts of Europe.Last year a Swedish appeals court ruled that police should pay compensation after setting up an illegal database of Roma family trees that included several thousand people, many of them children, or iniduals without any criminal record."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/761c7a25729fc8279e7c83b6882c568cc4aa1067/0_137_4096_2458/master/4096.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a3dcdb67ecf4f6b6467dc7e6f6dcf481","title":"panama papers firm mossack fonseca did not know who 75 of its clients were","story":"Mossack Fonseca made frantic efforts to discover its own clients’ identities as it fell under global scrutinyThe offshore firm at the heart of the Panama Papers leak did not know who as many as three-quarters of its clients were at the time of the exposé, according to an investigation.The Panamanian company Mossack Fonseca made frantic efforts to discover its clients’ identities in the spring of 2016 as it fell under global scrutiny.The Panama Papers are a leak of 11.5m files from the database of the world’s fourth biggest offshore law firm, Mossack Fonseca. The records were obtained from an anonymous source by\u0026nbspthe German newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung, which shared them with\u0026nbspa network of international partners, including the , in April 2016.The documents show the myriad ways in which the rich exploit secretive offshore tax regimes. Twelve national leaders were among 143 politicians, their families and close associates shown to have been using offshore tax havens. They included the Pakistani prime minister, Nawaz Sharif the former vice-president of Iraq, Ayad Allawi the president of Ukraine, Petro Poroshenko and the prime minister of Iceland, Sigmundur Davíð Gunnlaugsson.An offshore investment fund run by the father of the then British prime minister David Cameron\u0026nbspavoided paying tax in Britain by hiring residents of the Bahamas to sign its paperwork.The leak is larger than the\u0026nbspUS diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks in 2010, and the\u0026nbspsecret intelligence documents given to journalists by Edward Snowden in 2013.One client of the company also complained that the stories generated by the Panama Papers meant his customers would have to pay taxes.The revelations will harden the resolve of anti-corruption campaigners who have argued the offshore sector needs to become more transparent.Last month, they secured a major victory in the UK when MPs passed a law requiring British overseas territories, including the BVI, to create public registers of shell company owners.The extent of the firm’s record-keeping failures is revealed in a fresh leak of data from the company, which declared in March that it had gone out of business and was shutting down.The new material was obtained by the German newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung and shared with the US-based International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ).The new leak suggests Mossack Fonseca drafted reports for law enforcement concerning at least a dozen of its own clients following the Panama Papers, in some instances citing articles by journalists as supporting evidence.The firm also received a flurry of requests for information from law enforcement agencies, including the UK’s Serious Fraud Office.In one such instance, the firm did not know who owned an offshore company of interest, even though Mossack Fonseca staff were serving as the company’s nominee directors.Other instances of unusual practice appear to have continued despite exposure by reporters. According to records held by the ICIJ, one Mossack Fonseca employee was continuing to sign documents and attend the board meetings of several thousand offshore companies, despite having died in 2005.Amid pressure from regulators and law enforcement agencies, the firm also faced complaints from enraged clients. “Thanks to you, all the names of our customers have been known by the authorities of their countries,” wrote one. “Thanks to Mossack, customers have to pay income taxes.”At the time of the Panama Papers, Mossack Fonseca said: “We are responsible members of the global financial and business community” and denied any wrongdoing.Neither Jürgen Mossack nor Ramón Fonseca, the firm’s founders, responded to requests for comment from the ICIJ concerning the new leak.The Panama Papers brought a new level of public scrutiny to the role of offshore tax havens in tax fraud, money laundering and financial secrecy. The prime ministers of Iceland and Pakistan were forced to leave office as a result of separate scandals, and legislatures around the world passed new laws to tackle offshore crime following an international summit on tackling corruption hosted by the UK. German police are understood to have obtained a copy of the original Panama Papers data and shared it with several other countries to assist with criminal investigations. Last year the British government told parliament that four arrests had been made as part of 66 investigations into suspected tax evasion, and that three arrests had been made in relation to a suspected organised crime group.Several countries are understood to have raised millions in additional tax revenue thanks to the disclosures. HMRC’s chief executive officer told a parliamentary committee that it was expected the disclosures would bring in an extra £100m of revenue, while Germany was reported to have raised €140m (£123m) using the information.Despite the move to introduce transparency by the UK parliament last month, several of Britain’s overseas territories have refused to implement new legislation. The BVI has hired a law firm to explore a possible legal challenge against the transparency measure on constitutional grounds. The premier of the Cayman Islands, another British tax haven affected by the measure, attacked the vote as “reminiscent of the worst injustices of a bygone era of colonial despotism”.It was January 2017, and one fund manager had evidently had enough of Mossack Fonseca. Despite having been a client of the firm for years, he had just been informed that further to due diligence checks, the offshore services firm would be resigning as registered agent of his offshore company.“Thank you for your email,” began his response. “It is true that thanks to you (Panama Papers) in March 2016, all the names of our customers have been known by the authorities of their countries.”“Thanks to Mossack, customers have to pay income taxes.”The unusually frank complaint appears in the fresh leak of documents from the now redundant offshore firm, which became synonymous with offshore tax evasion and money laundering after its files were exposed in the Panama Papers two years ago. The original leak of the firm’s data, encompassing almost four decades of documents, emails and more, revealed for the first time the offshore financial interests of world leaders, celebrities and criminals, and prompted a firestorm of public debate about the ability of ultra-wealthy elites to effectively purchase exemptions from the tax laws that govern the majority of the world’s citizenry.Research by the ICIJ and its partners depicts a firm under scrutiny from law enforcement, regulators and politicians in Panama and around the world.A number of clients reported that banks had begun blocking transfers of funds to and from entities with “Mossack Fonseca” in their name in response to the scandal, the new material shows.Amid a desperate attempt to bring its compliance policies up to scratch while surviving the increased regulatory scrutiny, Mossack Fonseca also faced an onslaught of enraged and even abusive complaints from bankers and lawyers having to explain to their own clients why details of their offshore arrangements were appearing in newspaper articles.“I demand an explanation why your firm is so impossible to work with! In any properly regulated jurisdiction, a firm like yours would have been shut by the regulator!!! ... ” wrote one employee of a European financial firm.Mossack Fonseca seems to have aggravated some customers by continuing to charge its standard rates during the crisis, including fees for those who wanted to close down companies. “WHAT A BRUTALITY !!!! that you dare to send me an invoice for ‘the annual fee’,” wrote one client, corresponding directly with the firm.Internal document management also appears to have become more chaotic in the wake of the leak, resulting in Mossack Fonseca requesting information it already held or filing multiple incomplete requests. “We look like fucking amateurs,” wrote one customer after the firm asked it to obtain more information from its client. “A Mickey-Mouse operation.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1e452b7816f63b27de1bf55216a90ba5d40c5d8c/89_383_2664_1598/master/2664.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=043f19927871d258ce0edd7cf9c1793b","title":"jacinda ardern babywatch new zealand media","story":"Live blogs have fired up across the country as the nation – and world – waits for the prime minister to give birthThe media arrived at Auckland hospital in the predawn hours. They set up their cameras, notepads at the ready. Commuters exchanged knowing looks in the streets. This was the day. Nine floors up, New Zealand’s prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, was in labour.The phenomenon that has become known as #babywatch across the country had officially begun.Since Ardern announced her pregnancy, on 19 January, shortly after winning office, she has gained increasing recognition on the world stage. She appeared in countless interviews with international media and in the pages of Vogue. It would be the first time in 30 years that a nation’s leader had a child while in office.It was also the winter solstice, a good time to plant garlic a “great day for having a baby”, wrote one commentator on Twitter.The day began early with an announcement from the prime minister’s office that Ardern and her partner, Clarke Gayford, had driven themselves to hospital at 5.50am. Ardern then handed the official duties to the acting prime minister, Winston Peters.The live blogs fired up within moments – except one that had been going for several days already. In the absence of an actual baby, they recounted minutiae: the quality of scones available in the hospital canteen, the number of patients the hospital cares for each year, photographs of other politicians with other babies.The Spinoff interviewed a man called Steve, who was on a “smoko break”. Steve said he had not heard about the prime minister’s baby. “It’s a bit out of the blue,” he said.Other news outlets filled the air time with coverage of Ardern’s interactions with her nieces, her previous statements on why asking a woman in job interviews about their intentions to start a family was unacceptable and why this pregnancy meant so much to a generation of New Zealanders. One blog reported the most amusing comments from the Daily Mail’s story. The nation’s most-read Chinese-language news service produced a memorable composite image of Ardern, Gayford and a baby’s dummy. Another website compiled a playlist to welcome the infant, including the Chemical Brothers song Hey Boy, Hey Girl and Europe’s The Final Countdown. The biggest actual news was that Ardern had been texting her staff from the hospital. The content of the texts was not known but apparently did not relate to the progress of her labour. Meanwhile, the betting operator TAB had a “phantom market” of potential names inspired by famous New Zealand figures, along with some others. The country was upbeat – and the feeling seeped beyond its borders.The New York Times suggested it was a rare opportunity for New Zealanders to get excited about something. Many had taken to knitting for the incoming baby as part of a #knitforjacinda movement. Others had gifted Ardern baby clothes in preparation. At her last public outing, at an agricultural show, members of the public took to trying to rub her belly and wish her luck.Some wore their joy on their sleeve.“It felt like Christmas today on Lambton Quay,” a commentator, Morgan Godfrey, wrote on Twitter. “People were smiling at each other, the ‘you know’ kind of smile.”But beyond that some suggested this moment was worth something more than the usual celebrations of an impending child.“She’s showing that women can procreate while campaigning, negotiating coalition deals, deflecting sexist comments about babies, and just generally going about their everyday duties,” wrote a columnist, Michelle Duff.Not everyone was as enthused.The opposition National party MP Judith Collins asked for the media coverage to take a break, after learning that a security guard had moved a reporter who was filming in the wrong place.By early afternoon the baby still had not come. The hospital had set up a media centre complete with food for waiting reporters. The hashtag #isithereyet began circulating. The wait was well and truly on.Ardern will take six weeks of maternity leave but will be contactable if there are any urgent or major developments. Gayford will be a stay-at-home parent, or “first bloke”, as he has referred to himself. Peters told reporters at parliament that he did not consider this a historic day and said he would just be getting on with the job. He was “unfazed” when he received the news he was now acting prime minister, he said. “When you’ve been around as long as I have, nothing’s unusual.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b51c891f46954862b0d622f6c9e8bf7d85aae902/0_142_640_384/master/640.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=55aca60b40ad024480d17107d56e6138","title":"jacinda ardern new zealand prime minister birth baby girl","story":"Ardern and partner Clarke Gayford announce ‘our little girl has finally arrived!’ The New Zealand prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, has given birth to her first child amid a flurry of excitement in New Zealand.Ardern posted the news to her Facebook page, saying her daughter was born at 4.45pm. “Welcome to our village wee one,” she wrote, next to a picture of her and partner Clarke Gayford cuddling the newborn.“Feeling very lucky to have a healthy baby girl that arrived at 4.45pm weighing 3.31kg (7.3lb). Thank you so much for your best wishes and your kindness. We’re all doing really well thanks to the wonderful team at Auckland City hospital.”Earlier, a statement from the prime minister’s office said Ardern and Gayford had arrived at Auckland hospital at 5.50am on Thursday.Winston Peters, the deputy prime minister, is now acting prime minister. The head of the populist New Zealand First party had already taken over some of Ardern’s duties, including running cabinet meetings in Wellington, while she stayed close to home in Auckland.After Ardern went into hospital, Peters said in a statement: “It’s a happy day and on behalf of the coalition government we wish her and Clarke all the very best.”The former prime minister Helen Clark told Radio NZ that the birth was a fine example to young people in New Zealand.“Jacinda’s done it her way, what a remarkable story.“She’s taken it in her stride, New Zealanders have taken it in their stride … all round I think we’re showing huge maturity as a country with this.”US ambassador Scott Brown offered his congratulations via Twitter, as did a host of Ardern’s political colleagues.Ardern’s due date was Sunday and the country had been gripped by a sense of excitement and anticipation in recent days. On Thursday, many major media outlets set up live feeds on their websites with rolling coverage and local journalists camped at the hospital.Ardern has said there would be little disruption during her time off because she would stay in regular contact with Peters and be involved in major decisions.Ardern, 37, is only the second world leader to give birth while in office – the first being Pakistan’s Benazir Bhutto in 1990.Ardern has said she will have six weeks’ maternity leave before heading back to parliament. Gayford, a television presenter, will become “first bloke” and a stay-at-home father to the child.Ardern had her last pre-birth day in parliament at the start of the week. Her last public outing was at the national Fieldays agricultural show where many fans spent the time wishing her well, and some tried to touch her stomach.Many will be watching Peters closely while is acting prime minister – he has already backed away from a hallmark crime and justice policy and revealed he is suing heads of departments of his own government."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/92fa642957f21b191966ecc9c4bba43faeb9fa69/0_287_7174_4304/master/7174.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=66b684cdbf13e3024c38c210c1d2ac9b","title":"musical youth kent school supajam turning teenagers lives around","story":"SupaJam is proving a hit with music courses for young people who have fallen out of educationIt is midday, and a teenage boy has been removed from class for causing trouble.

This summer the students have been given their own stage to curate at the Black Deer music festival near Tunbridge Wells.News doesn\u0027t always have to be bad – indeed, the relentless focus on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame risks convincing the public that the world is hopeless and there is nothing we can do.This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come.Readers can recommend other projects, people and progress that we should report on by contacting us at theupside@the“Did you know Albert Einstein played the violin?” asks second-year student Katie, 17. “A teacher told his parents they should take him out of school, he wasn’t smart enough. And then they bought him a violin and he sailed through.”Katie has also experienced the power of music. Bullying and family problems shattered her GCSE year, and with only a scattering of Cs and Ds she felt she had nowhere to turn. At SupaJam she has become a star pupil, even creating her own blog about music and mental health. “In formal education they don’t take into account anything you might struggle with. You might be having a bad day but that isn’t the person you are,” she says. “Nick and David actually give you a chance.”SupaJam’s co-founders can identify with their pupils. They met at 15, both kicked out of school without qualifications. “We were the naughty boys, but we were lucky because we had nice families. We weren’t abandoned by the adult world, like some of these kids,” says Stillwell. After setting up their own company they offered an internship scheme, but when it attracted only middle-class children they decided to try something different. The initial idea was to help six local teenagers – they now have 70 pupils and 31 staff, including welcomers to meet students as they arrive safeguarding specialists in every class and one-to-one maths and English tutors. Getting the young people into work is the primary objective. “They will often be the only person in education or employment in their family,” says Court. “Sometimes we have to battle with the parents because the kids can earn more money if they’re out on the streets dealing than in school.”While the special requirements of the students vary – from learning difficulties to physical disabilities – they are not taught separately, although all staff are trained in dealing with disabled students. “We decided to mix them all up and they naturally started to self-support each other,” says Court. “They don’t label one another, they just get along. It puts all of us to shame. These kids are inspirational.”Ahead of the Black Deer festival, the students have been working with professionals on every aspect of production, from choosing and booking the acts to running the sound and lighting. Gill Tee, the festival’s co-founder, says she could have found herself in a similar position to the students when she was young.Growing up on a council estate, her teenage brother was murdered when she was 12. “I used to nick my mum’s tranquillisers,” says Tee. “I wanted to escape the pain at home, seeing my beautiful mum shattered.” But she stayed out of trouble, and began her music career making tea at Capital Radio. “It shows these kids that they can do the same.”Last year the first three SupaJam graduates were accepted into university, a proud moment for the school. But taking up those places proved intimidating for the students. Stillwell and Court responded by setting up a charity that will run a mentorship programme and send tutors along with the students for the first six weeks of their studies.Their dreams for SupaJam are even bigger: plans to open a second base in Ramsgate, and then to expand nationwide. “These kids are too young to abandon,” says Stillwell. “This is our society and we have to fight for them.”"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"F\u0026oacutersa says failure to allow additional time off is breach of Labour Court recommendationsIGTV will intensify competition among ad-supported streaming services such as YouTubeExclusion zones needed to stop protesters from intimidating women accessing servicesEoghan Murphy tells Oireachtas committee some people \u0026lsquoobsessed\u0026rsquo with the wrong issueLeo Varadkar warns UK \u0026lsquowill not be trusted\u0026rsquo if it fails to honour Border commitmentChemist Michael Braungart suggests products could end their life as biological nutrientsThat\u0026rsquos Maths: This Greek masterpiece is an enduring paean to the power of geometryJudge says former banker engaged in \u0026lsquogrossly reprehensible behaviour\u0026rsquo in 2008 conspiracyVery significant discrepancies in waiting times depending on application process chosenIssue has potential implications for up to 1,000 casesFormer Anglo chief executive likely to serve 3\u0026frac12 years before being due for releaseMinister for Foreign Affairs backs all-party D\u0026aacuteil motion calling for immediate policy reversalChief executive tells Oireachtas hearing of difficulties in advancing reform at agencySinn F\u0026eacutein leader has hour-long meeting with British PM in Downing StreetBirth rate expected to dip significantly around 2030Former chief\u0026rsquos jail term reflects lead role at Anglo but others are serving longer in UK, USJoe Mulholland says organisers are \u0026lsquoworking progressively\u0026rsquo to address programme failingsCars and drugs seized after 18-month stakeout\u0026lsquoI did not intend to kill her, I intended to set her free,\u0026rsquo says Paul Horgan (27)Garda\u0026iacute need instant access to drivers\u0026rsquo records, D\u0026aacuteil committee hears"},{"url":null,"title":"children heard crying and calling for parents in border facility recording","story":"Read and listen to the full story at:-  June 19, 2018Trump administration policy labelled \u0026lsquoinhumane\u0026rsquo and \u0026lsquoheartbreaking\u0026rsquo   June 19, 2018President blames Congress and loopholes in the law for \u0026lsquoillegal immigration crisis\u0026rsquo   June 20, 2018President tells Republicans he is \u0026lsquo1,000 per cent\u0026rsquo behind immigration reform efforts   June 20, 2018Word of Trump\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquozero tolerance\u0026rsquo border policy has sowed confusion on migrant trail "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3538631.1529565010!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"roscommon county council staff strike over flexi leave","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe council said Fórsa  is seeking to have an additional 13 flexible days leave per year. Photograph: iStock More than 100 hundred Roscommon County Council staff are staging a one-day strike in a dispute over flexi-leave that could have implications for all public service union members.The CEO of Roscommon County Council, Eugene Cummins is defending changes he has made to flexi-leave schemes for staff at the local authority. He says he is complying with recommendations made by the Labour Court last year.The Labour Court had ruled that Roscommon council staff should have the same rights as their colleagues through the local government sector. The staff’s trade union Fórsa said no worker had been approved for flexi-leave in the past year.Fórsa said the council’s failure to allow workers take additional time off is anti-family and in breach of binding Labour Court recommendations issued last year.Mr Cummins told RTÉ’s Morning Ireland that flexi-leave must be approved by a line manager based on the council’s business and operational plans so that continuity of business can be maintained.The council said the union is seeking to have an additional 13 flexible days leave per year, resulting in some staff having the potential to avail of in excess of 50 days leave per annum.The widely available flexible working scheme allows staff to accumulate an extra day a month - up to 13 days per year - by working additional hours during their normal week.Mr Cummins pointed out that at present the staff can decide when to work the extra hours rather than when they are needed. “They took it at will. It has to be managed, approved and should be generated when it is needed.”Today’s strike has national implications for thousands of public service workers in Government and local authorities.Mr Cummins explained that he conducted a review in 2016 that involved extensive analysis. This was the first time the flexi-time process had been analysed in 20 years.“No one has anything to worry about if the hours are generated in the way they are meant to be generated,” he said.

Mr Varadkar said other countries could not trust the word of a country that does not stick to deals it has already done. The Taoiseach was speaking ahead of a visit to Dublin on Thursday by European Commission president Jean Claude Juncker and Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator. European commissioner Phil Hogan will also be part of the delegation.Mr Juncker will address a joint sitting of the Dáil and Seanad, and Mr Varadkar will hold a dinner in Mr Juncker’s honour in Dublin Castle on Thursday night. Mr Varadkar is also expected to speak with Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, by telephone.It is expected that the senior EU figures will express support for Ireland as the Brexit talks stall over the issue of the Border between Ireland and Northern Ireland. The Taoiseach said it called Britain’s ability to do a deal into question.“If it is a country that is talking about going global, talking about making trade deals all over the world, how could anyone make a deal with a country that doesn’t stand by its commitments?” the Taoiseach asked. Next week’s summit was initially intended to reach agreement on the so-called “backstop”, but this timeline has been pushed back to later in the year.Mr Varadkar has already pushed the timeline out, and even suggested that a deal on the backstop – which prevents a hard border even in a “no-deal” Brexit scenario – may not happen until November.The Taoiseach said he expected that the EU would “stand behind Ireland”. Senior figures in Dublin have suggested that the UK’s transition period after Brexit formally takes effect next March may be threatened.Earlier this month a British government proposal that the Border “backstop” arrangement be extended to the whole of the UK was rejected by Mr Barnier. The Taoiseach said there has not been “sufficient progress” from Britain in recent months. He said the backstop had been agreed in principle in December. “I had further progress in March where they accepted there had to be a backstop written as part of the Withdrawal Agreement, but since then, quite frankly, progress has stalled. What I want all of Europe to do is continue to stand behind Ireland, and to say to the United Kingdom that they have to honour the commitments they made.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

They’re going into the June summit with no intention of having any kind of definitive or substantial conclusion. They are disavowing the backstop. Not alone do they not have an operable, acceptable proposal of their own, they have put clear blue water between themselves and what was agreed in December and what was set out in March,” she told The . “I think this now calls for the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste to take a very firm stand and indeed for our European partners. They cannot facilitate British game-playing when we know that the sole concern here is to move to the next phase of the negotiations, really with no progress and much less a definitive answer.” Ms McDonald said she was not calling for the negotiations to be halted until more progress was made on Ireland’s concerns, including a backstop to guarantee that there will be no hard border. “We need to go back to first principles and the initial assertion that the budget, citizenship issues and the issues of Ireland were prerequisites. Or to use Donald Tusk’s phrase, a policy of Ireland first. Because what is happening here is a reality of Ireland last, Irish considerations not at all,” she said. “I think that is very dangerous and I think it would be wrong for our Government at home or for our European partners to allow that to persist. And I’m saying that in the discussions, it now needs to be made absolutely clear to the British side that they will not skip on to the issues of the new relationship and their withdrawal in the absence of an operable proposal that protects Irish interests and the Good Friday Agreement, the status quo in other words on the island of Ireland.” Ms McDonald was accompanied in Downing Street by Sinn Féin’s leader in Northern Ireland, Michelle O’Neill, and the party’s new MP for West Tyrone, Órfhlaith Begley.

Thank you, Ms Ardern said in a statement.She added that both mother and daughter are doing well, as she praised medical staff.In a picture posted on Instagram with her partner Clarke Gayford, 40, and their new baby in hospital, Ms Ardern said she was feeling very lucky.Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters has now taken over as acting prime minister.However, she said she would remain in charge by continuing to read cabinet papers during her time away from office.Jacinda Ardern, right, addresses Parliament in Wellington, New Zealand, earlier this monthThe leader plans to take six weeks of maternity leave before returning to work. Such is her dedication to work that Mr Gayford, a television presenter, posted a picture on Twitter of Ms Ardern continuing to read official papers in the hours before she gave birth.Ms Ardern, who was elected in October, revealed in January that she and Mr Gayford were expecting their first child.The first world leader to give birth while in office in modern times was Benazir Bhutto, the late former Prime Minister of Pakistan, in January 1990.Jacinda Ardern and her partner arrive at Buckingham Palace in April to attend The Queen\u0026#39s Dinner during The Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting But Ms Ardern previously downplayed the significance of having a baby while in office.Lots of people juggle a lot of things in their personal and private lives, and I\u0027m not unusual in that, she said. Plenty of women have multitasked before me, and I want to acknowledge that.Video: Jacinda Ardern announcing her pregnancyThe birth capped an eventful year for Ms Ardern who became prime minister, three months after inheriting the leadership of the Labour Party when it was languishing in the polls.Congratulations quickly flooded in from around the world and across the political spectrum, with New Zealand opposition leader Simon Bridges among those to offer his congratulations.Being parents is a joy and a privilege and we are sure your new arrival will fill your lives with all the happiness our children have ours, he said.And Helen Clark, New Zealand\u0027s first woman prime minister from 1999 to 2008, said it was a proud day ... gender quality in action.Ms Ardern has said she plans to return to work at the beginning of August.Then, Mr Gayford will take care of the baby and will travel with his partner between their Auckland home and the capital, Wellington, as well on international engagements.Jacinda Ardern and her partner Clarke Gayford speak to the media after announcing her pregnancyMs Ardern worked until late into her pregnancy, regularly encountering members of the public who touched her stomach and passed on gifts.It\u0027s been great, she told reporters at her last major public event before giving birth. New Zealanders are incredibly generous people and have been generous in their support of me regardless of the politics just as another human being going into a new stage of life. Video: Election of New Zealand\u0027s second female leaderMs Ardern\u0027s plans for a family had sparked a sexism row during the election when a television host quizzed her on the issue, saying voters had a right to know before they cast their ballots.She rejected the line of questioning as unacceptable, saying pregnancy and child rearing should not hinder women\u0027s opportunities in the workplace.It is a woman\u0027s decision about when they choose to have children and it should not predetermine whether or not they are given a job or have job opportunities, she said then.Please review our commenting policyNew York mayor \u0026#39shocked\u0026#39 that migrant kids as young as nine months secretly sent to his cityNew \u0026#39witness protection scheme\u0026#39 for whistle-blowers exposing technology industry \u0026#39wrongdoing\u0026#39When is the summer solstice?

Though it is very difficult to imagine what a future alien race might do, it is likely they will search out ways of harnessing renewable energy, such as building power plants around stars – those structures, known as Dyson spheres, have never been seen but are the object of keen astrophysical investigation.But the new paper makes clear that could only work for so long, and would become impossible once the universe filled with dark energy and the stars were too far apart. That would force them to reach out, grabbing stars before they become inaccessible.Given the inevitability of the encroaching horizon, any sufficiently advanced civilization that is determined to maximize its ability to utilize energy will expand throughout the universe, attempting to secure as many stars as possible before they become permanently inaccessible, the paper reads.To make sure they didn\u0027t get lost, the civilisations would be able to move the stars closer to their home – with the hope that they would eventually become stuck in their own orbit, and would not stray too far away to become useful.Having worked out what such activity might look like, the paper then aims to look at how we might be able to see if that activity is happening already. If it were, we would be able to look for stars that seem to be moving in an unexpected way, or to spot holes in galaxies where a star might normally be expected.The Independent\u0027s bitcoin group on Facebook is the best place to follow the latest discussions and developments in cryptocurrency.

This was a matter of procedure, not discrimination.“King’s College is a rich and erse community, and take the wellbeing of its students and staff extremely seriously. We remain committed to being an inclusive and welcoming environment in which to work and study. We categorically deny that the incident referred to was in any way racist.”A spokesperson for King\u0027s College said it had completed its investigation and cleared its porters.\u0026nbsp“Michael Proctor, who is the Provost of King’s College, did speak to Dr Gopal. However, the account of the incident from her perspective was taken from the witness testimony from her Twitter, they said.Cambridge and Oxford have come under criticism for the small number of black students which are\u0026nbspadmitted each year.Last month, it was revealed more than one in four of Oxford’s colleges failed to admit a single black British student each year between 2015 and 2017.Figures revealed several of the most prestigious colleges – including Balliol, University and Magdalen – each admitted two black British students as undergraduates during the three-year period.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

That is why we expect heads to put in place strong policies that support their staff in tackling poor behaviour.”Ms Spieman will back calls for heads to ban mobile phones at school, saying it can create disruption in class.“I want us to look just as hard at low level disruption, which stops pupils learning and which can make the job of classroom management miserable,” she will say.“Technology has made the challenge of low level disruption even worse,” Ms Spielman will warn.“I am yet to be convinced of the educational benefits of all day access to ‘Snapchat’ and the like and the place of mobile phones in the classroom seems to me dubious at best.”Her comments come after the\u0026nbspculture secretary, Matt Hancock, called on heads to ban mobile phones, saying he admired those who do not allow the device to be used during the school dayOfsted researchers are currently designing a study to assess the extent to which students are being hidden away during school inspections – and whether any action should be taken to address it.Malcolm Trobe, deputy general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: “Rumours about badly behaved children being hidden from inspectors are just that – rumours.“It is not an acceptable practice and we look forward to seeing how Ofsted intends to assess the extent of this issue.”Mr Trobe added: “We can assure the chief inspector that schools do not shy away from putting in place strong behaviour policies and that they are well aware of the importance of a well-ordered and disciplined environment as a cornerstone for effective learning.“They decide on the nature of sanctions based on their knowledge and experience of what is most effective in their school, and it is important that this remains a matter of professional judgement rather than an expectation that certain sanctions will be used.”UK news in picturesFamily members of those who died in Gosport War Memorial Hospital gather today after a public inquiry found that up to 650 patients died between 1989 and 2000 from lethal doses of opiate medication that was delivered “without medical justification”Former TV presenter John Leslie leaves Edinburgh Sheriff Court, he is accused of putting his hand down a woman\u0027s trousers as they danced at her hen night.Prime Minister Theresa May finishes speaking following visiting patients at the Royal Free Hospital in London.

Flat desert on either side, a few lights.\u0026nbspThe Moroccan traveller Ibn Battuta passed this way on camel back in 1326, and wrote of its emphatic wilderness: “He who enters it is lost and he who leaves it is born.”Before mass tourism ruined them for a second time, I’d travelled to the so-called “lost” cities of Petra, Machu Picchu and Angkor Wat.\u0026nbspMy destination tonight was the isolated sandstone valley eulogised by Charles Doughty, the first European to enter it\u0026nbspin 1876, as “the fabulous Mada’in Saleh\u0026nbspwhich I was come from far countries to seek in Arabia”.The prospect of following in Doughty’s flapping shadow gave me a jolt of anticipation that I hadn’t experienced since my twenties.\u0026nbspDoughty’s classic book Arabia Deserta was championed by his friend TE\u0026nbspLawrence, who later used it as a military textbook, as the greatest record of adventure and travel in our language.It begins with Doughty trying to smuggle himself into Mada’in Saleh in the guise of a poor Syrian pilgrim.\u0026nbspEven up until recently few Europeans have visited this cradle of forgotten civilisations, which, though designated a World Heritage Site in 2008, remains a blank page on the archaeological record, closed off by geography, politics, religion.“Visitors last year from abroad? I can say zero,” my guide Ahmed tells me.Mada\u0027in\u0026nbspSaleh\u0026nbspnear Al-Ula\u0026nbsphave survived for 2,000 yearsThis is set to change. Last July, under the impetus of Saudi Arabia’s progressive new Crown Prince, Mohammed Bin Salman, or “MBS” as he is popularly known, a Royal Commission took charge of Mada’in Saleh and its surrounds – “the only crown jewel of a site the country possesses,” says one of the archaeologists recruited to excavate it.In December, public access was halted first in order to survey what actually is there, next to develop a strategy for protecting it, and then to open up Mada’in Saleh to the outside world. My advance visit is aimed at providing an amuse-bouche, as it were.In the bright morning sunlight, Ahmed escorts me through locked gates, past the German-built railway-line linking Damascus with Medina, which Lawrence bombed (“there are still local tribes which call their sons Al-Orans”), to the celebrated Nabatean rock tombs.Doughty first heard about these in Petra, 300 miles north. Fifty years earlier, an awe-struck British naval commander had gazed in disbelief at Petra’s imperishable Treasury, murmuring, as many continue to do: “There is nothing in the world that resembles it.” He was wrong.If a little less rosier than her sister city, Mada’in Saleh shares her capacity to stagger.\u0026nbspOut of the flat desert, one after another, the ornate facades rise into sight, 111 of them, carved into perpendicular cliffs up to four storeys high, their low doorways decorated by Alexandrian masons in the first century AD, with Greek triangles, Roman pilasters, Persian flowers, Egyptian sphinxes, birds.“This is a twin to Petra,” Ahmed says. Except that in Petra we would be bobbing among crowds.Ahmed\u0026nbspis descended from a long line of imamsStanding in reverent silence, with the valley to ourselves, I recall how the Victorian artist who supplied the first images of Petra to the world, David Roberts, responded to that other city. “I turned from it at length with an impression which will be effaced only by death.”These tombs were carved for the Nabatean tribes who ruled this region for 300 years until the Romans annexed them in 106AD. Nomads who had settled and grown wealthy, the Nabateans controlled the lucrative spice route from the Mediterranean to the Red Sea.Then, like the civilisations they’d replaced, the Dedanites, the Lihyanites, the Thamuds, they galloped off into obscurity. Their tombs were looted: the acacia doors plundered for firewood, the marble statues melted to make lime for plaster, the porphyry urns smashed.All that survives of their caravan city, Hegra, is a flat expanse behind a wire fence: “her clay-built streets are again the blown dust in the wilderness,” Doughty wrote.The same desolation holds true for the still more ancient Biblical city of Dedan, situated on the lip of an oasis a few minutes drive way. To visit both sites is to gain the sense of a narrative even now being worked out.\u0026nbspUntil the 20th\u0026nbspcentury the story of these civilisations was scrawled on the rocks in Nabatean or Thamudic script. Ahmed leads me between two steep cliffs to the oldest inscription, written 6,000 years ago.Tombs in Mada\u0027in Saleh were decorated by Alexandrian masons in the first century with Greek, Roman and Persian symbolsThe ancient Biblical city of Dedan is situated on the lip of an oasisCliffs formed out of red and black sandstone have eroded into crazy, hallucinatory shapes such as elephants, mushrooms, and sealsAncient Dedan inscriptions.

Ahmed could be speaking of the cavity in the historical record when he says, “They were making sacrifices to one god, Dhu-Ghaibat, which means ‘the one who is absent’.”Out in the desert, the wind has chiselled its own mysterious deities and hieroglyphs. The scene is stunning. In Petra, which forms part of the same massif, David Roberts threw away his pencil in despair at being able to convey it, believing that the ruins “sink into insignificance when compared with these stupendous rocks”.It’s hard to disagree. Cliffs formed out of red and black sandstone have eroded into crazy, hallucinatory shapes: elephants, mushrooms, braying seals. If they were transcribed into music, it would be Wagnerian.They make you believe in mountain gods, I tell Ahmed, who smiles. “I never try smoking weed, but when I hear someone react, I feel like that. It makes you high, naturally.”For sheer high spirits, no one yields to the British archaeologist I meet that night. Jamie Quartermain is part of an international team employed since March to survey these sites.A surveyor who pioneered the use of drones, Quartermain says: “We’ve been wanting to get involved here, but Saudi has been a closed shop, a completely untapped reserve.The perception is that it’s big, open desert. When I tried to find out anything about it, there was essentially one book. The discovery that there are so many archaeological sites is a big shock for most people. It was a big shock for me.”Advised by the Royal Commission to expect 450 unexcavated sites, Quartermain estimates the truer number between 6,000-10,000.\u0026nbsp“The survival of the archaeology is remarkable, some of the best condition remains I’ve ever seen. We’re not finding it close to the surface, it’s above surface, well and truly visible.”Dedan\u0026nbspinscriptions. Holes in the rock floor denote a sacrificial spot from the time of the DedanitesDeploying a drone, he has begun creating a three-dimensional textural surface of the area. Already, what he has found is ground-breaking. “You can see all the archaeology jumping out and biting you on the bottom.”When, aged 20, I visited Petra, sleeping in one of the caves, I talked to the head of the Bdoul tribe, allegedly descendants of the Nabateans, who told me: “We have a saying that the more wealth you have, the more brain cells you need to be able to cope with it.What impresses about MBS’s plan for Mada’in Saleh is his determination to use his nation’s resources to avoid the pitfalls of Petra.“Wadi Rum is pretty disastrous,” says Chris Tuttle, an American archaeologist seconded to the project. Tuttle spent many years excavating in Petra. He saw at first hand the ruinous impact of tourism, both on the ruins and the local community.By contrast, in Al-Ula, the local town for Mada’in Saleh, there has been a concerted drive to educate the locals, giving scholarships to 150 children, but also to attract experts armed with the latest methodolOne reason for the blankness on Saudi Arabia’s archaeological map, says Tuttle, has been the resistance of conservative religious leaders to question their history. “You don’t need to study the past when you’ve been given a manual from God.”Suddenly, a multi-thousand-year-old story has become an open book, not a closed one, and the revelation it contains could be a complex of sites more significant even than Petra.\u0026nbspMy guide Ahmed Alimam is a perfect representative of Al-Ula’s past and future. He comes from a long line of imams descended from a grand tribal judge who arrived c1400 in Al Ula’s “old town”Abandoned in 1983, the year of Ahmed’s birth, this haunting labyrinth of mud houses and twisting streets replaced Dedan and Hegra. It was built using stones from those cities.

He shows me the mosque, erected over the spot where the Prophet Mohammed stopped in 630AD, and with a goat bone drew in the sand the direction of Medina Ahmed’s uncle was the last imam.Iranians are angry with Israel and Saudi Arabia, not just TrumpSaudi Arabia to build giant $9bn oil complex with French company TotalSaudis \u0027to cut off Qatar\u0027 with canal, nuclear dump and military baseSaudi Arabian Prince toured Hollywood and Harvard on trip to USAnd a modern inscription: the name “Charles”, scratched on the oat-coloured mud wall not, as momentarily I’d hoped, by Charles Doughty, but by Prince Charles (in 2015, with his key), and below it the Islamic translation.During the Islamic period, Al-Ula, or El-Ally as Doughty knew it, became an important station on the haj road south, and marked the last place where Christians were permitted to travel.\u0026nbspIbn Battuta described how pilgrim caravans paused here for four days to resupply and wash, and to leave any excess baggage with the townspeople “who are known for their trustworthiness”.“I hope we are still doing our best to be like that,” Ahmed says. “You can try, if you want, to leave something.”The only thing I left behind after my four days here was an urge to come back.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

When I did, one asked:\u0026nbsp“Can we pray for you?”I asked why they wanted to pray for me, and the same person answered that they felt called by God to walk the streets of DC\u0026nbspand let God’s voice tell them who might be “broken” or otherwise need prayer.As a Christian, I’m opposed to neither prayer nor people praying specifically for me, at least not when it’s done in good faith.But I’m also a transgender woman, and I was dressed in gorgeous makeup and clothing and earrings. I sure caught the gist of why these folks happened upon me to offer prayer.My introduction to Christianity was in evangelical churches. For years, I navigated conservative religious spaces, where I encountered bigotry and attempts to shame LGBT+\u0026nbsppeople and women as often as I found warmhearted people eager to serve others.There was more than a little racism, too. I’ve heard the statement “I’ll pray for you” said with love, and with judgment and scorn. I know the difference, and the folks who confronted me outside the cafe were making their judgement clear.Instead of a theological debate that usually goes nowhere for lack of good faith in discussion, I wanted them to feel what it’s like to have someone supposedly approach in love but inflict pain and discomfort. Perhaps that’s what it takes. A forced perspective in empathy. Why not try that approach?I could have ignored them but I’ve had it with some evangelicals giving a bad name to their community by insisting on defining people’s humanity for them. These three assumed I was broken because of my gender identity. They saw the constellation of my personhood through a backward telescope.It angered me that the whole of my being could be reduced to their flawed understanding of LGBT+\u0026nbsppeople, a view that could easily be revised if only they would take the time to get to know me instead of assuming they already did.So I would be damned if I would let them interrupt my Sunday afternoon coffee when I certainly wasn’t bothering them.I asked their spokeswoman if she understood how it might look to be searching for “broken” people to pray for, and specifically pick out a random transgender person. And they looked more than taken aback.I stood up, smiling but internally annoyed, and asked them what the Book of Matthew says about prayer. Their eyes went wide. One guy stammered nervously, clearly having trouble answering the question.The other two were just as flummoxed, ambushed by the idea that the “broken” transgender person was asking a simple question about a common verse on prayer in Matthew.For those who don’t know, Matthew is the first book in the New Testament and one of the three Synoptic Gospels, each of which are narratives of the life of Christ, frequently using the same stories, often with identical wording.While all three contain instruction on prayer, I reached for Matthew 18:20 because of its strong presence in the evangelical community and its common misapplication by members. In short, it reads: “For where two or three are gathered in my name, there am I with them.”Those up on their biblical knowledge might wonder why I didn’t turn to Matthew 6:5-7, scathing verses that call out hypocrites who are performative in their Christianity, telling them to pray in private rather than out on the streets so that they might be seen by others.It’s a good one that, unsurprisingly, is ignored in evangelical circles. They know it’s there, but it’s inconvenient.The verse I selected hits hard instead because it’s so commonly heard before a group prayer in evangelical churches. There, it tends to be inaccurately interpreted as a numbers game, one that’s about bringing to fruition what is requested of God in prayer.Evangelicals think of it as a call to bring more people into the church or, more cynically, personal prosperity through the Gospel.In reality, it’s a verse on accountability before God and about how God may work that accountability through humans. As Leisa Baysinger notes on the blog Our Ancient Paths, it references earlier Jewish tradition that at least three witnesses must agree to bring judgement on someone.In the moment I was unaware of its exact roots, which were surprisingly apt given the attempt of this small band to sit in judgement of me, but I still understood what was at stake in the line, and I loved the idea of using a verse on accountability that they had probably misunderstood numerous times.I was the judged who understands the law better than those attempting to judge, and on that day I sought to bring accountability.These aren’t issues I take lightly, and the passive-aggressive condescension of these three was anything but harmless. This wasn’t the time to be polite.Not when the Trump-Pence White House is trying to ban transgender people from the military. Not when transgender students with stories of discrimination are turned away by the US\u0026nbspDepartment of Education.Not when President Donald Trump and vice president\u0026nbspMike Pence\u0026nbspare seeking to implement a Health and Human Services Department regulation allowing healthcare workers to deny potentially lifesaving treatment to LGBT+\u0026nbsppeople.Not when the Human Rights Campaign reports that in the US, eight transgender people have been killed in 2018 and 28 in 2017 –\u0026nbspthe most ever annually. I wasn’t going to be silent.Instead, I spoke.“You know how Matthew says that where two or three are gathered in Jesus’ name, there he is with us?”They stared at me blankly. I had no intention of going easy on them.“That is what Matthew says, is it not?”At last, one spoke up: “Yes, that’s right.”And they nervously stepped forward into a circle.I said to one:\u0026nbsp“You start us off.” And she did, going through the motions quickly and antiseptically because they clearly wanted to get as far as they could from this awkward situation. And then I picked it up when it was clear she was done.“Lord Jesus, thank you for the benefit of these friends,” I began, wholly honest with God about how I hoped she would bless my new friends, encouraging them to affirm and be inclusive of others. I was hopeful that their community would honour all as God made them and value the strength of ersity.I mentioned the natural beauty of the LGBT+\u0026nbspcommunity and thanked God again for making us as we are, throwing in a genuine wish that their trip back home would be a safe one.Then, knowing my audience, I wrapped up with the usual evangelical banal phraseology –\u0026nbsp“no weapons shall be formed against them”,\u0026nbsp“put God on their hearts” –\u0026nbspto let them know I was just as familiar with their community’s vernacular as they were, maybe more so.As I finished, having returned their “let us pray for you” to them tenfold, they murmured their thank you’s and scuttled away.I don’t know whether my words made it through, but I hope they have a sense of what it feels like to have a stranger impose self-righteous venom on them. I also hope that they’ll realise how much actions such as these diminish the power of prayer and enable so much harm to LGBT+\u0026nbsppeople.A prayer that one might change their sexuality or gender identity is egregious encouragement to those who would seek to discriminate against LGBT+\u0026nbsppeople in our laws and to do violence against them in our communities.

This is not good enough and I hope both the European Parliament and Commission will exert more pressure for them to do this as soon as possible.”But Jane Golding, chair of British in Europe, said the uncertainty was ultimately the fault of the UK.This display of concern from the British Government is a bit late and a bit rich“Obviously, we welcome any interest from the UK government when it comes to fighting the corner of its 1.2m British nationals living on the continent. However, as Mary Berry might have said: this display of concern from the British Government is a bit late and a bit rich,” she told The Independent.“What the home secretary appears not to realise is that it is the UK government that has thrown its own nationals in Europe into this uncertainty by insisting on introducing settled status for EU citizens in the UK so that it became an option for us in the EU 27 in December’s last-minute deal. The EU 27 was not interested in settled status up until then.“Furthermore, Mr Javid seems to be asking all the wrong questions.\u0026nbsp Rather than asking what systems the EU 27 are planning to set up he should know by now that the current registration systems across the EU27 are largely working well and that it is only France – along with the UK-\u0026nbsp that doesn’t require some form of registration for EU citizens. As such, he should be asking what the EU 27 is planning to do to tweak existing systems, rather than setting up new ones.”British citizens living in the EU face uncertainty about their futures and a loss of free movement rights.\u0026nbspThe UK government’s hands-off approach contrasts with that of the Netherlands, whose government has gone as far as to change the law to allow Dutch nationals living in Britain to adopt dual UK and Dutch citizenship – in direct response to Brexit.The European Parliament’s Mr Verhofstadt said: “The European Parliament will soon launch an extensive process in order to scrutinise the preparations being made by EU countries for British expats and we continue to believe the unresolved issue of onward movement rights must also be addressed for any deal to be reached. The European Parliament will defend the rights of all those affected by Brexit.Brexit so far: in picturesBoris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

Still, the non-binding document has been criticised for its ambiguity and lack of commitments the North must adhere to in order to begin its denuclearisation process.Mr Trump has sought to defend the summit, claiming in a tweet on Monday that if his predecessor Barack Obama had made the initial steps towards a deal I have he would have been declared a national hero.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

When the downpour finally came, it was worse than anyone feared.In just four days, Cox’s Bazar received two-thirds of the average rainfall expected in the month of June. More than 100 landslides have been reported, several people have died and hundreds of families have been made homeless, forced to sleep in mosques or crowd into shelters with their relatives.Ahead of World Refugee Day\u0026nbspon Wednesday, the UN released a report showing that the number of displaced people in the world has risen to a new record high of 68.5 million, and highlighting the plight of the Rohingya fleeing persecution in Myanmar as one of the biggest drivers pushing up that number.But speaking from Cox’s Bazar in a break in the weather that has coincided with the end of the Ramadan fast, Caroline Gluck, a senior official with the UN’s refugee agency, said their message this year was to “celebrate” World Refugee Day as a tribute to those struggling through such hardship, and the charities fighting to help them.As is the case with the wider refugee crisis across the globe, the population of those displaced in Bangladesh is made up mostly of women and children. Aid workers have found that creating women-only centres for healthcare, counselling and childcare is having a dramatic impact on the Rohingya’s quality of life.Rohingya women and girls are taught sewing, play games, receive medical care and are offered counselling at women-only centres run by charities like IRC in Cox\u0027s Bazar (Jessica Wanless)“In any crisis, women and children are the most vulnerable,” Ms Gluck told The Independent - a problem only exacerbated as flooding and landslides cripple camp infrastructure. “Night-time can be a worrying time, particularly if you have to travel to use toilets. The camp is quite sprawled, and instead of living alongside people you know, you are living with strangers.”One of the charities providing women-only centres is the International Rescue Committee (IRC). Dalia Al-Awqati, IRC’s emergency director in Bangladesh, said up to 80 per cent of the refugees are women and children and in need of “specialised support”.“Many Rohingya women and girls have been raped, seen their husbands and children killed before their eyes and lots of them are facing raising their children alone,” she told The Independent. “They live in a situation that is exacerbated by the presence of stigma and discrimination.”IRC\u0027s women-only centres (Jessica Wanless)For 12-year-old Azara, the centre is an oasis of normalcy in a situation that is anything but, and a welcome break from the boredom that comes with living in a refugee camp.She said she came to the centre every day, finding a safe space where she can make friends, play games and engage in her favourite pastime - henna.“It feels like home,” she said. “We come straight after we have been to school. Every week there is at least one day for sewing. Every week we learn something new. We love to learn.”Ex-UN ambassador says \u0027destroying Rohingya exceeds costs\u0027 for MyanmarRohingya facing \u0027crisis on top of crisis\u0027 as world looks other wayRohingya say Myanmar singled out the educated in genocideArmed Rohingya group massacred Hindus in Myanmar, report alleges\u0027Bittersweet\u0027 Ramadan for Rohingya Muslims forced to flee their homesMs Gluck said centres like those run by the IRC were vital to encourage women “carrying the burden” of what happened to them in Myanmar to come forward and seek counselling and support, in what is traditionally a very culturally conservative society.Media reports have previously highlighted a spike in births nine months after the alleged brutal crackdown by Myanmar’s army in Rakhine state that forced the Rohingya to flee. The danger, Ms Gluck said, is that all pregnancies in the camp become stigmatised as potentially being the result of rape.And one of the biggest positives to come out of the creation of the centres has been the number of female volunteers working to foster new communities in their makeshift home.A lot of women are taking on jobs as safety volunteers or in counselling their fellow refugees directly, having received training from NGOs. “It has helped women to develop roles that they didn’t have back home,” Ms Gluck said.Senwara stands in the Kutupalong refugee camp in Cox\u0027s Bazar (Timothy NesmithIRC)Senwara, a 35-year-old mother of four, is a volunteer who helps spread word about the centre to other refugees. She became the only female “Majhi” or community leader in her area of the camp after helping distribute food aid, and sees promoting the centre as part of her responsibility.“Women come here to this centre because there are no men,” she said. “If there were men, families would not let teenagers or women giving birth come here because they would feel shy. They are serious about this matter.”Ms Gluck said the few days of good weather, plus celebrations around Eid, had brought “joy to many faces” in the camps. There is an upbeat mood also to coincide with World Refugee Day, with singing, volleyball and other competitions put on to showcase the best of life in the camps.Rohingya Crisis in Photos Rohingya

The government wants to encourage 200,000 more people to commute to work by bikeThe Dutch government is encouraging companies to pay people to cycle to work as part of a national initiative to fight worsening congestion on the roads.“Let’s get out of our cars and onto our bikes”, Dutch deputy infrastructure minister Stientje van Veldhoven said this week as she announced new measures to encourage cycling.She has proposed a compensation scheme for working adults in which they receive 19 cents (17p) for each kilometre they cycle as part of their commute.Almost three-quarters of women ‘never cycle’, survey findsSix of the coolest cycling destinations3D-printed homes you can actually live in to be built in NetherlandsAccording to AFP, Ms Van Veldhoven is to discuss the proposal as well as other ways of promoting bicycle use through fiscal rewards such as subsidies to buy bicycles “with major national employers and small and medium enterprises”.“I want to stimulate cycling with the aim of getting 200,000 extra people out of their cars to cycle 3\u0026nbspbillion kilometres more on their bicycles,” she said.The Netherlands already leads the way when it comes to cycling. There are an estimated 22.5m bicycles in the Netherlands – more than the 17.1 million people who live there, while more than a quarter of the country cycles to work.Since 2005, the number of bicycles has increased by 11 per cent, and in Amsterdam, 32 per cent of all journeys are made by bike.According to the Netherlands’ government website, a regional trial is already in place which has shown that even after the financial rewards stop, people continue to cycle to work.It states: “Various regions are promoting the use of bicycles by means of mobile phone apps. A case in point is the\u0026nbspB-Riders\u0026nbspproject in the province of Brabant. B-Riders are commuters who switch from car to bicycle. They are coached by an app, and receive a financial reward for each kilometre cycled during peak hours. Experience has shown that most people continue to cycle even after the reward ceases.”The scheme benefits employers, the government says, as “employees who cycle are in better shape and are less prone to absence through illness. In addition, bicycle use often enables companies to save on parking costs.”“For that reason, the government is encouraging employers to provide adequate bicycle facilities, and introduce a mileage allowance for cyclists. Employers may provide cyclists with a (tax free) mileage allowance of up to 19 cents a kilometre, as is the case for car commuters,” the website says.“Bicycles play an important role when it comes to reachability, quality of life and health,” Ms Van Veldhoven said. She added: “It reduces traffic jams and gives people forced to use cars more space.”World news in picturesA woman and child are told they will have to wait before crossing the US border as confusion sets in following the Trump administration\u0027s zero tolerance policy on immigrationPeople wave a banner with a picture of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan during a gathering of supporters of his ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) in Istanbul, Turkey,.

OnlinePope Francis has made several statements during his papacy to suggest he is accepting of LGBT peopleThe Vatican has recognised the term “LGBT” by using it in one of its official documents for the first time.A paper examining the Catholic Church’s relationship with young people, published on Tuesday,\u0026nbspsaid “some LGBT youth” were looking to “benefit from greater closeness and experience greater care by the church.”The use of the term\u0026nbspappears to mark a significant change in the Vatican’s attitude towards gay Catholics, which it has previously described as people with “homosexual inclinations” and\u0026nbsp“homosexuals.”Grancis\u0026nbspDeBernardo, executive director of the New Ways Ministry, which advocates equality for\u0026nbspLGBT\u0026nbspCatholics, welcomed the move, but said\u0026nbspit did little to solve inequalities within the church.“This change in language signals that church officials are beginning to understand that they have to treat LGBT people with simple respect by referring to them with more accurate terms,” he said in a statement.“While these developments are welcome changes in the church’s style of discourse, it must be noted that there is nothing in the new document which indicates that the Vatican is, as yet, willing to entertain changes in church policy on LGBT issues.“The furthest they have gone is to indicate a willingness to work towards being ‘a community open and welcoming towards all’.“This pastoral approach is important, but the church’s outreach cannot end there.”The document, known as an instrumentum laboris, was released ahead of the General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops, due to take place in October to discuss young people.The report acknowledged the church’s traditional teachings on issues such as homosexuality, were “unpopular” among younger generations.It also conceded the question of sexuality within the Catholic world needed to be discussed “more openly and without prejudice.”“The Synod’s primary aim is to make the whole church aware of her important and not at all optional task of accompanying every young person, without exclusion, towards the joy of love,” Cardinal Lorenzo Baldisseri\u0026nbspsaid at a press conference to introduce the document on Tuesday.Pope Francis gives life advice: in pictures110 Pope Francis\u0027 guide to happinessPope Francis: \u0027Live and let

Israel, America, the Tories and Brexit the next.Corbyn’s off limits, obviously, as Frankie thinks he’s “a real person”, but there’s a regular cast of soft targets, including Donald Trump, Richard Branson (“a c***”), Boris, Michael Gove, Ruth Davidson (“a bastard”) and usually a joke about Prince Philip dying, which I think we can put down to the host’s very obvious and well-deserved self-loathing.Prince Philip, after all, was mentioned in dispatches fighting real Nazis in World War Two, instead of just ranting about them to a couple of hundred students at the Edinburgh Fringe.At the age of 97, The Duke is also still a thousand times more unpredictable, off-message, edgy and funny than any of the people on NWO and, unlike Frankie, who has 11 scriptwriters, also comes up with his own material.The hatred and abuse of Israel is slightly harder to explain, though. Frankie claims it’s because “They break international law”, but then so do a lot of countries, including Russia, which even shoots down passenger aircraft.A stroke of luck then, you might think, that the BBC’s just screened Frankie’s two-part, pre-World Cup travelogue, Frankie Goes To Russia, where, unfortunately, he didn’t have time to raise the issue of the aircraft, but he did go on Moscow radio to denounce the British Empire (topical or what!).If you were expecting anything else, of course, you give Frankie Boyle more credit than his apparent cowardice and hypocrisy deserves.If you were also expecting laughter, then I applaud your optimism, but you’ll no more get it on NWO than on Have I Got News For You, or The Mash Report, or any of those other shows that have decided the right-on part of the world is untouchable and their own left-wing agenda is far more important than being funny.The BBC’s continuing claims of impartiality, on the other hand? Well, forgive me if I let out the hollowest laugh of my life, but they are really, darkly funny.Ha . . .— GIVEN the BBC’s endless, self-serving and grovelling tributes to the NHS are still very much ongoing, I feel it would be wrong, at this point, if I didn’t join in the birthday celebrations.For though it has its faults and is often criticised, it’s been there for us, healing the lame, curing the sick, becoming the envy of the world, a shining beacon to the entire universe, which makes me fall to my knees and give thanks for seven decades’ service at the mere mention of its sacred initials.Happy 71st, Bupa.All those liars who say they want fat, unattractive people on Love Island. The disturbing Trouble With Women revelation that Anne Robinson keeps a scrapbook of her old newspaper columns, when so many hamsters still go without decent bedding every night.And The X Factor giving a job not just to Robbie Williams, who’s won 18 Brit awards and five Ivor Novello awards, but also his wife, Ayda Field, who handed Emmerdale the NTA’s 2017 Best Soap award. There on merit . . .IF you have ever wondered why some people are so dementedly pleased to see the World Cup arrive, try watching daytime TV just before the ball-kicking tournament starts.I did last Wednesday and quickly fell down a QVC rabbit hole, where I discovered Amanda Holden has a neat line in selling stuff nobody actually needs but everyone seems to want.Suitcases that aren’t really suitcases, string chairs designed to look like a cat’s sphincter, rugs that would make a Moroccan fez salesman blush, machine-woven toilet roll baskets, lamp-shades so taut and expressionless they could sit on the Britain’s Got Talent panel, if you just pre-programmed them with a dirty laugh.Amanda’s exclusive landfill range has the lot. Piece de resistance, though, has to be her “glass infinity spheres”, which defy any sort of purpose or description, but she had a crack anyway.“They’re, uhm, a bit like those things in the ’80s and ’90s you put fingers and hands on.”Lava lamps? Tamagotchis? Les Dennis? Sadly, we may never know.The afternoon’s real curve ball, though, was introduced by QVC’s endlessly enthusiastic host Pipa Gordon, vis-a-vis lightbulbs: “Amanda, bayonet or screw?”Get back to you, Pipa.

They have grossly failed their ethical standards by abusing people’s human rights.“Our vulnerable relatives were stripped of their final words to their loved ones, silenced by overdoses. This has been sinister and calculated and those implicated must now face the rigour of the criminal justice system.“Hopefully people will wake up now and realise this is the largest national scandal under the NHS.”The inquiry into the Gosport deaths unearthed an astonishing catalogue of failure, arrogance, incompetence and indifference from medical staff, health officials, local politicians and the police.It said:In total there were four police and Crown Prosecution Service investigation and a General Medical Council hearing into Barton and the failings at Gosport.They failed to result in a single criminal prosecution.She was moved there after treatment at another hospital for a urinary infection.Staff had ruled she could go home but as there was no care provision in place she ended up in Gosport. Weeks later Elsie died of kidney failure after being prescribed strong painkillers.Granddaughter Bridget, above, said yesterday: “This sort of behaviour is both chilling and precarious.”Barton, now 70, was eventually found guilty of serious professional misconduct by a General Medical Council tribunal in 2010 following an investigation.It said she had put patients at risk of an early death. But she was not struck off.The tribunal instead placed restrictions on her, including a three-year ban on injecting opiates.She decided to retire following the ruling.She was admitted to recover from a hip op but died five days later.Her daughters Gillian Mackenzie and Lesley O’Brien told Hampshire Police she was “drugged to the eyeballs”.Mrs Mackenzie, 84, of Eastbourne, East Sussex, spent the next 18 years campaigning for justice. She said: “It’s been a massive cover up. It’s nice to know I wasn’t wrong.”But the Gosport Independent Panel said the focus on Barton had ignored the fact there was an “institutional” problem at Gosport that went beyond a single GP.It said this occurred because officials were haunted by the fear of “another Shipman.” Dr Harold Shipman is believed to have murdered as many as 250 patients between 1975 and 1998.Bishop James Jones, who led the panel, said: “Harold Shipman acted alone.The GP — the most prolific killer in modern history — prescribed opiate morphine in fatal doses to more than 200 victims, often elderly and female.Shipman, left, was caught only when suspicions were raised to cops over a forged will that gave the doctor claim to £386,000.Tests on the body of Kathleen Grundy then found she had died of an overdose of diamorphine — an easily injected form of recreational heroin.In 2000, 53-year-old Shipman was found guilty of 15 counts of murder and was jailed for life at Wakefield Prison, West Yorks.An inquiry indentified 218 victims and estimated he killed 250. The case led to an overhaul in how medication is dispensed.Shipman hanged himself in his cell on his 58th birthday in 2004.“Whereas what we’re describing in this report is an institutionalised practice and that is a significant difference.”The report criticised pharmacists, nurses and consultants for dispensing the drugs, administering them or turning a blind eye. It said families were “powerless” in their relationships with professional staff and were “consistently let down.”The police investigations into complaints by relatives were “consistently poor.”The 65-year-old’s family were told by a doctor that they were letting “nature take its course”.Stan’s daughter Debbie Mackay, 54, said: “It can’t be right a man who was admitted for rehab to die the following day.“We knew something wasn’t right from the start. It has been a constant battle to have our concerns taken seriously.”The 370-page report praised the families for never giving up their fight for justice.The panel cannot cannot call for criminal or civil action.But it urged ministers, police and the Attorney General to “recognise the significance” of its findings and “act accordingly.”Theresa May yesterday described the report as “deeply troubling” and apologised to families for the length of time it took to get answers from the NHS.A spokesman said: “We will consider the content of the report and will take any appropriate steps as required.”Meanwhile, police said some of the evidence in it had never been shown to them.Hampshire Chief Constable Olivia Pinkney said: “It’s apparent from our early reading of the 370 pages that in its deliberations, the panel had sight of information not previously seen by us.“It’s important that a process is put in place to ensure all relevant agencies come together to enable decisions about next steps to be made in a way that is well-considered and transparent.”Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said it was scandalous that nurse whistleblowers were ignored back in 1991. He added: “Had the establishment listened when junior NHS staff spoke out, had the establishment listened when ordinary families raised concerns instead of treating them as troublemakers, many of those deaths would not have happened.”He told MPs that police and prosecutors were examining the report to whether criminal charges should be brought.Three days before he was due home, he begged daughter Pauline Godley to get staff to stop giving him morphine.That night a nurse rang Pauline’s husband to say Arthur, 82, was dead.She said yesterday: “It was so heartless.“I want to see criminal charges and I want to see justice done now.“I feel so guilty because he asked me to save him and I didn’t.”Solicitor Hannah Travis said yesterday prosecutions will inevitably follow the report.She added: “Consultants were aware of Dr Barton’s actions but did not intervene — they are therefore culpable and should be held to account.“It is deeply distressing to see that even as early as 1991, nurses at the hospital were warned not to take their concerns further.“Why Dr Barton’s employment was not terminated at this stage beggars belief.”Dr Barton lives in Gosport with husband Tim, an ex-Royal Navy Commodore.They are currently thought to be in Spain.Earlier this week she said: “I don’t know what will be in the report, But I don’t think it will be very pleasant.“I’ve never spoken to the Press about what happened and I don’t plan to now.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Say it. Sorted.”Endless repetition probably cost her a million votes in last year’s catastrophic snap election and earned her the label “MayBot”.She did it again while hailing her long-overdue £380million-a-week Brexit boost for the health service.Her NHS treatment for diabetes helped her “get on with my job”, she said.Except, it didn’t. Her Type 1 diabetes deserves sympathy and understanding, but it has nothing to do with her job as PM.To lead is to choose. Mrs May chose to lead but suffers paralysis by analysis.Since achieving her dream of leading this country, Mrs May has failed to make the right choices at a pivotal moment in British history.As a sceptical Remainer, she was perfectly placed to steer Britain through the complex task of leaving the European Union.Her first act should have been to summon her Cabinet and tell them “Brexit means Brexit”, which means every minister and Whitehall mandarin must work their socks off to make it a success.And while staring Chancellor Phil Hammond in the eye, invite anyone who felt otherwise to find another job.Instead, she boxed herself in by triggering a rigid Brexit timetable, slapping £39BILLION cash on the table and inviting Brussels’ biggest bullies to do their worst.And they did. Any idea this would be a friendly divorce has turned to ashes. We are at war with Europe, if only by another name.This week we are likely to see their Commons cats’-paws, the increasingly triumphant Remoaners, take Mrs May and the UK to the brink of abject surrender.We are being forced to repeal the verdict of our biggest ever single-issue vote by screeching siren Anna “Suck it up” Soubry and hypocrite Tory lawyer Dominic Grieve, who yesterday said he and fellow rebels were prepared to bring down the Government if they are not granted a “meaningful vote” on the final Brexit deal.Obnoxious Soubry gives even Remainers a bad name, resorting to reckless slurs of “racism” even as her precious European Union is being torn apart by rows over uncontrolled mass immigration.She shrugs off the real grounds for scepticism about Brussels — its sneering contempt for democracy and the misbegotten euro, which has destroyed the job hopes of a generation of young Europeans.These were the failures which actually led to Brexit, long before Tony Blair flung open the door to 4million foreign migrants and German Chancellor Angela Merkel raised the stakes with a million more.It was Merkel, as much as Blair and David Cameron, who soured the public view of Europe’s Grand Project years before Brexit ever became a possibility.But while it is easy to condemn defeated Remoaners as sore losers, it is hard not to be impressed by their organisational zeal, which would do credit to Jeremy Corbyn’s Marxist militia.By stark contrast, all of those who voted Out — and won — are entitled to be outraged by the performance of the Cabinet’s victorious Brexiteers.What the hell have they been doing for the past 18 months?They have been caught flat-footed, ambushed in the night, bound and gagged by a richly funded, highly motivated mob of undemocratic contemptibles. They should be shot for sleeping on the job.Boris trumpets the occasional bugle call. David Davis threatens to quit once a month. Michael Gove is busy elsewhere. And Liam Fox?They never talk to each other, prepare strategy or organise tactics, let alone mobilise financial backing or communicate with 17.4million supporters. Do they too think we are all thick and racistNow we risk the horrifying prospect of remaining half-in, half-out of the EU, robbed of our vote, our hard-won rebate and £39billion in hard cash.The game may be lost by default to the dark forces of organised bureaucracy: The Civil Service, the BBC, EU pensioners such as Peter Mandelson and those faceless Eurocrats.We shot their fox in The Glorious Referendum, only to let them regroup and return as a pack of wolves with a scent of blood.They had to suck it up or risk choking on the toxic fumes.But I think it sounds more like the punchline to a particularly revolting joke which is unsuitable for a family newspaper like this.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

In practice this means even if an MP is in the Commons car park in an Ambulance, they can still vote. But Government whips are understood to have refused to accept this procedure, and are insisting on even infirm MPs physically passing through the lobbies in order to have their vote counted. Labour MP Naz Shah was seen being rolled through the Commons in a wheelchair this afternoon as MPs voted on the Brexit bill.  Pregnant Liberal Democrat deputy leader Jo Swinson voted despite being past her due date. Tory chiefs allegedly imposed the measure amid fears they faced defeat before backing down in their latest EU (Withdrawal) Bill humiliation. A senior Downing Street source said they were unaware of Conservatives refusing to co-operate. But a Labour spokesman confirmed the party’s whips had been told “nodding through” would not be available. He said: “As I understand it there has been a refusal to nod through people who are not in a state to vote in the normal way, and that’s obviously unacceptable.” Lib Dem MP Layla Moran, of the Best for Britain campaign, said: “The Government played dirty on this one, using some real gutter tactics. “They tried to take advantage of sick and elderly Labour MPs in a desperate bid to win this Brexit vote, but had to concede with only hours to go.” "},{"url":null,"title":"shes cursed theresa mays backdrop","story":"NewsShe\u0027s cursed!

Alicia Barber, 27, washes Jamison, one, in Clorox bleach twice a week for 15 minutes before exfoliating him with a mitt to rub away hard skin and ward off infection. Little Jamison suffers from Harlequin ichthyosis, a severe skin disease caused by a genetic mutation which affects around one in 500,000 births. Infants with the condition are born covered with a hard layer of protein in the outer layer of the skin, which forms scale-like diamond-shaped plates, separated by deep cracks. The keratin shell makes it near impossible for those with the condition to move around freely and can cause breathing difficulties as well as leaving sufferers at high risk of infection.  Former waitress Alicia, who is now Jamison’s full-time carer, learned of the devastating diagnosis while seven months pregnant. She was initially expecting twins following a battle with fertility issues, but one foetus died in the womb. Learning that the surviving baby might not survive was a difficult blow.  Medics recommended Alicia terminate the pregnancy, but despite being given just a two per cent chance of survival, Jamison has defied the odds to make it to his first birthday .  But the disease means he must endure a grueling treatment regime which includes bleach baths and a prescription of morphine to help ease the excruciating pain. Alicia said she has also struggled with comments from cruel strangers who called her son ‘creepy’ - and said she is keen to raise awareness about the little-known condition.  The mum-of-three, of Chattaroy, Washington, USA, said: I had never heard of Harlequin ichthyosis before the doctor took me aside and showed me a text book with pictures of babies with this condition. They had no faces, no hands, no feet and no fingers and toes. It was really traumatizing and they recommended that I terminate the pregnancy. While deciding what to do I was told I\u0027d gone past the point of termination so I had to go full-term. It was scary, I didn\u0027t know what was going to happen with him and the birth was pretty traumatic as well. I had an emergency c-section because they were concerned that a natural birth would cause tearing of his skin fissures. I also needed four-and-half blood transfusions and didn\u0027t get to meet him for a few days. I broke down when I saw him - I wanted to hold him and tell him it’s going to be OK. I knew he was going to fight.  The skin abnormalities associated with harlequin ichthyosis disrupt the skins protective barrier, making it difficult to control water loss, regulate their body temperature, and fight infections. It means Jamison requires round-the-clock care and the family get 187 hours-a-month appointed care from their hospital. He must take two 45 minute baths per day during which he is bathed in water and rubbed with a sandpaper rag to help him shed his skin. Doctors also prescribed Jamison baths in household bleach, the type you buy at the grocery store. He has two of these per week for around 15 minutes.  Alicia said: “It is painful for him so he is on morphine, which is scary because he has respiratory issues and it can slow things down and make him sleepy. “He does accidentally swallow the bleach when I’m pouring it over his head and it occasionally gets in his eyes. “It is something I dread because he is in pain. He does cry and I have cried quite a few times. “If he didn’t have these baths he could end up in the hospital with an infection. “We have to keep a very very tidy, clean home at all times and check him every couple of hours for any sign of skin infection.” "},{"url":null,"title":"animal hero your life amanda","story":"NewsIs there an animal hero in your life?

Authorities are warning families to urgently return the cough syrups to the shop from which they were bought. One of the ingredients in the medicines could cause them to grow to mould, which would make children very unwell or cause reactions. Affected products include some own-brand syrups from Asda, Morrisons, Sainsbury\u0027s, Superdrug, Wilko and Tesco. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) said only a small number of batches from eight different products are being recalled and no other cough syrups are affected.  Check if you have any of the listed cough syrups and if you do, please don\u0027t use them, take them back to where you bought them from, said the MHRA\u0027s Dr Sam Atkinson. The mould is not always visible, so return any of the affected cough syrup bottles, even if it looks okay to use. If your child has recently taken one of these cough syrups and, in the unlikely event that they have become unwell or had a reaction, please speak to your GP, pharmacist or other healthcare professional. Our highest priority is making sure the medicines you and your family take are safe. This is why, even though there is a low risk of a reaction, we have asked the company to carry out this recall and why we want people to check their medicine cabinets.

In an interview with the Liverpool Echo, the family - including two grandparents, their daughter, son-in-law and grandson - explained how the children slashed and stabbed them with weapons, including a knives, screwdriver and a large, curved flick blade. The grandmother said the incident, in Broadgreen, Liverpool, came after the family were alerted by a neighbour their van had been broken into.  The 76-year-old said: I was getting ready to go to the quiz at the pub over the road and the bell rang. And it was the lad over the road, and he said - \u0027I have just seen a lad going into your husband\u0027s van.\u0027  \u0027He opened it, went into the van and looked around, then went away, then came running back again and took something out of the van.\u0027 The pensioner said she told her husband about the incident and told him to go and lock it, which is when he realised he had left the keys in the ignition and they had been stolen. She added: My husband and son-in-law were then trying to get the battery out of the cars on the drive, because the van keys had my car key on it as well and we knew they would come back for them. The pensioner said her grandson spotted a group of lads acting suspiciously, not far from the house, and the family including both 76-year-old grandparents, daughter, son-in-law and grandson, walked over. She added: There was four of them and we didn\u0027t bounce over and we said \u0027we don\u0027t want any problems or trouble, we just want the keys back.\u0027 And that\u0027s when they turned gangster and said \u0027we haven\u0027t got any keys you cheeky f******g b*****s.

And that is when one of them just punched my husband in the face and pulled out a knife.  The grandmother said the group began jumping on the backs of her family, trying to slash and stab them, during which the van keys fell out of the pocket of one of them. She said: They were animals. They were jumping on our backs, they went to stab me and my daughter shouted he is going to stab you and pulled me away. I was in shock. They were kicking the hell out of the three of them and just kept swinging and slashing with their knives. During the fight they dropped the keys - they fell out of one of their pockets. All of this over some keys. We were literally fighting for our lives. One had a screwdriver and two had Stanley knives and one had a big curved flick blade.  They pulled their hoods up and my husband said he remembers just seeing big brown wide eyes, then he had his face slashed. Then one of them pulled this flick knife from a bum bag and stabbed my grandson Jack and blood was just gushing out. And my daughter was shouting \u0027he has been stabbed, he\u0027s been stabbed\u0027. The grandmother said one of the gang scratched her daughter\u0027s face and broke her tooth, meanwhile another used a screwdriver to attack her son-in-law who suffered injuries to his back, legs and arms. Her grandson, aged 20, was taken to hospital with a stab wound to his stomach and is in a stable condition, however his family were told it could have been much worse. The grandmother said: The blade nicked his liver, the surgeon said if it had been an inch either side he wouldn\u0027t be here. He is very lucky.  He didn\u0027t think he was going to make it - he even said to his dad \u0027if I don\u0027t make it this is the name of one of them who did this.\u0027 He was supposed to be going to Thailand on Friday for a two week holiday - I was going for his money today. My husband has had five heart bypasses, he has had bowel cancer, I have had cancer, we have all been through it - we don\u0027t need anything else. Her husband, also 76, said: If you see someone\u0027s keys in someone\u0027s van you knock on and say your keys are here - you don\u0027t rob them.What is this mentality that when you get dressed you put a knife in your pocket?

It always sounds so easy in theory: grab some crisps and sandwiches, head out to the nearest green space with the family and let the good times roll. But in reality, there\u0027s always something vital that gets forgotten. Like spoons. Or something to sit on. So to help you enjoy the sunny days in style, we\u0027ve put together some handy tips.  Keep your cool    No one wants a limp, soggy sandwich - so refrigeration is important for lunch. You could keep things cool with a pre-frozen ice pack, but they tend to over-cool the food near them, which can spoil certain foods. Instead it\u0027s better to get a coolbox with a built-in refrigeration system. The Halfords 40 Litre Coolbox is ideal for \u0026pound85 (was \u0026pound110, save \u0026pound25) because you can use either a mains or car power supply to keep those cucumber sandwiches chilled.   Let the kids help make the lunch (yes, really)   If you\u0027ve got small kids, then get them involved in making the lunch. Get some plastic containers, like Halfords Plastic Stacking Containers , currently half price at \u0026pound6, and have them put either fruit or salad into each.   They can either be responsible for their own - or if you\u0027re feeling brave, the whole lunch. Just prepare yourself for a rogue strawberry in the tomatoes!  Be prepared for rain (this is the UK, after all)   There\u0027s no need to worry about sudden inclement weather at a well-planned picnic.  Make sure you pack the Halfords 300 Fully Waterproof Gazebo , \u0026pound69 (was \u0026pound90, save \u0026pound21). This rather brilliant shelter will hold off heavy rain and offers 50+ UV protection, so no matter what\u0027s happening to the weather - you\u0027re going to be covered.   Also grab the Halfords XL Waterproof Picnic Blanket , currently half price at \u0026pound10 - so that even if the grass is a bit damp, you can be sure of a dry place to sit.  Armed with these, you\u0027ll be able to eat in comfort whatever the British weather brings.  Don\u0027t compromise on cutlery  No matter what you packed for your picnic you\u0027re going to want to eat it off something nice. Taking plates, bowls and cutlery means that you can take anything you like on your picnic. In the mood for pasta, rice, or potato salad? No problem, if you\u0027ve got knives and forks for all.   These Halfords sets of bowls, plates and cutlery all come in awesome bright colours - and they\u0027re all currently half price. Packs of six Bowls , six Plates , and 18 pieces of Cutlery are priced at just \u0026pound3 each. All-in-all that\u0027s a lot of mouths you\u0027ll be able to feed in rainbow style!   The Five Fs      The \u0027five Fs\u0027 are the key to a great picnic. The first four are family, friends, food and furniture. We\u0027ve dealt with food already, and it\u0027s nice and cool, thanks to the coolbox. You\u0027ve got your family and friends with you too - and they all need somewhere to sit. That\u0027s where the furniture comes in.  For optimum comfort grab some Urban Escape Moonchairs for the adults, \u0026pound30 (half price) and a few Kids Folding Chairs \u0026pound5, (half price) for the little ones.   A Halfords Roll Up Aluminum Table , \u0026pound20 (was \u0026pound30, save \u0026pound10) will finish this off to perfection.   Now, the adults can sit back with a glass of wine - served in durable Acrylic Wine Glasses , (half price at \u0026pound5 for four) - while the kids take care of the final \u0027F\u0027...   Fun!

Chilling footage released by police shows murderer Genu Armeanu, 45, approaching mum and grandmother Elisabeta Lacatusu, 44, as he lay in wait and pulling out a kitchen knife. He stabs her 19 times and leaves her slumped behind a car, looking back over his shoulder as he walks away in Ilford, east London. It took just 15 minutes for a jury to find Armeanu guilty of murder, and he\u0027s been sentenced to life in prison with a minimum of 28 years, Essex Live reports.  Ms Lacatusu and her killer had known each other from childhood and were from the same city in Romania. They started dating but Ms Lacatusu, a mum-of-three and grandmother-of-two, broke off the relationship when her family found out and were unhappy. Armeanu bombarded her with text messages, at first threatening to kill himself and then threatening to kill her. But Ms Lacatusu, who was murdered on January 3 this year, did not think he was capable of violence and didn\u0027t report the threats to police.  Four weeks before the murder her daughter had told Armeanu that she wanted nothing to do with him and to leave her alone. But Armeanu then began waiting for her outside the Upton Park restaurant where she worked and sent a barrage of texts and calls to her phone confessing his love to her. He had also sent a message to a family member saying that he was going to kill Ms Lacatusu and himself. On the fateful day of the murder, Armeanu lay in wait as she returned to her family\u0027s home in Norfolk Road, Ilford at around 7pm, emerging from a van behind her.  After a brief conversation, Armeanu pulls a knife from his right-hand jacket pocket and stabs Ms Lacatusu. She screamed for help and struggled to fight him off, but Armeanu hooked his left arm around her head and neck and repeatedly stabbed her. At one point, Ms Lacatusu managed to stumble away, but Armeanu ran after her and held onto her, possibly stabbing her again, before pushing her to the ground. He then calmly walked away. The attack lasted for 30 seconds.  Met Police officers and the London Ambulance Service attended at about 7.10pm and found the victim in the street. She was pronounced dead at the scene six minutes later. A post-mortem examination revealed that Ms Lacatusu, also known as Alina, had sustained at least 19 stab wounds. The kitchen knife Armeanu used was found bent in the street next to the mum\u0027s body. In a text to a friend, he confessed to the murder, and police arrested him in the early hours of January 4.  During his police interview, Armeanu said: There is nothing much to tell, just that I love her too much and I couldn\u0027t live with the thought that she is away to the other one so then, I\u0027ve had this thought to kill her, that\u0027s all. Madalina Lacatusu, the victim\u0027s daughter, said: My mother was an exceptional mother who loved us and she raised us with a lot of love, attention and care. My mother was full of life, happy and energetic. She spent her life bringing me and my sisters Ioana and Elena up. She supported the three of us all the time, until the last moments of her life and she spent all of her spare money on us and her two grandchildren. Our lives have changed completely since she is no longer with us. Her death shattered our daily peace and now we just try to survive. I don\u0027t really know how I still carry on living. I am scared to walk out on the streets, I try to go out accompanied. I have nightmares, a month after my mother\u0027s death I was unable to sleep for more than a couple of hours at a time. I was even scared to walk around the house.

Lauren Neville, 30, believes a car crash, which completely wrote off her 10-year-old Nissan Qashqai, may have saved her life. The mental health nurse had suffered from sickness, tunnel vision and dizziness for two years and was eventually having 70 seizures every week - but doctors put her symptoms down to depression. Lauren, of Burnley, Lancashire, ploughed her \u0026pound4,000 Nissan into a tree in January and completely forgot where she was after suffering a seizure.  And an MRI scan revealed the horrifying cause of her focal seizure - a 6cm brain tumour called a glioblastoma. The mum-of-two said: I felt really frustrated and angry. I was told I had emotional trauma and then depression and I kept going from diagnosis to diagnosis. It was only after the accident that I was diagnosed with a brain tumour. I don\u0027t think I would be here right now if it wasn\u0027t for the accident. It was a blessing in disguise.  I\u0027d had symptoms for two years before I was diagnosed with the tumour. I suffered daily with headaches, tunnel vision, dizziness, shaking and generally not feeling like myself. I was also having focal seizures and knew something wasn\u0027t right. Eventually they also sent me for an MRI scan in May and they found a 6cm cancerous tumour on my brain. I was completely devastated. I could only think of my kids as they are my first priority and my whole world, only them. It breaks my heart that I could die from this. Lauren, who now suffers with short-term memory problems, underwent a gruelling six-hour operation to remove 80% of the mass on June 8. Surgeons then had to use 90 staples to close the 30cm scar. It\u0027s most likely I\u0027ll need further surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy.

Posted by Melissa Hope (@lissalet) the tweet informed people of what they should do if a service dog approaches them on its own. It reads: So today I tripped. Fell flat on my face, it was awful but ultimately harmless. My service dog, however, is trained to go get an adult if I have a seizure, and he assumed this was a seizure. I went after him after I had dusted off my jeans and ego, and I found him trying to get the attention of a very annoyed woman. She was swatting him away and telling him to go away. So I feel like I need to make this heads up.    If a service dog without a person approaches you, it means the person is down and in need of help. Don\u0027t get scared, don\u0027t get annoyed, follow the dog! Thousands of people have shared the post, admitting they had no idea they were meant to follow the dog. However many also don\u0027t realise this isn\u0027t the case for support dogs in the UK. A spokeswoman for the charity Support Dogs, which trains seizure alert dogs to give an advance warning of an epileptic seizure of up to 55 minutes, said that they did not train their assistance dogs to run off or go for help in case of an emergency.  Instead support dogs will often stay with their owner and bark to attract attention to the situation. Toni Brown-Griffin, of Tunbridge Wells in Kent, is blind and epileptic. Because of this, she is supported by a black Labrador cross named Hetty, who is the first dog to be dually trained as both a seizure alert dog and a guide dog in the UK. Toni and Hetty have been together for seven and a half years, with the talented pooch set to retire in a matter of weeks. Throughout their time with one another, Hetty has been an incredible support to mum-of-two Toni when she has a seizure.  The 48-year-old has two different types of seizure and Hetty is able to work out which type she will have and when she is going to have it, alerting her before it happens so she can get to a safe space. The dog, who has won numerous awards for her service over the years, also assists with physical tasks, including taking Toni\u0027s top off, picking things up that have been dropped and finding things Toni has lost. In reference to Melissa\u0027s advice, Toni revealed that Hetty would never go off and seek help from a stranger.

Pundit Leonid Slutsky, 47, formerly Hull manager, suddenly quit amid claims he is being punished for mentioning taboo name Alexei Navalny on state-run TV.  Navalny is Vladimir Putin ’s arch foe who was barred from standing against him in this year’s presidential election.  Russian-style political correctness forbids the 42-year-old anti-corruption campaigner’s name - the N-word - from being mentioned on air on state-run channels, it is claimed. Problems deepened when another Channel One commentator Vasily Utkin was also fired from World Cup coverage soon after he posted online about Navalny.  Informed sources said he was axed under pressure from the Kremlin. The scandal unfolded after Slutsky - a former Russian team manager - said: Unfortunately for me, I am ending my work on Channel One, because it is necessary to embark on other activity.” This followed his earlier on-air quip during Germany’s game against Mexico when he said: “Does Navalny play football? “It would be interesting to see.” Slutsky had responded to another pundit Kirill Dementiev who made a reference to “navalny football\u0027, which roughly translates as route-one football” - the word is an adjective as well as a surname.  Putin foe Navalny seized on the references and mocked the Kremlin over his name being mentioned. The moment when censorship came down and I turned up on Channel One. Well almost,” he joked on Twitter. Slutsky has sought to play down the row by saying he is poised to start work as manager of Vitesse Arnhem in the Netherlands. But fans were not convinced this was the true reason his time as a World Cup pundit lasted just four games. Many saw him as the best pundit on Russian TV, and social media blamed censorship for his demise. He covered Russia-Egypt, Russia-Saudi Arabia, Germany-Mexico and England-Tunisia games before his departure.

It took doctors three years to figure out why Mariah, 11, was so ill and specialists eventually determined that the dangerous black mould could be the cause. The girl had been exposed to the toxic mould every day she attended school. Speaking to Australia\u0027s 9News , Hayley said: It was black mould through her carpet, it was on walls, i could smell it from a mile away and Mariah could as well. Mariah was constantly unwell and suffered from severe nausea and her weight dropped dramatically.  Her mum added: Every organ in her body was pretty much inflamed. As a drastic measure, her family even moved from New South Wales to Queensland to be close to her doctor and with the hopes that the warmer climate would help her. At one point Mariah was so sick that she could not attend school or play with other children. Federal MP Lucy Wicks is now leading the charge for a national inquiry in Australia into the hidden danger of black mould. She has experienced similar symptoms when her house was damaged during a storm and black mould took hold.  Within a week or two I began to get some very strange symptoms, pneumonia, asthma, got very tired, she said. She was diagnosed with chronic inflammatory response syndrome (CIRS). My skin would feel like I was on fire, my brain would feel like it wasn\u0027t working properly, she said. I started writing my speeches down in parliament to avoid the embarrassment of not being able to remember the words that suddenly just might not be there. It was a really tough time.

No one was an automatic pick, you had to play for your place.“Before he came to Dens Park it was like that, too many were.“When he came in there was a big clearout. He revolutionised the team.“A lot of the squad were ageing and just going through the motions at the end of their career.“At that time Dundee weren’t expected to do much, they were a big club but, after the success in the early 50s, there were a few years of doing not very much.“He also brought in some older guys who we all wondered about.“He brought in Bobby Wishart, who was 32 at the time, Bobby Seith was 30, but they were revelations.”Shankly also revolutionised the style of football on display at Dens Park.“We were an out-and-out attacking team,” Ure added.“We could defend when we needed to but we used to go at the opposition and test them.“We had a lot of seasoned players like Bobby Cox and Gordon Smith and some really good ones like Alan Gilzean and Alan Cousin. There was a perfect balance to the team.“We wanted to play football – there was no humping it up the pitch and chasing after it.“We were a possession-based team, one of the first in Scotland to keep the ball. It was a European style and that helped us in the European run the next season and why we did so well.“I think that foxed the European teams because they expected the usual Scottish kick and chase so they’d have the ball for 15 minutes at a time – the difference was we were keeping the ball!”That run in Europe saw the Dark Blues hammer Sporting Lisbon and then Anderlecht before falling to AC Milan in the last four.“The Anderlecht game was the best ever.

He moved to America where he died in 1982 but, 36 years later, remains regarded as one of Scotland’s greatest players.Claudio Caniggia: It was a case of 1950 and Billy Steel all over again when, in October 2000, Dundee sent tremors through the football world by announcing the signing of Argentine World Cup star Claudio Caniggia.In desperate need of a replacement for injured striker Fabian Caballero, the Dee’s Italian manager Ivano Bonetti used his Serie A connections and fixed up Caniggia, a former Roma team-mate of his brother and assistant Dario.In the end, the man who was Diego Maradona’s favourite strike partner for Argentina did not stay long at Dens Park, making just 21 league appearances and scoring seven goals, before heading for Rangers at the end of the 2000/01 campaign.Both for his performances and the gentlemanly way he conducted himself off the park, the impact he had on Dundee was considerably greater than the time he spent at Dens Park.Alan Gilzean: If there’s a debate over who the best-ever Dundee player is, when to comes to putting the ball in the net there can be no argument.Although down the years the club can boast some prolific scorers, there never has been, and is never likely to be, anyone who could match the ability of the legendary Alan Gilzean.Over 40 years after his playing career with the Dark Blues and then Spurs came to an end, those who saw him or played with or against him still regard him as being a world class centre-forward.Born in Coupar Angus, Dundee were his first senior club. He score an unequalled total of 169 goals for them and won the league in 1961/62 before being transferred to Spurs, where he enjoys similar legendary status, in 1964.Doug Cowie: The sands of time mean in some ways he is the forgotten man of Dundee greats but never to those who saw or played alongside Doug Cowie.Signed by George Anderson in 1945, over the next 16 years the Aberdonian would make a record 446 appearances, win two League Cups and also appear in two World Cups for Scotland.Cowie left Dens at the end of the season before the club won the championship but many of those who played in the side that clinched the title have often referred to the influence he had over their development on the pitch.As well as nurture it, Cowie would go on to show himself as an adept talent spotter. Once his playing days were over he worked for Dundee United and, along with fellow-scout Davie Small, was credited by Jim McLean as being instrumental in unearthing many of the local players who went on to bring the league flag to Tannadice in 1983.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b2781041b59a-126x180.jpg ","title":"125 years of dundee fc how did it all start for the dark blues","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAt times during their history, Dundee Football Club have proudly boasted of being the city’s oldest professional football club.While celebrations of their 125th birthday this year are confirmation of that, what the Dark Blues can’t claim to be is the first.Indeed, it was the growing popularity of the game late in the 19th century that led to their very existence, through the desire of smaller local outfits to challenge at a national level.The club was in some ways down to the existence of a man about whom little is known. He was Andrew Buttar, president of the Dundee Charity Football Association and, importantly, an official of one of the clubs already on the go in the city – Our Boys.Buttar felt that by joining forces with one of their big local rivals, East End, a new club representing the city as a whole would be capable of doing it proud at national league level.Perhaps surprisingly given the strong tribal nature of football even at that time and the fact an earlier attempt at amalgamation was thrown out by members of the clubs, within a month of him publicly airing the idea they’d met and put together an application for Scottish League membership.So it was that on June 12, 1893, at their AGM, the new Dundee Football and Athletic Club was admitted to the league.In doing so they beat off competition from Cowlairs and, more notably an Edinburgh-based outfit going by the name of Hibernian – whatever happened to them?With just two months to the start of the new season, there was plenty work to be done and, less than two weeks after the league vote, a committee, of which Buttar was vice-president, had been formed to run things.A home for the team had also to be found and, when hopes of playing at Carolina Port were dashed by another local side, Strathmore, obtaining the lease for it, Our Boys’ home at West Craigie Park, a ground that lay roughly between Albert Street and Morgan Street, was earmarked.Work to get it ready for the national league was hastily arranged and carried out. At the same time the committee set about putting together a team capable of competing at a higher level. For the most part that involved picking the best performers from East End and Our Boys, though Scotland cap Sandy Keillor and a team-mate from Montrose, goalie Billy McKie, were also brought in.So it was that, on August 12, barely three months on from the bid to form the club had gained real momentum, Dundee ran out to face Rangers at West Craigie Park on the first day of the new Scottish League season.The Gers were already a well- established league outfit and had secured their first title just two years earlier, so for Dundee to come from two goals down to earn their first league point from a 3-3 draw was a creditable performance.On top of the result, further vindication of the decision to move to the big stage came in the shape of a healthy 5,000 turnout for the game.After a-not-unexpected defeat at eventual champions Celtic the following week, a first win came in the second home game at the end of August when Renton were edged out 3-2.The 18-game campaign would yield a further five wins and two draws for an eighth-place finish and, although that meant they had to apply for re-election, the bid was successful. That first season also saw the team switch to first choice home Carolina Port, the ground many fans still believe was their original home.And if that first campaign couldn’t quite be described as auspicious, it was a start and the beginning of an eventful next 125 years.n Tomorrow – The Managers.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2015/06/image.jpg1_.741936.jpg ","title":"125 years of dundee fc humble claudio caniggia was even better off pitch barry smith","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA Dundee legend in his own right, Barry Smith captained the club for nine years before returning as manager in 2010.During that time he saw some of the best and some of the worst times in the history of the club.Among the best, however, was playing alongside some top-quality team-mates.And one name that stands out is Claudio Caniggia.Barry said: “I grew up watching guys like him play in World Cups, so I feel really fortunate to have played with Caniggia.“What made him stand out is, no matter how much he had done in the game before, he was so humble and had great humility.“What stood out for me is how he took time to help out the younger lads in training. Guys like Steven Milne and Graham Bayne owe a lot to him.“That was just the type of guy he is, very humble, no airs and graces and he took a lot of time with younger players that a lot of other players wouldn’t.“The first time he came in, he immediately made sure he was part of the team.“He didn’t just stand around, he got involved straight away.“Claudio didn’t want to be a superstar or anything, just wanted to be part of a team. His attitude was superb.“A lot of players could take a lesson from him. Every day he knew he still had to work hard.“I remember him as much off the park as on it because he was so good on the training ground.”Barry had another name he’d stick into the mix from his time at Dundee.“Georgi Nemsadze was the most technically gifted player I played with,” he added.“I knew when I won the ball, I could give it to him no problem.“I was very lucky to play alongside him.“I have to say, those guys did what they did because there were other guys in the team doing their jobs.“Guys like Lee Wilkie, Gavin Rae and me were the workhorses for the team and we allowed the players with all the flair to go and do their stuff.”As manager, Barry had to deal with some of the darkest times at Dens as the club headed into a second administration – the people at the club, however, managed to turn that time into one of the best at Dundee with the ‘Deefiant’ season.He added: “I do believe if the team hadn’t stayed up someone would have shut the doors at Dens.“Collectively everyone responded, the coaching staff, office staff, players and definitely the fans rallied around the club.“Though it was a really negative time, we turned it into a positive one which then led to promotion the following year.“I don’t like to single anybody out but Robert Douglas played a massive part.“It’s difficult to say just how much he helped gelling the players together.“All the players and their wives and families were invited round to his all the time and that really generated the team spirit.“He really made sure the team was a real team and that’s not even talking about what he did on the park.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/keepers-collage-300x180.jpg ","title":"csaba laszlo delighted as dundee united move to fix up giant goalkeepers","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee United have filled the void in the first line of their defence by fixing up two giant goalies from European football.With Harry Lewis back at Southampton after his year-long loan and Deniz Mehmet out for six months with a knee injury, it was no secret the Tangerines were in the market for goalkeepers.Now they’ve moved for Swiss goalie Benjamin Siegrist and Slovakian keeper Matej Rakovan.

The park itself is very well-used by local community groups and sports teams, so the equipment will be put to good use.“It’s good to see this sort of democratic process on a local level, and these individual projects being carried out with council funds voted for by the project.“I think, for kids who may be there for football training, the hope is that younger brothers and sisters will get the

in the early 1990s, has been demolished.It comes just a few weeks after the loss of Halley’s Mill on Broughty Ferry Road.Opening its doors more than 90 years ago on Mains Loan, Keiller went on to produce its famous marmalade.The site also produced confectionery including boiled sweets and butterscotch.Despite employing nearly 900 people during the 1950s, its final owners – Alma Holdings – went bust in March 1992 before the plant was sold off.It was revealed in 2015 that Dundee City Council had given approval for the former factory to be replaced by 131 new homes.Local residents have complained about the site having been plagued by intruders who illegally gained access to the disused grounds.Following a major blaze in July 2015, the building continued to fall further into a state of disrepair.However, in spite of its sad demise during the last two decades, the Maryfield plant leaves behind a legacy that once saw royalty crossing the threshold.Keiller was at one time the largest confectionary firm in Britain, as well as boasting eight bakery shops in the city.The factory was given the royal seal of approval three years after it opened in 1928.Keiller supplied King George V with marmalade and Queen Mary with chocolate by royal appointment in 1931.The Keiller estate on Mains Loan would go on to see further expansion with an additional factory space opened there in 1947.Immortalised as part of Dundee’s three Js – jute, jam and journalism – the Keiller business would change hands two more times before its demise.It was bought over by Nestle in 1961, then it was the turn of the Okhai Group in 1981.Connections with the royal family continued when Princess Diana visited the factory in 1983.The Princess of Wales was pictured donning the regulation white hat and Keiller-branded white coat while chatting to staff during her visit.Former employee Carol Glass, 53, worked in the wrapping department from 1983 to 1991 just before it closed.She said: “I remember Princess Diana visiting the factory and it was good to see her there.“We also had a visit from Margaret Thatcher though I can’t remember if that was before or after Diana.“Initially I didn’t want to work there and only had a three-month contract but I loved my time.“It was huge part of my life growing up and I remember speaking to some of the staff who’d worked in original Keiller Factory.“It was great hearing their old stories.“I remember during my time the place must have employed a few hundred folk.”Carol, who lived in Douglas at the time, added: “It was sad to see the area falling into such a state during recent years.“It would have great if they had been able to keep the facade of the buildings, but they said they couldn’t owing to the structural damage caused by the

since 1986.With one of the most lethal finishers in the tournament, they could surprise a few.Star player: Robert Lewandowski.Local link: Impressive goalkeepers have been the main export to the city from Poland for United but two outfielders come to mind at Dens.Dariusz Adamczuk and Pietor Czachowski arrived at Dundee in 1993 but couldn’t prevent relegation – Adamczuk would be fondly remembered in his second spell, returning in 1996 before departing for Rangers in 1999. He played 11 times for Poland while Czachowski picked up 45 caps.The ‘Mad Monk’ Grzegorz Szamotulski, Lukasz Zaluska and Rado Cierzniak were all top goalies at Tannadice while Jaroslaw Fojut had a decent spell in 2014-15. They have 15 caps between them.SenegalJust their second appearance at a finals since they exploded on to the scene in 2002 by beating world champions France in the opener in South Korea.The West Africans would love to repeat their run to the last eight then and will fancy their chances of getting out of this group.Star player: Sadio Mane.Local link: French-born Morgaro Gomis played more than 200 games for Dundee United over two spells.Now 32, Gomis plays in Malaysia but picked up two international caps with Senegal in 2009 while at Tannadice.Yet again Scotland won’t be there but, with just one sleep until the big kick-off, all eyes are now firmly fixed on the World Cup in Russia.The action starts tomorrow when the hosts take on Saudi Arabia in Moscow’s Luzhniki Stadium.Tonight the

GREATER sense of empowerment for residents of one of the Highlands\u0026rsquo most deprived communities is being promised as part of a new plan for the area.The South Kessock and Merkinch locality plan, launched this week, details measures to boost quality of life there.Drawn up by the Inverness Community Partnership (ICP) \u0026ndash a body bringing together representatives of a range of bodies including Highland Council, police and NHS Highland \u0026ndash it includes proposals to improve support for school leavers and provision for unemployed people looking to move into work, as well as plans for a new family science event and a community clean-up.As part of moves to develop \"stronger connections for local voices\", as well as improving participation by young people and schools in community planning, there are also proposals for a new focus group drawn from local residents to support the ICP\u0027 work.This is off the back of evidence that residents have \"little confidence that their voices are heard\".Marked by lower than average incomes and a lack of qualifications in young people leaving school, in 2016 the average life expectancy in Merkinch was just 66 years \u0026ndash compared to 82 in the affluent Crown area, barely a mile away.The report stated: \"Community partners recognise that, in order for health and wellbeing interventions to be effective, they need to be delivered in the local community in partnership with existing community projects and activities.\"We recognise that our best chance of achieving success is to put people and communities at the centre of our planning and delivery processes.\"We will work with the people to tackle what matters most to them and will make a positive difference to their lives and to the community.\"Notwithstanding this, it also means that we recognise that communities can and do achieve great things for themselves.\"We need to harness such achievements and increase the level of influence and sense of control that people have over decisions and services across the locality.\"The plan also raises the possibility of support for residents to take direct control of a range of community assets.Council city centre manager David Haas said: \"We have talked to all the local communities to find out what people want to see improved and help the great work that\u0027 already being done in these areas by existing groups.\"We want to give them the encouragement to do more.\"It\u0027 down to us to listen to what people want and give them a helping hand to create the community they want.\"Dell McClurg, chairwoman of Merkinch Community Council, said it was ironic that it was apparently not told of the launch event \"until it had already started\" but agreed: \"There needs to be more help for the people who are already working at the coal-face in the area.\"She said: \"It\u0027 important that the people who live and work here are listened to.\"We live here and we know what works in this area.\"We just need the right level of support.\"Highland councillor Bet McAllister (Inverness Central) said: \"Things are really moving forward in the area and people seem happy with where we are going.\"As councillors, we need to be out there speaking to the community, and letting people know that they can come to us.\"Many strands of the plan are due to get under way imminently, with moves to review current provision for unemployed people set to start in August. The findings will be used to determine future actions.Longer term plans for a \"bespoke early leavers programme\", which includes ensuring all early school leavers have an individual work coach, are

reaching the end of its operational life.\u0026nbspAn options appraisal and consultation were commissioned in 2017.Members also agreed it would be sensible to commission a scoping report to give an overview of the whole links area and future options.The report considers the current use of the links and the area\u0027 context within the town, its management and sustainability and potential options for developing the site.It also notes it is important for the development plan to fit within the common good fund\u0027 financial boundaries\u0026nbsp and the plans of potential partners.Councillor Liz MacDonald urged the public to get involved in the consultation.\"The good thing is, it looks like there are going to be opportunities to deliver this time because there is the

Therefore, we support separating pedestrians, cyclists and motorists through an expansion of the network of walking and cycling paths across Scotland.We would like to stress, however, that measures like these will not single-handedly lead to safer roads. The road mentality in Scotland still favours the motorist over more vulnerable road users, which presents a huge barrier to more people taking up active lifestyles.More needs to be done to change our road culture for people in Scotland to feel safer regardless of their means of transportation, ultimately empowering them to lead healthier and more active lifestyles.Perhaps it is time we started to beat the ‘presumed liability’ drum once again?Brenda Mitchell, Road Traffic Accident Law (Scotland) LLP, Edinburgh.Sir,Some people have difficulty getting up and down the steps on the Glasgow bus.

A platform comes out on to the pavement, with a holding bar, and is then raised up to floor level. This is designed as a wheelchair lift, where two seats at the front have to be arranged to be taken out, to give plenty of room.It was agreed, however, that if someone felt nervous about climbing up or down the stairs, they could also use the access platform. Once they have paid their ticket, they can walk to a seat.West Coast Motors asks anyone wanting this service to please remember two things.Firstly, book your single or return tickets by phone or on the Citylink website.Then, 48 hours before your journey, phone Citylink and tell them the times and details of the booking you have made and let them know you will be using the access ramp. The telephone number is 08712 663333.Kirsty McCuaig and Patricia Crawford, Mid Argyll Buddies.Sir,The ongoing effects of weather, bureaucracy and concern for the future continue to put our countryside under pressure, with few avenues to turn to for support.This can have dramatic consequences for the rural economy and the people who live and work there.The Prince’s Countryside Fund is committed to supporting community-led projects that will re-invigorate and sustain farming networks and the countryside by providing services and amenities through its grant programme.Open for applications until June 14, grants are available for up to £50,000. If you are involved in a community-run or farming support project and think your organisation may benefit – or if you know someone who might –  visit  www.princescountrysidefund. org.uk/grants.The fund has supported a diverse range of projects, including a community transport app in Argyll and projects on Barra, Orkney and Shetland.

Beyond our concerns for public safety, this systematic under-investment is slowing our economy and costing local councils a fortune in compensation for car owners.We recognise the importance of well-maintained roads and we are willing to invest in it.The SNP has consistently neglected Scotland’s roads and the results are obvious for everyone to see.Councillor Alastair Redman, Islay.On Monday May 14, I spotted six swallows over the rear of Meadows Place, hopefully heralding a decent summer.First seen this year.Mike Power, Lochgilphead.Sir,During this week\u0026#8217s Holyrood vote on the UK Government’s Withdrawal Bill, Labour, the Greens and LibDems joined the SNP in an overwhelming rejection of the UK Government’s currently-drafted Brexit plans, voting 93 to 30 against the bill.While the Scottish Government agrees in the need for UK-wide frameworks, it has described the retention of the overall control of agriculture, fisheries, food labelling and public procurement as a power grab.The Scottish Parliament has spoken loudly and clearly, and if the UK Government wants us to believe they value Scotland and devolution, they must respect the vote and remove the proposed power grab.Any constraints placed on the existing powers of the Scottish Parliament without consent would be a democratic outrage.During Prime Minister\u0026#8217s Questions, Theresa May failed to reassure us she will respect the decision of the Scottish Parliament. If she does choose to ignore the vote and force through this legislation, she will be breaking the conventions of the 20-year-old devolution settlement and imposing a power grab upon Scotland against our will.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 21/05/18, 3:33 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Some would argue it has been an eyesore that should have been knocked down long before now and replaced with a more modern building.But it\u0026#8217s sad to see the old Inveraray Community Hall crumble and rot with neglect.What makes the building\u0026#8217s current predicament all the more galling is that there was the chance, according to Inspire Inveraray, to make the building safe six years ago.

As with other gull species which are opportunist in diet, junk food and bits of plastic provided by us humans can be inadvertently consumed.Over many years the Gleaner oil depot, which has a concrete bund in case of oil spillage, has provided a safe nesting site for around 20 pairs. The suggestion that this colony could easily find an alternative site is perhaps wishful thinking as suitable sites nearby in Mid Argyll are already occupied by other gull species or don’t have the required habitat features.Thankfully, however, this should not prove necessary. Following a productive on-site meeting last week with the Scottish Canals\u0026#8217 environmental scientist, the project architect and TSL contractors we noted 10-15 birds sitting on eggs and unaffected by the work going on around them.Planned works over the coming weeks should not affect these gulls, Oystercatchers or Black Guillemots from nesting and will also not impede the building work which is scheduled to be completed by next spring.The Mid Argyll hub project and new canal museum will largely reflect the social and cultural heritage of the Crinan Canal, but should also encompass the important and often decreasing natural history of the Crinan Canal corridor. These breeding birds are also a part of this and should not just be something to ‘chase off’ to somewhere else.Excellent viewing and educational opportunities from the new build will be possible to watch this colony raise their chicks as well as providing a point to lookout for other wildlife on the loch.Nearby, the tidal estuary of Loch Gilp provides us with an often highly under-valued unofficial nature reserve that links Ardrishaig with Lochgilphead, which in winter hosts important numbers of duck and waders, in summer includes breeding Eider ducks and Common Terns and during migration is a vital stopping off point during adverse weather for passage Whooper swans, Brent geese and Black-tailed Godwits to name a few.Increasingly good work is being undertaken by locals and the Phoenix Trust to help clear up some of the increasing amounts of shoreline rubbish.Keep up the good work!Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,I have been out and about Islay the past week speaking to my constituents, visiting local businesses and monitoring the roads department\u0026#8217s progress with road repairs.Unfortunately CalMac management\u0026#8217s shocking handling of our local ferry service is really taking it\u0026#8217s toll on many local businesses that depend heavily of Islay\u0026#8217s growing tourist trade. We simply cannot allow CalMac to continue to make the same errors every year without consequences.On another subject, I have been unimpressed with our local roads department management\u0026#8217s sluggish response to a large number of complaints from local residents and myself about the plague of potholes scattered across Islay.There are many roads across Islay that have some potholes marked to be filled while others remain unmarked despite them in many cases being side by side. This scattershot approach to pothole repairs is as random as it is ineffective.In the future we will need to see a more long term resurfacing solution to our local roads with less short term, random and piecemeal patchwork.Cllr Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,In the run up to National Volunteering Week (June 1- 7), Cats Protection would like to extend our thanks to the many thousands of volunteers throughout the country who offer their time and expertise to help cats and kittens across the UK.In 2017, our 10,200-strong volunteer network contributed an incredible 5.5 million hours, each volunteer gifting a wealth of expertise and immeasurable passion to the charity. Their dedication enabled Cats Protection to help around 200,000 cats and kittens nationwide.Cats Protection is always on the lookout for new volunteers to join the UK’s biggest cat community. Though a large part of our work is helping cats, through fostering and rehoming, our volunteers have the opportunity to become involved with a range of interesting activities such as organising fundraising events, helping with publicity or managing funds and resources to benefit the greatest amount of cats.Volunteering can offer the chance to develop skills such as time management, interpersonal skills and teamwork, making CVs much more attractive and, of course, helping cats.Anyone who is interested in becoming a volunteer can go to our website www.cats.org.uk/get- involved/volunteering  to find out more.Julie Meredith, head of volunteering development, Cats Protection,Sir,I really love being active, especially the feeling after and that’s why I’m supporting Bowel Cancer UK and Beating Bowel Cancer’s latest fundraising campaign to get sponsored to do 30 minutes of physical activity for 30 days in June.Step up for 30 is a fantastic way for you to be more physically active to reduce your risk of bowel cancer – the UK’s second biggest cancer killer. This can be anything from yoga, walking in the sunshine (I walk everywhere) or taking your favourite class at the gym.While you’re getting fitter and feeling healthier, you’ll be raising money to fund the highest quality research and essential information and support services that will save lives from bowel cancer.Take on the challenge and sign up at bowelcanceruk.org.uk/stepupfor30.Gaby Roslin, TV and radio presenterPICS:The common gull has been seen nesting at the disused oil depot. no_a21Gleanergull01Gulls at the former Gleaner site. no_a21Gleanergull02\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week june 1 2018","story":"\t\tHannah O\u0027HanlonUpdated: 30/05/18, 11:35 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThere are certain moments that just simply enchant us.One such moment happened this week when we were holidaying in Dunkeld.Almost every day we visited the wildlife centre at the Loch of the Lowes and delighted in our times watching the osprey.From the webcam we could see every detail.We watched with great anticipation to see when the chicks would emerge from their eggs, of which there were three.One of the days we went to the centre there was great excitement as one of the eggs was about to hatch.The staff there are dedicated volunteers who love sharing their knowledge of these wonderful birds.To our total delight we witnessed the birth first-hand as the shell cracked open and out struggled a tiny little chick as the mother bird looked on anxiously.I could hardly believe that this tiny scrap of life would be strong enough to fly to Africa in just a few months.Shortly, the father bird arrived with a very large fish and I was amazed at the tenderness of this great strong bird as he gently fed his baby.Since then we have been \u0026#8216hooked\u0026#8217 as we follow this wee family at the beginning of their journey of life.Soon the chicks will be given flying and fishing lessons and will leave the safety of the nest.My prayer is that they will all safely complete their long journey to Africa and that they will come back next year to enchant people once again.When they go, sometime in September, I fear that I will suffer from \u0026#8217empty nest syndrome\u0026#8217 till they come back again next spring.Scripture tells us: \u0026#8216Seek information from the birds of the air.\u0026#8217\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 22","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 31/05/18, 11:50 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.CalMac management’s shocking handling of our ferry service is taking its toll on local businesses which depend on Islay’s growing tourist trade.We simply cannot allow CalMac to continue to make the same errors every year without consequences.Also, I have been unimpressed with our roads department management’s sluggish response to a large number of complaints from residents and myself about the potholes across Islay.Councillor Alastair Redman, IslaySir,I\u0026#8217m inviting your readers to get their walking boots or trainers on for the Stroke Association and sign up to the summer marathon challenge, Walk Your Way.In April 2013, a year after my own stroke, I took on​ the London Marathon. It was a huge step in my recovery and helped to draw attention to this devastating condition while raising money for a wonderful charity that I\u0026#8217m proud to be an ambassador for.Walk Your Way takes place between 17 June and 1 July to raise money to support stroke survivors and their families.  You can walk the whole 26.2 miles in one go, do it over a few days or spread the distance over the two-week period and get sponsored to do it. It’s your chance to take on the distance of a marathon on your own terms.For many stroke survivors like me, getting your life back means overcoming life-changing disabilities and emotional difficulties. By taking part in Walk Your Way you’ll be helping to reduce your own risk of stroke, and the vital funds you’ll raise will help the charity to support more stroke survivors to regain their independence.Sign up to Walk Your Way now: stroke.org.uk/WalkYourWayMichael Lynagh, former Australian rugby union internationalSir,What is it with people who drive cars while doing other things?As a driver I often see people behind the wheel talking on mobile phones, sending texts, touching up make-up in the mirror and, on a few occasions recently, the same man has been shaving while bowling merrily along the A83 trunk road \u0026#8211 while in a van belonging to an Argyll and Bute public agency.It just takes a split second for an accident to happen through losing concentration behind the wheel.Put down your smartphone, make-up bag and electric razor before either the police catch you or an accident happens.Name and address supplied\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column 26","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 02/06/18, 3:08 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.What a spell of weather we have had over the past week and more.Knowing the Argyll climate, by the time you read this you might be sitting in a blizzard in front of the fire enjoying your paper but it was good while it lasted.Welcome as it is, warm weather brings its own problems.

These had a variety of riding and control of paces challenges including an unusual off piste element using the quarry area of the field.Judge Debbie Hay Thorburn was very impressed with the independent riding of the youngest members who tackled all the tasks with confidence and determination. The show jumping catered for all ages and abilities and there were exciting jump-offs to entertain spectators. In fact many of the passing ferry passengers stopped to watch from the road.The new timing equipment, purchased with aid of a grant from Tarbert and Skipness Community Trust, was in full use by judge Mairi Henderson and made for more professional accuracy in timing aspects.The final Grand Prix had only two competitors but it was a masterclass of style and competence from Jojo and Katie which made it a joy to watch.As usual the event ended with some fast and exciting games and after the field was cleared there was the prizegiving in the Pony Club’s brand new blue tent.The Junior Trophy for the day was won by Louise Ralston from Campbeltown and Iris McMillan from Tayvallich took the Senior Trophy for a second year while the non-members trophy was won by Andrea McShannon.Pony Club PonyClass 11 Frazer Prentice, Firefly2 Louise Ralston, Nero3 Rory Shaw, Libby4 Jake Rowan, AliceClass 21 Willow Ryan, Ryan2 Zoe Prentice, Cowal3 Isla McShannon, ColeyClass 31 Iris McMillan, Conker2 Katie MacKay, Eva3 Josephine Boase, ValerieClass 41 Andrea McShannon, Nicole2 Julie McLeish, Eclipse3 Shelagh Oakes, Pery4 Catriona Ryan, DoneyShow JumpingStars of the Future \u0026#8211 Lead Rein1 Louise Ralston, Nero2 Frazer Prentice, Firefly3 Rory Shaw, Libby4 Jake Rowan, AliceStars of the Future1 Iris McMillan, Conker2 Zoe Prentice, Cowal3 Isla McShannon, Coley4 Willow Ryan, RyanNewcomers1 Iris McMillan, Conker2 Andrea McShannon, Nicole3 Michelle McAloon, Eclipse4 Catriona Ryan, DoneyDiscovery1 Josephine Boase, Valerie2 Andrea McShannon, Nicole3 Katie MacKay, Eva4 Michelle McAloon, EclipseGrand Prix1 Josephine Boase, Valerie2 Katie MacKay, Eva\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 07/06/18, 4:46 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.This week\u0026#8217s photograph comes from Jacqui Barker of Tarbert.

After a pit stop in the Royal Burgh it was on to Fort William, then Inverness and back home again- all to raise money for Cancer Research UK and Target Ovarian Cancer.Spokesperson for Breast Way Round, Laura White, said: ‘This year was full of fun, laughter, meeting new family members and although the daily miles are hard going, the weather and the beauty of the Scottish scenery made it that little bit easier.’As well as the sponsored trek, the bikers raised money in more traditional ways, such as bucket shaking (the men wearing bras) and hosting a raffle and auction in Caol Community Centre. The most coveted item, a patchwork quilt made by rider Cathy Anderson, went for a whopping £700.The annual trip was started in 2008 by Shirley-Ann McKnight as a last tour of Scotland for fellow biker and close friend, Alyson Porter, who was suffering from cancer. Sadly, Alyson never made it to her trip and now each year the journey is retraced in celebration of her life and all those affected by cancer.Since 2008, more than 600 riders have participated, each clad with a pink mohawk courtesy of Hairy-RS, and the team has raised £347,000 for Macmillan Cancer Support.

They won a throw-in deep in the Glasgow Red Star half, taken by Craig Aitken. After playing a neat one-two with Woody Hoad, Craig sent in a teasing cross for Keiran Caskie to glance past the Glasgow Red Star keeper.Lochgilphead introduced Jamie Stewart and Ciaran Gibson who helped freshen things up and work hard to close the game out.Special mention to subs Lee Harris, just returning from injury, and the ever reliable Calum Paterson.At the end of the game the Lochgilphead boys were presented with the League Cup and also the League Championship for 2004 age group teams to make it a double celebration.With three games still left to play the boys are looking to make it through the season with only one league defeat.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column 27","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 10/06/18, 3:50 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.The last thing David MacInnes sees himself as is a hero.Be we believe differently.

The pair were seeded car 30 in the two wheel drive section, run first on the day in a new schedule being piloted by the rally, the two wheel drive cars covering the stages before the four wheel drive cars followed in the afternoon.With the dry conditions in the weeks running up to the event dust would be the main problem for those running further down the field. Douglas attacked the first stage, Twiglees, and was catching the car in front when, unfortunately due to the dust being created by that car, came out of a 90 degree corner with zero visibility and connected heavily with a rock, damaging the suspension and forcing his early retirement.The car, and the driver, are noticeably quicker  each event they compete in and it\u0026#8217s only a matter of time before the results are there.The other Argyll car out on the stages was Ally Currie from Mull and Grant McNiven in the Ford Fiesta ST picking up 9th overall and 1st in Class 6.The next round of the Scottish Championship is Argyll Rally, based in Dunoon on June 23 \u0026#8211 the closest round for most Argyll rally enthusiasts and one not to be missed. The stages look absolutely breathtaking this year and well worth a watch.The Scottish Tarmac Rally Championship continues as well with round three being the Granite at Leuchars Stages hosted by Aberdeen and District Motor Club at the MOD base in Leuchars, Fife.Argyll was well represented both in the drivers seat and the co-drivers. All Argyll crew Willie and Steven Beattie were out in the newly finished and beautifully finished Escort MkII. They were absolutely flying and really getting to grips with the car when a sixth gear lock-up threw them into a spin and off the stage, clouting a fairly substantial fence post in the process.The navigators side now looks decidedly second hand, but nothing a few hours in the workshop won\u0026#8217t sort. A bent bottom suspension arm put paid to them re-joining but they will take the positives and the blistering pace into the next round for sure.Willie Beattie Snr in his equally exquisite Escort was also beginning to get the hang of the car, with some more seat time this year, not to mention experienced co-driver, Phil Sandham, pushing him on. He, after making sure his boys were okay when they didn\u0026#8217t show up at service after their spin, continued on to secure 12th overall and second in class: his first honours since building the car.The next round may see some family ties severely stretched, at least until the final results are announced.Ian Parker was also out in familiar machinery, co-driving for Fraser Smith in his Canal Garage-prepared Honda Civic. The pair were also making good progress up the class rankings until the diff decided to implode and finished their rally on Stage six.The drive of the day was not in question. Alan Kirkaldy led from start to finish despite some interesting issues in the first test. His door came loose after about a third of stage and he continued, holding the door shut by the open window whilst steering, changing gear and waving with the other.Astonishingly he still managed quickest stage time by five seconds. His co-driver for the day could forgive himself for being a little green about the gills after that.Eoghan Anderson from Cairnbaan was lucky enough to win the seat in a charity auction at the Annual STRC Dinner earlier in the year.

Now scientists from the University of Aberdeen have added a third species to the mix \u0026#8211 the European pine marten. These native squirrel predators are recolonising Britain after years of persecution, and so the scientists set out to uncover the impact of this on red and grey squirrel populations.Three study sites in Scotland were in the Highlands (marten recolonisation for over 45 years, no grey squirrels), Central Scotland (marten recolonisation for 8-14 years, grey squirrels since 1945) and the Borders (early stages of marten recolonization, grey squirrels since 1980).Populations were monitored for five months using cameras and multi-species feeders \u0026#8211 the latter with glue strips on the underside of the lid to obtain visitor hair samples. This material provided DNA to determine visitor species and identify individual martens.The results showed that while red squirrels avoided feeders used by martens, greys were equally likely to use feeders whether frequented by martens or not. So grey squirrel numbers were reduced where exposure to pine martens was high, whereas numbers of red squirrels increased – unequivocal evidence that recovering marten numbers affect competition between red and grey squirrels.This finding is likely explained by the fact that reds, having co-evolved with martens, instinctively avoid areas used by martens but invasive greys, having no such instincts, showed no avoidance behaviour at all.Since pine martens’ range is increasing and extending southwards, scientists are optimistic that this will control the invasive grey squirrel species.As they say in the title to their report, in this case ‘the enemy of my enemy is my friend’.PIC:The native grey squirrel may have an unlikely ally.

We simply don\u0026#8217t have enough children playing shinty in each school to make up separate clubs.Surely, in 2018, this shouldn\u0026#8217t be allowed to happen?It is only three clubs that are being affected by this, and they\u0026#8217re all in the south of Scotland,  half way through a season, leaving all our kids devastated at the though of losing their chosen sport.My son has been playing shinty since Primary One. He is now heading into Primary Four and is even more passionate about the sport. He enjoys quality team time, striving to be the best he can and just loving playing the game.It\u0026#8217s very difficult to explain something like this to an eight-year-old child, never mind the Primary One children we have in our club.One quote from a child was: \u0026#8216Everyone is going to be so sad if we don\u0026#8217t have shinty. Why would shinty people do this to us?\u0026#8217It\u0026#8217s a very sad day indeed for the children of Argyll and Bute who are simply being punished for what school they go to and where they live. We have to stand together and fight for our club and our children.The Camanachd Association needs to step up and find a solution to allow all children to compete nationally and stand as one united shinty community.Ailsa and Alastair Crawford, LochgilpheadSir,The Camanachd Association has put politics before the needs of the children and the development of the sport in Argyll.The kids are disappointed and the coaches who have worked tirelessly to set the club up are deflated. Surely the association knows this is a mistake that needs rectified immediately.Personally, Kilmory and Dunadd children\u0026#8217s club has inspired our son and daughter to get involved with the sport and to grow in confidence amongst other like-minded children.Stuart and Simone Charnock, LochgilpheadSir,My son has trained with Kilmory/Dunadd shinty club since he was in Primary One. The club has always treated the kids equally and welcomed all kids to participate.After years of hard work, the team was progressing well and was worthy of competing at national level.In his last year before high school, to be told he is no longer allowed to play is not only devastating to my son but greatly confusing and he is left wondering what he has done wrong.I fail to see how this can be classed as progress by the Camanachd Association. This needs to be readdressed to allow kids to compete in the game they love.Susan Jackson, LochgilpheadI was very angry to hear from local residents in Portnahaven that their recycling bins have been used by numerous motorhomes for disposing of general waste, including food waste.I have visited the recycling bins site in Portnahaven and spoken to my constituents in person about this and I can confirm that unfortunately Portnahaven\u0026#8217s recycling bins are full of general waste.This is as unacceptable as it is disrespectful. I have contacted the appropriate department with the council and asked for an investigation to be done. I also asked for some addition signage for the bins area.I made it very clear that my constituents should not lose their recycling facilities as a result of their bins being misused by someone else.I will continue to monitor this situation and provide an update as soon as I have more information.Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,It is fitting to mark this Diabetes Week (June 11-17) for Scotland’s 30,000 adults and children living with type one diabetes by noting that life-changing monitors are now available on the NHS.A child diagnosed with type one diabetes at five faces 50,000 finger prick blood glucose tests by the time they are 18.Each painful finger prick is part of a daily routine which also includes calculating carbohydrate intake and frequent insulin injections, all to prevent life-threatening hypoglycaemia and long term complications.But since November last year, a \u0026#8216flash glucose monitoring\u0026#8217 system called the Freestyle Libre can be prescribed by local GPs, offering an alternative to such intensive finger-pricking.The roll out of flash glucose monitoring, which gives a reading via a simple sensor, however, is not consistent across all local health boards. So, our message for Diabetes Week is to call for health boards in Scotland to speed up prescription policies and step up much needed prescriptions.As someone who has lived with type one diabetes for 21 years, new technology, such as the FreeStyle Libre, makes a world of difference.Type one diabetes cannot be prevented and until we find the cure for it, research and technology are vital.Holly Davies, development manager, Aberdeen\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"working to preserve the yarns of yesteryear","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 20/06/18, 7:14 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowPeople across Argyll and Bute are being encouraged to take part in a unique project that will help to preserve tales about the area for future generations.Argyll and Bute Youth Services is calling on people of all ages to help gather stories, film clips, photographs and objects about the area to celebrate the uniqueness of Argyll and Bute.The Digital Storytelling Project is part of the national Year of Young People and aims to bring together our younger and older generations to share their stories and folklore tales of yesteryear.Argyll and Bute Council’s policy lead for education, Councillor Yvonne McNeilly said: \u0026#8216This is not only a great way of capturing precious stories about the area, but it’s an excellent opportunity for a mix of generations to work together.\u0026#8216Argyll is teeming with folklore tales, from giant serpents and mermaids being spotted on our coastlines in years gone by, to stories of haunted caves and bloody battles \u0026#8211 we’ve got a lot to talk about.\u0026#8216The Year of Young People is all about bringing generations together and celebrating our young people.

Labour’s Phil Saxton, who represents Troon, is to table a motion before colleagues calling for a rethink.  He said: “The word we’re looking for here is compromise. “I don’t think the relevant detail was considered when this policy was first introduced. “The ability to enforce something like this will always be very difficult.” Cllr Saxton is now expected to lead calls for a ‘mixed’ smoking zone outside cafes or bars which use council-owned pavements. He said: “We could look at 50 per cent of the tables smoking and 50 per cent not. “I don’t think that’s an unreasonable solution. “Right now I’m looking at gathering support and hopefully the vote will go our way.”  That vote is scheduled to take place on June 28 when the council holds its last full meeting before the summer recess. It’s understood members are currently divided on the issue, which was introduced under the council’s last administration. The new move comes as the Post reported last week how furious cafe bosses said their business was under threat because of the “crazy”council law. Nino and Karen Pajovic insisted a smoking ban outside their Cafe Le Monde premises in Ayr was costing them thousands Said Nino: “A compromise along these lines would be perfect and is surely the common sense approach.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"brave mum set skydive charity","story":"NewsBrave mum set to skydive for charity for inspirational nephewJoanne Dunlop, of Ayr, will jump from a hair-raising 10,000ft at Skydive St Andrews.\u0026nbspShareByLochlin Highet10:32, 15 JUN 2018NewsMegan Mcphearson and Joanne Dunlop\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA brave mum is set to take to the skies for her inspirational nephew.

She is tackling this momentous challenge with work colleague Megan Mcphearson to raise awareness and funds for Down’s Syndrome Scotland. The 41-year-old’s nephew Reeve has Down’s Syndrome, which is a genetic disorder caused by the presence of all or part of a third copy of chromosome 21. The Ayr Hopsital nurse wants to give something back, claiming Reeve is an inspiration to everyone who knows him. The mother-of-two said: “I have always wanted to do something out the ordinary so decided to a skydive for Down’s syndrome. “I have the most amazing nephew ever and love him will all my heart and want to do this for him and to raise awareness.  “I see people raising funds for other charities all the time, but this one is important to me and I have never seen any fundraisers for Down’s Syndrome. “It’s something I have never had the cause to do, but now I do. “Reeve is five in September and I decided to try and get my work colleagues to do it. “We started with 17 people interested, but it’s whittled down to just Megan and I now. “Between us we have raised \u0026pound800 so far which is fantastic.” Joanne has raised \u0026pound320 on her Just Giving page so far and is calling for more donations towards her skydive on June 19.

Villagers - and residents across the greenbelt in Muirhead - mounted a stiff rearguard action after a bid to get it zoned for housing. For the first time it emerged a developer WAS behind the plan, rather than, as was insisted, South Ayrshire Council officers just selected it as a prospect. Senior SNP councillor Craig Mackay said on Tuesday it was now “highly unlikely” it would make the next stage. And he told Troon Community Council : “No decisions have been made and we are not out of the woods yet with the Muirhead-Loans site yet. “But on the basis the available land pretty much matches what we need for new housing over the next five years, there should be no need for any release of greenbelt sites. “It is highly unlikely it will be built on.” We revealed the secret plan for the soggy 30 acre field in October, which would link the medieval clachan to the town of Troon. It sparked an emergency meeting of Loans Community Council and the public packed out Troon Community Council meetings.  And at the time town councillor Peter Convery said: “That ground is sacrosanct and it should never have been suggested for the local plan.” Planners were promoting the sight, saying the “layouts of both settlements turn their backs twoards each other at the moment and this doesnt create an attractive approach to either of them.” Councillor Mackay said the house sites currently available “pretty much” matched the demand. And he revealed South Ayrshire Council has now taking a slightly different approach from the developer-led schemes. He added: “Brownfield land will be prioritised even though that is not as lucrative for developers.” Councillor Mackay also revealed a developer had been circling on the Loans site - despite insistence from council officers there was no developer. He said:”Planning officers gave assurances there was no developer.. but there was.”  The breakthrough has been hailed by David Chalmers, chairman of Loans Community Council. He said: “It is obviously encouraging hearing Councillor McKay’s statement that development be allowed on the greenbelt between Loans and Muirhead is unlikely to be adopted in LDP2. “We will, of course, anxiously await SAC’s verification of this which we understand will not be until nearer the end of this year. “Every praise should be given to the overwhelming response given by the residents of Loans and Muirhead - a 367 signature petition and 246 letters - which clearly demonstrated the level of feeling against.” South Ayrshire Council said the process to publish the new Development Plan was still active. A spokesman said: “There are a range of issues that are suggested, discussed and determined. This is a very thorough process to ensure that all stakeholders are given due consideration. As a result, we’ll only be able to give assurance of what is included in, or excluded from the proposed plan when a report is considered by the Council later this year.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnScottish National PartySouth Ayrshire CouncilTroonAyrAyr News"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"girl 4 stuck playpark equipment","story":"NewsGirl, 4, gets stuck in playpark equipment and needs fire brigade to rescue herPetrified Lily-Mags Rodman ended up wedging her wee leg in a metal car in Belleisle near Ayr.\u0026nbspShareBySarah Hilley16:44, 20 JUN 2018Updated19:45, 20 JUN 2018NewsLittle Lily-Mags had her leg stuck in the toy car for 40 minutes\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA four-year-old girl got stuck in playpark equipment for 40 minutes as firefighters struggled to get access to her. Petrified Lily-Mags Rodman ended up wedging her wee leg in a metal car in Belleisle. Her father David and other parents were unable to free her, sparking an emergency services rescue. But crews faced a major delay as access to the park through the main entrance was blocked off due to fencing at the Belleisle Hotel. The crew had to abandon their fire engine some distance away and run across the grass to reach Lily-Mags. After assessing the situation, they were forced to backtrack their appliance through the main exit and find another way in.  Mum Clare said: “Luckily my daughter wasn’t badly hurt, but if it was a life-or-death situation and a child had fallen from equipment it may have been too late.” Clare, who was working from home outside Ayr, rushed to the park after her husband phoned. Clare, 33, said: “I drove in a panic. “Her leg was wedged in the car at a funny angle. “I could hear her screaming over the phone. My husband and others tried to get her out but it hurt so they called the fire brigade.” Firefighters calmly cut off the side of the car to free the tot.  She emerged unscathed but with bad pins and needles during the incident a week past last Wednesday. Now Clare and Lily-Mag’s gran Anita O’Connor are calling for an emergency services route to the wooded park. Clare said: “The fire service were really fantastic but it took them 10 minutes to figure out how to get the fire engine in.” Anita said: “She was stuck for well over 40 minutes as the fire engine couldn’t find a route through to the park because of the fencing. “Fortunately she has not sustained any injuries, but she is extremely traumatised. “This issue regarding access needs to be addressed ASAP and not sat on for days until the council have their next meeting.”  Belleisle Hotel owner Campbell Inns erected more fencing on June 6, which has blocked off access to the playpark through the main driveway. The alternative entrance is now through Greenfield Avenue. Anita said emergency services should have been notified of the issue. A council spokesman said: Due to layout changes affecting the main access road at Belleisle, emergency services had to enter via an alternate route. “We are contacting the emergency services to advise them to use the alternative entrance for the time being.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12704340.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/35265670_1680890188694011_7257840954613170176_n.jpg","title":"public hunt dog vanished irvine","story":"NewsPublic hunt for dog that vanished on Irvine beachMaisey\u0027s been missing for almost 24 hours.\u0026nbspShareByRoss Dunn11:04, 14 JUN 2018News\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA dog owner is urging the public to keep an eye out for her missing pooch.

And 15-year-old Ayr United starlet Finn Ecrepont is no different. Dubbed a hot prospect with a bright future, the local Ayr lad kicked off his footballing career with a knock back from Grange Academy’s Performance School of Football. The Kilmarnock school has dedicated facilities for bright talents in the footballing world. And after leaving Alloway Primary, Ecrepont’s aim was to join the set-up at the Grange - but he was told he wasn’t good enough at his trial for the performance school. But the left-back, who also went to Glenburn Primary, refused to give up on his dream. Ecrepont, who has played with Ayr United since he was nine, said: “Getting that knock back is key to where I am today, because that has made me realise it’s not as easy as just walking into a team. “I didn’t get through the first trial so that made me focus and I knew I had to work hard. “I guess there was choices to make and sacrifices to make, but I was willing to make these changes for my football.  “I had training at Ayr the night after I got my knock back so I went to ask my coach Ross Armour for advice, so that’s when the work began. “I went away and worked on my game and a year later I got into the performance school at the Grange, which is one of the best things that has ever happened to me.” Ecrepont worked his way up through the ranks at Ayr and has now signed a three year deal with the first team. Just last season he was training with the under 17s, but his progress has been off the scale and he is now training with the senior side. He has been getting day release from school on a Thursday to train with the first team, but after signing his new deal he will train four mornings a week with Ian McCall’s side. And despite most schools refusing to take him in due to his football commitments, Ayr Academy were good enough to take him in. And dad Eddy, who runs Cafe Ginger in Ayr, claims teachers from Ayr Academy have offered to work overtime to help Ecrepont through his studies. Ecrepont is delighted to get his chance so early with Ayr.  He said: “The coaches thought I was playing well so I got more of a chance through my training and playing more with the under 20s last season. “I just love being in and around the first team, and the boys have been great with me so I am happy to be where I’m at at the moment. “Everyone at the club has been brilliant with me, through all the age groups. All the senior players and coaches have been really accepting of me and I couldn’t have asked for anything more. “Ian McCall and all of the other coaches are great because they always give me feedback. “Whether it’s positive or negative they are always keeping me right. That has been key to my progression. “If I was to ask anyone a question at Ayr they would answer it no problem, and that’s exactly what I look for and it’s why I’m here.” Despite the gruelling schedule of being a footballer, Ecrepont claims he is still fully focused on his school work.  He said: “Adapting to be a footballer hasn’t been much different as I enjoy it and it’s more like a hobby. I play football for fun and that’s what’s most important to me, so I guess it’s just normal. “It can take a lot out of me, but again because I enjoy football so much I don’t really realise how much I am doing. “I don’t think it’s had an effect on my school and I think it’s going good. Hopefully I have done well in my exams which I’ll find out in August. “I’ll get a Wednesday off from training so I can hopefully work towards getting my highers. “This year I’m studying higher English and PE, next year I’ll do something like Chemistry and Biology. And despite his age, Ecrepont has already been involved in a number of big games. He scored for Scotland under 16s against England, but for Ayr under 20s he was involved in a league decider last season against Morton. He said: “Unfortunately we lost the game 1-0 from a penalty, but I played the full game and it was a great experience and the boys played really well.  “There was quite a few Ayr United fans there so they gave us a great support.” But Ecrepont refuses to forget where he came from, he is sure to consistently help his dad Eddy in Cafe Ginger. Ecrepont said: “I signed for Ayr on the Tuesday, I was washing dishes for my dad on the Friday and on the Monday I was training with Scotland. “I work with my dad at the cafe which has been key to keeping me grounded. I know for a fact he wouldn’t let me get big-headed so I couldn’t thank him enough for that. “I’ve been asked before where I see myself in five years, but the honest answer is I don’t know. “For all I know I could get injured tomorrow and break my leg. “I have been told many times that I haven’t made it, and I know that. “My hard work starts now, so I just need to take everything as it comes and take each day on its own.” "},{"url":null,"title":"Glee as Melrose Primary choir raises the roof in Perth","story":"PERFORMING pupils from Melrose are officially amongst the best in Scotland.\nThe

Royal Burgh Standard Bearer Peter Forrest.\nOn Friday morning the 26-year-old joiner led his town with both authority and calmness as Souters celebrated and honoured their historic traditions.\nYet the countdown couldn\u0027t have been more nerve-racking or distracting.\nDelays in Selkirk town centre renovations meant a reshuffle of vantage points for the iconic Casting of the Colours ceremony.\nAnd on the eve of the Common Riding itself, Storm Hector rampaged through the Royal Burgh tearing down bunting and leaving a trail of destruction and debris.\nIf the build-up wasn\u0027t distracting enough, a thoughtless thug spent the Nicht Afore the Morn spray-painting graffiti on landmarks including the War Memorial.\nBut just a few hours later the 2018 Standard Bearer remained the picture of calm as the sun gently rose on Friday morning.\nThe weather had relented, the debris had been cleared, the bunting had been restrung, and the vandalism was covered.\nAnd as Souters frae a\u0027 the airts linked arms and belted out the songs they\u0027d learned as children, all the woes were soon forgotten.\nSelkirk shone as it always does on Common Riding morning.\nAfter returning the Burgh Flag, Standard Bearer Forrest told us: \"I have been calm all week and even managed to get a good three hours\u0027 sleep last night.\n\"I\u0027m not sure how I manage it, but I don\u0027t get nervous at all, and despite everything that has happened, for me the Common Riding couldn\u0027t have gone any better.\n\"I\u0027ve loved the build up and I have loved every second of being Standard Bearer - I don\u0027t think the smile has left my face since the minute I got up this morning.\"\nWhether it was the four years he served as an Attendant - behind James Cheyne in 2009, Douglas Gunn in 2010, Gavin Henderson in 2012 and Kieran Riddle in 2017 - that equipped Peter for taking his duties in his stride, we\u0027ll never know.\nBut his composure and welcoming smile wasn\u0027t lost on any of the dignitaries around him.\nHonorary Provost Jake Wheelans said: \"After all the bad weather and everything else it was great to have Peter as our Standard Bearer.\n\"He was impeccable in every part of his duties today, and he upheld all of our traditions as a Standard Bearer should.\n\"Selkirk has enjoyed a tremendous Common Riding with a fantastic Standard Bearer.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"Keep calm - it  39 s only the Common Riding","story":"THE calming influence of Standard Bearer Peter Forrest made sure Selkirk Common Riding ran like clockwork on Friday.\nJust hours after Storm Hector had ripped through the region, Souters awoke to a serene and surprisingly relaxed morning.\nAnd about to head their day-long celebrations was to be the most relaxed of them all - Standard Bearer Forrest.\nThe Flute Band\u0027s Rouse Parade set the tone for a day few will forget.\nHundreds gathered at the War Memorial to honour the brave sons of Selkirk who didn\u0027t come home.\nAnd as the First Drum was sounded at 6am in the Market Place, the hundreds who do come home year after year from far off lands burst into song.\nHer Bright Smile has rarely sounded so good.\nThe build-up had well and truly begun.\nAnd by the time Standard Bearer Forrest was officially installed by Lady Busser, Dylis Wheelans, on the balcony of the Victoria Hall the hundreds had grown to thousands.\nA total of 281 riders followed the 2018 Standard Bearer doon the Green, across the Ettrick and up the Linglie.\nEveryone one of them was safe oot and every one of them returned safe in, some two-and-a-half hours later.\nOfficial reports later confirmed only three minor falls occurred throughout the entire procession.\nAs Standard Bearer Forrest, duly assisted by his Attendants Craig Monks, Robbie Reilly, Thomas Willmott and Liam Cassidy, led the cavalcade beyond Tibbie\u0027s towards the Three Brethren, beneath in the ancient streets of Selkirk the Hammermen, the Weavers, the Fleshers, the Colonials, the Merchants and the Ex-Soldiers began to muster ahead of their march to the Toll.\nAll the pomp and ceremony, headed by the trusty Silver and Pipe bands, brings out the best in this small rural burgh.\nIt\u0027s a place where pride and passion go hand in hand with smiles and laughter.\nSongs are sung, friendships rekindled and customs observed as the crowds patiently await the Coming in of the Burley.\nAnd they didn\u0027t have to wait long at Selkirk\u0027s northern most entrance as Standard Bearer Forrest, aboard the grey-dappled Lizzie, arrived to a cacophony of cheers and shouts of encouragement.\nProud parents, Ann and Rob, as well as girlfriend, Emma Pearce, were the first to offer him their congratulations as a well-deserved breather is taken at The Toll.\nAnd, in time-honoured fashion, his mounted followers made their own spectacular galloping return to the auld toon.\nJoyce Wright, representing the Ladies section of the Rig Committee, presented the traditional riding crop to Standard Bearer Forrest before he remounted to conclude his duties.\nAnd what a conclusion it is.\nThe Casting of the Colours pays homage to the heroic Fletcher, who returned from Flodden with a captured English banner and defiantly cast it around his head before dying.\nTo Up wi\u0027 the Souters Standard Bearer Forrest brought his ceremonial duties to an end with an impeccable cast.\nReflecting on his day, Peter told us: \"Being Standard Bearer was everything I knew it would be and more.\n\"I enjoyed the Marches - really enjoyed it - and my horse Lizzie was great.\n\"You think it can\u0027t get any better then it does. Coming in at The Toll was unbelievable and the Casting was something that will live with me forever.\n\"It has been a truly amazing day and I\u0027d like to thank everyone who came out and supported me.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"Casting their places in history","story":"SELKIRK Common Riding is undoubtedly a festival steeped in tradition and commemoration.\nBut it is also a day of contrasts for the followers as well as the ones lucky enough to take part.\nFrom the high-adrenaline riders returning at the Toll, the ecstasy and elation is quietly absorbed by reflection and respect as the colourful procession heads into town.\nBeneath silver skies the rearranged scarlet plinth within the Market Place awaited not only Royal Burgh Standard Bearer Peter Forrest, but the six accompanying Standard Bearers selected by the town\u0026rsquos ancient Societies and Associations.\nTo the growing thrum of expectation, as the hidden clock ticked past eleven, all seven gathered beneath the steps to await a brief minute or two that will live with them forever.\nSince the tragic cast of a blood-soaked English banner more than 500 years ago, this re-enactment both commemorates and celebrates, defiance and pride in equal measure.\nAnd as the Silver Band leads the way with Up wi\u0026rsquo the Souters, each Standard Bearer in turn re-enacts and relives this defiant and proud act.\nStandard Bearer Forrest, as he had been all morning, was assured and relaxed as he turned the Royal Burgh Standard above his head.\nIt was as deserved a cheer as any Standard Bearer has received as he smiled, waved and made his way from the gaze of five-thousand eyes.\nCollege lecturer Mark Easson \u0026ndash a painter by trade \u0026ndash resumed where Standard Bearer Forrest had left off. Armed with the Incorporation of Hammermen Banner, the 49-year-old showed a steady hand and perfect timing to provide an impeccable cast.\nHis smile was as deserved as the loud cheer that followed him down the steps.\nFletcher himself was a weaver before that bloody battle in 1513, and Michael Pepper made sure the fabric of the historic Corporation continued unblemished for another year.\nThe 27-year-old textiles worker may have looked a little nervous but as his cast continued his smile grew. Again, the appreciation was richly deserved.\nFormer farmer Jackie Johnston brought experience with him as he provided a perfect cast of the Incorporation of Fleshers Flag.\nIf there were nerves, they didn\u0026rsquot show as the self-employed excavator took it all in his stride, even managing a thumbs-up to the conductor of the Silver Band before dismounting.\nWhile the other Standard Bearers have enjoyed several weeks\u0026rsquo of practice under the guiding gaze of those who have gone before them, Colonial Standard Bearer Alisdair Piercy has been using two broom-handles taped together with an old Scotland flag in his garage in Toronto.\nBut casting the colours is in his blood - the 39-year-old was following in the footsteps of his father, Drew, and grandfather, Archie, by casting the colours.\nAnd the 2018 Colonial Standard Bearer was perfect in every way as he cast the striking yellow banner above his head.\nFollowing the ceremony Alisdair revealed: \u0026ldquoI watched the casting so many times when I was a boy growing up in Selkirk.\n\u0026ldquoBeing up there was amazing \u0026ndash I was ready to start but when that drum sounds it hits you right in the heart.\n\u0026ldquoI was trying not to listen to the band and keep counting in my head, like I\u0026rsquod been told, and I think it worked.\nThe wave and grin from Alisdair were deserved as he savoured every moment on the scarlet plinth.\nOne Standard Bearer who is more familiar with the new-look Market Place than most is architect Stuart Davidson.\nThe 37-year-old dad-of-three has been heavily involved in the ongoing redesign of the town centre.\nStuart was a picture of concentration throughout most of his faultless cast, only allowing himself a huge smile of relief during the final bars of Up wi\u0026rsquo the Souters.\nArguably the most poignant of all is saved for last.\nFormer KOSB Martin Young brought with him all the military discipline and reliability you would expect as he carried the Ex-Soldiers\u0026rsquo Association Flag onto the scarlet plinth.\nThe father of two, who is a now a traffic policeman, provided another faultless cast with the Union banner before leading this close-knit community in two minutes of silence and reflection.\nWith the centenary fast approaching of the end of the Great War, the sacrifice made by so many is being brought even clearer into focus.\nThat defiance of tyranny and pride in one\u0026rsquos own beliefs and customs, shown by Fletcher, has carried on in Souters down the centuries as decade after decade they have made the ultimate sacrifice.\nThose two minutes of impeccable silence and reflection were only broken by the haunting strains of The Liltin.\nAnd for yet another year, Souters can return home safe in the knowledge that the past won\u0026rsquot be forgotten and the future is one of hope.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"New route planned for tonight s Melrosian s rideout","story":"FOLLOWERS of Melrosian

InChorus subsequently performed with Dougie at the Amber Festival in Perth.\nThe trip to New York was hugely memorable with the choir singing on the Red Steps in Times Square, at the annual NYPD concert, at various September Concerts in the city, and, most poignantly, at the British Memorial Garden to the relatives of the British people who had died on 9/11.\nMoira Pearson, who is one of the founding members and choir manager from 2009 to 2012, told us: \" When the advert for a New Peebles Choir was placed in the Peeblesshire News in September 2008 no-one could have imagined just how important InChorus would become to so many people.\n\"It was a great privilege to be the choir manager for three years, during which time we travelled to New York to support and sing at commemorative events for the 10th Anniversary of 9/11.\n\"The fundraising effort to enable the journey was immense but made much easier by the unstinting support of the Peebles community.\"\nAlthough the 9/11 concert will remain a highlight of the InChorus story, the successes and landmark achievements continued after they came home.\nThe next year, 2012, saw the choir performing to another full house at the Festival Theatre, this time raising funds for other charities which is what InChorus likes to do.\nThe following year they embarked upon their \u0026lsquoChoirathon\u0026rsquo in aid of Comic Relief, when they sang from 9.30am to 9.30pm in the sleet, but raised \u0026pound3,500 in the process.\nIn 2013 they also had their first foray to the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in what was to be come a biennial venture, winning the covered sell-out laurels in 2013, 2015 and 2017.\nIn 2014 the choir decided to try its hand at competition winning themselves a \u0026lsquoChoir of the Day\u0026rsquo award at the Scottish auditions of Choir of the Year, proving that even a very large choir can be sufficiently disciplined in all the nuances of choral singing to make a good impression.\nOver the years InChorus members discovered they rather liked performing at music festivals and have sung at T in the Park, Meadows Festival, Fringe by the Sea at North Berwick, Big Burns Supper in Dumfries, Eden Festival, Lindisfarne, and last year on the main stage between Texas and the Manic Street Preachers, at the BBC Children in Need\u0026rsquos Carfest in front of an audience of 20,000 people. How do they top that?\nThey also love weddings and travelled to Dublin in 2016 to sing at the wedding of a choir member\u0026rsquos son. While there, they performed on the bandstand in St Stephen\u0026rsquos Green and at the famous Cobblestone pub, as well as appearing as a flash mob all over the city.\nAly Skidmore, herself a long serving choir member, took over as Musical Director in 2014. Aly was responsible for the huge flash mob \u0026lsquoDancing in the Street\u0026rsquo event last year, involving the whole community.\nShe told us: \"Whilst singing is at the heart of everything that InChorus has achieved over the last 10 years, it\u0026rsquos never been only that.\n\"Through this organisation we have seen people\u0026rsquos friendships, confidence, skills, self-esteem and both emotional and physical health all flourish and grow over the years.\n\"In return the members give their time freely and generously to learn, rehearse and perform music for the benefit of others.\n\"In its time InChorus has achieved and given so much more than any of us really ever anticipated at the outset and I think every member feels so proud about that.\nIt\u0026rsquos amazing what a community can achieve when they group together, take a collective breath and burst into song.\"\nThey say that into every life a little rain must fall, and InChorus has not escaped, losing three much loved ladies to cancer.\nIn 2016 it was founder members Kitty Lyle and Celia Hayton and, just a few weeks ago, Bernice Brown - all are missed greatly.\nThroughout its 10 years the choir has raised over \u0026pound60,000 for other charities, both through its own concerts and through specific charity events.\nThis is something that is at the core of InChorus, something of which they are proud, and something which will continue in the years to come.\nAt one charity dinner they even put up an InChorus performance as an auction prize and were \u0026lsquosold\u0026rsquo for over \u0026pound1100.

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.

Jess Mackie\u0026rsquos family created the fund in her name after the Gullane youngster, who loved to sing and help others, passed away suddenly on January 2 this year.  The North Berwick High School pupil was a member of the National Youth Choir of Scotland and sang with Aberlady and Gullane Parish Churches, at care homes and for charities, and at school concerts.  Despite her young age, she had a sense of how music could help people in need.  And now the Jess Mackie Memorial Fund will \u0026ldquohelp her to keep helping others, as she had always done, and would have continued to do if she was still with us, said parents Michael and Jackie.  \u0026ldquoWe cannot let our beautiful daughter\u0026rsquos name and character be forgotten, they said. \u0026ldquoShe had so much to offer.  All monies raised will be used to provide support and comfort through music therapy at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Edinburgh.  Dad Michael, long-standing chairman of Gullane Sports Development Trust, said: \u0026ldquoWhen Jess passed away, we had a memorial service for her and decided to use it to donate to the Edinburgh Children\u0026rsquos Hospital Charity. Quickly thereafter, we learnt about an initiative involving music therapy they were running with Tinderbox Orchestra in the hospital. We met with one of the trustees initially and we decided to put in place something that would allow Jess to help other kids.  The memorial service, which was held at Aberlady Parish Church, raised more than \u0026pound2,000, with money continuing to be donated by members of the public and through organised events.  Michael, 52, said: \u0026ldquoWe were approached by Gullane and Aberlady Parish Churches and they asked if they could run an event in Jess\u0026rsquo memory, which they did last Sunday.  \u0026ldquoFrom the family point of view, it was another show of overwhelming support by the village and the community. We have raised a substantial amount of money. Gullane and Aberlady Parish Churches posted on Facebook that it had raised about \u0026pound1,800 for the fund and Gullane Athletic [FC] are running an event in August in support of the fund.  Twelve members of staff at North Berwick High School also took part in the recent Edinburgh Marathon Relay.  Split into three teams, they raised more than \u0026pound1,500 for The Royal Hospital for Sick Children Jess Mackie Memorial Fund, Richmond\u0026rsquos Hope and Leuchie House.  Jess, who was in S3 at the secondary school, was, like her twin sister Lauren, a keen singer.  Her dad told the Courier Jess \u0026ldquoloved singing and tried to help people and raise their spirits through her voice.  That love of singing and trying to help people has been mirrored through the success of the memorial fund, which sits at about \u0026pound9,800.  Michael added: \u0026ldquoI think that the fund reflects Jess completely. It reflects the impact she had while only 14 years old.  \u0026ldquoIt reflects the impact she had on people that she met and what she did in terms of her church singing, singing in local care homes, school concerts, helping out at various events like for the Bethany Christian Trust and Leuchie House. I think that reflects what she did while she was here.  The project aims to ensure children and young people who are feeling vulnerable in hospital are given the chance to enjoy music, which can have an enormous and positive impact, helping ignite a spark in them and giving them back a sense of control.  Michael added: \u0026ldquoMusic is a great comforter at times and what Tinderbox do is amazing for the kids.  \u0026ldquoWe had no hesitation in supporting what they do.  Janet Anderson, who is involved with the choirs at the two villages\u0026rsquo churches, also paid tribute to the talented teenager.  She said: \u0026ldquoI could not speak more highly of Jess.  \u0026ldquoShe did not think she had a special talent, she was just the most unassuming, normal girl you would ever meet.  \u0026ldquoShe was so pretty, so kind and so thoughtful and generous and she never thought she was anything special.

Chester, from Dunbar, is one of 13 pets, including cats, dogs and even a rat, taking part in the PDSA Pet Fit Club.  Together they weigh more than 200 kilogrammes and need to shed 75kg to reach their ideal weights.  Ten-year-old Chester, who lives with the Gilmour family on Newhouse Avenue, is looking to shift 2.6kg \u0026ndash or six pounds \u0026ndash to reach his ideal weight.  Chester, who tips the scales at 7.6kg, was gaining so much weight that his owners thought he must have an underlying medical condition. But when tests came back negative, it was clear Chester\u0026rsquos appetite and lazy ways were the root of the problem.  Owner Lisa said: \u0026ldquoWe realised everyone in the house was feeding him without knowing he\u0026rsquod already being fed, so he was getting fed by all four of us every day!  \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove tried to help him lose weight, even putting a collar on him that says \u0026lsquoDo not feed me!\u0026rsquo for the neighbours, but that hasn\u0026rsquot worked.  \u0026ldquoHe eats whatever he can find including crisps left on the floor by the kids. He even stole my dad\u0026rsquos cheesecake that was on the kitchen counter! Another time my son woke up to the sound of rattling and he was trying to claw his way into a box of chocolates.  Lisa, along with partner Lindsay and sons Rhys and Ryan, got Chester when he was just a kitten.  Now they are determined to do what they can to help their pet lose some weight and be happier.  Lisa, who works in the family newsagent, added: \u0026ldquoHe\u0026rsquos getting older now and his weight will play on his joints if we don\u0026rsquot do something to help him. He can\u0026rsquot be comfortable carrying all that weight around and we want him to be happier and healthier as he ages.  Chester\u0026rsquos six-month Pet Fit Club diet and exercise programme will be specially tailored and overseen by the vets and nurses at Edinburgh PDSA Pet Hospital.  He is up against seven dogs, including a Cavalier King Charles spaniel who once ate a set of false teeth, a cat too fat to fit through the cat flap, and a rat who is double his ideal bodyweight.  If crowned the winner, Chester will receive a year\u0026rsquos supply of pet food, a pet-friendly holiday and a pet hamper.  Kathryn Marshall, PDSA Veterinary Care Assistant, will be helping to oversee Chester\u0026rsquos diet.  She said: \u0026ldquoWith the help of PDSA and Pet Fit Club, Lisa and Chester are making the necessary diet, exercise and lifestyle changes to help get Chester down to a healthier weight.  \u0026ldquoWe will support them every step of the way over the next six months to ensure they succeed."},{"url":null,"title":"Log found at Yellowcraig beach transformed into stunning violin","story":"              A VIOLIN maker has crafted a violin from driftwood found on an East Lothian beach to help raise awareness about the environment and the plight of the oceans.

Dean Conner, 33, of Links Avenue, has been handed an anti-social behaviour order (ASBO) following an application by East Lothian Council.  The court was presented with details of the alleged anti-social behaviour of Mr Conner, including shouting, swearing and fighting within a property at Links Avenue, and disposing of items and bags of rubbish outwith a domestic bin within the communal garden.  The terms of the ASBO prohibit Mr Conner from behaving in an anti-social manner including shouting and swearing at neighbours and other residents in and around Links Avenue.  He is also banned from having more than two visitors to his property at any one time except those who are there in the course of their employment.  Mr Conner had received an interim ASBO earlier this year.  A council spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThere is a significant history of anti-social behaviour complaints made against Mr Conner which has caused considerable alarm and distress to others.  \u0026ldquoEast Lothian Council, with the full support of Police Scotland, will take the strongest possible action against those who behave in an anti-social fashion.

Len Smith, 92, was conscripted at the age of 18 and was a supply lorry driver for the British Liberation Army.  He landed at Gold Beach, Normandy, where he said he was not shot at and saw little combat.  But he drove some of the first troops into Berlin in 1945 and moved supplies through a war-ravaged France, Belgium, Holland and Germany.  Despite his actions, modest Len, who went on to work in the civil service, said he had never thought of himself as veteran, never mind a hero.  He told the Courier: \u0026ldquoThere were thousands of young men like me. I never considered myself a veteran until the recent events marking the anniversary led to me looking back.  \u0026ldquoAt the time we just got on with it the real heroes are the soldiers who fought and died over there.  Mr Smith was one of eight children born in Pencaitland to local couple John and Euphemia Smith.  His sister Ellen, 97, still lives in Pencaitland and he visits the area regularly but after he was demobbed in 1947, Mr Smith moved to Longlevens, Gloucestershire, to find work.  Now a widower, Mr Smith\u0026rsquos sister sends him the Courier every week so he can keep up with local news.  His L\u0026eacutegion d\u0026rsquoHonneur medal was sent to his home in Cheltenham by post and contained a letter from Jean-Pierre Jouyet, French ambassador to the UK, which said: \u0026ldquoI offer you my warmest congratulations on this high honour, which recognises your military engagement and steadfast involvement in the liberation of France during the Second World War.  \u0026ldquoAs we contemplate this Europe of peace, we must never forget the heroes like you who came from Britain and the Commonwealth to begin the liberation of Europe by liberating France.  But Mr Smith insists he was just a young man doing a job.  He said: \u0026ldquoI didn\u0026rsquot know how the war was going, I didn\u0026rsquot read anything about the war. I was a young lad and I had no fear.  \u0026ldquoI just thought \u0026lsquoget on with it\u0026rsquo.  However, he remembers thinking about how worried his mother would be.  Len\u0026rsquos brothers James and Thomas were also in active service and James was in the D-Day landings. All three came home.  He said: \u0026ldquoWhen we came back my mum was overjoyed, she got three sons back uninjured.  Last year, Mr Smith returned to the Normandy beaches on a British Legion tour organised for veterans. He said: \u0026ldquoI wasn\u0026rsquot involved in the D-Day landings the people that were are the heroes."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7252400.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"  39 Important progress  39  at Knox Academy  say inspectors","story":"              A SECONDARY school which came under fire from Government inspectors last year has made \u0026ldquosome important progress.  Education Scotland visited Knox Academy in Haddington at the end of 2016 and told parents that the school needed to \u0026ldquorevisit its \u0026ldquovision and values.  The inspection report, which was released in March last year, highlighted a number of areas in which the school could improve. \u0026lsquoLeadership of change\u0026rsquo and \u0026lsquolearning, teaching and assessment\u0026rsquo were ranked as \u0026lsquosatisfactory\u0026rsquo, while \u0026lsquoensuring wellbeing, equality and inclusion\u0026rsquo was described as \u0026lsquoweak\u0026rsquo.  Inspectors returned to the school 12 months on from the original report for a follow-up inspection, which led to a new report being published on Tuesday.  The inspection team talked to young people at the school and worked closely with the interim headteacher Lauren Rodger, who is returning to North Berwick High School after the summer holidays.  She will be replaced by Susan Cook, currently acting headteacher at Trinity Academy, Edinburgh  Other members of staff were also spoken to, to hear about the steps the school had taken to improve on areas previously identified in the original inspection.  Education Scotland noted the following key improvements:  - The interim headteacher has provided effective leadership in taking forward work to secure improvements, including a review of the school values  - Staff have developed a range of policies to improve practice in equalities and inclusion, including a new safeguarding policy  - The recently created Pupil Support Faculty is now better placed to address the needs of young people, and those with social, emotional and behavioural needs in particular  - The school has made progress in establishing a more positive learning environment for all.  The report did note that there were still some improvements to be made.  Issues highlighted included using evidence from self-evaluation activities to ensure consistency in learning and teaching across the school reviewing the purpose of the pupil support base to ensure there was a greater focus on learning for the young people using it and ensuring there was a whole school approach to equalities and inclusion.  Fiona Robertson, head of education at East Lothian Council, praised staff at the school for their efforts.  She said: \u0026ldquoI am pleased that Education Scotland acknowledges that Knox Academy has made important progress since the last inspection, and I would like to thank all the staff and pupils for their hard work and commitment in making these improvements.  \u0026ldquoIt is really encouraging that the positive relationships between pupils and teachers, and the fact that almost all young people recognise the value of learning in their lives, was noted.  \u0026ldquoThis is a strong basis for ensuring that the school continues to be a positive learning environment for staff and pupils alike.  And she added: \u0026ldquoWe will continue to work with the school and Education Scotland to make further improvements, and to working with Susan Cook, our new headteacher, who joins the school in August.  Education Scotland will continue to work with East Lothian Council regarding the school\u0026rsquos capacity to improve and will return to carry out another inspection within 18 months."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7898185.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Thousands oppose Dunbar town centre parking charge plans","story":"              MORE than 2,000 people have signed a petition against the idea of parking charges being introduced on Dunbar High Street.  A public consultation looking at potential parking solutions throughout East Lothian came to a close last month.  Meetings and workshops were held throughout the county by East Lothian Council, including one in Dunbar Royal British Legion.  A number of suggestions were put forward, including for a disc parking system where visitors to the busy street would set a disc showing when they had parked.  Another idea being explored is parking charges \u0026ndash but that has met with the opposition of Dunbar Trades\u0026rsquo Association (DTA).  Philip Mellor, DTA chairman, said that the group \u0026ldquostrongly oppose the introduction of parking charges.  A petition, which was put in various businesses in the town, has attracted more than 2,000 signatures.  Mr Mellor added: \u0026ldquoThe DTA feel introducing parking charges to High Street and other key off-street parking areas will have a detrimental effect on our High Street and the local economy.  \u0026ldquoThe current system since the introduction of traffic wardens has already addressed concerns around space for shoppers on High Street and it now seems counterintuitive to then introduce a measure which will drive more customers away to out-of-town developments.  \u0026ldquoWhilst parking during heavy summer visitor times can be difficult, it is very few special event days where parking is congested enough to even consider parking charges viable the majority of the time parking is available and this potential charge seems to be nothing more than a money-raising exercise at the expense yet again of already-struggling independent business owners.  A spokesman for East Lothian Council said \u0026ldquoall responses would be taken into consideration as it looked to develop a strategy.  He added: \u0026ldquoThe draft Local Transport Strategy (LTS) sets out ways in which the council can meet both national and local objectives sustainably, while supporting the local economy and environment.  \u0026ldquoOur consultation on the draft LTS recently closed and we are grateful to everyone who responded or attended one of our workshops.

John, 35, from Port Seton, won \u0026pound1 million in the EuroMillions draw on June 26, 2015, but he remained in his job as a roofer, insisting he wanted to keep working.  He took on the challenge to climb more than 4,400 feet and faced treacherous weather conditions to mark the Lottery\u0026rsquos milestone and tick off a lifelong dream from his bucket list.  It comes as new research reveals that more than half of the millionaires are now spending more on experiences rather than possessions.

East Lothian Council intends to create a new primary school, operating from the existing school buildings, which will cover nursery through to primary seven. The proposal was approved by East Lothian Council in April after a public consultation. It has now also been approved by the Scottish Government.  Combined, the two schools currently have a school roll of about 700 pupils. However, it remains unclear who the new headteacher for the primary school, which is yet to be named, will be.

Five retail units are planned for a site at Gateside previously earmarked for a Sainsbury\u0026rsquos supermarket and petrol station.  The site, which totals about 60,000 sq ft, could be made up of units ranging from 7,500 sq ft to 20,000 sq ft in size.  Alastair Dickie, development director with Ediston Real Estates, which now owns the site, attended the town\u0026rsquos community council meeting on Tuesday, one week before plans are unveiled to the public.  He told members the proposal was for the site to include three food retailers, with the other two units including \u0026ldquoa household-type retail business and a coffee drive-through facility.  However, he was keeping tight-lipped on the identity of the businesses until legal agreements were in place.  Mr Dickie hoped planning permission for the site, off Oak Tree Roundabout west of Haddington, could be achieved by the end of the year.  He said: \u0026ldquoIf we submit an application in August, we would hope. . . we would hopefully have a consent in December or January next year.  \u0026ldquoWe could be on site quarter one of 2019.  It is then hoped that the retailers could be trading in the lead-up to Christmas that year or early in 2020.  The development, which has been described as \u0026ldquoEast Lothian\u0026rsquos first retail park, will involve in the region of \u0026pound14 million investment, with 150 jobs potentially created, as well as those during the construction process.  It has already been revealed that talks are ongoing with \u0026ldquoa number of major retailers who will be new to East Lothian.

The new scheme offers people an opportunity to support Our Community Energy \u0026ndash a partnership between not-for-profit Scottish firm Our Power and Mongoose Energy, which manages community energy assets \u0026ndash and hopes to find investors in the county.  They say that the site at Pogbie Windfarm \u0026ndash already home to the turbines \u0026ndash will create enough energy to power 7,200 homes and believe that, when they combine it with a second site in Berwickshire, the scheme will raise an estimated \u0026pound1.9 million in surplus profit over 25 years.  Our Power said that profit from the wind turbines it takes over would then be used to keep energy prices down, helping people who are struggling with the costs.  They need to raise just over \u0026pound3 million for the project, which covers both sites, and community groups and individuals are being invited to invest in bonds and shares to raise the money needed to get the project up and running, with investments ranging from \u0026pound500 to \u0026pound100,000.  Andrew Smith, Our Community Energy acting chairperson, said: \u0026ldquoFuel poverty is a huge issue for Scotland and we\u0026rsquore proud to be launching such an important fundraising opportunity to directly tackle it.  \u0026ldquoInvesting with a social purpose is something close to the hearts of many Scots, and these bond and equity offers provide the chance to have a huge impact locally.  \u0026ldquoThese offers aim to support those who struggle to afford sufficiently heated homes, as well as providing investors with an exciting new option which not only targets a significant social impact but a positive environmental one too.  \u0026ldquoHowever with these types of investments there are some risks and funds are not readily realisable.  \u0026ldquoInvestors should note that capital is at risk and returns are not guaranteed.  A fuel poor household is defined as one which needs to spend more than 10 per cent of its income on all fuel use and to heat its home to an adequate standard of warmth.  Last year, the East Lothian Poverty Commission found that almost half of local pensioners were forced to spend more than 10 per cent of their income on energy bills.  Mark Kenber, CEO of Mongoose Energy, added: \u0026ldquoWith the majority of Scots recognising the critical level that fuel poverty has reached, it is now more important than ever for investors to put their money into causes that work for the social good, not just their own.  \u0026ldquoOur Community Energy not only gives investors the potential to earn competitive interest rates on their money, but also the opportunity to support the wider Scottish community.

A pressure group called \u0026lsquoBowls for Gullane\u0026rsquo was established on Facebook in the wake of concerns that the village\u0026rsquos bowling club \u0026ndash with a membership of only about 30 \u0026ndash was to be sold to developers.  Councillor Jeremy Findlay, ward member and former chairman of Gullane Area Community Council, said: \u0026ldquoAll three ward councillors are behind the campaign to save the club and we hope that the members understand the feeling in the village.  \u0026ldquoI understand that the committee own the club and it would be the members who benefit from any potential sale.  About 50 residents gathered outside the bowling club on Monday evening to show their displeasure at the possible loss of the club.  The group told the Courier they had had hundreds of offers of support.  Catherine MacKenzie said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove had people phone up, email and text us \u0026ndash and face-to-face \u0026ndash to tell us that they\u0026rsquore willing to become a member.  \u0026ldquoSome of them don\u0026rsquot live locally, or won\u0026rsquot be able to bowl, but they are willing to pay the membership fees. People do not want to see the club close.  Gordon McLelland, a local resident and member of the community council, added: \u0026ldquoThe community council want to save the club for the community.  \u0026ldquoWe have tried hard to offer the club our support to work with them but so far they have turned that down.  Billy Mellors, the county\u0026rsquos bowls development officer, said: \u0026ldquoThe overwhelming support from the local community indicates to me the future of Gullane Bowling Club can be sustained if the current members accept it.  Many locals have tried to sign up as members but have been turned away by the club, it has been claimed.  Another member of the group said: \u0026ldquoWhat has shocked us as a group is how many people have been refused membership in recent years \u0026ndash young and old have come forward with their personal experience of being turned away.  Mr Mellors added: \u0026ldquoTime will tell on the way the club want to go but we all hope a common sense approach is taken to preserve this community facility.  East Lothian MSP Iain Gray met representatives of the Bowls for Gullane group last week and is keen to find a solution to ensure the club\u0026rsquos survival.  He said: \u0026ldquoThis is an unfortunate situation Gullane has lost too many local assets recently, so every effort should be made to avoid losing another. I did meet with representatives of the campaign and have said that I will support them in trying to find a way the land, and preferably bowling too, can remain part of the village community.  Ian McMillan, CEO of Bowls Scotland, said that he was \u0026ldquodelighted to see local residents lend their support to the campaign to save the 116-year-old club.  He added: \u0026ldquoI would encourage all in the village to support their historic club, get on the green, enjoy the great game of bowls and ensure future generations can benefit from the opportunity to play an accessible, inclusive sport. Bowls Scotland fully supports the work being undertaken to keep bowls an important part of Gullane\u0026rsquos community fabric.  Les Ritchie, secretary of East Lothian Bowling Association, told the group: \u0026ldquoWe are ready to support you and the community in whatever steps might secure a future for bowling in Gullane.  Attempts by the Courier to speak to Michael Baxter, vice-president and secretary at the bowling club, were unsuccessful this week. In April, Mr Baxter told us: \u0026ldquoThere are not enough members to support the running of the club.  He had said then that the club was \u0026ldquotrying to find a solution but that it was not viable to continue with a dwindling membership.  A spokeswoman for East Lothian Council confirmed the land was earmarked for leisure and recreation use in the Local Development Plan and any deviation from that would require planning permission for a potential change of use."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7297144.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Haddington hosts world record attempt for the Slosh dance","story":"              HUNDREDS of people are set to lace up their dancing shoes in a bid to break a world record.

Doug Haig from the Bridge Centre said to do a world record attempt because it would be great for publicity and a lot of fun.  The group decided to make it an unofficial world record attempt because they were worried they would have to turn away people who were not dancing in time to the music.

They are one of four one-act plays that will take part in the Scottish Community Drama\u0026rsquos National Youth Drama final in Plockton on Saturday.  The group, who meet in North Berwick\u0027s St Andrew Blackadder Church every Friday, will be performing Evan Placey\u0026rsquos powerful play Girls Like That, which explores the consequences of a naked photo being sent round a school and how this affects, not only the girl in the photo, but the way in which girls react and respond.  Indelible Arts director Linda Grant told the Courier: \"I am so delighted that our talented cast have made it to the SCDA one act festival.  \"It really is a joy to bring all these young people together who have a love of the performing arts and support each other in a very nurturing environment. In particular I am so glad that we have progressed with this play.  \"After a reading the script during one of our sessions the girls were behind it one hundred percent, here was a piece that they could relate to and completely identify with.\"  And some of the cast, pupils at North Berwick High School, are equally looking forward to taking part.  S6 pupil Ella Higgins said: \"When I first read the script, I immediately loved it and was desperate to perform it.  \"I\u0026rsquove never read or seen anything that fully demonstrates how much resilience is needed to survive in high school as a teenage girl to the extent that this play does and it covers so many issues and scenarios that many girls do experience in real life.  \"This play is such an important and well written piece. I feel so proud to be performing it at the final and I hope we do it justice and get it the recognition it deserves.\"  Holly Edwards, another S6 pupil, said: \"The play is extremely relevant and gives a taste of real life and what really goes on at schools that have such a large social media influence.  \"The competition means a lot to us as a group and the thought of getting to the final is so exciting, we want to show people what this play is all about. After all our hard work we are all so happy to be in the final!  Heather Fortune, also S6, added: \"Life today as a high school student is displayed perfectly through the contrast between the boys\u0026rsquo reaction to the photo and the girls\u0026rsquo reaction to it.\"  And S4 pupil Abbey Greenwood: \"I have really enjoyed working on this play, I think it really brings people together and opens up discussions on how we treat each other in society.\""},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7930043.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Calls to tackle Edinburgh Bypass gridlock as tram system to Musselburgh mooted","story":"              MUSSELBURGH\u0026rsquoS MSP has backed calls for improvements to the Edinburgh City Bypass \u0026ndash while suggesting extending a tram or light rail system to the Honest Toun.  Colin Beattie stressed that \u0026ldquoradical thinking needed to be done to create a solution, highlighting a possible extension of a tram or light rail system out to Musselburgh.  During a recent Holyrood debate, he said: \u0026ldquoPeople meet the queues of traffic heading on to the bypass on the main roads around my constituency before they are even near the bypass. This causes more congestion and more air pollution.  Mr Beattie later said: \u0026ldquoYou can go along the road at any time of the day and there are queues of traffic, mainly at Sheriffhall Roundabout.  \u0026ldquoIt is important that when the Government are looking at all the possible changes required to the bypass, all options are considered. The main priority should be that it is cost-efficient and done as soon as possible.  \u0026ldquoIt may be that it is more economic to extend a tram or light rail system out to the main population centres such as Musselburgh than to take on the eye-watering cost of enlarging the A720. This would also benefit the environment and be much faster than using road transport.  \u0026ldquoClearly more radical thinking needs to be done on creating a sustainable solution. I am not convinced that simply replicating a system which moves traffic speedily and efficiently into new choke points is the answer.  Miles Briggs, Lothian region MSP who led the Parliamentary debate, said: \u0026ldquoThe transport information company Inrix in late 2016 identified the bypass as the most congested trunk road outside London, with four of the UK\u0026rsquos worst bottlenecks.  \u0026ldquoI continue to be contacted by frustrated constituents and businesspeople who face frequent delays when using the bypass to commute or transport goods, especially but not exclusively at peak times or when there is an accident on the route. Many drivers tell me their experience is that these tailbacks and traffic jams are becoming more and more regular.  He said that while proposed work at Sheriffhall would be an important improvement, he added: \u0026ldquoIt is only one part of what needs to be a far broader, long-term and coordinated programme of improvements to the bypass which will ensure traffic can keep moving in the decades ahead.  \u0026ldquoThis means looking at innovative solutions, assessing whether extra lanes will be needed, looking at the possible use of hard shoulders in some situations and utilising technology so the bypass can become a smart motorway.  Mr Briggs called on the Scottish Government to take forward a feasibility study into widening the city bypass and new options to address the growing congestion.  A Transport Scotland spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe Edinburgh and South East Scotland City Region Deal includes investment of up to \u0026pound120m in the A720 city bypass for the grade separation of Sheriffhall Roundabout and \u0026pound20 million investment in public transport infrastructure in west Edinburgh.  \u0026ldquoThis investment will improve journey reliability and safety for all users and support significant planned investment in Edinburgh and South East Scotland.  \u0026ldquoThe Scottish Government remains committed to undertaking the improvements at the Sheriffhall junction at the earliest opportunity. We are continuing to progress the detailed design development and assessment of the preferred option and expect to publish draft orders in 2019."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7930076.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Haddington pub seeking new owners","story":"              A TOWN centre pub which changed its name less than a year ago is on the lookout for new people to run it.

Brave Ruth Quilietti-Bird \u0026ndash who at one point was the most ill person \u0026ldquoin the whole of the UK, according to her husband \u0026ndash moved hospital several times to receive specialist treatment for multiple organ failure, spending her 40th birthday in intensive care rather than on a planned holiday.  She has had both her feet amputated after they suffered tissue damage due to sepsis \u0026ndash a serious complication of an infection.\u0026nbsp It was also feared that Ruth, who taught art at Knox Academy in Haddington and Preston Lodge High School, Prestonpans, might also lose her hands.  She is recovering at the Astley Ainslie Hospital in Edinburgh, where she is getting used to her newly-fitted prosthetic legs with the aid of physiotherapists.  The health of her hands improved and she is keeping them busy by resuming her love of creative activities such as drawing, weaving and needlework.  Ruth is now looking forward to getting out of hospital to rejoin her family: husband Mark, 47, and their daughters, seven-year-old Lucia and Isabella, five.    But she can\u0026rsquot return to her New Street home in Musselburgh as it has an outdoor staircase and is no longer suitable, so the search for a new home is under way.  Now her friend Jacqueline Campbell has launched a crowdfunding campaign to raise \u0026pound20,000 to help fund a mobility scooter and adapt a new property.  In March, Ruth suddenly started to have breathing problems along with vomiting and diarrhoea.  Mark, a nurse at the Western General Hospital in Edinburgh, said she was rushed to the accident and emergency unit at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh by paramedics who assessed that she was suffering from sepsis, which can be triggered by an infection and affected her immune system.  He said: \u0026ldquoHer health deteriorated more and more and she was taken to the high dependency unit. They said they needed to ventilate Ruth and that was the last time I spoke to her for two-and-a-half weeks. She went into a medicalised coma.  Mark said it was still unknown what was causing the infection, so Ruth received multiple antibiotics.  \u0026ldquoThe consultant told me to prepare myself because we were losing Ruth, he said.  The medical team decided to take Ruth into theatre to connect an ECMO (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) circuit to help her breathing.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoThey managed to stabilise her but her vital organs were failing. Her respiratory had already failed and her kidneys had failed.  \u0026ldquoThere was no one as ill as Ruth in the whole of the UK at that time, receiving that amount of support to keep her alive.  Ruth was then transferred to a specialist ECMO unit at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoHer liver was failing and her heart was beginning to fail.  \u0026ldquoThey said again that they were losing Ruth and she wouldn\u0026rsquot last the in-patient stay.  \u0026ldquoThey made the decision to fit a second ECMO circuit to support her heart and this stabilised her.  \u0026ldquoI was told several times I might be potentially losing Ruth. Then things started improving and they were able to withdraw some of the support and her blood tests were showing very small improvements.  \u0026ldquoRuth was infected with group \u0026lsquoA\u0026rsquo streptococcal, a very aggressive bacteria which is around us all the time.  \u0026ldquoRuth\u0026rsquos immune system was already affected, so it was able to take over very quickly, causing failure to the vital organs. She was diagnosed with sepsis and pneumonia.  Ruth began to make progress with her breathing, her heart started to stabilise and her kidneys started to improve. Doctors felt they could remove the ECMO circuit for the heart and rescind the \u0026lsquodo not resuscitate\u0026rsquo notice.  As doctors brought Ruth out of sedation, she faced the risk of haemorrhaging throughout the body because of blood thinning and medications.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoI remember her opening her eyes and looking at me.  \u0026ldquoWe put our foreheads together and looked into each others\u0026rsquo eyes. I knew that Ruth was back.  \u0026ldquoHow close she was to dying on several occasions is still difficult to comprehend.  A special moment for Ruth was a visit by her daughters for her birthday when they took her cuddly toys and held her hand. Her mum and dad were also at her bedside.  Ruth was moved back to the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, where her ventilator was removed and she was able to start to speak.  But as she got better, she was to face a huge decision as a result of the tissue damage, caused by the lack of blood flow, which had turned her feet black.  She was told she would have to lose her right foot and possibly half of her left foot, with surgery carried out at St John\u0026rsquos Hospital in Livingston.  But Ruth, determined to get the best quality of life, made the decision to lose both feet below the knee, which would give her more choices in terms of prosthetics and improve her recovery.    Mark paid tribute to the \u0026ldquowonderful hospital staff who had \u0026ldquogiven everything for Ruth.  He highlighted the help he had received from friends and family over the past few months, including the network of \u0026lsquoSupermums\u0026rsquo who looked after Lucia and Isabella, friends, neighbours and colleagues at the Western General.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe kindness of people has been overwhelming. They want to help so much.

New CCTV has been installed throughout the store, while various bottles of alcohol are only accessed through a member of staff opening a locked cabinet.  Similarly, a number of \u0026ldquohigh value lines, including alcohol and various cuts of meat, are on \u0026ldquosmart shelves which sense when an item is lifted and alerts a member of staff through a pager.  Musselburgh is the company\u0026rsquos first of its so-called \u0026lsquoClapham-style\u0026rsquo stores in Scotland.  Neil Hayes, Iceland\u0026rsquos merchandising and format development director, said: \u0026ldquoRefurbishments on this scale are only possible if we close the stores for a time and I am grateful to all our customers in Musselburgh for their patience.

Colin Beattie\u0027s comments follows a \"positive meeting\" with health bosses in the wake of patients\u0027 concerns about the service at the enlarged practice in the Musselburgh Primary Care Centre.  The Musselburgh MSP met with doctors and staff at the surgery, along with representatives from East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership.  Mr Beattie said: \"There is no doubt that there are issues around patients\u0026rsquo communication with the surgery, particularly at peak times. I was pleased that the surgery has recognised this and was in a position to give me a briefing on the situation.\"  He said doctors were now up to their full staffing level of 14 and an additional four staff members to take phone calls were in the process of being recruited.  During the visit, Mr Beattie had the chance to discuss other new initiatives which were \"positively transforming the surgery\".  He said: \"While much work seems to have been done, more still has to be achieved to improve the service to patients.  \"I am confident that Riverside and East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership are seriously addressing their remaining issues and I will be keeping in close contact going forward to ensure that my constituents receive the service they should expect.\"  He added that the practice was looking at introducing an online appointment booking system, which it is anticipated would reduce phone calls to the practice.  Riverside was also looking at different options as to how to more effectively manage phone calls at the volume it was receiving, he said.  Mr Beattie said: \"I have encouraged the practice to expedite the introduction of the online appointment booking system, which I feel will have the greatest and quickest effect on the experience of patients contacting the surgery.\"  He also raised the concerns of patients who might have to speak to multiple staff over a period before they were dealt with.  \"Clearly a single point of contact who can immediately direct the patient to the correct destination would be cheaper for the surgery and more efficient and less frustrating for the patient,\" added Mr Beattie."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7952926.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc2 martini-tablet-src=/resources/images/7952926.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc3 martini-desktop-src=/resources/images/7952926.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Clear skies gift solstice-watchers with    perfect morning    at Stonehenge","story":"              Crowds cheered the rise of the sun at Stonehenge as thousands gathered to celebrate the summer solstice.

Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard MSP last week met East Lothian Labour Party campaigners at Holyrood as they delivered a petition signed by more than 1,000 people to Kevin Stewart MSP.  While Councillor Lachlan Bruce, ward member for Preston, Seton, Gosford was joined by South of Scotland MSP Michelle Ballantyne, both Conservative, as they sent letters to Mr Stewart calling for the same action (see image inset).  The campaign comes after the minister called in a planning application by Inch Cape Offshore Ltd (ICOL) to build a substation \u0026ndash which would bring energy ashore from a planned offshore wind farm \u0026ndash on a large section of the site, which was recently purchased by East Lothian Council from ScottishPower.  That sparked cross-party condemnation from county politicians, who fear it could jeopardise local plans to create jobs and boost the economy on the site.  Mr Leonard added his signature to the Hands Off Cockenzie petition before it was submitted.  Iain Gray (Lab), East Lothian MSP said: \u0026ldquoMinisters claim the call-in is because the site is of national importance, but even the leader of the SNP Group on East Lothian Council has condemned the decision as unnecessary.  \u0026ldquoBy signing our petition in such large numbers, local people have sent a clear message they want East Lothian to decide on decisions about the future of the site.  Meanwhile, Mr Bruce said he had asked Mr Stewart to send the decision back to the council. He said: \u0026ldquoI think it is only right that this decision is made locally by the council on behalf of local residents. The people who are affected most are local residents and it is the people they elected, not a Government minister from Aberdeen, who should be making the decision.  A Scottish Government spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe reporter will ensure that the local development plan and the community\u0026rsquos views are taken into account prior to making a recommendation to ministers, who will make the final decision."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7518508.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Watch the moment famed Glasgow hairdresser is surprised with   137K Porsche prize","story":"              A FAMED Glasgow hairdresser received the surprise of a lifetime after winning a top-of-the-range Porsche worth \u0026pound137,000.

Muriel Gray said she believes the world-famous building can be restored from the ashes of the disastrous fire of last weekend.  She said: \u0026ldquoI am massively optimistic that we can.  Speaking after closely inspecting the building with other key staff, Ms Gray said construction firm Kier, which was responsible for the building\u0026rsquos renovation following a previous fire in 2014, had \u0026ldquoquestions to answer from the board.  Experts have estimated that it could cost up to \u0026pound200 million to restore the building after its second major fire in four years.  Ms Gray said she did not know how the blaze began.  The broadcaster and writer said: \u0026ldquoPeople are asking, why are you so quiet? We are waiting to be told the real details, so we can tell the public the real facts. The building wasn\u0026rsquot in our custodianship at the time, it was in Kier\u0026rsquos custodianship.  Ms Gray has called an emergency board meeting, which will meet today, to determine the future of the building.  Insurance was in place for the renovation of the building, she noted firmly, and she said the board had been assured a \u0026ldquogold standard fire regime had been installed at the site.  The building is largely \u0026ldquostructurally solid, initial assessments suggest.

New drone footage shows the famous stone walls in place, but devastation within.  Ms Gray said: \u0026ldquoIt isn\u0026rsquot a goner. It is by no means a goner, it is still there, recognisably standing as the Mack. It is not a few bricks covered in charcoal, it is the Mack, even with its windows burned out, and no roof.  \u0026ldquoSo although it\u0026rsquos a shocking thing to look at, I was actually weirdly heartened by getting to see it.  \u0026ldquoI know it sounds peculiar but it was lot more optimistic than any of us had expected, having seen the flames. It\u0026rsquos like the world\u0026rsquos most indestructible building.  Ms Gray said she believes the building can be saved, but noted: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos been a massive, massive blow to everyone involved.  \u0026ldquoBut if we are about to start it again, we know so much more about that building than we have ever known.  \u0026ldquoBy heavens, we are armed to the teeth with knowledge of the construction, the detail of it, it will make it even easier to begin it. I am not remotely pessimistic about it.  Ms Gray said that \u0026ldquothe biggest job next is to keep morale going, to roll up our shirt sleeves, and start again.But the will is there to do it.  As for the cost of reconstructing the building, she said \u0026ldquothat is ineffable at the moment. Questions have been asked about anti-fire measures at the site, but Ms Gray was adamant the board had done \u0026ldquoeverything we could to guard against a second blaze. She said: \u0026ldquoIt was absolutely at the top of our agenda. We were massively fire aware.  \u0026ldquoAnd we were completely re-assured that we had done everything, and appointed the correct contractors to apply absolute gold standard fire protection during the construction of one of the most valuable buildings that we have.

Now this dazzling cultural heritage is about to be celebrated in a landmark exhibition opening on Friday in Edinburgh.  Rip It Up, which runs at the National Museum of Scotland until November, is the first major exhibition of Scottish pop and explores the musical culture of the nation over the last 60 years.  Unsurprisingly, Glasgow features heavily, its musicians, scenes, venues and fans having been at the centre of so much of the action.  The exhibition showcases more than 300 objects \u0026ndash many lent by the artists \u0026ndash and brings together an unprecedented collection of costumes, memorabilia, instruments and props alongside archive footage and interviews with everyone from The Proclaimers, Franz Ferdinand, Simple Minds, Lulu, Midge Ure and Alex Harvey, to Gerry Rafferty, Annie Lennox, Young Fathers and Shirley Manson.  Delving into Scotland\u0026rsquos extraordinarily strong contributions to punk, new wave and indie, the exhibition also traces the influence of labels such as Postcard and Creation through costume, artwork and instruments, exploring the impact made by much-loved bands as diverse as Altered Images, The Skids, The Associates, Primal Scream, BMX Bandits and the Jesus and Mary Chain.  \u0026ldquoPopular music is a shared experience and a really important one in many people\u0026rsquos lives, says exhibition curator Stephen Allen. \u0026ldquoNobody has done an exhibition on Scottish pop on this scale and we want it to capture people\u0026rsquos imagination and allow them to reflect on their own experiences of listening to and enjoying music.  \u0026ldquoBetween the objects, the footage and the music, people will be able to learn more about their favourite artists and see their treasured objects up close, but also to discover music that is new to them in a whistlestop tour of over six decades of Scottish pop.  Here\u0026rsquos our top 10 objects to look out for in the exhibition.  Gerry Rafferty\u0026rsquos acoustic guitar painted by John Byrne, early 1970s.  This is one of several guitars painted by Byrne for his Paisley buddy Rafferty. He played this one, which has never been displayed before, on Top of the Pops in 1973, performing the Stealers Wheel classic Stuck in the Middle With You. The Baker Street star first came to prominence alongside Billy Connolly as part of folk band The Humblebums and went on to become a successful singer-songwriter and producer. He died in 2010 and remains one of the most talented and loved musicians of his generation.  PVC jumpsuit worn by Rezillos singer Eugene Reynolds in the band\u0026rsquos 1978 appearance on Top of the Pops.  Formed at Edinburgh College of Art in 1976, The Rezillos designed and made many of their striking stage outfits. With a distinctive high energy style, they were quickly noticed by major labels and went on to enjoy chart success. The band broke up in 1978, re-emerging as The Revillos fronted by Fay Fife and Reynolds. The Rezillos reformed in 2001 and continue to record and perform.  Original photograph of Average White Band with Marvin Gaye, 1976.  The American soul legend was one of the band\u0026rsquos idols and turned up to sing with them at a gig at the Hollywood Palladium, Los Angeles. The funk and blues band from Dundee and Glasgow made their big breakthrough 1973 when they supported Eric Clapton and became hugely popular in the US, where the single Pick Up the Pieces and album AWB reached number one simultaneously in the US charts in 1974. Over the next decade they released critically acclaimed albums and successful singles, and their sound has been sampled by many other bands. They still perform today.  Annie\u0026rsquos Lennox\u0026rsquos Tartan trouser suit, made by Jeff Banks, 1983.  The suit was part of Lennox\u0026rsquos famously androgynous look, and was worn during the Eurythmics Touch tour in 1983 and 1984. Born in Aberdeen, Lennox is one of the most recognisable voices of the past 30 years. She earned a scholarship to London\u0026rsquos Royal Academy of Music at 17 and sang in new wave group The Tourists with Dave Stewart, with whom she went on to form the Eurythmics, one of the biggest bands of the 1980s.  Long-sleeved T-shirt worn by Paolo Nutini at his first T in the Park appearance in 2006.  PaOlo, from Paisley, was booked to play the T-Break stage for up-and-coming artists, but that week his first single Last Request reached the top five in the UK chart.

The Labour leader said the Prime Minister had acknowledged the \u0026pound20.5 billion a year boost for the NHS would come from Brexit, economic growth and tax.  He asked at Prime Minister\u0027s Questions: \"There can be no Brexit dividend before 2022, economic growth is the slowest since 2009 - so which taxes are going up?\"  Mrs May said a long-term plan for the NHS had been set out, with money no longer sent to the EU available for the health service.  In response to heckles from Opposition MPs, Mrs May quoted Mr Corbyn saying he would \"use the funds returned after Brexit\" to invest in public services.  Mr Corbyn replied by telling the PM he said the money should be ring-fenced to replace structural funds to regions, agriculture, the fishing industry and research for universities.  He added: \"Can she be straight with people - which taxes are going up and for whom?\"  Mrs May said Chancellor Philip Hammond will set out the full funding package before the spending review.  She claimed there will be one circumstance in which there will be no money returning from the EU, telling MPs: \"That\u0027s if we adopted Labour\u0027s policy of getting a deal at whatever the price.\"  Mr Corbyn said the funding was \"less than is needed just to stand still\" as he asked why anyone would trust the Government with the NHS.  He said: \"The Prime Minister is writing IOUs just to stand still.  \"Until this Government can be straight with people where the money is coming from, why should anyone, anyone anywhere, trust them on the NHS?\"  Mr Corbyn also drew laughter from MPs as he claimed Mrs May\u0027s figures were \"so dodgy they belong on the side of a bus\".  Mrs May hit back, saying Labour\u0027s plan does not \"add up\".  \"He can stand up here all he likes and talk about the Labour Party\u0027s plans for money, but what we know is that the Labour Party\u0027s plans would bankrupt this economy, and the IFS have said Labour would not raise as much money as they claim even in the short run, let alone the long run.  \"In short, their plan absolutely doesn\u0027t add up.  \"Conservatives putting more money into the National Health Service, Labour losing control of the public finances and bankrupting Britain.\"  She said her party had \"consistently put extra money into the National Health Service\" and had announced a plan which gives the NHS \"certainty of funding for the next five years\"."},{"url":null,"title":"Sick MPs may be unable to take part in crunch Brexit vote","story":"              With Theresa May facing a knife-edge Commons vote over Brexit, Labour has accused the Conservatives of refusing to co-operate with a long-standing convention permitting sick MPs to vote.  Under the convention, MPs who are too ill to make their way through the voting lobbies can be \"nodded through\" from an ambulance or car parked in the parliamentary courtyard.  At least one Labour MP and possibly more were understood to be planning to come from hospital to be nodded through for Wednesday\u0027s crucial vote on the EU Withdrawal Bill, which could be decided by the narrowest of margins.  A senior Downing Street source said he was not aware of Conservatives refusing to co-operate, but a Labour spokesman confirmed the party\u0027s whips had been told \"nodding through\" would not be available, denouncing the move as \"obviously unacceptable\".  Tory rebels believe they can inflict defeat on the Government as the flagship legislation returns to the Commons after the Lords again backed giving MPs a \"meaningful\" say on the final deal.  The Prime Minister staved off a Tory rebellion on the move last week but faces a bruising battle in the latest round of voting amid claims she failed to implement a compromise that opponents believed they were promised.  Phillip Lee, who resigned as a government minister in order to back a strengthened role for Parliament, acknowledged there had been a concerted effort to win over would-be rebels, including the \"dark arts\" of persuasion in the corridors of power.  But he claimed the rebels may have the strength to defeat the Prime Minister - who he said he still counts as a friend - unless an 11th-hour concession is agreed.  Dr Lee told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today: \"We were always going to get the normal dark arts of Westminster taking place, fully expected, but my understanding is that the position taken by a number of colleagues is solid, which is why the Government is still in negotiations.\"  Asked if there were enough rebels to defeat the Government, he said: \"Potentially, yes. But... this for me personally is a position of integrity, that I think Parliament deserves to have a proper role in this process, a truly meaningful vote.\"  He rejected some of the claims made about the consequences of a Government defeat which would give Parliament a greater role in the event of a failure to agree a Brexit deal.  \"I cannot follow the argument, in fact I think it\u0027s nonsense, that somehow this makes it harder for the Prime Minister to do a deal in Brussels.\"  He added: \"I continue to be hopeful that the Government will accept our position but fundamentally this is not about the Government, this is about Parliament and - I would argue - this is about my country, this is about securing a Brexit deal which is good for my country in the longer term.  \"I think, in the unlikely event that Government fails to get a deal, Parliament should play a part in trying to find a solution.\"  Dominic Grieve, one of the leading figures in the stand-off, said he expected negotiations to \"go right to the wire\".  The possibility of a rebellion \"all depends on where we go on the negotiations and at the moment I don\u0027t know the answer\", the former attorney general added.  Tory Remainer Anna Soubry posted a lengthy statement about why she will rebel and denied being a \"traitor\".  \"Getting Brexit right is vital and is the most important set of decisions our country has taken in decades,\" she wrote.  \"Whatever we were told during the referendum, you can\u0027t simply unravel 43 years of membership of the EU in a year or two and getting a new trading deal is far from the \u0027simplest\u0027 of matters as we were assured.\"  Peers on Monday backed an amendment to the EU (Withdrawal) Bill, tabled by Viscount Hailsham, that would require the Government to allow MPs to vote on how it would proceed in the absence of a Brexit deal by January 21 next year.  MPs will now vote on whether to adopt the motion, which was brought in after pro-EU rebels led by Mr Grieve accused the Government of reneging on measures they believed had been agreed to see off a rebellion last week.  The Prime Minister has warned against any moves to \"tie her hands\" during negotiations with Brussels, saying that Parliament must not be able to \"overturn the will of the British people\".  Under Government plans, if MPs reject the agreement reached by Mrs May with Brussels, or if no deal has been obtained by January 21, Parliament will be offered the opportunity to vote on a \"neutral motion\" stating it has considered a minister\u0027s statement on the issue.  Crucially, the motion will be unamendable, meaning MPs cannot insert a requirement for Mrs May to go back to the negotiating table, extend the Brexit transition or revoke the UK\u0027s withdrawal under Article 50.

A study of 13 patients found that a combination of fish oil and eye-protective nutrients led to \"significant\" improvements in memory, sight and mood.  Trial patients who took the Memory Health supplement \"displayed overwhelmingly positive responses\", according to a press release accompanying the product\u0027s launch.  Progression of the disease was delayed and the supplement helped \"maintain cognitive abilities and quality of life\", it was claimed.  A month\u0027s supply of 30 of the capsules costs \u0026pound27.50 and is available online from www.memoryhealth.  But leading experts strongly criticised the research behind the product, calling the \"breakthrough\" claims irresponsible and warning that the findings were \"highly unlikely to be true\".  Thirteen patients with mild to advanced Alzheimer\u0027s disease were given the supplement for 18 months and their progress assessed.  Each Memory Health capsule contains a combination of macular carotenoids and fish oil containing omega-3 fatty acids.  Macular carotenoids such as lutein and zeaxanthin are plant-derived pigment compounds that are thought to protect the retina from damage.  The new approach to tackling Alzheimer\u0027s was pioneered by Dr Alan Howard, inventor of the low-calorie rapid weight loss plan the Cambridge Diet.  Dr Howard, who chairs The Howard Foundation charity that promotes nutrition research and was one of the study authors, said: \"This represents one of the most important medical advancements of the century.  \"Alzheimer\u0027s disease is the largest public health crisis the UK has ever faced, and drug companies have so far fallen at every hurdle in finding a solution.  \"This study gives us that breakthrough, in a unique natural compound of nutrients.\"  Colleague Professor John Nolan, founder of The Nutrition Research Centre Ireland (NRCI) in Waterford, where the study took place, said: \"I believe this is a valuable discovery that will challenge perceptions worldwide about the role of nutrition in brain function.\"  However, independent experts reviewing the results published in the Journal of Alzheimer\u0027s Disease were not impressed.  Naveed Sattar, Professor of Metabolic Medicine at the University of Glasgow, said: \"Whilst any research in Alzheimer\u0027s disease is to be welcomed, this is too small a trial and lacks a placebo control so that its findings are highly unlikely to true.  \"In fact I would place no reliance on these results, especially since we know little effect of fish oils or carotenoid supplements on other outcomes in proper trials.\"  Professor Robert Howard, head of Old Age Psychiatry at University College London, said: \"This report is sadly not much more than low-grade anecdotal evidence. Certainly, it falls seriously short of the standards of a high-quality clinical trial in terms of scale and conduct.  \"The accompanying claims made by Dr Howard seem irresponsible and completely unsupported by any reasonable reading of his data.  \"Sadly, people with dementia and their carers will grasp at any straw and I would worry about the impact of media reports around what seem either naive or deeply cynical attempts to exploit this.\"  Dr David Reynolds, chief scientific officer at the charity Alzheimer\u0027s Research UK, said: \"The experimental design of this study makes it hard to draw meaningful conclusions about the effect of these supplements on the symptoms of Alzheimer\u0027s... claims about the significance of these findings should be met with caution.\"  Memory Health is licensed on a not-for-profit basis by the Howard Foundation with \u0026pound1.50 from every purchase supporting research into Alzheimer\u0027s disease."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/7951691.jpg?type=article-full","title":"Children travelling to school by car exposed to twice as much pollution as those who walk","story":"              CHILDREN driven to school by car are exposed to twice as much traffic pollution as pupils walking along busy roads, research reveals today.

Now the sinister sight of cherry trees draped in eerie cobwebs is taking hold in Scotland after the beast from the east Siberian storm and recent heatwave created perfect conditions for the phenomenom.  Huge numbers of bird cherry ermine moth caterpillars has created the spectre in woodlands across the country as they spin elaborate webs to protect them from predators.  They feed on bird cherry trees which are found across Europe and when they emerge fully grown, they become distinctive white moths with five rows of black dots.  The larvae, which are about an inch long, make large communal silvery webs for protection and then feast on the surrounding leaves, stripping the trees bare.  There are eight species of ermine moths in this country and 2,400 species of moths in the British Isles and they usually pupate into adult moths in July or August.  The Woodland Trust Scotland has been receiving many reports of the ghostly looking trees in recent days with worried callers expressing alarm at the trees being stripped of all vegetation.  But the trees are not killed and will recover next year, by which time the caterpillars will have found somewhere else to spin their webs.  The Trust has received calls about outbreaks at Formonthills in Glenrothes and at its own Geordie\u0027s Wood at Glen Devon with the species enjoying a bumper year across many parts of the country.  George Anderson of the Trust said: \"Every few years this species explodes in numbers and they strip the host tree of its leaves. Trees normally recover the following year so it is not as drastic as it looks.  It does look very sinister as they drape entire trees in their silk. We have had some enquiries from people concerned that they were seeing oak processionary moth.  \"These are a real problem in the south of England and cause severe allergic reactions but thankfully they have not been found in Scotland. It is the bird cherry ermine moth we are seeing at the moment and it is entirely harmless.\"  The bird cherry moth, Latin name Yponomeuta evonymella, has a maximum wingspan of less than an inch and is found all over Europe.  There are hundreds of known species of ermine moths, and most of the time they go completely unnoticed.  But when it comes to spinning elaborate webs, no creature can match the power of ermine moth caterpillars. The behaviour is called \u0026ldquotenting, and only some species are able to manage it.  Every now and again, thousands of the tiny moths show up en masse and it is happening more frequently.  By working together, they are able to conceal themselves in a protective blanket. Like a giant invisibility cloak, the veil confuses birds and other predators well enough to keep them at bay while the caterpillars feed.  As the ermines move from tree to tree, they have to cover their tracks and so they keep their protection with them.  Over time everything in their path, from cars, to street signs, to grass, becomes shrouded in white, a scene which has been nicknamed the \u0026ldquowalk of ghosts.  One theory suggests that the super-webs form when multiple females lay their eggs on the same plant, in areas where food is scarce such as housing developments.  Other experts suggest that climate change is having an impact as the eggs tend to do better over warm and damp winters.  Experts believe that the sever storms which swept in from Siberia in March followed relatively shortly after by a prolonged heatwave has provided perfect conditions for the moths, while killing off their parasitic predators.  Tom Prescott, Senior Conservation Officer at Butterfly Conservation Scotland said: \"They are targeted by parasitic wasps and flies who enter their bodies and hatch out when the moths should and kill them off.  \"It\u0027s why they make this incredible web, they hope to keep the parasites and other predators out, it\u0027s like a very large disguise.  \"It just takes two or three to get inside the blanket for the moth numbers to be dramatically reduced, this is why some years there are lots of them, while in other years you can hardly see them.  \"We don\u0027t know for sure but the cold spell could have hit the parasites numbers while the recent warm spell has made it great for the caterpillars, one minute it was grey and overcast and the Spring and Summer both seemed to appear at once.  \"We have another species in Scotland, the Marsh Fritillary, which spins similar webs to protect it from its only known parasite, but there are smaller numbers of them and its population fluctuates much more from year to year.  \"But in truth, we don\u0027t really understand everything about the bird cherry ermine months and the webs but it can certainly put on a show\"."},{"url":null,"title":"Sprinkler plan for all new-build social housing","story":"              SPRINKLERS will be installed in all new-build social housing in future after the SNP Government agreed to fast-track a proposal from Scottish Labour.

It had received overwhelming cross-party support, with more than 50 MSPs from all five parties backing it, meaning it would have advanced through parliament.  However the Scottish Government has now taken over the plan, speeding its progress, as part of a broader programme of post-Grenfell safety improvements.  Sprinklers and fire suppression systems are currently mandatory in all high-rise domestic buildings, whether private or social, with a floor more than 18 metres high.  The new measure will extend that to all new build social housing.  A recent review also recommended expanding the use of sprinkler systems in houses in multiple occupation used as care facilities or with more than 10 people.  Mr Stewart said: \u0026ldquoFire sprinklers have been proven time and time again to be effective in the fight against fire and I know that this move will save lives.  \u0026ldquoThe strong backing for the plans from the public, industry and across the Parliamentary Chamber has been so encouraging and I am delighted that the Scottish Government have seen the sense in these proposals and have decided to take them on.  \u0026ldquoThe ball is now in the Government\u0026rsquos court to respond effectively and quickly to this overwhelming support.  \u0026ldquoI intend to work closely with the Government on the plans and will continue to campaign to ensure that this new requirement makes it onto the statue books as soon as possible.  \u0026ldquoMy hope is that, as fire sprinkler technology becomes more widely used, eventually all Scottish homes will be protected by this life saving technology.

Egypt Station is due to be released on Capitol Records on September 7.  The record, which shares a title with one of Sir Paul\u0027s own paintings, includes the double A-side singles I Don\u0027t Know and Come On To Me.  It is his first full album of all-new music since the chart-topping record New and was recorded between Los Angeles, London and Sussex.  All but one track was produced by Greg Kurstin, who has worked extensively with Adele. The other track was produced by OneRepublic frontman Ryan Tedder.  Sir Paul said: \"I liked the words Egypt Station. It reminded me of the \u0027album\u0027 albums we used to make.  \"Egypt Station starts off at the station on the first song and then each song is like a different station.  \"So it gave us some idea to base all the songs around that. I think of it as a dream location that the music emanates from.\"  The 14 songs, collected to convey a travelogue with each song capturing a place or moment, is described as a kaleidoscopic journey through myriad musical locales and eras, yet firmly rooted in the here and now.  Track Happy With You is described as an \"acoustic meditation on present day contentedness\", while People Want Peace is described as a \"timeless anthem\".

The then prime minister sheltered from torrential downpours in a cottage belonging to his wife Samantha\u0026rsquos millionaire stepfather.  At least that is what newspaper reports said. In fact, the whitewashed lodge where the Camerons and their three children hid from the weather was part of a 20,000-acre estate formally owned by a firm registered in the Bahamas.  The Scottish Government on Wednesday announced detailed proposals to try to expose the true owners of land - rather than untraceable firms at PO Boxes in the Caribbean or Channel Islands.  In a statement, the government said it wanted to create a register which, if agreed, would \u0026ldquoreveal for the first time the controlling interests of land owned by trusts and overseas companies.  Land reform minister Roseanna Cunningham added: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos no longer acceptable for the identity of people making decisions about land in Scotland to be obscured. Our proposals go further than any existing UK legislation. We\u0026rsquore putting Scotland at the forefront of this policy in Europe.  Scotland\u0026rsquos currently opaque property registry - title searches are expensive and often end with a secretive tax haven address - means it is far from clear how much of the country is owned offshore.  The Sunday Post earlier this year said some \u0026pound2.9 billion worth of land was held by 776 companies registered in 22 secrecy jurisdictions.  The BBC this year checked the land registry of England and Wales and found nearly 100,000 properties registered offshore, a quarter of them in the British Virgin Islands.  Land campaigner Andy Wightman - who exposed the offshore ownership of the Camerons\u0026rsquo holiday home on Jura - reckons 750,000 acres of Scotland is owned in tax havens. Foreign investors have been buying up prime Edinburgh real estate, including property close to Nicola Sturgeon\u0026rsquos official residence, Bute House.    Bute House  Rachel Davies Teka of Transparency International said: \u0026ldquoAnonymous ownership of property is a key method used by corrupt individuals to hide their identities and launder illicit funds.  \u0026ldquoOur research has found \u0026pound4.4 billion of property bought with suspicious wealth across the UK with much of this facilitated by the use of anonymous companies registered in secrecy jurisdictions.  She added: \u0026ldquoThis is a positive step by the Scottish Government who are leading the way to open up who really owns land.  \u0026ldquoThis will also act as a deterrent to those seeking to launder money through Scottish property.  Transparency want England and Wales to follow suit.  Mr Wightman also welcomed the move but struck a note of caution after his 20-year-battle for transparency. He said: \u0026ldquoThis new Register will be helpful but it will not be definitive as it relies on self-declaration and will be impossible to verify the true owners based in offshore secrecy jurisdictions.    Roseanna Cunningham  Ms Cunningham said access to the register would be free. Mr Wightman warned that information to which beneficial ownership details would relate to would still be behind a paywall.  Scotland\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquobig land\u0026rsquo lobby said it was supportive of transparency moves. Sarah-Jane Laing, executive director of Scottish Land \u0026amp Estates, said: \u0026ldquoWe fully appreciate that transparency and visibility of ownership is an area where improvement is required and we led the way in publishing our Landowners\u0026rsquo Commitment in 2014 which urged landowners to be open and visible. \u0026ldquo She said her body would review regulations to ensure they are \u0026ldquoboth proportionate and workable  However, the SNP still faces robust opposition on wider reform from vested interests. These include those of Mrs Cameron\u0026rsquos stepfather, Viscount Astor, whose family has effectively owned the Jura estate for nearly century and who has described the beneficial owners of the property as his children.  The hereditary peer, whose full name is William Waldorf Astor III, in 2015 accused the SNP of threatening \u0026ldquoMugabe-style land grabs on landowners. That, said a spokesman for Ms Sturgeon, was \u0026ldquopretty preposterous.  Analysis from Malcom Combe, Law Lecturer, Aberdeen University  \"Land registration is not new to Scotland. The current Land Register was introduced in 1979, and prior to that there was a system of deeds registration that went back to the 17th century.  \"What is happening now \u0026ndash in line with what was provided for in 2016 Land Reform Act -\u0026nbsp is to have a register of who controls a relevant entity that owns land, much like letting agent registration has emerged in the private rented sector.    Malcolm Combe  \"The hope is that this will increase accountability of owners, or at the very least open up channels of communication, which would otherwise have been tricky in situations where, say, the only details of a landowner was an overseas registered office.  \"Interestingly, the draft regulations set out that knowingly or recklessly failing to comply with the information duties that will be associated with the new register will be a criminal offence.  The maximum penalty for those offences is a fine not exceeding \u0026pound5,000, although the stigma of an offence is perhaps the greater penalty. There will be some tricky issues to navigate though, such as how to operate the rules for local trusts or clubs.\""},{"url":null,"title":"Pay hike    absorbs      50m college merger savings","story":"              ALL of the savings generated by a Scotland-wide college merger programme will be \u0026lsquoabsorbed\u0026rsquo by higher wages for lecturers, according to public spending watchdogs.  Audit Scotland suggested the costs of pay harmonisation across the sector - which will see lecturers paid a top salary of more than \u0026pound40,000 - will match the estimated \u0026pound50 million annual windfall from mergers.  The report goes on to highlight a number of financial risks facing colleges including a \u0026pound360m repairs backlog, revealed in December, and the impact of Brexit.  Auditors also noted the attainment gap between rich and poor students is growing despite a national campaign to close it.  Overall the report found the sector\u0026rsquos financial position had improved in 2016/17 with an overall surplus of \u0026pound0.3m compared to an \u0026pound8m deficit last year.  However, five colleges are still in deficit including New College Lanarkshire, Edinburgh, Ayrshire, Dundee \u0026amp Angus and North Highland.  The report said: \u0026ldquoStaff costs remain the highest area of spending and are forecast to increase, mainly as a result of the costs associated with harmonising pay and other conditions.  \u0026ldquoColleges Scotland has estimated the total cost of harmonisation as \u0026pound50m a year from 2019/20.  \u0026ldquoThis would absorb all the \u0026pound50m of annual financial savings the Scottish Government ... expected the reform programme to deliver.  In 2015 Audit Scotland said there was no evidence the 2011/12 merger programme - which saw the number of colleges fall from 37 to 20 - had improved education or produced savings.  When the plans were announced, ministers said mergers would deliver \u0026pound50m annual efficiency savings and bring other benefits such as reduced duplication and better outcomes for students.  Shona Struthers, chief executive of Colleges Scotland, said: \u0026ldquoThe report notes significant elements of financial uncertainty for colleges, including ongoing costs of national bargaining.  \u0026ldquoColleges are working in partnership to ensure adequate sustainable funding ... to continue to deliver benefits.  Larry Flanagan, general secretary of the Educational Institute of Scotland, questioned the figures.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe have not seen any evidence to support these claims ... and would question the basis upon which these comments have been made.  \u0026ldquoThe 2015 Audit Scotland report itself challenged how much of the estimated \u0026pound50m could actually be attributable to college reform.  Iain Gray, education spokesman for Scottish Labour, said the report highlighted the \u0026ldquolack of support colleges received.  And Liz Smith, education spokeswoman for the Scottish Conservatives, attacked the \u0026ldquoout of control repair bill.  She said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos going to be difficult for colleges to teach and educate if their buildings are not in an adequate condition.  Shirley-Anne Somerville, the further education minister, said the report showed colleges were in better financial health with student satisfaction higher than last year.  She said: \u0026ldquoThis progress is supported by significant government investment of more than \u0026pound7 billion since 2007.

The shortages are understood to have been caused by a longer than usual break in production of ammonia, one of the key sources of food grade CO2 in Europe - which is used to carbonate drinks and preserve some packed fresh foods.

Mr Yousaf met with Common Weal earlier this year \u0026ndash just months before he is due to make an announcement on the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos plans for a public sector bid to take over the railways.  He initiated the meeting with the left-wing \u0026ldquothink and do tank to discuss a paper it produced with the transport union TSSA, which also suggested creating a unified public transport body for Scotland\u0026rsquos buses, trains, trams and ferries.  The document, entitled A Public Future for Scotland\u0026rsquos Railways, argues the current franchise system should be abolished to prevent the railways being taken back into private ownership if a public bid takes over.  It states: \u0026ldquoWhile the system of tendering out time-limited contracts for operating Scotland\u0026rsquos railways remains, even the most popular and efficient public-sector operator will suffer from the lack of certainty which inhibits long-term thinking in the railways today, as it would face the very real prospect of losing its right to operate the franchise every five to ten years.  \u0026ldquoIn order to allow us to enjoy the full rewards publicly-run railways have the potential to bring, the Scottish Government should seek the power to abolish the franchise system, and instead allow ScotRail to be operated permanently on a public-sector basis.  The paper argues \u0026ldquomuch of the transformative potential of the idea of publicly-run railways in Scotland relies on it being a permanent break with decades of privatisation and market-oriented policy.  It references the InterCity East Coast franchise, which was run by a state-owned operator between 2009 and 2015, and argues a publicly-owned rail company could make substantial cuts to ticket prices.  It also suggests three governance models: a new public arms-length rail company, a unified public transport body, or a co-operative partially owned by workers and passengers.  In an entry on Holyrood\u0026rsquos lobbying register, Common Weal writes: \u0026ldquoWe were asked to provide our advice and opinion on [the] plans and to offer suggestions as to what other aspects of the recommendations in our paper could be prioritised.  Dr Craig Dalzell, head of policy and research at the think tank, said Mr Yousaf had been interested in \u0026ldquothe report in the round.  The transport minister is currently preparing a bid to take over the railways, with a statement on the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos plans due within days.  A public-sector bid by state-owned ferry operator CalMac is understood to be one of the favoured options.  But current operator Abellio has repeatedly said it would have \"no problem competing with a public bid\".  Scottish Tory transport spokesman Jamie Greene said the meeting with Common Weal \u0026ldquoshould send alarm bells ringing.  He said: \u0026ldquoSeeking views of this type simply signals that instead of just pushing for a public operator to run our railways, the transport minister is in fact open to full monopolised nationalisation, at any cost.  He added: \u0026ldquoTenders and franchises offer a transparent process which get the best available operator at the best cost to the public purse.  A Transport Scotland spokesman said: \u0026ldquoOur consistent view over many years is that there ought to be a level playing field between the private and public sector in bidding for rail franchises.  \u0026ldquoIt is vital that we take the time to think through the various scenarios as ministers want to enable a competitive public sector bid which offers best value for the public purse while delivering continuous service improvements.

As well as multiple long-term challenges facing the country\u0026rsquos businesses, Holyrood\u0026rsquos economy committee said ministers had to update their plans in anticipation of Brexit.  The cross-party group also said it was worried about the government\u0026rsquos ability to measure the impact of its policies on growth, and recommended enterprise agencies be \u0026ldquomuch more clearly focused on delivery, and pursue a consistent definition of inclusive growth.

It said the end of free movement and a tighter immigration regime would see such workers try other EU nations and English-speaking countries such as the US and Australia.  The researchers at Glasgow and Edinburgh universities also warned a lack of joined up thinking by the UK Government meant the fate of such workers was being overlooked.  While there had been work on maintaining the flow of high-skill and seasonal workers, little was being done on maintaining adequate numbers of key low-skill workers all year round.  There was a particular failure to plan to Scotland\u0026rsquos rural areas and its demographic needs, with a growing elderly population requiring more care workers.  There are around 128,000 EU nationals working in Scotland, 5 per cent of the workforce.  The Scottish Government said the report showed the need for Holyrood to control migration.  The report, Choices Ahead: Approaches to lower skilled labour migration after Brexit, found a shift to more restrictive migration system was likely \u0026ldquoto have substantial effects on the supply of EEA [European Economic Area] nationals into lower-skilled jobs.  Some Scottish sectors were particularly reliant of EU nationals, with more than a fifth of basic cleaners and food processors from the continent.  There were also lesser concentrations in manufacturing, hotels and restaurants, and finance.  It recommended policy makers \u0026ldquobalance a range of labour market, demographic and social goals in developing policies to regulate low-skilled migration, and consider how changes would affect the decisions of would-be migrants on mobility and settlement.  It said: \u0026ldquoWhatever programme is adopted, the UK and Scotland will have to compete with other countries as potential migrant destinations. For EEA nationals, other countries within the EEA will become attractive alternatives. Other English-speaking countries (USA, Canada or Australia) with more complex entry requirements may also begin to emerge as more attractive destinations, especially for younger migrants with good English-language skills.\u0026rsquo  \u0026ldquoSuch restricted rights programmes are likely to be far less appealing to EEA nationals.  Co-author Professor Rebecca Kay, of Glasgow University\u0026rsquos School of social and Political Studies, added: \u0026ldquoEach year thousands of European nationals fill lower-skilled job vacancies in many UK industries like agriculture and care work. Many have stayed longer-term, raising families and contributing to their local communities.  \u0026ldquoPolicy makers designing new immigration policy must consider the varied needs of these workers and the attractiveness of the UK as a destination.  \u0026ldquoPolicy design will impact both on our ability to attract migrant workers at all, and on the types of migrants who are willing to come to, or settle in our country.  External affairs secretary Fiona Hyslop said: \u0026ldquoThis report clearly sets out the potentially catastrophic impact to Scotland\u0026rsquos business and communities of the UK Government\u0026rsquos migration policies. This cannot be an acceptable scenario and makes it all the more important, as the deadline of the UK leaving the EU draws closer, that we have the powers to set a migration policy tailored to Scotland\u0026rsquos specific needs and circumstances.  Green MSP Ross Greer said: \u0026ldquoThe scale of the task Scotland faces in attracting European nationals is laid bare in this report. It outlines how other English speaking countries and other countries in the EEA will become \u0026lsquomore attractive destinations\u0026rsquo than Scotland.  \u0026ldquoWorse still, families with young children, looking for a new home for the long-term, will be deterred by a \u0026lsquomore restrictive system\u0026rsquo.

The charity, which is being supported by The Wood Foundation as it expands its reach in the North-east, hopes to eventually be active in every City and Shire secondary school.                                                    The North-east is the first area for the nationwide expansion of the programme outside of Glasgow. Aberdeen has the second highest proportion of young people failing to move onto \u0026lsquopositive destinations\u0026rsquo when they leave school.        The Wood Foundation\u0026rsquos UK Director Ali MacLachlan said: \u0026ldquoNurturing young people at this crossroads in their lives is vitally important in terms of supporting them to find the right path to fulfil their potential.\u0026ldquoPeople may be surprised to learn that the North-east has such high rates of young people unable to move onto positive destinations after school. We must harness the potential of these young people to support the current and future economic performance of our region.\u0026ldquoMany of these vulnerable young people lack the stability and support many of us take for granted. This imbalance is something the programme aims to address.\u0026ldquoMCR Pathways has already demonstrated significant impact and we are pleased to support its introduction to the North-east.                                                                                                        The Wood Foundation will be hosting an open event next week to inform potential mentors and business partners about the programme.A mentor meets a young person weekly in their school. They provide a listening ear and supportive voice \u0026ndash a constant adult role model who will build confidence, aspirations and a route to meaningful training or employment. Mentors are trained to guide young people through subject choices, training and professional routes to broaden their mind-sets and realise their potential.One of the opportunities, which requires support from the local business community, is \u0026lsquoTalent Tasters\u0026rsquo \u0026ndash a bite-sized work experience programme showing young people different aspects of industry.Iain MacRitchie of MCR Pathways said: \u0026ldquoA young person\u0026rsquos future should be determined by their potential, never their circumstances. Our mentoring scheme levels the playing field and gives young people structured, enthusiastic and dedicated support to really find a way to realise and achieve their goals as they make that transition from childhood to their adult lives.                                                                                                        \u0026ldquoWe are very proud of what the programme and our young people have achieved to date and we have no doubt the same successes will be realised in the North-east where we have recognised a real need and desire for this support.\u0026lsquoPathways Coordinators\u0026rsquo have been hired for each of the six schools and will begin work after the summer break. They support pupils in S1 and 2 and match them with a mentor from S3.MCR Pathways is already operational across all Glasgow secondary schools where more than 1300 young people are supported each week through a mixture of group work, mentoring and work-based \u0026lsquoTalent Taster\u0026rsquo opportunities. More than 80% of mentored participants have moved onto further education, higher education or employment in sharp contrast to the national figure of 54%.Businessman Iain MacRitchie launched the charity in 2007 after being shocked by a professional experience restructuring a youth care business. While the business health was restored, the poor outcomes for young people remained the same and he realised the need for relationship-based, meaningful support.He commented: \u0026ldquoThat professional experience was a real eye-opener for me, seeing that these young people were not getting the support they needed and nowhere near achieving their potential. I vowed then to do something and have taken time out from my business to make a difference. This programme really does deliver profound results for some of the most vulnerable in our society.                                                                                                        \u0026ldquoHelping a young person onto the right path at this stage really is life-changing. We continuously hear incredible stories including a mentee who went from a homeless unit to medical school and another who had to contend with family addiction issues and was four years behind in their education to graduating university and becoming a building surveyor.\u0026ldquoTheir stories, among countless other, have spurred us to roll out this project nationwide and we look forward to hearing of the successes of North-east youngsters in the years to come.The first information event for individuals and businesses keen to support the programme in the North-east will be held at The Wood Foundation\u0026rsquos office in Aberdeen on Monday, June 18.To register, or for more information on future events, please contact Alison.maclachlan@thewoodfoundation.org.uk.

Karin Hayhow, Marketing Director at Mackie’s, said: “This might well sound like an excuse for lots of fun – but we really do need a wide range of people to give us feedback on the taste of our products – that’s the most important attribute – and one that will inform what we go out to market with. “We always try to do something special for the RHS as it’s an integral part of the Mackie’s business, so we’re thrilled to be invited to participate on board the SRUC’s amazing new facility.“Hopefully the participants will enjoy getting a peek into the behind-the-scenes process of testing products before they are released on to the market.”Students at the college will be assisting with the sensory lab throughout the show, featuring a range of produce.

One befriendee said these befrienders are \u0026ldquolike young relations.The benefits of this are twofold. As well as keeping the befriendees company, it gets the young befriendees into the voluntary mind-set early on, encourages them to become more empathetic and confident and it shows they can make a difference.Befriendees also benefit from regular contact with people \u0026ldquoso they feel as though they\u0026rsquore part of the community, according to befriending co-ordinator Elspeth Manson.Angie added: \u0026ldquoHelping someone recognise their worth is a benefit for both the befriendee and the volunteer.The recruitment procedure includes volunteers receiving Protecting Vulnerable Groups (PVG) clearance and providing three references. Once accepted, training includes support from other groups such as stroke awareness, Hearing and Sight Care and Parkinson\u0026rsquos awareness.Befriending Caithness is not a standalone organisation \u0026ndash it is helped by the community.An event to look out for is a fashion show at M\u0026ampCo in Thurso on June 28, starting at 7pm.

I\u0026rsquom sure there are a lot of people who won\u0026rsquot know them.He explained that only the base of the memorial, which was erected in 1903, was still to be refurbished with the interpretation panels set to complete the whole project.The path along by the memorial is on the Wick section of the John O\u0026rsquoGroats Trail, a 147-mile route from Inverness.Mr Bogle pointed out that interpretation panels were already in place on the stretch of the trail through Wick, with one at the Trinkie. However, two existing panels are being moved to the Braehead and North Head.He said the paths were already proving popular with local people and visitors and the group is keen to provide information about the area.Mr Bogle added that the civil engineer\u0026rsquos gravestone \u0026ndash in the graveyard of Wick St Fergus Church \u0026ndash had also been tidied up recently.Wick Harbour Authority chairman Willie Watt MBE said: \u0026ldquoFor me James Bremner is one of the unsung heroes of Caithness. He is just an amazing character. Nothing was too difficult for him and he treated everybody he worked with the greatest of respect. He was a great leader and motivator.Mr Watt pointed out that one of the Wick engineer\u0026rsquos greatest achievements was the refloating of the SS Great Britain \u0026ndash the largest ship of its time \u0026ndash when she ran aground off Ireland in the 1840s.He said that Mr Bremner was sent for from Wick, along with a few of his men, when other engineers had failed in one of the biggest salvage operations of that era.James Bremner (1784-1856) was born at Stain, Keiss. He was an apprentice in a Greenock shipyard and returned to Wick to establish his own shipbuilding business, constructing over 50 vessels in as many years as well as designing and building many harbours. He was involved in the construction of the breakwater at Wick harbour.A local author, John Mowat, once described Mr Bremner as \u0026ldquothe Ulysses of the north and \u0026ldquoour greatest Caithnessian.Mr Bremner is still remembered in Keiss with a plaque at the harbour erected by the Institution of Civil Engineers.Thursday 21 Jun 2018 8:38 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"June 21, 2018 at 6:00 amThis week\u0026#8217s edition of The Orcadian is now available from all the usual outlets and online, here.

That simply makes it a must-attend event for Orkney’s premium food and drink firms, giving them the chance to showcase their products to a very wide audience of potential customers. It’s a very busy few days for our producers, but always worth the effort and it also gives us an opportunity to tell the wider story about Orkney and all its other attractions.”Amongst the Orkney businesses travelling to the show will be newcomers, J. Gow Rum, makers of the county’s first locally produced rum.Collin van Schayk of rum producers, VS Distillers, said: “We’re very much looking forward to introducing J. Gow Rum to the visitors at this year’s Royal Highland Show. The reception it’s had since its launch late last year has been fantastic, so we’re really excited about bringing it to a much wider audience, and sharing our story.“One of the strengths of Orkney’s approach to marketing food and drink is the fact local businesses present a united front at these major events. We all share the same vision in terms of upholding Orkney’s reputation as a quality food and drink location and we’re all very proud to be representing the islands on the national stage.”\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The plans represent an investment of £125 million for investors and would create 385 new jobs.According to the hotel chain, the letter it has sent to OIC sets out how it has supported 12 local authorities in England and Wales, supporting local regeneration, creating jobs and boosting local economies.With similar letters being sent to 19 other councils in Scotland, including Shetland Islands Council, the hotel chain is attempting to show how it could similarly support local communities around the country.These agreements offer a funding structure which the hotel chain says enables local authorities to utilise their existing assets, create jobs, generate income, and help to regenerate land in strategically important locations.Hotels in the programme are built on surplus local authority land, with the funding provided either through the local authority’s internal resource or via low-cost funding from the Public Works Loan Board or third party resources.Upon completion of the hotel development, local authorities would either have the choice of either retaining ownership of the hotel and receive an annual rent into the council’s revenue budget or selling the hotel with Travelodge as its operator.Brian Wallace, Travelodge chairman said: “Many local authorities are in possession of large amounts of property and assets that are not being utilised. Investing in a low-cost hotel like Travelodge is an increasingly attractive choice, as it draws visitors, creates jobs and helps boost the local economy.”“We operate 44 hotels across Scotland. However, the country is growing at pace and attracting visitors from all corners of the globe but there still remains a huge shortage of good quality and great value hotels. To fill this gap, we want to extend our Scottish network with a further 20 hotels and this includes our first hotel in Kirkwall. To help us achieve this, we are writing to Orkney Council, to invite them to consider how Travelodge can act as a catalyst to drive their local development agenda.”A spokesman for Orkney Islands Council has said the local authority is unable to comment at this stage as to date, a proposal has not been received by the council.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.
