Superstar Brad still doesn\u0027t have a chance...Share this articleStudents for Fair Admissions relied on an analysis from Peter Arcidiacono, a Duke University economist who says he found evidence of bias against Asian-Americans.Arcidiacono\u0027s study concluded that if Harvard relied only on the academic scores it assigns to each applicant, more than half of admitted students would have been Asian-American in the six years in question. Instead, they made up just 22 percent.To blame, he wrote, are subjective rating categories for which Asian-American applicants consistently received lower scores than their white peers.Asian-Americans, for example, received lower scores than any other racial group in a category for \u0027personal qualities,\u0027 and they fared worse than whites in an overall rating category that isn\u0027t based on any particular formula.Yet Harvard alumni who interview applicants and provide their own ratings generally scored Asian-Americans higher than whites, a contrast that Arcidiacono says suggests bias.          They quoted figures stating that an Asian-American male applicant with a 25 percent chance of admission would have a 35 percent chance if he was white, 75 percent if he were Hiic and a 95 percent chance if he were black. File photo The university attacked his analysis, saying it\u0027s flawed because it excludes applicants believed to have an advantage regardless of race, including relatives of alumni and athletes recruited by the school.Instead, Harvard sought its own study from David Card, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley, who found no evidence of discrimination against Asian-Americans.Looking at a wider pool of applicants and admissions factors, Card found that the effect of being Asian-American was \u0027statistically indistinguishable from zero.\u0027Both sides also are sparring over a 2013 internal study at Harvard exploring the racial makeup of the admitted class. The inquiry, uncovered by Blum\u0027s group, was conducted amid earlier allegations of discrimination against Harvard.The study found that even considering factors like legacy status and extracurricular activities, 26 percent of the admitted class would have been expected to be Asian-American. Instead, 19 percent were.Blum\u0027s group says the report is proof of intentional discrimination and that Harvard \u0027killed the study and quietly buried the reports.\u0027Harvard counters that the study was never intended to evaluate possible discrimination and that it was \u0027incomplete, preliminary and based on limited inputs.\u0027University officials have painted the lawsuit as an attack on their ability to consider race in admissions, which they say is necessary to ensure ersity on campus.In 2016, the Supreme Court examined the topic and upheld race-conscious admissions at the University of Texas, but the justices warned that other colleges still must be able to prove affirmative action is the only way to meet ersity goals.Blum also was a driving force behind that case, helping Texas student Abigail Fisher sue the university. Fisher is also an executive in Students for Fair Admissions, according to the group\u0027s tax filings.Friday\u0027s court filings followed a recent battle over a trove of Harvard data reviewed by lawyers during the discovery process.Harvard argued that its records initially should be filed confidentially to protect students and the admissions process. Blum\u0027s group said the public should have access to the records, and the U.S. Education Department - which is also looking into Harvard\u0027s use of race in admissions - weighed in to agree.The judge ultimately sided with Harvard, but Blum said Friday that he believes the rest of the records will be released \u0027in the next few weeks.\u0027 "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/16/21/4D5073A400000578-5852201-image-a-45_1529182710569.jpg","title":"Luxury new build house dubbed Beggars Lodge royals new home","story":"    Situated on the 3,800-acre estate of Great Tew in Gloucestershire, where Harry and Meghan are currently renting a country bolthole, the planned property is set to replace an existing set of dilapidated farm buildingsDepicted here in computer-generated drawings by a local designer, it certainly fits the bill for Meghan and Harry’s future family home.The stone-built manor, at the end of a 150-yard-long tree-lined drive, will feature a high-tech ‘media room’, a massive walk-in wardrobe, a ‘family room’, and ancillary accommodation perfect for security staff, drivers and a nanny.At the rear of the house will be a flagstone terrace, ornamental flower beds and a 150ft lawn lined with yew topiary.

But there are some hard facts that both sides are going to have to confront.ONE is that Theresa May misled the Remainers. A charitable interpretation is she did so unintentionally. A less charitable one is that she mugged them in an effort to save her own skin. But regardless of motive and method, on Tuesday Dominic Grieve and his allies believed their concerns would be fully addressed by a Government amendment, hence the 11th-hour withdrawal of their own. By accident or design, they were duped.RICHARD LITTLEJOHN: The Bad Boys of Brexit spoke for Britain...Blow for Philip Hammond as the PM plans to pour billions of...Share this articleWhat is equally apparent is that by tabling such a strongly worded motion, Grieve over-reached himself. Upholding the sacred right of Parliament to scrutinise legislation is one thing. But his text went way beyond that, stipulating that in the event of a deal being rejected by the Commons, the Prime Minister ‘must follow any direction in relation to the negotiation under Article 50’. That was an untenable demand. Setting aside the issue of centuries of constitutional precedent, the idea that MPs could elbow aside Ministers and begin setting the terms of negotiations themselves was utterly impractical.As one Government official scornfully noted: ‘We haven’t started the procurement process for a negotiating table around which it’s possible to fit 650 MPs.’Similarly, by presenting his amendment merely as a sensible contingency, only to be triggered in the event a no-deal scenario, Grieve was himself being uncharacteristically disingenuous.He knew full well that, if adopted, it would have emasculated David Davis and his Brexit negotiating team, giving their EU opposite numbers a clear incentive to simply stonewall the talks and await the cavalry from the Commons. Far from guarding against a no-deal scenario, it would have made a no-deal scenario a certainty.Grieve, Anna Soubry, Nicky Morgan and their allies believe the end justifies these slightly underhand means. They genuinely think they represent the last line of defence against a kamikaze Brexit. And for that they deserve respect, not slurs about their patriotism or their parentage.But they are also wrong. The last line of defence against a kamikaze Brexit is Theresa May.The Prime Minister was pilloried last week for her negotiating stance. ‘A farce’ was one of the more polite descriptions from one Brexit-supporting newspaper.Even Downing Street insiders characterise their progress as ‘several steps forward, then a couple back’. But they also – correctly – point out that the overall direction of travel is consistent. Towards a sensible, pragmatic Brexit.For all the criticism she has received from Tory Remainers over the past few days, Mrs May has demonstrated time and again she too is prepared to stand up to her hard-Brexit zealots. Over the orce bill. Over the transition period. Over ECJ rulings during that transition. Over a customs arrangement. Indeed, not just stand up to them, but face them down, as Boris Johnson’s perennial frantic redrawing of his ‘red lines’ attests.But if the Prime Minister is undermined this week, then she will no longer be in a position to stand up to anyone. At that point a leadership challenge would almost certainly be mounted, one that if successful would result in the election of a far more Eurosceptic Tory leader.Or worse. The removal of Theresa May might give a brief moment of satisfaction to the Remain and hard-Brexit factions. But it would not break the Commons deadlock.And that is the real danger presented by the Grieve amendment. We are now on the cusp of entering a period of parliamentary purgatory. The Prime Minister attempts to negotiate a deal. The Commons rejects it. A new Prime Minister is dispatched to negotiate a new deal. That in turn is rejected. Tory – and moderate Labour – fears of a Corbyn government prevent a dissolution of the House and an early Election. And so the cycle repeats itself. At which point the Government ceases governing.          Nicky Morgan is one of the Tory rebels The country deserves better than this. As does Theresa May. Twelve months ago her premiership was over. The horrific fire at Grenfell, and catastrophic Election result, had created a perfect storm. In a matter of months Corbyn and his legion of White Walkers would be marching up Downing Street.BUT with the tenacity and bloody-mindedness that have become her trademark, the PM has stabilised her position. Labour’s lead in the polls has been reversed. The Corbynites’ crude attempt to leverage the Grenfell tragedy into a transitional political moment has failed. And, as we report today, a dramatic cash injection for the NHS demonstrates she is finally throwing off her instinctive caution, delivering the kind of major ‘visible from space’ policy announcements Ministers have been crying out for.Then there is Brexit. It has been an ugly process. But the Government is inching forward. David Davis has won the argument for publication of a Brexit White Paper. It will be signed off at next month’s Chequers away-day, after which it will form the basis of Mrs May’s official negotiating position.That’s if the Remain rebels stand with her.

I can\u0027t move into that role with the infighting, the disciplinary measures going on for LGBT clergy who step outside the lines.\u0027           She had previously been persuaded by Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby (right) to join the priesthoodChurch of England turns to flamboyant preachers like Harry...Church of England bishops will call on Theresa May to...Have the ‘courage’ to pump more money into the NHS,...Share this articleBeeching, who had intended to start her priest training this Autumn, said she had felt a vocation since childhood, when she was reared on stirring tales of her grandparents\u0027 lives as missionaries in Africa.  But she added that she felt her \u0027career and vocation were being blocked by a stained glass ceiling\u0027. In her memoirs, Unided, published this month, Beeching describes how she struggled with her sexuality from the age of 13 onwards. According to the singer, at 16 she was subjected to a traumatic exorcism at the hands of eight adults, shouting: \u0027Demons of homosexuality, leave.\u0027She also revealed she was forced to suppress her sexuality while touring the \u0027Bible Belt\u0027 in the US - leading to chronic health issues.But Beeching said she hopes the church will eventually change its teaching on the subject. She continued: \u0027Future generations will look back at the way the church has treated LGBT people in the same way we look back and shudder at the way the church defended slavery or opposed women\u0027s right to vote.\u0027 The Church of England said in a statement: \u0027It is essential to put on record the huge service and contribution LGBTI+ people bring to the life of our church, and without it we would be diminished.\u0027            Beeching has enjoyed considerable success as a US Christian pop singer and has toured the US several timesVicky Beeching, the lesbian shut out by the stained glass ceiling | News | The Sunday Times"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/17/12/4D4F3EB100000578-0-image-m-18_1529235383689.jpg","title":"Labour MP Dame Margaret Hodge applies unpaid university post long gets paid it","story":"    Labour MP Dame Margaret Hodge has asked for a salary for the unpaid post at Royal Holloway, University of LondonA Labour MP has applied for a voluntary position at a university - but has asked for a salary for the unpaid post.Dame Margaret Hodge, the former chair of the public accounts committee, is known for being a fierce critic of companies and institutions that fritter away taxpayers\u0027 money.However it has been claimed that she would only take up the post of Chair of Council at Royal Holloway, University of London if it came with an income of £20,000 per annum. Dame Margaret, who has held the position as a MP for Barking since 1994, was previously honoured by the Queen in 2015 for her political and public services. A source told the The Sunday Telegraph: \u0027The role attracted well over 100 good applicants when it was advertised. So lots of capable people wanted to volunteer to give back to support the University.\u0027Royal Holloway University\u0027s statutes, or laws, forbids the University from paying their Chair of the Council a salary.

There must have been a number of candidates for the role, presumably keen to do it voluntarily.\u0027           Royal Holloway University\u0027s statute stipulates that the Chair, along with all other members of the Council, are charity trusteesIf the Chair of Council were to be paid a salary it would mean changing the statutes and regulations, which would need the approval of the Privy Council.The university has now contacted both the Charities Commission and the Privy Council. Speaking to The Sunday Telegraph, Dame Margaret said: \u0027My application was made on the basis that I would receive modest remuneration for the work associated with this position.\u0027          James Price, campaign manager at the TaxPayers\u0027 Alliance (TPA), said it seems \u0027odd\u0027 to start paying for previously-voluntary rolesA spokesman for the Privy Council confirmed that Royal Holloway University has submitted a draft proposal to amend its Statutes which is currently being considered. A spokesman for Royal Holloway University added: \u0027The role of Chair of Council is an important one, and the inidual we appoint will have a key role to play in the governance and development of the university,\u0027 the university said.\u0027Given the level of commitment that we expect from the new Chair of Council, we are seeking permission from the Privy Council and Charity Commission to remunerate the post.\u0027Dame Margaret is a high profile and respected public figure and will bring a great deal of experience and knowledge to this role.\u0027"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/17/10/4D54191C00000578-0-image-m-5_1529226707642.jpg","title":"Labour bosses pleaded MPs staff work free Labour Live","story":"    Jeremy Corbyn (pictured at Labour Live yesterday) was accused of hypocrisy over the staffing arrangements, as it appears to fly in the face of his party pledges to ban unpaid internships and crack down on the exploitation of workersTheresa May says taxes WILL go up to bankroll her £380m a...\u0027You have been overtaken on the left by May\u0027: Thornberry...Share this article    The Labour Live festival (pictured) has been hit by a string of problems - fueling concerns it was just a vanity project for a Labour leader keen to replicate his popularity at Glastonbury last yearThe festival has been hit by a string of problems - fueling concerns it was just a vanity project for a Labour leader keen to replicate his popularity at Glastonbury last yearTickets were £35 for adults but on Thursday prices were slashed to £10.And Unite, Britain\u0027s biggest trade union and a major Labour Party donor, reportedly also spent up to £35,000 buying tickets to dish out to supporters for free.And Mr Corbyn was left red-faced on the day when anti-Brexit protesters interrupted his headline speech at Labour Live tonight with a chorus of \u0027stop backing Brexit\u0027.The Labour leader\u0027s address during \u0027Jez Fest\u0027 at the White Hart Lane Recreation Ground in Wood Green was halted by activists from Our Future, Our choice - a pro-Europe youth group.Chanting \u0027stop backing Brexit\u0027 to the tune of \u0027Oh, Jeremy Corbyn\u0027, the 15-strong group raised a banner just metres from where Corbyn stood.The group - who were protesting Mr Corbyn\u0027s ambiguous stance on Brexit - were reportedly ejected from the event shortly afterwards.    Labour Live: Jez-fest gets staff to work for FREE after slashing ticket prices | UK | News | Express.co.uk"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/08/03/4D08E19000000578-0-image-a-30_1528424177739.jpg","title":"Giant UFO shaped like stingray spotted sky Russian World Cup venue","story":"Nizhny Novgorod from Kirov said she spotted the mysterious aircraft flying over northern Russia as reports came of a UFO arrival.Alongside the clip, the woman posted: \u0027What the hell was that? \u0027It doesn\u0027t look like anything I\u0027ve previously seen.\u0027And others believed aliens could be flying over the city.What is the mysterious object caught on video above a...US aircraft carrier was stalked for days by a UFO travelling...Share this articleOne said: \u0027The aliens have arrived for the World Cup,\u0027 said one.\u0027Is that a rocket, a fireball or a UFO over Nizhny Novgorod?

Superstar Brad still doesn\u0027t have a chance...Share this articleStudents for Fair Admissions relied on an analysis from Peter Arcidiacono, a Duke University economist who says he found evidence of bias against Asian-Americans.Arcidiacono\u0027s study concluded that if Harvard relied only on the academic scores it assigns to each applicant, more than half of admitted students would have been Asian-American in the six years in question. Instead, they made up just 22 percent.To blame, he wrote, are subjective rating categories for which Asian-American applicants consistently received lower scores than their white peers.Asian-Americans, for example, received lower scores than any other racial group in a category for \u0027personal qualities,\u0027 and they fared worse than whites in an overall rating category that isn\u0027t based on any particular formula.Yet Harvard alumni who interview applicants and provide their own ratings generally scored Asian-Americans higher than whites, a contrast that Arcidiacono says suggests bias.          They quoted figures stating that an Asian-American male applicant with a 25 percent chance of admission would have a 35 percent chance if he was white, 75 percent if he were Hiic and a 95 percent chance if he were black. File photo The university attacked his analysis, saying it\u0027s flawed because it excludes applicants believed to have an advantage regardless of race, including relatives of alumni and athletes recruited by the school.Instead, Harvard sought its own study from David Card, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley, who found no evidence of discrimination against Asian-Americans.Looking at a wider pool of applicants and admissions factors, Card found that the effect of being Asian-American was \u0027statistically indistinguishable from zero.\u0027Both sides also are sparring over a 2013 internal study at Harvard exploring the racial makeup of the admitted class. The inquiry, uncovered by Blum\u0027s group, was conducted amid earlier allegations of discrimination against Harvard.The study found that even considering factors like legacy status and extracurricular activities, 26 percent of the admitted class would have been expected to be Asian-American. Instead, 19 percent were.Blum\u0027s group says the report is proof of intentional discrimination and that Harvard \u0027killed the study and quietly buried the reports.\u0027Harvard counters that the study was never intended to evaluate possible discrimination and that it was \u0027incomplete, preliminary and based on limited inputs.\u0027University officials have painted the lawsuit as an attack on their ability to consider race in admissions, which they say is necessary to ensure ersity on campus.In 2016, the Supreme Court examined the topic and upheld race-conscious admissions at the University of Texas, but the justices warned that other colleges still must be able to prove affirmative action is the only way to meet ersity goals.Blum also was a driving force behind that case, helping Texas student Abigail Fisher sue the university. Fisher is also an executive in Students for Fair Admissions, according to the group\u0027s tax filings.Friday\u0027s court filings followed a recent battle over a trove of Harvard data reviewed by lawyers during the discovery process.Harvard argued that its records initially should be filed confidentially to protect students and the admissions process. Blum\u0027s group said the public should have access to the records, and the U.S. Education Department - which is also looking into Harvard\u0027s use of race in admissions - weighed in to agree.The judge ultimately sided with Harvard, but Blum said Friday that he believes the rest of the records will be released \u0027in the next few weeks.\u0027 "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/17/00/4D50F1C800000578-5852547-image-a-4_1529191964079.jpg","title":"Co operative bank bans feminist group using services","story":"    Activist Venice Allan said they wanted to stick to \u0027dictionary definition\u0027 of man and womanThe Co-operative Bank has banned a feminist group from using its services because of its stance on transgender issues.The bank claims the unnamed group has \u0027actively declined the rights of members of the transgender community\u0027.But the ban has sparked outrage from feminist campaigners.Last night, activist Venice Allan told The Mail on Sunday: \u0027Feminist groups are constantly being told that they need to admit men who define themselves as a woman.\u0027But I think we are entitled to stick to the dictionary definition of what a man is and what a woman is.\u0027It is highly inappropriate for the Co-op Bank to treat a group in this way for sticking to the correct definition of a woman.\u0027The boycott is revealed in the Co-op\u0027s Values and Ethics Report 2017, in which it proclaims: \u0027We declined banking services to…\u0027 and then lists organisations it deems to be unacceptable and which it has turned down.Extraordinarily, the feminist group is top of the list – ahead of organisations listed under \u0027oppressive regimes\u0027 and the \u0027fur trade\u0027.The Co-op has refused to reveal further details, but there has been an increasingly heated conflict nationally over transgender issues.

Dagmar Hochová took photographs that captured all of the hopes and fears of the long postwar struggle for freedom in her country, which culminated in the Velvet Revolution of 1989.Hochová was born in 1926 and lived most of her life in Prague until her death in 2012. Though her pictures were sometimes overtly political – the young, ostracised Václav Havel, at home the “march of silence” against the Russian invasion – Hochová became best known as a photographer of children. This was partly a question of expedience. Childhood was one of the few aspects of the city’s life that was effectively beyond the censor’s control. Hochová’s camera sought out the mischief and spirit of Czech kids playing in the streets. The exuberance she was drawn to was no doubt a statement of subversive intent at a time when freedom of expression was outlawed – there was also plenty of pure innocent joy.This picture, part of the first UK retrospective of Hochová’s work, captures all of that youthful Bohemian spirit. It was taken on a bridge over the Vltava River in 1959. After the Russian coup in 1948 there had been long years of Stalinist purges of artists and agitators, and the creation of all the grey apparatus of a police state, but that world seems far removed from these two girls. They lean into Hochová’s lens with freckled and dimpled devilment, challenging the viewer not to share their grins, infant fists clenched in an innocent echo of a wider defiance.The Power of Sympathy: The Photography of Dagmar Hochová, organised by the Czech Centre, runs from Wednesday until 29 June at the 12 Star Gallery, Europe House, London\u0026nbspSW1"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a149f83bad08686d7e62f5ffeef2631ec2da45d3/0_716_6943_4166/master/6943.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7c9923ede7e01621e50161a13223b76d","title":"field day festival drawings in pictures","story":"Earlier this month, London-based artist Joey Yu headed to Field Day, a two-day music festival held in south London’s Brockwell Park, to record the action with crayons, pencils and paper.

With her novels, she prefers to wait for her characters to introduce themselves to her, and slowly develop a trust and a friendship with them. Sometimes, however, external events force her hand. One of these was the election of the isive Hindu nationalist Narendra Modi as Indian prime minister in May 2014.At the time, Roy had been working for about seven years on her second novel, the successor to her stunning, 1997 Booker prize-winning debut, The God of Small Things. But Modi’s victory forced her to “really put down the tent pegs” on what would eventually become The Ministry of Utmost Happiness. “It was just a moment of shock for people like me,” says Roy, twirling an elegant, checked scarf around her neck like spaghetti around a fork. “For so many years, I’d been trying to yell from the rooftops about it and it was absolutely a sense of abject defeat and abject despair. And the choice was to get into bed and sleep for five years, or to really concentrate on this book. I didn’t feel like writing any more essays, although I did write one, but I felt like everything I had to say had been said. It was time to accept defeat.”It may have felt like defeat to Roy, but the arrival of The Ministry of Utmost Happiness last year was a cause of celebration for nearly everybody else. The novel, now out in paperback, opens in Delhi, in what appears to be the 1950s, and introduces us to Anjum, a Muslim hijra or transgender woman. In the second part of the book, the story moves to Kashmir and we follow a new protagonist, Tilo, an architect who becomes involved with a group of Kashmiri independence fighters. The strands eventually converge, but along the way dozens of odd characters dip in and out of proceedings. It’s not always immediately clear what purpose they are serving it’s only at the end of The Ministry of Utmost Happiness that you realise what an extraordinary and visceral state‑of‑the-nation book Roy has created.“What I wanted to know was: can a novel be a city?” says Roy. “Can you stop it being baby food, which can be easily consumed? So the reader also has to deal with complexities that they are being trained not to deal with.”Much of Roy’s own experience feeds into The Ministry of Utmost Happiness, not least the fact that she studied to be an architect and has campaigned for Kashmiri independence. For herself, she realised very quickly that architecture was not for her. “I graduated but I didn’t actually build anything, because I wasn’t really cut out to be making beautiful homes for wealthy people or whatever,” she says, smiling. “I had too many arguments with my bosses. Kept getting sacked for bad behaviour. For insolence!”So finding her way to writing was probably for the best then? “It started with knowing very early that I couldn’t have a boss!”Even now, at the age 56, Roy manages to retain a healthy rebellious streak. We meet in London, at the offices of her publisher, Penguin Random House, a couple of days after the end of the Hay festival. I notice she hadn’t appeared at the festival and wondered if there was a reason. There was: Tata, the Indian conglomerate that owns everything from steel plants to tea company Tetley, sponsored various events at Hay under the banner “Pioneering with Purpose”. Roy has in the past been critical of it as one of the “mega-corporations” that run modern India. She didn’t want to be a hypocrite.Roy, who lives in Delhi, instead wanted to use her time in London to confirm the publication of her collected nonfiction work. In the 20 years between her two novels, these projects have occupied most of her time. She has written powerfully about government dams, the 2002 Gujarat massacre, and spent almost three weeks walking through the forests of central India with Naxalites, a Maoist group that seeks to defend the rights of the tribes whose land, abundant in minerals, is being developed. It is a considerable body of work: so much so that when the essays are released next year – with the title My Seditious Heart – the book will run to more than 1,000 pages.Roy describes her nonfiction as “urgent interventions”, but ever since Modi came to power she is mostly drawn to writing fiction. It seems unlikely, then, that we’ll have to wait another 20 years for a new novel. “Who knows, but I hope not!” she says. “Because I really have so enjoyed writing fiction again. But I must say that, the times are so uncertain, there’s going to be a very, very hard year in India and I don’t know what’s going to happen. I can’t ever say in advance what I’ll be doing …”She shakes her head and laughs, “It’s a highly unplanned life.”Lionel ShriverAuthorDo you ever worry that your work as an activist detracts – or at least distracts – from your fiction, and are you concerned that sticking your neck out politically changes the way readers and critics respond to that fiction?I have always quarrelled with this word “activist”. I think it’s a very new word and I don’t know when it was born, but it was recently. I don’t want to have a second profession added to writing. Writing covers it. In the old days, writers were political creatures also, not all, but many. It was seen as our business to be writing about the world around us in different ways. So I don’t feel threatened or worried about that. For me, my fiction and my nonfiction are both political. The fiction is a universe, the nonfiction is an argument.What I do worry about is the fact that writers have become so frightened of being political. The idea that writers are being reduced to creators of a product that is acceptable, that slips down your throat, which readers love and therefore can be bestsellers, that’s so dangerous. Today, for example in India, where majoritarianism is taking root – and by majoritarianism, I don’t just mean the government, I mean that iniduals are being turned into micro-fascists by so many means. It is the mobs and vigilantes going and lynching people. So more than ever, the point of the writer is to be unpopular. The point of the writer is to say: “I denounce you even if I’m not in the majority.”Nina StibbeAuthorWhich Beatle is your favourite and why?John Lennon. I can say that in my sleep! Why? Because I always felt that there was a sadness that was wrapped with brilliance. And, this is not the reason that I love him – I also love the way he looks. This morning I woke up and felt a little jealous of seeing Yoko Ono and him together. I was like, “Fuck!” Although it was really before my time, but still…George MonbiotWriter and environmentalistIn a world racked by climate breakdown, ecological collapse and the marginalisation of billions, what gives you hope?One of my books of essays is dedicated to “those who have learned to orce hope from reason”. So being unreasonable is the only way that we can have hope. I am often among people who battle every day, but when you’re in there with them it’s not all grim. These are people who have their backs to the wall and are fighting for survival, but so much of the time they spend laughing at stupid things.For example, when I was inside the forests of central India with the comrades, one night everyone was asleep and I saw this guy typing something on his solar-powered computer. So I said: “What are you doing?” And he said: “Oh, I’m issuing a denial. You know, if all our denials were published, they would run into several volumes.” So I said: “What’s the most ridiculous denial you’ve ever had to issue?” And he said in Hindi: “No brother, we didn’t hammer the cows to death.”The story was that the current sitting chief minister had promised in his election campaign that, if he won the elections, every rural household would get a cow. So once he won, to pretend to deliver on his promise, they rounded up all these elderly cows and then they were subcontracted to people who were expected to deliver them to these far-flung households in the forests of indigenous peoples. Some of them just killed the cows halfway through and then said the Maoists did it. It served so many purposes: they didn’t have to bother delivering them, and the Maoists come out of it as anti-Hindu.So there’s often a graveyard humour and a steely resilience, and I believe that the only way – if at all – the machine can be pushed back is through these resistances. And I’m on the side of the line with them.Eve EnslerPlaywrightWhat reader’s response to The Ministry of Utmost Happiness surprised you the most?Ha-ha, there are several. One is that it’s a book that doesn’t pretend to universalise anything or conceptualise anything. It’s a book of great detail about a place. So the first thing that surprised me was that it has been translated into 46 languages – that it is being read in Vietnam, in Georgia. It was never designed to be that kind of an easy read. I got a letter from someone in Palestine the other day who said: “Thank you for making space for the poetics of other languages in your book.” That was amazing because the book is imagined in more than one language. And given the climate we have in India right now, I’m happy to say that it’s been pirated and even being sold to me at the traffic lights. For half-price!Wendy DonigerUS Indologist whose book The Hindus: An Alternative History was recalled by its publisher, Penguin India, in 2014Do you think it is possible for writers and publishers to join forces to find ways to oppose prosecutions for blasphemy (or “offending” religious feelings) under laws like Indian penal code section 295A? Or at least to change the charge from a criminal to a civil offence?If we’re talking India in particular, I feel that it is possible. I know Wendy Doniger’s publishers let her down very badly. It was very wrong what they did, because they were not even taken to court. It was just this crazy man who makes a business out of going after people in this way. This is the way the criminal justice system is used in India, as harassment. So they could have backed her, but they didn’t.At the moment what is happening in India is that censorship is being outsourced to the mob. Some person comes out and says: “Oh you’re not showing rajput in a good light,” or any community starts feeling that they can burn down cinema halls, they can stop a film release, and it’s all being allowed. In the same way, writers have been killed and shot and threatened. The government can try to act as if it’s not involved, but its involvement is in protecting the mobs. It’s a question that leads to many questions and Wendy Doniger has suffered.Shobha RaoAuthorWhen did you know your childhood was over?It’s not over yet! It should never be over for writers. The people I fear most are the people who I look at and I can’t imagine what kind of a child they were. Because of the circumstances in which I was born and how I lived, I had to be in some ways a pretty adult child and I would like at least some part of me to be a pretty childish adult.Kate HudsonGeneral secretary of CNDIt’s 20 years since India’s Pokharan nuclear weapons tests. At the time, you powerfully and convincingly demolished the claims that such weapons were deterrents to war. Now the narrative from the White House is one of “usable” nukes. How can we defeat this drive towards global self-destruction, and how can a new movement be built?I don’t know what the answer to this question is. But one thing that’s truly on my mind now, and I know it will sound paranoid – but I think we do need to be paranoid – is artificial intelligence. Perhaps AI can do better surgery than surgeons, write better poetry than poets and better novels than novelists. But what it does is make the human population almost surplus: it makes it unnecessary. One argument is that it will be the end of work and the beginning of play that people can be looked after. But people could be looked after now, as we know there’s enough surplus to do that, and it doesn’t happen.When human beings become surplus, that’s where these smart nukes and chemical and biological warfare – these things that are genocidal – begin to really worry me. Because I do see a time when the masters of the universe will decide that the universe is a better place without most of the population. Artificial intelligence is a way of becoming the perfect human being, which fascists have always thought about: the supreme human being. If you can think of that, if that is your goal, then certainly you can think of the other. I worry about it.Ali SmithAuthorI am a fan of all your writing in all its forms, but what is it that the novel makes possible for us that no other form of writing does?And there are things it can do. There’s a quote from James Baldwin in The Ministry of Utmost Happiness: “And they would not believe me precisely because they would know that what I said was true.” So if you were to take out the political milestones in this book and just do nonfiction about them, they would not be what they are. Only a novel can tell you how caste, communalisation, sexism, love, music, poetry, the rise of the right all combine in a society. And the depths in which they combine. We have been trained to “silo-ise”: our brains specialise in one thing. But the radical understanding is if you can understand it all, and I think only a novel can.Shelley McNamara and Yvonne Farrell Directors of Grafton ArchitectsYou have said that literature is not about issues, that it is about the world, about everybody, that literature is a monumental, profound, beautiful and complicated thing. Would you apply the same values in your contemplation of architecture?Yes, of course. I’m a student of architecture, and if I had to choose a profession again I would choose architecture, because I do believe it’s about everything. One of the people who made me want to become an architect was Laurie Baker he was British but had lived in India all his life. He used to do what was called no-cost architecture, where you pay a lot of attention to material and where it came from: he was so against the idea of his buildings living for ever. I learned from him that beautiful architecture is not directly proportional to how much it costs or how much money you put into it. So for me, it’s a very fundamental and beautiful art, certainly extremely profound in terms of how you should be thinking about it.With regards to your fiction, would you be able to describe the balance between research, autobiography and imagined worlds? How important is it to you?James CorcutI don’t do research. What generally happens is I begin to get curious about something for no reason and then I just find it impossible to contain and I’ve written nonfiction. But especially in the novel, these things just settle in you and you become like a sedimentary rock. The characters come by and it’s almost like you’re walking down the street and someone catches your eye and you meet them again and then you become friends. It’s a bit like that. One of the ways in which I write, especially when I write fiction, is just that I wait. And something just comes knocking at your door. You have to be open to it. You have to allow it in, more than pursue it.I’m very much part of those worlds that I describe. So sometimes it might be really autobiographical and I don’t know. When you’re open to allowing these characters in, everything is autobiographical, no? Esthappen in The God of Small Things says: “If in a dream you’ve eaten fish, does it mean you’ve eaten fish?” For me, those worlds are all very osmotic: experience, autobiography, imagination, understanding. And that’s why it all needs to mix and settle and it’s not segmented.My friends and I often debate “the best Bookers”. Mine happen to be, in no particular order: Disgrace, The God of Small Things and Midnight’s Children. I’d like to think that you, too, have these “pub conversations” – so, what’s your favourite Booker novel, and why?Viren Mistry I don’t have these conversations, because I don’t feel like thinking about books in this way. Books are unique and so I don’t think of them hierarchically. I understand that people need to give prizes, but it’s so particular to you and I don’t even think of “Booker books” to begin with.You have been fiercely expressing your disagreements with the state, irrespective of political parties in office. Have you ever wished to go into electoral politics? If yes, why haven’t you yet? If no, why?Anand AaniNo. It’s such an important place and time in which to be a writer, where you’re not burdened by the idea of soliciting people’s support. Where often it’s so important to stand alone, to be a person who expresses themselves very clearly on certain things. So I can only see it as a great defeat if I really wanted to come into politics or stand for elections or ask people to like me or vote for me. It’s just not in my DNA to do that. I cannot even conceive of becoming a person who needed to change something about the way they were dressing or thinking or speaking to get someone to vote for me. To suddenly start going to a temple and pretending I’m really religious because I want to win the Hindu vote, I can’t do it! I’d be terrible at it!You once said: ‘Each time I write an essay I get into so much trouble I promise never to do it again.’ What was the last essay you wrote and did you get into any trouble?Cate LoboWell, the last essay I wrote was actually about the trouble, it was called My Seditious Heart. But previous to that, I wrote a piece called Professor, POW about GN Saibaba. He is a professor of literature, paralysed in his lower body, and he was thrown in prison and sentenced to life for… I don’t know what all the reasons are, but he’s accused of being a Maoist and working against the state. He’s still in prison now and is in a bad state.I’ve known him for a long time and when I wrote Professor, POW I was charged with criminal contempt of court. I have a long history of contempt of court, being accused of contempt of court – I’ve also gone to prison for it. So I had to appeal to the supreme court to quash it, which they have not done, but they have put it in cold storage. It’s so tiring, but it’s OK for me. Because of the work I do, I have lawyers who are friends. I have the money to fly to the other city where the appeal is being heard and hire a hotel and stay there. But let’s say you’re a young journalist or a young writer who doesn’t have that – what do you do? You’re finished! So the idea is: “Let’s make this an example, let’s break up the stride, then the mobs will come there and will shout at you.” It just goes on and on.How do you write the parts that make us cry? And do you cry when you read them back?Brendan RossWriting and crying are things that people do differently. For me, I’m always writing: when I’m walking, when I’m shopping, when I’m thinking. There’s a processing that’s going on – and the heartbreak is close to the surface all the time. But there’s a difference between the retelling of a tragedy and when you sometimes don’t actually tell it, but what it reflects is even more tragic. So often when I think about things, yes, I do cry, but I shift between laughter and tears and anger. That’s what I meant about never stopping to be a child: you have to always be in touch with those feelings.What female writers have inspired and influenced you?Sofía GuerreroIt seems that The Ministry of Utmost Happiness suggests it’s possible to live in a world that is carved out of, yet also away from, the degradations of a class- and caste-ridden (also ableist, homophobic etc) society. Is such a world possible only in novels, or do you think it’s possible in real life?Alpana SharmaI don’t think that The Ministry of Utmost Happiness should be viewed as a manifesto, that it’s proposing an alternative way of living. It’s a story about certain particular and unique people who find their way in a unique way. By having these people, you are shining a light on what society is really like and the fact that you can’t ignore caste and gender and all of that. It’s really about that.What moments in your life give you solace?Sylvie MillardThe moment when I just put my cheek on my dog’s tummy. I have two of them, and one has a considerable tummy, but the other is slightly more delicate. Both of them used to be strays. I found them. One of them, her mother was killed by a car on the road outside my house. Her eyes were closed and she was so small and I had to feed her with a dropper and now she’s huge. The other one I stole. I’d see her tied to a lamppost night and day on this road, and I just took her. Later, I told the people that I’d taken her, and they said: “OK, we didn’t want her.”• Arundhati Roy’s The Ministry of Utmost Happiness is published in paperback by Penguin (£8.99).

In case you’d forgotten, no one knows me but me. So look me in the eyes and say it. You can’t, can you? Very few people can look in the eyes of a killer. A killer and a leader. That’s me. So yes, I have killed. More people than I could possibly name. I’ll never forget the first one. In Afghan. A Taliban rushing towards me with an AK-47. I had a choice. I chose to kill. Two gentle squeezes on the trigger. Two shots through the mouth. His head exploded. I felt nothing. It was easy. Job done. A job I’d do again. And again. You don’t know me. Only I know me.My childhood. My father died when I was young. The next day, my mother had taken down all his photos and married someone else. That’s all you need to know. You don’t know me. Only I know me. My stepfather was a hard bastard. When I was having a tough time in school, he told me to hit the bully. So I broke his jaw. It felt good. The bully didn’t bother me again.Don’t let anyone else define who you are. When I first joined the army, I felt I had to be part of the alpha male culture. But I didn’t. I could be just me. You need to be you. Don’t try to be me. No one but me can be me. But you can be you. Look inside yourself and get to know who the real you is. And then be that person. The best version of you. Even if the real you is basically a bit shit, it’s better than not being you.Basic training was hard. But I made it. Because I wanted to be the best me. Sometimes you have to learn that being the best you is being the second best you. I learned the hard way that the army doesn’t want people who always come first. Otherwise there would be only one person in the army. And there wouldn’t be enough men to deploy in Afghan. The army needs people who can come second, third, fourth and last. Know yourself and be that person. Leaders understand that.After a while, I realised 9 Para wasn’t for me. There was too much macho shit in the regiment. The reality was they weren’t nearly as hard as they thought they were. That’s because they didn’t know themselves. Like you don’t know yourself. I know myself. I know my demons. We all have demons. You may not think you have demons. But I can guarantee you do. And your demons have to be confronted.My demons took me to some dark places. My first marriage failed. I drank too much. I went to prison. Though technically it wasn’t my fault. All I was trying to do was break up a fight by assaulting a police officer. But I took the rap and did the time. Because that is how you confront your demons. In prison, one of the inmates tried to push me around on the first day. I grabbed him by the throat. “Don’t fuck with my demons,” I said. “Or else my demons will fuck with you.” He backed off and no one bothered me again. I joined the police for a bit. But they were pussies. And I got kicked out. So I joined the Royal Marines. The training was tough. Brutal. But I survived. Because I knew my demons. I got my demons to work for me rather than against me. That’s what leaders do. On a 60-mile trek with a 200kg bergen on my back. I felt my ankle break. Some might have given up. I broke my other ankle to even up the pain. And carried on. I never give in to my demons.Afghan was hard. I was lead man in an area where there was a 5050 chance of one of my squad getting killed. My mission was to make sure none of my men died. “The only people who get killed in Afghan are those who don’t know their demons,” I said. I saw that one of my blokes was shitting himself. I asked him what he thought we were doing here. “Killing the cunts,” he yelled. I knew then he was going to be OK.At some point I got married again. This time it was for food. Because there were three people in the marriage. Me, Emilie and my demons. I also trained for the Special Boat Service. But that’s something for me and my demons. Since leaving the SBS, I’ve done a lot of TV work. Helping people confront their demons. Helping people to be the real them by sailing across the Pacific in a shit boat. We did that. Now they are the real them. Not the real you. Because only you can be the real you."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/53433565431e8cbc69098041a5c7961f54b15607/50_414_801_480/master/801.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=539b205d4aacd3e2a8ff0864d07a0258","title":"facebook news publishers accuracy","story":"Two new surveys suggest the public still value traditional news publishersWhen you try to imagine a media diet consisting only of retweets, random blogs or the Facebook posts of family and friends, you grasp the value of journalism created by professional media organisations. Traditional news organisations aren’t perfect, but they are not fake. Nor are they as readily manipulated as we know social media can be. Professional journalism’s longstanding skills of access to sources, verification, presentation and dependable distribution remain an essential element of what nourishes democratic societies.That insight, sharply conveyed in images accompanying this column, informs a new campaign to promote the well-regarded Columbia Journalism Review (CJR), a not-for-profit magazine based at the graduate school of journalism at Columbia University, New York. The campaign’s assertion of the importance to a healthy democracy of the public sphere – alongside the private, of course – coincides with two new reports that, in different ways, affirm the same. However, the emerging picture is not clear yet.Looking beyond the US, the 2018 digital news report of the UK-based Reuters Institute for the study of journalism tends to support the notion that the public understands that “real journalism matters”, although the authors’ optimism is cautious. Reliance on Facebook for news is falling, they report, and willingness to pay for professionally produced journalism seems to be increasing. But a majority prefer “side-door access” to news through search and social media, rather than going direct to the traditional news publishers. Use of messaging apps is rising “as news consumers look for more private (and less confrontational) spaces to communicate”, the report says.This rich piece of research, an international collaboration that surveyed online 74,000 news consumers in 37 countries, contains more than this column can convey. I hope to return to it. For now, four morsels quoted directly from the authors’ overview and key findings:• For the first time we have measured news literacy. Those with higher levels of news literacy tend to prefer newspapers brands over TV, and use social media for news very differently from the wider population. They are also more cautious about interventions by governments to deal with misinformation.• With Facebook looking to incorporate survey-driven brand trust scores into its algorithms, we reveal in this report the most and least trusted brands in 37 countries based on similar methodologies. We find that brands with a broadcasting background and long heritage tend to be trusted most, with popular newspapers and digital-born brands trusted least• Paul Chadwick is the ’s readers’ editor"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/74761e593558770a62f1f1a87871d1cac82ad172/254_712_4792_2875/master/4792.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fadcc1edbae8880390cb842bdbfe4b58","title":"the guardian view on books for all libraries give us power","story":"There is something unique and uniquely valuable about the institution of a public library. Libraries in themselves are one of the foundations of civilisation. They enable the conversation between the living and the dead, which keeps a culture alive. We hear the voices of past authors and read back into their texts our own preoccupations and others, when we’re dead, will hold their own discussions about the books that have resulted. But for most of history a library was a private possession. Culture, in that deep sense, was cut off from every family who had no books of its own or very few. The public library, one of the Victorian age’s great social inventions, changed that. Poverty or even narrowness of parental taste could no longer imprison the curiosity of children. Anyone could read almost anything. It was their right.This vision still is kept alive in some countries, but is being choked in Britain. Public libraries have been remorselessly attacked as public finances shrink. They have lost books, staff, opening hours and whole branches. More than 400 libraries and a further 140-plus mobile libraries have been closed. The pragmatic justification is that local authorities no longer have the money to do anything right, and that social care or housing must be higher priorities. Others say that the internet has abolished much of the need for libraries. But it hasn’t. If anything, it has made them – and librarians – even more useful than before. There must be millions baffled by the challenges of the online world and the demand to interact with the authorities through a screen others understand how to navigate this realm, but cannot afford to do so. Even those with digital savvy and the money for their own books gain from communal life. All these need public libraries, and they need librarians.Private libraries can supply all of the knowledge that public ones ever could – but only to their members. They say that literacy is for the privileged few. Even when we move beyond the written word, as to some extent libraries should, there is much that only a public library, properly staffed, can do. It is not just a gateway to another world. It is, at its best, a welcoming committee and a guide to the uncharted territories of the intellect. As Neil Gaiman remarked, Google can bring you 100,000 answers to a question, but a librarian can give you the right one.The Irish government now proposes to extend the opening hours of 200 libraries across the country, from 8am to 10pm, seven days a week. Its ambition to double visitors within five years, instead of treating a decline in users as inevitable, is a striking and welcome contrast with the approach in Britain. But the extra hours are to be unstaffed. The libraries in that time will work only for people who already know how to work them. This is much better than nothing, but it is still a failure to grasp all that public libraries can do for their communities. Libraries are made by librarians, not by the contents of their catalogues, and\u0026nbspthe people who make them are not just public goods but public treasures."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/efbe32adfef67c83a46f7b434976fe7e44eab8c7/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=59254393d1c0634d0167c3b8581613da","title":"the guardian view on yemen our complicity lies bare","story":"So they are doing it. They are conducting this war with British-, American- and French-made arms. They are conducting it with western military training and advice British and US officers have been in the command room for airstrikes, and this weekend Le Figaro alleged that there are French special forces on the ground in Yemen. They are conducting it with diplomatic shelter from the west. On Friday, the UK and US blocked a Swedish drive for a UN security council statement demanding a ceasefire: “Britain, as the ‘penholder’ on Yemen at the UN security council, nevertheless takes a nakedly pro-Saudi approach to the conflict,” the former international development secretary Andrew Mitchell notes. Arms\u0026nbspsales and security interests dictate.The war has already claimed tens of thousands of lives, the oft-cited toll of 10,000 being highly conservative when reached and now hopelessly out of date. Many more stand in peril. International law obliges the rapid and unimpeded passage of humanitarian aid, but both the coalition and the Houthi rebels have an atrocious record on observing the rules of war. Relief groups have had to flee Hodeidah. Twenty-two million Yemenis need aid. Eight million are at risk of starvation.The assault appears to be an attempt to pre-empt the presentation of a peace plan by the UN envoy Martin Griffiths, who had previously warned that an attack on Hodeidah could “take peace off the table in a single stroke”. He is due to brief the security council on Monday, following emergency talks, and the UN’s humanitarian coordinator, Lise Grande, has said that talks on the UN taking over the port’s administration are at an advanced stage. But even if Mr Griffiths can manage an agreement against the odds, the chances of it sticking are poor, given both sides’ record of acting in bad faith. The complexities of a handover are immense.The coalition backs the internationally recognised president, Abd Rabbu Mansour Hadi, driven out by the Iran-backed Houthis. But the campaign appears largely driven by two forces. First, rivalry with Iran, and other strategic interests. Second, the prestige of its leaders – notably Mohammed bin Salman, who led the charge to war and is now Saudi Arabia’s de facto leader. The coalition has calculated that after a lengthy stalemate it may be in its best position since the war began more than three years ago it hopes to change the facts on the ground and appears to have convinced itself that Hodeidah will be a relatively easy win, if far from painless for civilians. This is familiar stuff, as an International Crisis Group report pointed out this week: “The warring factions are overconfident in their military prospects, almost always press for military advantage when there is an opportunity for negotiation, and are all too often starkly indifferent to the humanitarian impact of their actions and the plight of ordinary citizens.”Riyadh and Abu Dhabi may be of one mind in their loathing for Tehran, but the crowded and increasingly complex field is exposing ergence in their interests. A few months ago, Emirati-backed forces were fighting and killing Saudi-backed forces in Aden. The south is moving towards outright autonomy. But which Saudi and Emirati officials will dare to tell their superiors that Tehran enmeshed them in a costly, apparently endless war at relatively little cost to itself? The entrenchment of a war economy is another significant obstacle to peace.So it goes on, the suffering mounting, further unsettling this unstable region and breeding cynicism and rage towards the west and its talk of human rights and international law. If the complicity ever looked deniable, events of recent days have laid it bare."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1c1d9174ca860658b1bcf7f63ba70d3e7a06fb67/0_182_4855_2914/master/4855.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3cdd5321dc0c3a986e14f58275f0f897","title":"andrew scott interview sea wall sherlock hamlet king lear shakespeare","story":"Andrew Scott, 41, was born and raised in Dublin. Recently seen in the BBC adaptation of King Lear, he is best known for playing Moriarty in Sherlock, and for starring in Robert Icke’s production of Hamlet, which transferred from the Almeida to the West End last year. In 2008, Simon Stephens wrote Sea Wall – a monologue about grief – for Scott it is being revived as part of the Old Vic’s bicentenary celebrations.How is it performing Sea Wall alone on stage?This one I love. I did it at Edinburgh,\u0026nbspand you could actually see the audience. There isn’t any separation, and the house lights are usually half-up.The play gets to some big questions pretty quickly – such as, do you need God when terrible things happen?The idea of goodness, morality and kindness, and that you can possess those qualities without an organised faith… I think a lot of people of my generation feel that. People want to be kind and good, and have a sense of community, all that the church used to bring.You were brought up as a Catholic. Does it still hold anything for you?No, it doesn’t. I hid away from it before, but now I feel like I actively reject my upbringing. Not in an angry way – I don’t feel angry any more. A lot of family and friends do still believe, and you’ve got to exist with that. But over the past five years I’ve been really interested in the idea of spirituality and mindfulness – just being here. I do find it troubling, being on a train and looking round and everyone is on their phones. We can be addicted to not being here, to always being somewhere else. Having all this information is so new you realise, God, I actually can’t sit still. Just to be there and not to be looking for a little high all the time… That will define our age.How was playing Hamlet?It was extraordinary. I’m still absorbing it. After I finished, two weeks later I did King Lear: I had a Shakes-year, boom-boom. But it’s the stamina. Sometimes I thought I can’t do it – three hours and 50 minutes, twice on a Wednesday and Saturday. And it’s not light material you have to go to a dark place.What was your way into that part?I really wanted it to be engaging for people who’d never seen it before. Rob Icke and I wanted it to be a play that would ignite our 14-year-old selves. And the big thing was to try to speak the language in as conversational a way as possible. To attack the play for what it is rather than what you think it is – because it’s so famous. I do think it is the greatest play ever\u0026nbspwritten.It might be the greatest play ever written – but do we do it too often?There are a lot on! You have to have a really sound idea – you can’t just barge in. There has to be a real reason behind it. I felt very proud of our production: 28,000 young people came to it. Something like half of the audience in the West End\u0026nbsphad never been to the theatre\u0026nbspbefore. And that’s an achievement.A first bad experience of Shakespeare can kill it for you, whereas a good one can set you up for life…I always think of it like rap music – there’s the rhythm of the thing, and even if you don’t get every word, it’s electrifying. I just hate the idea of Shakespeare being put in a glass box, like something that’s dead.You played Hamlet hot on the heels of Sherlock co-star Benedict Cumberbatch. Was there rivalry?There was no rivalry. It has to be your own thing, you have to bring who you are to it – so it shouldn’t be similar.Hamlet may be the best part – but what’s the worst part you’ve ever\u0026nbsphad?I played a Christmas bauble at the Royal Court. It was at this international festival, which are cool things – but I couldn’t do anything playing a Christmas bauble. I didn’t\u0026nbspeven get a costume, I just had to mime!Did you like Shakespeare at school? I loved Shakespeare as a kid. We used to have these drama competitions in Dublin, in deserted atmosphere-less school halls, with nervous mums and some priest slowly pulling a curtain open: “Competitor number three, an extract from Romeo and Juliet.” I got\u0026nbspto play, when I was 14, Richard III, Shylock, King John…How big an impact did Sherlock have on your career?Well, I’d worked a lot before it, but it definitely opened doors for all of us. I’m grateful to have been in it.You almost studied art. Is it still an interest?Yes, it’s still a big passion of mine. I’ve been getting into linoprinting recently. It feels like magic to me.Which artists’ work do you enjoy?I live near Tate Modern and sometimes, when it’s late opening, I go in when I’ve had a hard day, and just walk around. As much for the particular quiet as the art. David\u0026nbspHockney is my all-time favourite artist.Did you go home to Ireland for the abortion referendum recently?Unfortunately I couldn’t, because I was working. And I was really scared. But oh my God, what a day. Another great day – because we had the marriage referendum a couple of years ago which was just so thrilling. It was a great day not just for women, but for humanity.

I also really love the Tramshed Bar \u0026amp Kitchen – they’ve got a brilliant Asian menu, or you could just pop into the bar for a drink or two.Speaking of drinks, in the evening, Takk bar on Queens Road, Heeley, right on the edge of Sheffield city centre, is a great place for a dance and a cocktail in a fairy lit garden. You’ll find it in Hagglers Corner, a creative courtyard community of artists and independent makers, which doubles as an arts venue. If pubs are more your thing, the Brothers Arms and the Sheaf View are both nearby and have a reputation for top quality real ale.If you’re after a gig, try the Audacious Art Experiment, the eponymous venue of the local record label, on Harwood Street. Alternatively, head back to Abbeydale Road and check out Picture House Social, for an eclectic line-up of music events, with great cocktails, craft beer, Italian-inspired street food and a games room, too. I’m a big fan of small, independent venues with creative programming as they’re vital to a healthy music industry – both are destinations for the in-the-know crowd and have some great shows on.Day two – coffee, cake and creative curationThe second day is when you’ll find out what the city centre has to offer, plus a visit to Kelham Island, a riverside area that was once the central hub of Sheffield’s industry, and one of the oldest sites of its kind in the city.Start your day with a good coffee. There are so many great places to choose from, depending on where you are based. Tamper is a New Zealand coffee place with an industrial feel – its main outpost is housed in a 19th-century former silversmith workshop on Arundel Street. On the same street is the Holt, a true hidden gem of a coffee place, while tucked away on Aberdeen Court is Steam Yard, with a cosy feel and amazing cakes.Spend the rest of your morning checking out some of the best shops the city has to offer – in particular stroll along Division Street and the surrounding roads. Syd and Mallory sells the best handmade clothing and reworked fashion. La Biblioteka is a great little bookshop stocking a massive range of magazines and books from independent publishers, plus stationery. When I’m looking for good music, I often discover something new and fresh at Bear Tree Records – a lovely shop that sells both new and secondhand vinyl.While you wander, keep your eyes peeled. Sheffield is full of great street art, sculpture, graffiti and wall murals by local artists such as Jo Peel, Faunagraphic, Phlegm and more. Street Art Sheffield lists many of the sites if you’d like to plan ahead. One of my favourite sculptures is the Women of Steel by Martin Jennings outside City Hall. It commemorates the women who worked in the city’s steel industry during the first and second world wars.After a morning stroll, stop for lunch at Dina Diner, a vegetarian and vegan cafe attached to a music, comedy, poetry and theatre venue that is a social enterprise and platform for emerging artists. Dina is an example of what I like about most of Sheffield’s creative spaces: the really thoughtful curation. Similarly, Gloam Gallery is another great space dedicated to creativity. Gloam’s Instagram is exciting and exhibitions here are fresh and unusual. In September, the Site Gallery will also be re-opening – another great creative space to check out.For dinner head to Kelham Island and the cosy, neighbourhood restaurant Stew and Oyster. Later in the evening, check out the Delicious Clam – a record label and an unmissable DIY venue where you’re guaranteed to hear something interesting and underground. A lot of bands start out there and it’s worth catching a show if you can. Something entirely different is Public, a recently-opened cocktail bar in a converted old public toilet – it’s another small venue, and really worth it.Last but not least, be sure to check out what is one of the best railway station pubs in the country – the Sheffield Tap, a place where my husband and I love to sit and watch the world go by. Located within the old first-class waiting room, this pub is also a microbrewery and has a great selection of craft beers. Enjoy and don’t worry if you miss your train home as Sheffield has more than enough to offer for further adventures. Alternatively, you could just do what I did and move here!Stay in the heart of the action, and let Sheffield’s creative spirit inspire you, by checking out homes on Airbnb"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b6ebccc3eb3fe63b9497db436ae7f456d9745e73/0_446_5337_3203/master/5337.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4ffecd280d7e1941fb08af610ccc76bf","title":"sea and be seen the insiders guide to margate","story":"Jimi Famurewa meets Margate’s most in-the-know locals and sizes up Kent’s Copenhagen-like capital of cool, where you can go to a major art gallery, swim in a scenic tidal pool, dine on Nordic cuisine and shop for designer homeware – without the flightIn lieu of a permanent move, more and more weekend visitors are taking advantage of Margate’s recent influx of acclaimed new restaurants, chic cafes, superior homeware stores, on-trend boutiques and more. In fact, with its fixie bikes, cobbled streets, Noma-ish foraged cuisine and design-first ethos, it almost feels like a pocket of Copenhagen that just happens to be a 90-minute train ride from London. Throw in the refurbished 1920s theme park Dreamland and it all adds up to an irresistible artist’s enclave for a weekend city. Armed with effusive recommendations from my Airbnb host Clare – a trend-forecaster and trainee florist ­– I set about experiencing the best of the Kentish coast’s new capital of cool. Here’s my guide to getting the best out of a trip to this unique seaside town.Follow the foodie trailThe seafront chippies are still drawing crowds (and e-bombing seagulls) but in recent years, Margate’s culinary scene has evolved. Open since 2015, Hantverk \u0026amp Found is a seafood cafe and gallery that exemplifies that uptick in quality, whether you’re after a big last-night-of-the-trip dinner or a casual lunch slurping local rock oysters spiked with yuzu (a citrus fruit) in the suntrap garden. The food is unfussy and brightly flavoured – think clams in a spicy Korean broth and bream with a heady brown shrimp butter. The dinky emerald-tiled room adds a lively, squashed-in thrum to proceedings.For a legendary cheese toastie, and great rooftop views for sunset, head to Cheesy Tiger on the jutting Harbour Arm, my Airbnb host advises. There’s also friendly little Fez bar, a quirky, eclectic boozer close by. Or for an array of beachfront eating and drinking options, then the The Bus Cafe – with its crammed and zingy salad wraps – and the adjacent Sun Deck, are the places to head to. “There’s a really good juice bar, Po’ Boy that does great Creole-style food, and a cool tiki bar,” says Ed Warren, local and co-founder of Cliffs record shop and cafe.Sound out local musicThere aren’t many cafes where you can watch an experimental radio show broadcasting to the world and have a flat white made by a double Mercury Music prize-winning nominee. A labour of love for musician Obara Ejimiwe (aka Ghostpoet) and his creative director wife Kate, Radio Margate is a hybrid coffee shop, late-night venue and internet radio station launched in 2017 following their move from London. This sea-view space – all calming jazz and tasteful mid-century furniture – is, according to the Ejimiwes, a direct result of Margate’s contagious creative energy. “It’s totally infectious and there’s more room here to develop strong, independent ideas,” Obara says.Housed in a lovingly restored former 1920s tearoom in Cliftonville, Cliffs is a record shop that also encompasses a fitness studio, coffee roastery, hair salon, gig venue and an exceptional cafe (try the harissa oil and avocado toast). “I just wanted to sell Motown records but we got caught up in it all, like a lot of people here do,” says owner Ed Warren, explaining how he and his interior designer partner Kier Muddiman found themselves presiding over this artfully-distressed cultural fiefdom. “All these interesting little places in Margate are from the heart, basically.”Hit refreshWalpole Bay tidal pool is a must for lovers of outdoor swimming. It is the UK’s largest saltwater bathing pool, covering 4 acres (1.6 hectares), and was built in 1937. A group of locals swear by a regular swim in this beautiful coastal location, which fills up at high tide each day. “The first time I jumped in I squealed with excitement as the cold water engulfed me,” says Kathryn Ferguson, Margate resident and director of Taking the Waters, a short film about the pool. “But it felt exhilarating and from that moment I was totally hooked. A full moon swim is something I’d recommend everyone to try once.”Sticking with the theme of wellness, it’s worth stopping by natural fragrance and skincare company Haeckels to pick up a few restorative products to take home. One of the town’s most famous success stories, it was founded by Dom Bridges, a former film director who turned a hobby making soap from foraged Margate seaweed into a brand stocked in Harvey Nichols. Still, little can prepare you for the surprise of its flagship laboratory, shop and sea-based thalassotherapy spa, high up on a blustery Cliftonville parade. “It’s an example of the fact that each business has an amazing story of its own,” says Shelly Keeys, owner of shrewdly curated local fashion store Ruskin.Shop independent art and designThose that know their parlour palms from their succulents will feel at home in the jungle interior of Mar Mar, a cafe, gift shop and houseplant emporium on Northdown Road. Bolstering the town’s roster of design boutiques (homewares store Môr is worth a look too), it grew from Central St Martins graduate Boe Holder’s bold, Memphis Group-influenced creations. “She used to do pot painting and sell these great plant pots online,” says Margate-based photographer Harriet Bentley. “Now they’re selling plants, coffee, magazines and other great little things. It’s so cool.”Other interiors shops worth seeking out include: Clayspace Studios, a social enterprise and ceramics store Danish Collectables for curated Scandinavian vintage pieces Papillon Interiors for vibrant indoor and outdoor furniture and Imagineican Store, a tiny design and lifestyle studio. If you hire a bike during your trip, Westgate-on-sea is about a 15-minute cycle from Margate’s seafront, and is home to Eighty Two Westgate.Of course, one of the biggest draws in town for art is the Turner Contemporary, which opened in 2011 and sowed the first seeds for the current regenerative flowering. Smaller venues, such as Pie Factory in the Old Town, also a studio complex and, yes, former pie shop, are increasingly offering a platform to Margate’s thriving ecosystem of emerging visual artists and Turner-exhibited stars of tomorrow. “There’s such a strong creative network here,” notes Dan Chilcott, co-founder of nearby Resort Studios, who put together a June show at the Pie Factory. “As an artist, it’s right where you want to be.”Jimi Famurewa is a London-based freelance writer and editor.

This was not a performance to dispel doubts over Serbia’s ability to fully harness their array of talent but the deciding goal should be taken for what it was: a strike worthy of winning any match on this exalted stage and one that, given the taker’s identity, came as no huge surprise.There are few players who can hit a dead ball with the whip and accuracy of Kolarov and the latest example, which left Keylor Navas grasping at thin air 11 minutes into the second half, has given Serbia a fighting chance of improving their woeful record in this competition.Until Kolarov’s intervention Serbia had looked like a side falling into bad old habits. Their first-half showing had, bar a series of flourishes from the gifted Sergej Milinkovic-Savic, largely been tepid but they shifted through the gears after the interval.Kolarov was given his chance after Francisco Calvo, the otherwise impressive Costa Rica left wing-back, grappled illegally with Aleksandar Mitrovic. The position, 25 yards out and angled a little to the right of centre, was to the Roma player what the penalty spot might be to others he duly sent the ball up, down and into the one spot Navas could not reach and it was as if a lead weight had been removed from Serbian shoulders.“Frankly speaking there was a great deal of pressure on the players,” their manager, Mladen Krstajic, said. “I felt some pressure, too. But I’m very happy and proud of them for their team effort.”The tension was understandable: including games under the banner of Serbia \u0026amp Montenegro in 2006, Serbia had lost five of their previous six World Cup assignments. They began as if paralysed and should have been behind within 12 minutes. A lively start from Costa Rica had already brought a couple of half-chances when their centre-back Giancarlo González found himself free in front of the posts after a well-worked short corner. All González had to do was nod David Guzmán’s floated delivery back past Vladimir Stojkovic but his bearings went awry and, perhaps appropriately in a city that proudly wears its status as the vanguard of the Soviet space industry, sent the ball into orbit.“I get the impression that in the first 20 or 25 minutes we were very close to achieving something,” the Costa Rica manager, Óscar Ramírez, said. In his post-match press conference Ramírez was taken to task by his country’s media for, apparently, setting up too negatively. The charge is not a new one but this time it seemed harsh: they committed men forward in decent numbers when possible but were bereft of genuine creativity, a fact that became starkly evident when their pursuit of a late equaliser degenerated into a series of balls tossed aimlessly into the Serbia box.What Costa Rica really lacked was someone who could break the lines like Milinkovic-Savic, an outstanding player whose ability to emerge with the ball from seemingly lost causes prompted several double takes. As he grew into the game so did Serbia, and moments before Kolarov settled the issue he played in Mitrovic with a perfectly weighted through pass only for the forward to shoot too close to Navas. There is, presumably, more to come from a playmaker who was only winning his fifth cap and is still bedding in. Serbia looked capable of enjoying themselves when spaces opened up, Filip Kostic missing one gilt-edged chance after a fine move, but they will need to be more efficient when they face Switzerland in a match that will probably decide both teams’ group stage fortunes.“For the first time in a long time there are no clans or cliques in the squad,” Krstajic said. That, by common consent, is the difference between this Serbia side and previous generations. They were certainly quick to assist Nemanja Matic when, in the dying minutes, a minor scuffle broke out over a Costa Rica staff member’s refusal to hand him the ball. The incident was referred to VAR, as was an even later stray arm flung out by the substitute Aleksandar Prijovic. No red cards were brandished and, mercifully, Kolarov’s stroke of genius remained the abiding memory."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1cf0481a457556472b93b08c20858817e88adc7c/0_149_4044_2427/master/4044.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=63892205dbf3da7626d58ccbc0f04b61","title":"england tunisia world cup harry kane gareth southgate russia","story":"Harry Kane has vowed to showcase his talent on the world stage as he prepares to lead out England in their eagerly anticipated opening group game against Tunisia.The national captain has yet to score in a major tournament, either for the under-21s or the senior side, but intends to put memories of those toils behind him as England kick off their campaign in Russia on Monday. Kane will lead the line, with Raheem Sterling in support at the Volgograd Arena, the Spurs striker having scored six times in his five caps when wearing the armband.His seven games under Gareth Southgate have yielded eight goals, and there have been 135 in the past four seasons since he broke into the team at Spurs. “If you go back four years, I was watching the World Cup while on holiday,” Kane said. “I’d played the last six or seven games of the Premier League season under Tim Sherwood. Mauricio Pochettino came in that summer and got me fit, in better shape and more powerful, and I kicked on from there.“It’s taken a lot of hard work and determination, not least because there were players ahead of me at the time, particularly strikers. I had to work hard on the training pitch and take the opportunities when they came. The last few years I’ve improved and now I’m here, and I can’t wait to get out there and show the world what I’ve got.“Obviously for me and the team the European Championship in 2016 didn’t go well. But, as the gaffer has made clear, this is a new squad, with new ideas and a new way of playing. We want to attack this tournament, create chances and score goals. In the friendlies leading up to coming here we did that well, with the way we played with the runners getting in behind. That’ll help me get some space and some chances.“My aim is to continue what I’m doing, and what I did towards the end of last season in the Premier League season, and go out there with confidence and play my best for the team.”Kane, 24, will be supported by his Spurs team-mate Dele Alli and Jesse Lingard from midfield, with the Tunisia manager, Nabil Maâloul, having made clear his concern over the supply line to England’s captain. The Tottenham forward has watched Cristiano Ronaldo and Diego Costa pull clear early in the race for the golden boot, a prize he has targeted, but will aim to catch up.“For sure, Ronaldo’s put me under a bit of pressure,” Kane said. “He’s a fantastic player who had a fantastic game against Spain, but, for me, it’s more about concentrating on the team. Hopefully I will score a hat-trick tomorrow and we’ll be level again. But the golden boot is not something I’ll be thinking about until much later in the tournament.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1ca4381db5c833c373123ed92a1007eaf7f665b/0_86_2840_1704/master/2840.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6e4b702804b9195f4d9aa31eaa56662d","title":"england world cup openers","story":"Goals from Stan Mortensen and Wilf Mannion helped England secure a comfortable victory over Chile in Rio, only for them to lose their next two matches against USA and Spain and head home early.The meeting with Belgium in Basel\u0026nbspended in a thrilling draw after extra time.

A 1-0 defeat in a play-off saw the Soviets gain revenge.Taking part in his fourth World Cup as manager, Walter Winterbottom saw his side go behind to Hungary after 17 minutes in Chile before Ron Flowers equalised from the spot. Flórián Albert’s winner condemned England to second place and a meeting with holders Brazil.Alf Ramsey’s “wingless wonders” gave little indication of what was to come against a disciplined Uruguay team as a drab match ended in stalemate. The Wembley crowd jeered the players off the pitch.Geoff Hurst continued where he left off four years earlier with the only goal of the game against Romania in Guadalajara. England ended up second in the group behind Brazil and were knocked out by West Germany in the next round.After a 12-year absence from the finals, Bryan Robson took just 27 seconds to open the scoring against France in Bilbao. A Robson header and a late goal from Paul Mariner rounded off a 3-1 win.In the stifling heat of Monterrey, Portugal’s Carlos Manuel inflicted England’s second defeat in an opening match. But Bobby Robson’s side had the last laugh as they went through after beating Poland.Gary Lineker put England ahead in the ninth minute in Cagliari before Kevin Sheedy rescued a point for the Republic of Ireland.

A quarter-final defeat to 10-man Brazil ensued.Carlos Gamarra’s own goal in the third minute gifted England the lead against Paraguay in Frankfurt and Eriksson’s side hung on to claim a narrow victory on their way to topping the group. This time, it was Portugal who inflicted penalty shootout agony in the last eight.Yet another quick start courtesy of Steven Gerrard’s fourth-minute goal – not seen by ITV HD viewers, who were shown an advert instead – ended in a disappointing 1-1 draw after Rob Green’s clanger allowed Clint Dempsey to equalise.Despite Daniel Sturridge cancelling out Claudio Marchisio’s opener, England’s trip to the Amazonian jungle ended in a defeat against Italy thanks to a header from Mario Balotelli.

Germany ended this 1-0 defeat by Mexico with six attacking players and three defenders on the pitch, with Manuel Neuer wandering about flapping his arms in the Mexico penalty area, while on the touchline Jogi Löw capered and wheeled, ice-white jogging shoes peddling the air in frustration.The contrast with the start was profound. In the opening 40 minutes Löw’s team had been ambushed here, the world champions run into a state of breathless trauma by a thrillingly vibrant Mexico attack.With a quartet of forward-facing players in the starting XI Germany had begun by leaving huge open spaces at the back of midfield, into which Mexico’s three-man attack poured like a green-shirted piranha swarm. This was a champion team out of kilter, stung by what was arguably an act of disrespect to their opponents, a failure to appreciate their threat and the fine planning of Carlos Osorio, and never really able to regain its balance.On a steamy summer late afternoon the Luzhniki was once again packed. It is a vast space, with a roof that almost closes in on itself capturing the air like a superheated bubble. It was filled here with the boom of Nationalmannschaft-song and the crackle of Mexico’s green-shirted support. Moscow has been crammed with sombreros since Tuesday, another arm of the vast South and Central American presence at the eastern edge of Europe.There was a hint of structural problems for Germany from the opening exchanges. With Jonas Hector ruled out, Marvin Plattenhardt of Hertha Berlin had come in to play at left-back. Otherwise this was Germany to the max, Germany +1, with Mesut Özil included despite some whispered talk to the contrary, and the old familiar champion faces all over the pitch.So often Mexico arrive at these tournaments with a compelling energy, natural-possession footballers, and with a winning mania for the shirt. Here they began like a train, with Hirving Lozano finding space in the Germany area in the opening moments from a nice little pass by Carlos Vela.With 14 minutes gone Héctor Moreno might have scored, glancing a header too close to Neuer from a free-kick.What a game this was in those early minutes. Germany were also agreeably fluid, with a fine natural width. But they also looked like a champion team short-handed heading back towards their own goal. In the event they lacked a proper midfield bolt, with Toni Kroos and Sami Khedira huffing around in pursuit of the whizzing green machine. The centre-backs looked flustered, left to deal with three on two as Mexico broke. Löw’s 4-2-3-1 seemed antiquated and creaky, with the old World Cup shark Thomas Müller flat-footed in a wide position.By contrast Vela, Javier Hernández and Lozano switched positions with a thrillingly malevolent sense of purpose. Three times the Mexican gegenpress drew a scampering counterattack, whirring in on goal only to be foiled by a scudding last-ditch tackle or a last pass just awry. Germany were there for the taking, cut open with extraordinary relish by the Mexico attack.The breakthrough duly arrived after 35 minutes, an absolute beauty of a team goal scored by Lozano. First Khedira was robbed deep in the Mexico half. Hernández sniped away from Jérôme Boateng and Mats Hummels. A flurry of skimmed passes across the wide-open spaces of the Germany defence left Lozano in space in the area. With the stadium howling for him to shoot he cut inside Özil, who had tracked back to right-back, and buried the ball past Neuer.Every World Cup brings goals and moments that feel as if they’ve been seared into the memory. This was another for the hard drive, as the Luzhniki exploded with deep green joy, necks already craned for a first replay of that wonderful driving move.Moments later Kroos drew a fine save from Guillermo Ochoa, his dipping free-kick tipped at full extension on to the bar. But as half-time arrived Mexico left the pitch to huge, rolling cheers, Germany with a look of puzzlement.Germany regeared for the second half: same shape, more control. Mexico had lost some of their vim. And before long the game had turned on its head, with Germany able to keep the ball now, Kroos hitting his range, and Mexico less adept at seizing possession, unable to spring forward with such gusto.Vela came off, exhausted. Marco Reus came on for Khedira. Özil had done not just nothing in the first half, but less than nothing, offering simply an absence, a Mesut-shaped hole. For a while he dropped deeper with more success, driving forward like a featherweight Roy Keane. Reus shot over. Timo Werner produced a snap-volley from close range that flew into the crowd.With 73 minutes gone Rafael Márquez came on to add ballast at the back, appearing in his fifth World Cup aged 39 and with alleged links to drug trafficking, which he denies, on hold for now. And so they sat deep with a thin green line of five defenders ranged across their own penalty area as the game became a Mexican stand-off, attack versus defence.Germany huffed and switched angles and went wide, slinging in crosses, and finally sending on Der Targetman, Mario Gomez, for the last 11 minutes. To no avail, as Mexico held on for a sensational win against the defending champions."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/91531a87d7f28b93954a766e945d15e004ea859f/69_399_4766_2860/master/4766.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6fa1bcd1ff61fdd023de38bfb3bdb608","title":"pananma world cup finals god ballboys","story":"“When the goal went in, I could have gone out and got so drunk I wouldn’t have remembered a thing the next day.” You and the rest of the country,\u0026nbspHernán.The Panama manager, Hernán Darío “Bolillo” Gómez, says he is a “believer” and insists he “knew” there was a way back but time was running out and so was hope. Looking across at his players he saw “a ghost” appear before them. In the final minutes of the final game last October, they found themselves outside the qualifying places – the dream of a first World Cup denied at the last, as it had been four years earlier. Drawing with Costa Rica, Panama desperately needed a goal from somewhere, anywhere.What came next was, says Édgar Carvajal, the assistant manager, “like something handed down by God”. A long ball, headed on by Luis Tejada, and there, steaming in, was Román Torres – the centre‑back, a huge, dreadlocked figure. “I still get goosebumps,” Carvajal says. The ball crashed into the net. Torres turned, whipped off his shirt, leapt the advertisement boards and raced along the running track, fans clambering on to fences, drinks thrown into the air.“We had visualised it, dreamed, longed for that moment,” says Gabriel Gómez, the country’s most capped player, gazing at the goal where the ball went in. He turns, looks the other way. “We’d been knocked out at this other end four years before and that hurt. This time it all came off: the result from Trinidad where the USA unexpectedly lost and our goal, which came just at the right moment.” Panama – yes, Panama – were going to the World Cup.Not quite. It was the 88th minute, two minutes plus stoppage time to hang on and never, ever let go. An injury-time goal had cost them the chance of going to Brazil 2014 and they could not let that happen again. Crying ballboys kicked balls into the stands, never to be returned. A\u0026nbspsubstitute leapt from the bench, ran over and booted another as far away as he could. A few more seconds spent. Then someone turned the lights out.From the office under the stand where she works, Elida de\u0026nbspMitchel appeared on the pitch, walking straight past the referee, and pretended to faint. It was a policeman’s idea. Anything to stop the game, run down the clock. Three minutes she was there before eventually Gabriel Gómez and the substitute goalkeeper José Calderón “helped” her off, asking what was happening in the other game as they went. The USA were still losing, she said. “Sure?” “Yes, you’re in the World Cup!” When the whistle at last went Bollillo slipped to his knees, gripping a ball. As he and Torres rolled round together the goalscorer shouted: “You deserve this!”One of the photos Bolillo is fondest of shows Torres embracing a fan who is on the track, not in the stands as he should be. A policeman arrives and hugs both. Beyond the Rommel Fernández stadium in Panama City, there was pandemonium, people flooding the streets. The players paraded on the back of a fire engine. Alcohol sold out and the party ran all night. The president declared the next day a national holiday. “The emotion, the satisfaction, the belief,” Bolillo says. “In life you can dream and dreams can come true.”On Monday they face Belgium in Sochi. “It will be emotional,” says the striker Blas Pérez, whose international career goes back 17 years. “It was always a dream and when I’m standing there listening to the anthem at the World Cup, I don’t know how I’ll react.” Felipe Baloy also began his international journey in 2001. “I’ve had a long career, lots of falls, lots of sadness this is a reward for many of us,” he says. “I feel lucky to be involved the whole country will enjoy this.”The journey had been hard. “Ooooh, very hard,” Bolillo says. There were defeats, tension, even death, the midfielder Amílcar Henríquez gunned down outside his home. After one game in Mexico there had been a fight in the dressing room, encouraged by the manager, shouting: “Go on then, hit each other! Do it!” “Cathartic,” he calls it.The Colombian, who had taken his country and Ecuador to the World Cup, arrived on a mission to do the same with Panama. Only two squad members play in Panama but only five are in Europe – two in Belgium, plus Romania, Slovakia and Spain – and while the rest play in the Americas that does not include Brazil, Argentina or Uruguay. Torres plays for Seattle Sounders. Traditionally, baseball and boxing are bigger than football, although that is changing.“We worked in central America and had seen Panama,” Carvajal says. “We always thought: ‘This team has to go to the World Cup,’ but it’s difficult football is underdeveloped here. Bolillo is perfect for groups like this, giving them the professionalism they lack. Physically, Panamanian players are very good and have belief: they see Germany and think they can take them on mano a mano but we had to develop other aspects. This is the Profe’s fifth World Cup he had a lot to teach them.”“The principal thing is not the pitch it’s how you live,” Bolillo says. “You have to build good people, a family. When I arrived there were countless off-field problems. It’s more important to be a good leader than a good coach, someone to say: ‘I know what this is, how this works.’”Discipline was vital, just as it had been for the previous manager, Julio Dely Valdés. Bolillo talks about how football makes you pay for “poor living”. He says: “Last time Panama weren’t a family, they didn’t behave well and football said ‘no’. This time, ‘luck’ fell differently. Why? Because we deserved it to.”Yet while Valdés imposed discipline, Bolillo delegated, trusting in the veterans to lead. There is loyalty to them, then? “And gratitude,” he says. “I slept easy.”As the game progressed, it really was. “We were never out of the World Cup … until then,” Bollillo says. By half-time, the USA were 2-0 down but Panama trailed 1-0 to Costa Rica. “You’re doing things you haven’t done for three years,” Bolillo shouted in the dressing room. “There’s no bollocks, nothing! If you’re scared, turn out the lights, we’ll go home. No talking now, show it. Show it!”Pérez equalised soon after, scoring a goal that did not go over the line. The news from Trinidad was that the USA had pulled one back, too.“It’s inevitable you look to the bench, wondering about that score, thinking: ‘They haven’t said anything,’” Gómez says. “And we kept going forward, bravely.” They had to. A first World Cup was at stake.As they went out for the second half, Torres shouted, the expletive in English: “There are 45 fucking minutes left!” By the time he went forward for the last time, it was down to three."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b673c0f0a31778ba6041ba638e2d433788e81598/381_380_2031_1219/master/2031.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=20615ec333e4b88526e06e282ffb6dcf","title":"sir matt busby airbrushed from liverpool fc history","story":"Once the law is eventually passed to class upskirting as the criminal offence it clearly is (Upskirting bill is blocked by single Tory objection, 16 June), can the powers that be take this opportunity to give it a more appropriate name?

Their attacking play has often been untidy but they have been tactically brave and defensively excellent.78 min Neymar’s long-range curler is comfortably saved by Sommer, plunging to his right.77 min Roberto Firmino is about to come on.76 min Brazil are looking more urgentdesperate than at any stage in the match. But that isn’t always a good thing, as Fernandinho reminds us by driving high over the bar from distance.75 min Just before that penalty appeal, Dzemaili shot straight at Alisson from 20 yards after a good break by Shaqiri.74 min Nope, there’s no review and play continues. It was a risky challenge from Akanji, who had his hands around Jesus at one point it could have gone either way.73 min Jesus goes down in the box after a challenge from Akanji. The referee says no penalty but this might be reviewed.71 min Another change for Switzerland: Denis Zakaria replaces the admirable Behrami. 70 min Neymar’s fine pass finds Coutinho on the left side of the box. His first touch is lovely, a deft bit of chest control to come inside Lichtsteiner and set up a shot, but then he slashes the bouncing ball a few yards wide of the far post. That was an excellent chance. 69 min The last time Brazil failed to win their first World Cup game was in 1978. The last time they lost it was in 1934.68 min Behrami is booked for a foul on - yep - Neymar.67 min Neymar’s corner is half cleared to Willian, whose stinging 20-yard shot hits his team-mate Fernandinho. Brazil are going to make their second chance, with Renato Augusto replacing Paulinho.65 min Schar is booked for a foul on Neymar. 63 min Switzerland continue to have an even share of possession, and the second shock of the day isn’t beyond the realms. Brazil are struggling a little it doesn’t help that Neymar doesn’t look match-fit.60 min Brazil, affronted by the equaliser, have sprung into life. Casemiro wafts a shot over the bar from 25 yards. It’s his last touch, with Fernandinho coming on to replace him.58 min “Every single bar and restaurant here has the World Cup on,” says Rachel Clifton in America. “It’s quite amazing. As was the confusion in my office when the Spain-Portugal game finished at 3-3 and that was it. ‘No extra time?? What?’”57 min Coutinho has two shots blocked in the space of two seconds, then Neymar’s shot is deflected into the side netting. Neymar is limping as well, which is a concern given his recent injury problems.55 min “Brazil stopped being serious when they scored,” says Ian Copestake. “I would take Neymar off for Firmino, but then that is why I am in my pants in a hotel.”54 min On ITV, the former referee Mark Clattenburg thinks it was a foul by Zuber and that it should have been reviewed. But it wasn’t referred to the on-field referee by Team VAR.52 min The defending for that goal was less than utopian, with Zuber unmarked four yards from goal.A simpler goal will not be scored in the tournament. Shaqiri curled an inswinging corner into the six-yard box, where Zuber eased Miranda out of the way and flashed a header past Alisson. He did put hands on Miranda’s back, and Brazil are appealing for VAR, though I’m not sure it was enough for the free-kick. Yes, the goal has been given.Switzerland have equalised!50 min Seferovic’s through pass towards Dzemaili is crucially intercepted by the covering Marcelo. Brazil need to be careful because they are allowing Switzerland to have a lot of the ball.47 min Casemiro is booked for a foul on Dzemaili.47 min “This team already looks way better than Brazilian sides of recent vintage,” says Dileep Premachandran. “But they still have Paulinho and Casemiro playing where Cerezo and Falcao used to. Is it any wonder that some of us will never get over 1982? What a team that was!”Yeah, they’re comfortably the best attacking team I’ll ever see. The portfolio of goals they put together in three weeks in Spain is better than most countries have managed in their entire history.46 min Peep peep! Switzerland begin the second half.The Greatest Footballer Never to Play FootballBrazil has produced some of the greatest players of all time It also produced the greatest football never to play football: Carlos Kaiser, who earned a living as a star striker at some of Brazil’s biggest clubs for two decades – and he didn’t score a single goal. A film and a book about his extraordinary life will be released soon (I wrote the book, hence this entirely gratuitous plug), and I recommend them both. Obviously.Here’s a trailer for the film, directed by the brilliant Louis Myles. Here’s a link for the book. And here’s the Forgotten Story we did on Kaiser a year ago.Brazil lead through Philippe Coutinho’s trademark long-range curler. They look comfortable enough, even though they didn’t create much in a largely uneventful first half. See you in 10 minutes for the second half.45+2 min A decent chance for Thiago Silva, who heads Neymar’s inswinging corner over the bar at the near post. That was a really good opportunity, though not a sitter.44 min Switzerland have really dominated possession in the last 10 minutes, albeit without creating much. They are game, that’s for sure.43 min “Brazil has flirted with indulgence and conservatism,” says Billy Graboso. “Their great match winners of the past three decades have hid the fact they play ugly football. The last time they truly set the world alight was in the 2005 Confederations Cup unleashing Ronaldinho, Kaka, and Adriano. All three at their peak! The same has happened recently with Argentina who held the beautiful game’s torch from the 90s to 2006.”42 min It’s been a strange half, in that it feels like Brazil have been really impressive yet they’ve only created one clear chance.40 min Zuber’s errant shot, which would have gone out for a throw-in, flashes into the coupon of Thiago Silva. He visits the canvas but bounces straight back up and seems fine.38 min Thiago plays a backpass to Alisson, who nonchalantly flicks the ball over Dzemaili’s attempted block. That was laughably confident.37 min The biggest threat to Brazil is complacency. They are in total control of this game.35 min Apart from that early chance for Dzemaili, Switzerland have struggled to get anywhere near the Brazil area.33 min A corner on the left to Brazil. Neymar swings it to the far post, where Jesus heads back across goal from four yards. The ball beats everyone and goes all the way back to Neymar, who is offside. It looked a great chance for Jesus, though replays showed he couldn’t quite get around the ball to steer it towards goal.32 min “Neymar’s hair,” says John Ashdown. “My wife thinks it’s like Glenn Close’s in Fatal Attraction days to me it’s more like 1980s Martin Gore of Depeche Mode. Your thoughts?”I just think it’s time Paul Pogba concentrated on his football.31 min Lichtsteiner is booked for a foul on Neymar.30 min Switzerland have played pretty well, limiting Brazil to no clear chances, and they are having a lot of possession at the moment.29 min “Coutinho, Willian, Jesus, Danilo, Paulinho Bobby Firmino and Ederson on the bench - who said that South Americans couldn’t hack the English game?” says Matt Loten.If Brazil win the World Cup, I hope they make a special media for Richard Scudamore.28 min Casemiro and Schar are fine.27 min “Working in Munich for an Italian boss, I’m enjoying asking him about his World Cup viewing plans,” says Olly Bond. “I even gave him a nice wall chart for his office, which he took very well. On my way to visit colleagues in Holland where I’ll be equally tactful, crossing a very subdued Germany by train.”I’d go easy on the schadenfreude until England have played Panama.26 min Switzerland win a corner on the left. Rodriguez’s outswinger is headed away by Casemiro, who clashes heads with Schar in the process.25 min “Is there any other player in this World Cup who loves to show off his skill as much as Neymar?” says Gokul Kannan. “At times it is nauseating. He can pass, but he won’t. He has to make the other player look stupid and show the world that he can hold on to the ball. It is always a personal challenge for him.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/305bc968c6f203661396e0d5446e36f1be2ea1cf/0_233_3492_2095/master/3492.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5f77c3f8ea0097d1da6d163113dde473","title":"germany v mexico world cup 2018 live","story":"Mexico stunned the holders, handing Germany their first defeat in an opening game for the first time since 1982 thanks to a goal from Hirving LozanoIt’s time for me to wrap this up and steer you towards Rob Smyth’s coverage of Brazil v Switzerland. Will there be an upset to match the one we’ve just seen? Can the Swiss outdo Mexico’s win over Germany? Rob will have the answers. Join him. Bye!Maybe Germany shouldn’t be too pessimistic. They still reached the final in 1982, which was the last time they lost their opening game.This result sets up the possibility of Germany facing Brazil in the last 16. Oof!The holders haven’t won their opening game in four of the last five World Cups. The only ones to do so were Brazil in 2006 - they saw off Croatia thanks to a moment of inspiration from Kaka. Otherwise Germany have lost to Mexico today, Spain lost to Holland in 2014, Italy drew with Paraguay in 2010 and France lost to Senegal in 2002.Other than Mario Gomez’s late header, it’s difficult to think of many clear chances for Germany. They hit the woodwork twice and had a lot of efforts – 26 in the end – but they didn’t create enough. Mexico were pretty comfortable given the enormity of the occasion and really ought to have scored more than once. With greater composure they could have done to Germany what Holland did to Spain in 2014.On the BBC, Rio Ferdinand is tearing into Germany’s inability to counter Mexico’s counters in the first half. Joshua Kimmich is a fine player but his positioning was such a weakness in the first half and it was inevitable that Hirving Lozano punished him.“Germany remind me of France in 2002,” Niall Mullen says. “They’re actually played reasonably well. Things just haven’t fallen quite right for them.”France were dire in 2002!The Mexican celebrations were rather emotional. Can you blame them? They have pulled off one of the great World Cup upsets. They were outstanding in the first half, taking the lead through Hirving Lozano, and defended magnificently when they came under pressure. Their tactics were spot on and Germany had no answer. Mexico top Group F, although Sweden and South Korea are yet to play. They meet tomorrow.That’s it! The holders have been beaten! It’s the first shock of Russia 2018 and Germany have lost their opening game for the first time since 1982! The Mexico players are in tears. Their fans can’t believe it. The German players can’t believe it. But they got what they deserved. Mexico were splendid.90 min+3: Gomez appeals for a penalty after falling over. Behave. Germany have a corner, though. Neuer’s up. But Mexico clear. Germany continue to press but Ochoa claims an overhit cross. That should be that.90 min+2: The Mexican fans cheer as Ochoa smothers a pass from Muller before Draxler can reach it.90 min+1: It’s so frantic now. Germany are camped in Mexico’s half. The whistles from the Mexican fans are ear-splitting.90 min: Boateng shoots tamely at Ochoa from the edge of the area. There will be three added minutes. Herrera has been booked.89 min: Brandt looks to make an instant impact with an electric surge inside from the left. The ball breaks to Gomez, who tries to flick it past Ochoa. There’s no way through. Mexico clear their lines. But Brandt isn’t done yet. The ball bounces to him and he makes stunning contact with it from 25 yards. Ochao is beaten all ends up but the shot clips the outside of the right post and behind!87 min: Mulller crosses from the right. Gomez mistimes his leap and bounces a free header embarrassingly over from six yards. That is a shocking miss. 86 min: Julian Brandt replaces Timo Werner, who may well find himself on the bench when Germany play Sweden next Saturday. “Search your MBM for the word Ozil,” says Peter McMurry. “How many hits? Perhaps there’s a message there...”84 min: Germany almost release Werner but the striker’s forced wide. He retrieves it on the left and finds Kroos, whose shot doesn’t have pack enough of a punch to trouble Ochoa. Moments later Hummels sees yellow for a foul on Alvarez. The German centre-back looks resigned.83 min: The ineffective Thomas Muller earns a booking for a frustrated trip on Herrera.82 min: Gallardo storms forward and sprays a pass to Layun on the right. The midfielder batters a shot past the angle of post and bar.81 min: Jimenez wastes a three-on-two counterattack with a dreadful pass to Layun.79 min: Germany make another change, Mario Gomez replacing Marvin Plattenhardt. Mexico will face a physical test now.78 min: Layun goes on a noble, valiant run to relieve some pressure. He’s one-on-one with Hummels but he’s running out of steam as he veers to the right and shoots over from 25 yards.77 min: Kroos threads a pass into the Mexico area. The ball comes to Draxler, who earns space for a shot with a lovely dummy. Alvarez heroically throws himself in front of the ball to turn it over for a corner. That looked like it was going to be the equaliser. Not that Mexico can relax. Moments later Muller’s bursting in from the right, drawing Ochoa, but he’s denied as well. Mexico will not give this up easily.76 min: Kroos sweeps a shot wide from 18 yards. Ochoa had it covered. Germany have positional dominance but they aren’t exactly throwing the kitchen sink at Mexico.73 min: The 39-year-old Rafael Marquez replaces Guadardo and takes the armband. He’s equalled the record of captaining a country at five World Cups.71 min: Marco Reus tries to cushion a cross into the middle. Gallardo blocks it with his face and collapses. The ball comes back to Reus, who belts a volley over from a tight angle. Gallardo will need some treatment.70 min: Mexico counter for the first time in a while. Layun threads a pass through to Hernandez, who can’t really run. Therefore he decides to fall over in the area and claim a push by Hummels. Nope. Germany eventually get a free-kick.68 min: Germany take the corner shot before flinging the ball into the middle. The cross hits a Mexican head and flies to Werner, who rams an instinctive volley over the bar from 12 yards. Mexico are starting to live a little dangerously.67 min: A misjudgement from Salcedo sees a cross from the right bounce to Draxler. He controls and sees his curling shot take a deflection and dip wide. 66 min: Hirving Lozano, whose goal separates the side, is taken off for Raul Jimenez, who’ll be playing for Wolves next season.66 min: The disappointing Werner runs at Salcedo and tries to cross. The ball rebounds off the Mexico right-back, hits Werner and goes behind for a goal-kick.65 min: Boateng dinks a cross into the middle.62 min: Kroos and Reus get themselves into a muddle on the right of the Mexico area. The ball runs out for a goal-kick. The encouraging thing for Germany is that Mexico are starting to sit back, though. There’s a long way to go.60 min: Germany make their first change: Marco Reus replaces Sami Khedira."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ee89d5309c752a3882321ee92758afe31ff67ff8/0_202_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eea763daaa9273b195440c1b0964579e","title":"20 best summer wines 2018 value bargains","story":"Something dry and fresh for fish or ripe and red for a barbecue?

These are days on which I prefer to start cooking early, before the sun turns the kitchen into a furnace, and for which I need good-natured recipes that appreciate being taken from the oven and left to rest a while. I’m looking for dishes just as good served warm or even cold as they are straight from the oven.With this in mind, I did a lamb roast this week – a boned breast or two, stuffed with spinach, spring onions and feta cheese – that was as pleasing served warm as it was hot. The flavours reminded me of something I had eaten long ago, on holiday in Greece one very hot summer. The next day we carved it very, very thinly and ate it with a salad of lamb’s lettuce and green-shouldered tomatoes with a dressing of olive oil and enough white-wine vinegar to make our lips tingle.A second roast, of crisp-skinned duck and oranges, seemed all the better for being made an hour or so before we ate it. We folded the roast breast and leg meat, torn in fat chunks from its bones, through a bowl of stock-swollen couscous, then used the fat from the duck and juice from the roasted oranges as a dressing. It crossed my mind that this would be good with roast pork, too, or any meat with a generous amount of fat that can become part of the dressing.Whichever meat you choose, the result is a leisurely roast-cum-salad, which this time I folded through with a crisp tangle of sweet green pea shoots. (I could have used watercress or wild rocket crisped up in iced water.)Relaxed food for a great summer.Ask your butcher for breasts of lamb with the bones removed. It will speed up the process and save you an unnecessary half-hour of home butchery. When you add the cooked and drained peas to the roasting tin, turn them over in the pan juices from the roast – it will add much savour.Set the oven at 200Cgas mark 6. Remove the stalks from the spinach and wash the leaves thoroughly under cold running water. The leaves still wet, pile them into a deep pan over a moderate heat then cover tightly with a lid. Let the leaves cook for 2 or 3 minutes in their own steam, shaking the pan so they soften evenly. As soon as they are bright green and wilted, remove from the heat and plunge into iced water. Squeeze the leaves to remove the water, then chop them roughly and set them aside in a bowl.Roughly chop the mint leaves, then add them to the spinach, together with a generous seasoning of black pepper.Roughly chop the spring onions, then let them soften in the olive oil in a shallow pan over a medium heat. Add the spring onions to the spinach, crumble in the feta cheese in small lumps, then mix lightly.Lay the breasts of lamb flat on a work surface and spread the spinach filling over them, leaving a small rim of meat around the edges, then roll them up and secure with butcher’s string. Place the rolled breasts in a roasting tin, rub them lightly with olive oil and crumbled sea salt, then roast them for one hour. Remove them from the oven and leave them to rest, covered with foil.Cook the peas in boiling, lightly salted water for a few minutes until tender, then drain them and tip them into the tin around the lamb. Carve the lamb into thick slices and serve.I see no reason why this recipe wouldn’t work perfectly neatly with chicken, but the point of using duck is to harness all the glorious fat that assembles in the roasting tin, spiked with the juices of the warm orange.Set the oven at 200Cgas mark 6. Put the pieces of duck in a roasting tin and slash them, just deep enough to go through the skin and fat, every 3 or 4 cm. Peel and halve the shallots lengthways, then add them to the tin, together with the orange cut in half, and leave them to roast in the preheated oven for about an hour. They are ready when the skin is lightly crisp. Remove and set aside.Bring the stock to the boil. Put the couscous in a large mixing bowl then pour over the boiled stock, cover with a lid and set aside for about 15 minutes until the water has been absorbed by the grains of couscous. Squeeze the roast orange halves over the couscous. Break up the shallots and stir them into the couscous, then check the seasoning, adding salt and black pepper.Tear the duck to pieces – torn pieces look better than chopped – then fold them into the couscous. Wash and shake dry the pea shoots then toss them with the parsley and coriander leaves. Fold the herbs and shoots into the couscous and serve."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0a15915999a90cc714357e54fdc9c1c54294b6c3/220_302_5139_6420/master/5139.jpg?w=1200\u0026amp;h=630\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;crop=faces%2Centropy\u0026amp;bm=normal\u0026amp;ba=bottom%2Cleft\u0026amp;blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxOC8wMS8zMS9mYWNlYm9va19vcGluaW9ucy5wbmc\u0026amp;s=a5c429861ca66bb6cb8858a851a9bd0f","title":"this years bikinis are built for love island not center  parcs","story":"You really have to have the body of someone built for nothing but bikini wearing not to feel ridiculous in this summer’s garments, writes Eva WisemanLast weekend, I saw hell in a Topshop mirror. Hours I spent, whole ironed-out hours – time would go very slowly and then very fast and suddenly it was 5pm – in the changing rooms of a selection of high-street shops, trying on swimming costumes. I was going to Center Parcs on the Monday you see (by the time this is published I will have enjoyed a week with three generations of my partner’s family under its magical dome), and had been wearing the same bikini since I was 18. I needed something that would not slide off on a slide.So I started by strolling among the racks with my usual meditative glee at being among so many possibilities of transformation, many of them neon, and entered the changing rooms feeling good, feeling fine, feeling like a person, with a body, who might take it swimming on Monday. That feeling lasted until I stepped into the first swimsuit and yes, saw hell. A waterproof apocalypse.If I might take a moment to talk about my body? It’s a sort of meaty trunk of flesh, with everything, I thought, largely where it should be, ie 1 x belly, 2 x nipples, 2 x legs, 2 x arms, etc, the former in the middle, the latter closer to the edge. If there were a size 11, it would be that, neither obese nor emaciated, sturdy, effective, and yet, it turns out, entirely the wrong shape for a swimming costume. To begin with, the gussets. Usually there’s a selection of bottoms, from shorts to thongs, but this year, the fashion is for a very narrow chocolate eclair sort of shape that extends between the legs and up towards the belly button, requiring even the blondest of women to depilate almost an acre of flesh. So that’s the gussets.But I was prepared for that, and indeed had taken it into consideration when selecting swimsuits, leaving behind a number of costumes that, rather than offer a covering for one’s genitals, instead provided a sort of will-this-do mental floss, like a hastily erected crucifix to show where one has buried the cat. But even the kinder gussets provided only a suggestion of arse coverage, the designer perhaps having never seen a human bottom, instead having only studied medical charts about digestion.I’ve always enjoyed a bikini. No longer. Today’s bikinis are created only for people such as Love Island contestants, for whom the ability to wear a bikini with confidence is the basis of their career. Purchasing one is as ridiculous as, say, a chef buying a chisel – it is the wrong tool for the job. Haters are going to say, “Didn’t she have a baby? Isn’t she in her mid to late-30s with a largely sedentary lifestyle? Isn’t that why she can’t find a flattering bikini?” To them I’d say, yes yes, but surely even the most Hobnobbed of us should be encouraged to swim? Should expect that, at the very least, a bikini should contain the rudest parts of our body, rather than, as these ones did, offer the merest suggestion of coverage, and that’s standing up. Lying down in one of these fabric panic rooms made of three Doritos threaded together with a kind of lurid vine would cause a whole body to puddle beneath the sun lounger.Bikinis though – bikinis, we’ve all held a women’s magazine in June, we all know that we must protect the world from the sight of women in bikinis after the age of 28, what was I thinking? Twist! After a day’s research I can confirm that this season’s all-in-one swimsuits are by far the more obscene choice. They are cut narrowly, to expose the erotic “side-boob”, but if you are larger than a B cup, then they offer a whole teapot of tit to your neighbouring bather. Nothing is adjustable nothing is safe. At any point you might look to your left and greet an entire breast or buttock that has escaped and has been enjoying your conversation with the waiter for some time, just so so pleased with itself.There is a trend, this year, for “cut-outs”. These are shapes hacked out of swimsuits in unlikely places to add interest and mystery – is it a swimming costume, is it a bikini? Who knows! The result, apart from inevitable tanning complications, is a costume with built-in landmines – step carefully, women of 2018, for these cut-outs are liable to take a whole breast off. While also creating little pouches of excitable flesh that will burst through the nylon like summer hernias, hello! Hello, I love you!I travelled home gingerly, in this body that had been exposed to me as trouble, resigned to a holiday sat by the side, cheering the children on. Waving with a hand now revealed to me as a swollen meat puppet, balanced on the end of something wobbly, attached to a machine so complicated and mottled that it should not be driven in public, and certainly not in water. Thanks to this season’s swimwear, Center Parcs slides will be safe from the groaning problem of my body, for this year at least.After I wrote about migraines, hundreds wrote in suggesting cures, including coffee, magnesium, therapy and fasting.

In January, all extra charges for using a credit or debit card to pay for goods and services were banned to prevent nasty surprises at the checkout. However, five months on, increases in the cost of transactions by Visa and Mastercard mean consumers now face the prospect of paying more for goods and services.UK traders have to pay £1bn extra a year to Visa alone, after the US-owned giant doubled its fees for every card payment. This means smaller retailers are, in turn, being forced to increase their prices to cover the extra charges, thus undermining January’s surcharge ban.Every time a customer uses a credit or debit card to make a purchase, the trader has to pay a proportion to the bank – known as the “acquirer” – that processes the payment. Part of this, called the “merchant service charge”, is an “interchange” fee, which the bank then passes on to the card issuer – usually the customer’s bank.Other parts are a charge levied by the “acquiring bank” to cover the cost of processing the transaction, and a “card scheme fee” that goes to Visa or Mastercard. The fees fluctuate.In 2015, the EU introduced rules to cap increasingly high interchange fees. It was on the back of these reforms that UK traders have been banned from charging customers a levy at the checkout.Before the ban, customers could see the extra charge for using a card and had the option of choosing a cheaper payment method, whereas now everyone has to shoulder the cost, whether they use cash or card.“It’s a classic example of the unintended consequences of regulation,” says James Daley, managing director of campaign group Fairer Finance. “All the regulator has done is squeeze one end of the balloon, and made the other end bigger.”Some traders may be forced to stop accepting cards or close, according to the British Retail Consortium (BRC), which represents UK shops. “As consumers do not pay to use their cards, there is little awareness of increasing fees, but they – like any other cost – are ultimately paid for by the consumer,” it says. “As card fees have increased, retailers are faced with a choice of raising prices or absorbing costs to remain competitive.”According to CMSPI, a payments consultancy that advises traders, the fees are likely to rise further. As its chief economist, Callum Godwin, explains, it’s the smaller businesses that are likely to be hit hardest. “The latest increases have been targeted at those with a low average transaction value, such as local cafes and corner shops, hitting the weakest when the high street is already suffering,” he says.“Visa and Mastercard are forcing up the cost of accepting cards without justification in order to boost their profits and they know that their cards are so widely used it has become near-impossible for merchants to refuse to accept them.”So far, however, the PSR has dragged its heels. It says that at the launch of its annual plan in March, “we outlined that a variety of observations had been raised about different aspects of card payments and that, in the year ahead, we will be taking a deeper look at how this market works”. It adds that details of the investigation have yet to be finalised.Visa and Mastercard deny profiteering at the expense of retailers, but both refuse to disclose card scheme fees. “The figures quoted are misleading and overinflated,” Visa says. “Our pricing means we can invest in world-leading cyber security and consumer protection, in innovation such as contactless and mobile payments, and in providing a global network which enables billions to make purchases safely, securely and reliably.”Mastercard tells the Observer that its services increase custom for businesses and its fees represent the smallest percentage of the merchant service charge. “As with any payment method there are associated costs,” it says. “Our fees reflect the clear value of accepting Mastercard and the significant investment we have made in payment technology and security.”Customers have embraced the convenience of plastic without realising the hidden costs. Before the surcharge ban, they could see how much extra they would have to pay to use a credit or debit card at the checkout and opt to use a different method to avoid the charge. Now, as the costs are fed into high street prices, they are undetectable and unavoidable and affect cash as well as card payers.Earlier this month the government finished a consultation on the future of digital payments including the cost of card payments. Meanwhile, the European commission is reviewing the effects of the interchange fee regulations on costs, and CMSPI has launched a Europe-wide petition for it to include scheme fees.However, campaigners are calling on the UK regulator to take immediate action to protect the high street. “There has been shocking regulatory failure,” says Mark Falcon, former director of regulation and strategy with the PSR and founder of the financial consultancy Zephyre.“Instead, the money has been erted to scheme fees, which go to Visa and Mastercard as profit, and the regulator should take action.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e72dcbea6d7299a4beecf848fe9a211a6ca7fd06/0_389_5835_3501/master/5835.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4a00abc2bf399d0fd26fb28b864ceced","title":"kerry andrew you are wolf interview keld folk music","story":"The composer and novelist, who performs folk under the name You Are Wolf, talks about how her obsession with water inspired new album Keld‘I love being outside,” says Kerry Andrew. She means it literally, but it works just fine metaphorically, too. Try and pin a label to her and she’ll slip away, as lithe and liquid as the water that has inspired her latest project.Some might know her as a classical composer with many prestigious commissions to her name, or have spotted her as jury chair for last month’s BBC Young Musician competition. She’s also a novelist – you may have read glowing reviews of her first book, Swansong, published in January she’s working on her second. A jazz instrumentalist – check out the music of collective DOLLYman. A singer – she’s one third of avant garde vocal ensemble Juice. And – the reason we’re meeting today – a folk musician. In April she released Keld, her second album under the You Are Wolf moniker, which was hailed as “gorgeous and stunning” and “captivating and striking”. And yet before purists turn to the Who’s Who of Folk to check which MacColl or Waterson is her second cousin, it should be added that she only got into folk in her 20s (she’s now 40), and didn’t set out to make a folk album per se. “I do worry that people in the folk world might think my music is not quite authentic or that, because I come from a different background, I don’t understand the material,” she says. “But what does authentic even mean anyway?”“Every genre should be able to take in other influences. I work a lot with primary school students and they don’t worry if we present Stravinsky and Beyonce alongside each other, they’ll listen to anything. For me, music is something you can pluck and draw from whatever you like. There’s nothing wrong with stirring it all together a little bit.”She cites as creative inspirations Meredith Monk, Laurie Anderson, Björk – “musicians who are restlessly creative and look to express themselves in whatever medium feels right.”It was the stories that drew Andrew to folk, “It feels like they – and the songs – are there to be responded to however you like,” and are the thread that runs through all her creative projects. “My work as a composer has an interest in the very old and the very new. My novel is an old story that I tried to tell in a contemporary way and so, too, with Keld,” she says. The album mixes traditional and original music, telling stories of water spirits, vengeful river gods, drownings, love and betrayals, knights, witches, spells and curses. With Andrew’s bright and pure vocals at the forefront, its textures and intricacies make it feel contemporary and yet the sounds, the feel and the otherness of our country’s wild and wet past are woven deep into the music’s fabric, giving it a timeless feel.“I like themes in all of my work. I was fixated on birds and folklore for quite a while in music and my first novel. And slowly I moved on to water,” says Andrew. Water has filled and shaped her recent years, and not just creatively. Swimming outside is an obsession, she says. “Wherever I am I always look for the blue bits on a map to see if there’s a river or a lake nearby I can slip into.” Even when it’s cold? Especially. “The cold water on your skin is part of feeling alive and feeling connected to it. I find it very meditative. When’s it’s so cold you can’t think of anything else!”British folk music has a rich tradition of songs about the sea, but Andrew decided to limit herself to songs about fresh water, hymning the rivers and lakes she loves to swim in. Her title is from a word she came across in Robert Macfarlane’s beautiful book of lost and faded language, Landmarks.  “I liked that Keld was short and slightly hard sounding but it means the still, smooth, deep part of a river. I was thinking about the old songs on the album that are deep in our roots, deep underneath. They’re quiet and still but you can delve down into them. It just felt right,” she says.Only a couple of the traditional tunes are ones she previously knew, the rest she found through ballad books and “loads of Googling”. Even her original compositions have folklore in their warp and weft. A Japanese river spirit in the shape of a tiger that she read about found its way into the incantation “River Mother River Father River Child River Tiger”, while other sources were more prosaic. “I threw in Down in the Willow at the very last minute – I came across it on Fargo Season 2’s soundtrack!” she laughs. “I looked it up and found it is an appellation ballad that inspired Nick Cave’s Where the Wild Roses Grow that he recorded with Kylie. I used to love that song – his Murder Ballads album was one of my ways into folk music.”But in a time when green spaces are disappearing and the blue bits on the maps that Andrew seeks out are polluted, can an album celebrating our wet and wild past be anything more than a poignant exercise in nostalgia? Andrew ends her album with a short track of captivating beauty. “The idea is to put an environmental stamp on the album. Remember to celebrate these places, they’re going to be there after we’ve gone – let them be left.”Over the sound of flowing water and drones, the voice of Scottish poet Robin Robertson recites Gerard Manley Hopkins’ Inversnaid and meshes with the voices of young children. Two sing Burns’ Flow Gently, Sweet Afton, others solemnly speak the names of natural things as if conjuring them into being. The magic of language, the richness of words and the wonder of water weave a powerful spell. The girls, explains Andrew, she met in the Shetland Isles, working on an education project two summers ago. “I got them to field-record sounds of the island. They had to say their name, and what it was they were recording. I really wanted the contrast between Robin’s voice – he sounds very grave, of the earth – and their bright-eyed youthful voices.”It’s Robertson’s voice that lingers longest, ending the album on a bleak but hopeful note.What would the world be, once bereftOf wet and of wildness?

It’s clearly intended as the third part of a trilogy. After Lemonade, her album packed with hell-hath-no-fury revelations of infidelity and emotional ruin, and 4:44, his album of agonised mea-culpa guilt, comes the joint album affirming Beyoncé and Jay-Z’s renewed romantic bliss. “We broke up and got back together,” raps the latter on the closing Lovehappy. “Now we’re happy in love,” adds his wife.Its very existence runs the risk of making the two releases that preceded it seem less like urgent, brave exorcisms of pent-up emotions – the duo’s equivalent of Blood on the Tracks or Here, My Dear, albums their authors felt they had to make “almost like a therapy session” as Jay-Z put it last year – than stages in a carefully premeditated plan to wring as much capital out of the couple’s nuptial discord as possible. It doesn’t take away from the musical contents of those preceding records, both artistic highlights in their respective makers’ oeuvres. But it does make them look a little more obviously calculated, very clearly underlining that the whole business is as much an exercise in brand management as soul-baring artistry.But, even if you tend to a cynical view, it’s hard not to boggle at the imposing and authoritative way it’s all been executed: from the sudden arrival of Lemonade, with its deft interweaving of relationship despair and black womanhood, to the joint tour currently packing stadiums around the world. And besides, as Everything Is Love keeps emphasising, Jay-Z and Beyoncé don’t care what you think. Presumably realising that an album full of them making gooey eyes at each other might be a little sickly, the topic of their patched-up relationship is more or less confined to its opening and closing tracks, where, it has to be said, it’s dealt with skilfully.Fuelled by the musicians from New York’s Daptone label doing their best impersonation of a late-60s soul band, Summertime undercuts its amorous tone – “Let’s make plans to be in each other’s arms” – with a rap from Jay-Z in which his romantic reverie is haunted by grim memories of summer nights filled with violence in the Marcy Projects. Meanwhile, on Lovehappy, the pair trade lines in a way that’s charming and witty rather than cloying, particularly when the old bete noire of Becky With the Good Hair makes another appearance. “You’re lucky I ain’t kill you when I met that B …,” raps Beyoncé, but the name is cut off by her husband wearily interjecting: “All right, all right.”Elsewhere, there are occasional jabs at the racism of the American police and legal system, not least on Black Effect, with its references to Trayvon Martin and the 60s civil rights movement. But, for the most part, Everything Is Love concentrates on hymning the imperial nature of the Carters’ success, how untouchably prosperous and magnificent they are. An entire song is devoted to emphasising that even their friends are “better than your friends”. If listening to Jay-Z and Beyoncé bragging about their wealth and all-round wonderfulness is substantially less interesting than listening to them pick over the flaws in their relationship, at least it’s usually done with real wit and spark. And Beyoncé turns out to be pretty great at rapping. “My great-great-grandchildren already rich,” she snaps on Boss. “That’s a lot of brown children on your Forbes list.”Similarly, if there’s nothing on Everything Is Love that matches the breathtaking sonic experimentation of Lemonade’s Freedom – plus the sound of Beyoncé singing through Auto-Tune feels surplus to requirements, serving to diminish one of modern R\u0026ampB’s true powerhouse voices – there’s still a lot to like about the music, which is far more rooted in hip-hop than R\u0026ampB. If you ever longed to hear what Beyoncé might sound like making a trap track, then both Apeshit and Friends should satiate your curiosity. Elsewhere, Nice sets a dense, jazzy sequence of piano chords against a sparse beat to hypnotic effect Boss boasts swirling vocal samples and a spectacular 70s soul horn arrangement and Heard About Us transforms Biggie Smalls’ 1994 single Juicy into something approaching glossy yacht rock.“We already know you know about us,” sings Beyoncé self-assuredly on the latter, which pretty much sums up both Everything Is Love and indeed the pair’s recent output. Calculating it may be, but it’s hard to think of anyone who’s turned prurient public interest in their personal lives to their advantage quite as adeptly as the Carters have."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d4c21baeed7d8c0f0fc1c93451c22271e904c34a/0_0_5623_3656/master/5623.jpg?w=720\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=22d9096006330d9a7e2ace08d5cebea3 720w","title":"mod may duck decision on army numbers in review","story":"Final draft of Modernising Defence Programme looks likely to be messy compromiseThe Ministry of Defence is struggling to complete a review aimed at modernising British forces in the face of a renewed threat from Russia and new threats such as cyber and electronic warfare.The review was supposed to be finished in time for Theresa May to brief Nato allies including Donald Trump at what is shaping up to be a potentially fractious summit in Brussels on 11 and 12 July. The MoD has failed to resolve many of the nitty-gritty issues involved in its review, stymied by black holes in its budget and threats of Tory backbench revolts if too many traditional capabilities are abandoned. The final draft of the Modernising Defence Programme (MDP) looks likely to be a messy compromise, setting out the threat posed by Russia while ducking politically and financially difficult decisions about the size of the army, equipment orders and other issues until later this year or beyond. The MoD, the Cabinet Office and the Treasury are still working on the review.One of the most vocal of Conservative MPs on the issue, Johnny Mercer, a former army captain, said: “It is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to define what a modern UK defence force should look like.”He said he and service personnel were looking for an end to speculation about cuts. Asked what his response would be if the review fails to provide detailed proposals, he said: “That would be unacceptable. I will not accept a fudge.”Conservative backbenchers expressed concern when it was leaked that two amphibious landing ships, HMS Albion and HMS Bulwark, were to be taken out of service, and the army and Royal Marines cut.The review is unlikely to go into such detail when published in the next few weeks, but it is understood that, given the two ships have become totemic for Tory backbenchers, at least one and perhaps both of them will be saved. HMS Albion is at present part of a flotilla enforcing sanctions on North Korea. The defence secretary, Gavin Williamson, is scheduled to meet the chancellor, Philip Hammond, this week to press for more money for the MoD. Given the demands for increased spending from other departments such as health, it will be an uphill task.Williamson can argue, however, that the UK will come under pressure from Trump, alongside other European members of Nato, to raise defence spending. A government source said: “The US wants to see greater commitment from the likes of Britain, France and other countries.”The US is having to send marines to Norway, viewed by Nato as vulnerable to Russian pressure, to fill a gap after the UK stopped sending Royal Marines there for training exercises as a money saving measure.The UK defence budget has been skewed by the nuclear programme – £31bn on four new nuclear missile-delivering submarines, which excludes work on new warheads – and two new aircraft carriers, due to be operational by 2023. A cost-cutting option would be to reduce the number of American F-35s planned to operate from the carriers. Other cost-cutting proposals include buying ships off the shelf rather than the long delays and expense involved in building them to order. The kind of details backbenchers and allies are looking for is whether the army will be cut from its present 77,000 to create a more mobile force that can be deployed at speed. One analyst said that although a tank invasion of eastern Europe by Russia was highly unlikely, a feasible scenario would be an incursion of Russian special forces into Norway or the unexpected arrival of a team of Russian advisers in a disputed part of the Balkans, and that would require a quick deployment.The review began last summer as part of a look at UK security and defence as a whole, taking in the intelligence agencies as well as the MoD. In January, however, as concern grew that the defence spending problems were proving to be too big a headache, the MoD was hived off for separate review.Prof Malcolm Chalmers, the deputy director general of the defence thinktank the Royal United Services Institute, who wrote a report in February on the review, said: “I don’t think we are going to see an end to the MDP review process before the Nato summit. We will, it appears, see some announcement of the principles around which the government is reviewing defence. But will we see the end to speculation on army numbers and marine support or other capabilities? I think that is most unlikely.”He said that unless there was significantly more money from the Treasury, there would be more minuses than pluses from the review. “I don’t see an appetite from the government at present to conclude a review on that basis,” he said.

The cash spent to date establishing an imperfect system is a monument to his obstinacy, and is especially galling as it was occurring at a time when the benefits budget was being reduced.Les BrightExeter, Devon• So universal credit is more expensive and doesn’t deliver (Editorial, 15 June). Yet it is being touted as too costly to cancel.But one thing not mentioned so far is that whistleblowers have consistently reported being overworked, with the cuts or limits to jobcentre staff numbers making it impossible for them to deliver even universal credit’s own flawed and penalising measures. This is obviously in a bid to make UC appear\u0026nbspto pay for itself, yet even then\u0026nbspit costs too much.Wages and property expenses are usually among the highest of costs for any organisation, so if universal credit was actually staffed properly and with sufficient physical access available to “clients”, then it seems reasonable to expect its costs would justify shutting the entire project.Let’s not forget also that the old system, honed from years of use to a fairly good package, is still actually up and running, at least in part, in every council. It isn’t too late.Robin BaldockLondon• Join the debate – email • Read more  letters – click here to visit guletters"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9bc2ad07df9a67db1f536e261338b84247ce69f2/0_112_3053_1832/master/3053.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ee2109c4ae125925426ad6f183d238c5","title":"johanna konta ashleigh barty final","story":"Johanna Konta, who blew a 4-1 lead in the deciding set, was furious with the chair umpire over a poor line call and stormed off court to cool down before returning to congratulate Ashleigh Barty for winning the Nature Valley Open in Nottingham on Sunday.“This is an absolute joke. We are out here busting our chops. You are making decisions that affect all our lives,” Konta shouted at the umpire before completing the final, which Barty won 6-3, 3-6, 6-4 in a tense, see-sawing match that lasted just over two hours. The Australian kept her composure throughout the spat.Konta, clearly upset, hurried from the court without acknowledging her opponent or the official but returned for the presentation ceremony, looking tearful as she received the runner-up trophy. Speaking courtside, the British No 1 said: “Massive congratulations Ash. She’s one of the great girls on Tour and very tough to play on this surface. I tried to do the best that I can, competed the hardest I could. This is a very good result for me this year, a good feeling to be in the last weekend of a tournament, not a feeling I’ve had for a year.”Barty said of Konta: “She’s one of the most genuine girls on tour. Her team invited me to Wimbledon last week to practise. There wasn’t much in the match from the get-go. I’m please to get the win.”  "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1235f8913067c000b7e24bb790cd39c0b7200ca3/213_857_3357_2015/master/3357.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=29aab82365db6d342dd9f9f3d6a02327","title":"us open 2018 day four live","story":"Fleetwood whips his tee shot at 17 straight at the flagstick. The ball takes a hot bounce past, though, and he’s left with a 20-footer back up the hill. He can’t make it, but that’s another par, and if he makes a third in a row up 18, he’ll be signing for a 63. On the final day of a US Open!Yet another birdie for the Masters champion Patrick Reed! He sends his tee shot at 7 to 12 feet, and the putt never looks like missing! Five in seven! He’s +1. It’d be something to see Reed win this tournament, partly because he’d be halfway to the grand slam, but also because he took a ludicrous amount of flak after his Masters win. People criticised the supposed stodgy nature of his final round, but ignored the three days of brilliant golf that preceded it, plus the fact he’d closed it out calmly when Jordan Spieth and Rickie Fowler came racing at him late on. It was a magnificent performance. As for the personal stuff, well, he ignores it so let’s do that too. He’s a top talent, and whatever happens today, will be a factor in the majors for quite some time.Fleetwood’s second down 16 slips into the semi-rough down the left. But he swishes a wedge straight at the flag, leaving himself an uphill 12-footer for yet another birdie. But he doesn’t hit it. It was probably missing left anyway. That puts an end to his run of birdies. The first sign of nerves? Par meanwhile for Fitzpatrick on 13.Koepka lags his 60-footer up to tap-in distance. Wonderfully judged. That’s his third birdie of the day. Dustin has a 22-footer for his eagle, but that’s never going in. Both men settle for birdies. Par for Reed on 6. This is hotting up beautifully ... but threatening to turn into a four-man race.Daniel Berger stops the rot with par at 4. He stays at +5. But his fellow traveller in the final group continues to slide: a third bogey in a row for Tony Finau, who slips to +6. Meanwhile four big booms down 5, and both Koepka and Dustin are on the par-five green with long eagle putts.Justin Rose splashes out from sand at the side of five to four feet. He looks to have salvaged his par after playing the hole in the slapdash style ... but he pushes the short putt wide right, and he’s off in the wrong direction at pace. He’s +7.Tommy Fleetwood hits an extremely average wedge into 15. It’s a rare mistake. But then he rattles in a 30-footer for his fourth birdie in a row! This is an astonishing run, and one which might stand him in very good stead if he can keep it going until the end. If he can post something low, and the sun and wind dry the greens out ... well, he could improve on last year’s fourth place at the very least. But let’s not tempt fate and get ahead of ourselves. God speed, though, Tommy! He’s +2, with the second par five to come!A third bogey in five holes for Ian Poulter, this time at 8, and at +10 he’s toast. Meanwhile Justin Rose, who doubled 4, is now in all sorts of trouble, hacking his way down the right side of 5. And bogey for Matt Fitzpatrick on 12, the result of a wide flay left from the tee. Although he found the dancefloor, he was 50 feet from the pin, and raced his first putt well past the cup. He’s back to +5.The final pairing are struggling. Tony Finau and Daniel Berger have followed up bogeys at 2 with bogeys at 3. They’re +5. Going the other way, though, is the Masters champ Patrick Reed. His second into 5 found the bunker, and his splash out wasn’t all that, but he’s sent the 20-foot birdie putt scampering into the cup, and the 118th US Open Championship, ladies and gentlemen, is on!And in a flash, John is gone. Goodbye, John. And hello Tommy Fleetwood! He’s just raked one in from off the front of 14. That’s three birdies on the bounce, and suddenly Southport’s finest is tied for second! Matthew Fitzpatrick has the sniff of glory in his nostrils too, with birdie at 10.Koepka’s next tee shot is wayward so work to do for him. The same will go for Johnson. Justin Rose ended up on the jaws between two bunkers from his drive and a bogey is the best he can hope for. His bump and run gives him a chance that he blows. Double bogey drops him to +6. Tommy Fleetwood’s charge on 14 might have been stopped by falling short of the green. Berger’s scramble shot to save himself on the third, having bogeyed the second, has him wringing his hands in agony. Reed finds a bunker, too. That lengthy sequence of goofs and poor luck is a reminder of just how tough this course remains. Koepka is two clear now at +1 after holing from close in but Johnson’s good work from the rough is undone by a missed birdie putt. Up the course, charging Tommy Fleetwood is five under for the round and just two off the lead after birdie on 13th. Patrick Reed is excited, too excited and that weird swing of his, as if he was trying to take his jumper off, is exacerbated as his ball wangs into the wilderness. The bunker beckons. Reed’s run come to its end with a putt on the fourth that squirts into a run away from the hole. Justin Rose’s putter is steady enough but not quite inspired. He will have to settle for par on the third. Dustin Johnson is out in Hazzard County in some thick rough but his saver shot, a low punch, is inspired. It gives him a fine chance for birdie. Koepka is just as close after a far more regulation effort. Koepka has the lead at +2 after a birdie on the second. Johnson couldn’t match him. Off the third, Johnson worries some spectators with a wild tee shot while Koepka’s shot bounces along merrily into safety. Patrick Reed plays another pearler to set up the quadpot of birdies. Further back in the field, Ian Poulter drops a shot on the par 5 fifth while Tommy Fleetwood on the 12th, has put himself within two of the lead. There are a huge amount of possibilities for the win and being a clubhouse leader might not be a bad state of affairs if, say, the wind picks up even more. John McEnerney in Barcelona emails in: “Big Henrik has the last day Major win experience \u0026amp he showed glimpses of his class yesterday. He’ll be there \u0026amp thereabouts today but that putter of his needs to stay hot. Pin placements today should produce some low scoring.”Reed now has a share of the lead after his third consecutive birdie. In the final pairing, Tony Finau and Daniel Berger are underway, with Finau going to first to stay safe off the tee, and the same for Berger, who landed the better angle. Justin Rose’s bunker shot is ambitious but is affected by a layer of sand that keeps him too short. But! He holes the par putt. Dustin Johnson lays up on the first with a measured long putt and has a gimme for par. Koepka, meanwhile, has the chance to take the lead but his putt has too much purchase. He and Johnson stay levels, you devils. Elsewhere, Patrick Reed is on one hell of a charge. And he has got the locals hollering and yahooing with his stroke play. Another birdie looks likely on the third. Stenson and Rose play that par 3 second. Stenson lands it on the green though has a way to go to make birdie. Rose, though, has plugged his in the sand. A rescue job required. Dustin Johnson’s wedge is topped a little from an unkind angle. He has two difficult putts to make par on the first. Popular Patrick Reed birdies the second and is within a shot of the lead. Behind them Dustin Johnson, 2016’s champion of course, blamms a three iron to the left of the fairway. Brooks Koepka, defending champ, and playing with his mate here, drills one into a similar position, yet probably behind Johnson. Rose’s first putt falls short but a par should be his. Rose’s second shot on the first lands on the green, and spins dead. Par looks on from that distance, though a birdie putt is far more of a problem. Stenson gave his shot a bit too much gas and narrowly avoided rolling on from the green. Rose has the better chance. Patrick Reed holes out on the first for birdie and then sets up another with a fine tee shot off the second tee. Tyrell Hatton also lands a birdie on the ninth. The putts are flying in compared to yesterday’s crazy golf on a rollercoaster but Ian Poulter says, “You are kidding me” as his shot lips into the bunker. Thank you, Scott. Henrik Stenson and Justin Rose go on the first tee. Stenson has the honour and the local yahoos acclaim a shot that booms into the centre of that mighty fairway. Justin’s effort is within yards of Stenson’s, though Rose, narrowly further behind, will play his wedge shot first. After missing short birdie putts at 1 and 2, Ian Poulter nearly makes a 30-footer on 3. But that’s a third par in a row, on a day when he needs a fast start. He stays at +7. And Tommy Fleetwood can’t rescue himself from the side of 9 a bogey, and an underwhelming end to his front nine, though he’s still out in 32. He slips to +6, and in all probability, that was a slip he simply couldn’t afford if he was to post something special, early doors.And with that slightly downbeat message, I’m off to chow down on a plate of Hamburger Helper, still the only MSG-flavored foodstuff to be marketed by a singing golf glove. Your pal and mine, John Brewin, takes up the reins!Charley Hoffman goes the wrong way, a ten-foot left-to-right curler lipping out at 3. He’s back to +8. Paul Casey is back to where he started the day, after coming up short at 7 and dropping another stroke. He’s +9 again. And trouble for Tommy Fleetwood at 9, as he sends his approach to the right of the green, his ball nestling in some pretty thick stuff. He’ll have his work cut out getting up and down from there.Ian Poulter responds to disappointment at missing out on birdie at 1 by creaming a long iron into the par-three 2nd. It rolls serenely up the green, sliding in from left to right, and stops four feet behind the cup. That’s a beauty. But another chance goes begging as he shoves his putt right of the hole. Par for Tommy Fleetwood at 8 he’d nearly made it three birdies in a row but his 25-foot putt stopped just short. He stays at +5. Par for Tyrrell Hatton at 1: he’s +7. And birdie for Matthew Fitzpatrick at 5 he joins the group at +6, just three off the lead.Poulter whips his second at 1 straight at the pin, then pumps his chest in a show of determination. But he misses the birdie putt and stays at +7. Grace can’t save his par, always in trouble after that loose tee shot, and he drops to +8. Meanwhile another birdie for the 2012 winner Simpson, at 3. The leader board has had its first serious shake-up!Another birdie for Tommy Fleetwood! He sends his tee shot at the tricky par-three 7th to ten feet, then guides home the left-to-right slider. He’s moving through the field at pace! He’s +5. Meanwhile Xander Schauffele lands his second at 3 pin high, but 20 feet left of the target. He can’t quite make the birdie putt, but that’s another drama-free hole for the young Californian.Fleetwood sends a gentle high draw into 6. It lands softly by the flag, and stops within kick-in distance. He’ll surely make a birdie that will lift him to +6. A dropped shot for Paul Casey at 4, though he slips back to +8. And Ian Poulter is out, clapping an iron down the middle of 1. Branden Grace however finds the thick semi-rough down the left and might be in a little trouble from the get-go.Scott Piercy suffered terribly in the final group yesterday, shooting 79 as he and Dustin Johnson dragged each other down. He looks in much better nick today, though: birdies at 5 and 6 have sent him up the leader board to +7. A lot of red figures out there right now there are birdies to be had out there. Hideki Matsuyama illustrates this point perfectly: he’s in with a 66, at +10 snatching the very early clubhouse lead from Rickie Fowler, who had posted that best-of-week 65 earlier today. One thing to note: most of Fowler and Matsuyama’s low scoring was done on the front nine. So it’s important to get a wriggle on quicksmart, Schauffele style.The 2012 champion Webb Simpson came back to prominence last month with his stunning romp round Sawgrass to win the Players. He’s been grooving himself into form this week, following up an opening-day 76 with a couple of 71s. And he keeps that momentum going with birdie at 1 today: he’s +7. Ditto his playing partner Zach Johnson: the 2007 Masters and 2015 Open champ birdies 1, moves to +7. Meanwhile another birdie for Schauffele, who sends a low draw into the long par-three 2nd, then strokes home the 13-footer he’d left himself. The fastest start, and he’s +6, just three off the lead. A lovely chip bumped up from the back of 2 by Matthew Fitzpatrick, and he’s saving his par. He remains at +7. But his playing partner Justin Thomas is heading the wrong way, missing a short par putt that drops him to +9. Joining Fitzpatrick at +7: Paul Casey, with his second birdie of the day at 3, and Xander Schauffele, who is a major winner in waiting, I’ll be bound, with birdie at 1.Brooks Koepka is aiming to become the first player since Curtis Strange in 1989 to win back-to-back US Open titles. If the 28-year-old Floridian manages it, he’ll become only the seventh man in history to achieve the feat. And it’s quite an elite club: Willie Anderson, John McDermott, Bobby Jones, Ralph Guldahl, Ben Hogan and Strange. This sort of thing doesn’t happen often we could be witnessing some rare golfing history today.Fleetwood is this close to making it three birdies in a row, at 4. But his putt from 15 feet shaves the side of the hole. He’s got the par-five 5th, statistically the easiest hole of the week, coming up. Behind him, Matthew Fitzpatrick comes out of the blocks quickly, sending a gorgeous second into the 1st green to four feet. He makes his birdie to move to +7, though he’s a bit aggressive with his tee shot at the par-three 2nd, and his ball scoots past the flag and topples off the back. That’s not a pin position you can have a pop at the USGA for, given the length of the hole: it’s playing at 264 yards today.A bad omen for Dustin Johnson. Whenever he’s held the lead after 54 holes of the US Open, he hasn’t converted his position to a victory. He led by three going into the 2010 edition at Pebble Beach, only to start duffing chips and winging drives onto the beach. He ended up shooting 82 as Graeme McDowell snatched the prize. Then in 2015 at Chambers Bay, he was tied going into the final day, but ended up missing a short birdie putt for the win, then yipping the one coming back to hand the trophy to Jordan Spieth. Third time lucky? Or is the 2016 champion somehow ill-starred in these particular situations?Another birdie for Fleetwood, this time the result of a 20-footer across 3. He’s already risen to +7. Russell Knox follows his lead by raking in a monster on 2 he’s +8. An opening birdie for Paul Casey: he’s +8. And Patrick Rodgers is back in the clubhouse with a 67. There’s definitely a score out there right now. But who will seize the day? Justin Thomas, maybe, who shot 63 last year at Erin Hills. He’s out and about now. Expect a bit of upward movement on the leader board soon, as the later groups begin to take to the course.A fast start for another links expert, Tommy Fleetwood. The son of Birkdale can only find the front fringe of the green at the long par-five 2nd, but rakes a 60-foot monster straight into the cup for his birdie. He smiles broadly, in the manner of a man who has decided he’s just going to go out and enjoy himself today. He’s +8. “I was dismayed at the greens yesterday,” begins Anthony O Connell. “They got so far out of control that I fear today will basically be a joke in the other direction. Someone could easily shoot a 63 looking at the early scores. The PGA tour sets up stupid easy courses then the USGA work in the complete opposite direction.” Fowler was going round with Phil Mickelson today. Lefty scribbles his name on a 69, milks the applause from his loyal fans, and ends the week at +16. And with that, the circus leaves town.Rickie Fowler sends his second at 18 to three feet, tidies up for birdie, and signs for a best-of-week 65. He finishes the week at +11 and will be ruing his total capitulation yesterday amid the carnage, when he shot 84. The plus side: Fowler is a links aficionado and this is all good preparation for the upcoming Open Championship. He really is due a major. Millions will be wishing him all the best at Carnoustie.Some pre-action reading: “I’ve recently finished a blog about Ray Floyd’s win at Shinnecock Hills in 1986,” writes our man Steven Pye. “A triumph for the 43-year-old after an uncharacteristic collapse at the Westchester Classic the week before, and more disappointment for Greg Norman in the year of his Saturday Slam.”With such a crowded leader board, there’s a fair chance this could end in a play-off. A reminder that, should it happen, we won’t be going to 18 holes on Monday, in the traditional style. The USGA have adopted a new format, and it’ll be a two-hole aggregate play-off on 17 and 18. Should the scores still be tied after that, they’ll keep playing 17 and 18 on a sudden-death loop. I have a feeling that this one is going all the way.Anyone for some actual golf? Yay! First out today, with a marker, Andrew Johnston. Poor Beef had to put up with a lot yesterday, as Lefty lost it, and shot 82 as a whirlwind whipped around his bemused but highly amused head. “I looked at him and was like: ‘Is this actually happening?’ I said to him: ‘Sorry but I can’t help but laugh at that, it’s one of the funniest things I’ve ever seen.’ I’ve never seen anything like it.”) Still, he’ll have some story to tell the grandkids. And he’s finished his third US Open in positive fashion, with birdies at 15 and 16. He’s back in the house with a 71, the gallery sending this popular man off with the ovation he deserves. He ends the week at +19. God speed, Beef.Rich Beem, the 2002 PGA champion turned Sky commentator, reckons 17 out of 18 pin placements today are absolutely fine and dandy. The only one he’d question is 7, but there’s nothing you can do on that Redan green anyway, it’s a fault of the course architecture. Mike Davis of the USGA meanwhile has said his team were initially happy with the set-up yesterday, but it went wrong in the latter stages of the day because the wind got up more than they’d expected, drying the greens out. Hence all this preemptive action ahead of the final day’s play. And even if it does dry out in similar style this afternoon, the kinder placements should at least offer a little succour. Fingers crossed, then!The USGA have also pumped “appropriate levels” of water - i.e. large quantities - onto the greens for “turf health and firmness”. Accordingly, they’re going to be on average “10 to 12 inches slower than rounds two and three”. They’ve also adjusted the pin positions according to “agronomic data”, so hopefully those won’t be as punitive today. In other news, Phil Mickelson told Butch Harmon this morning that he “kinda lost it” yesterday. He also reportedly offered to withdraw, but the USGA weren’t having it, though no doubt we’ll be hearing more from both sides down the line.Do all these early birdies suggest the course is playing fairer today? Perhaps best to wait a while: it was giving up scores yesterday morning, too, and look how that panned out. The weather forecast is for sun and a bit of wind ... much like yesterday, then. But the pin placement on 15 doesn’t seem half as daft today, so that’s one in the bag from the get-go. Let’s see how this pans out.Hideki Matsuyama, like Rickie, is surely going to become a major champion one day soon. Like Rickie, he’ll have to wait a bit longer, after a hope-shredding 79 amid the mayhem yesterday. The Japanese star initially went backwards today with bogey at 2, but then followed it up with four birdies on the bounce. Matsuyama either blows hot or cold with the putter this morning he was on one of his sizzling streaks. Another birdie at 9, and he’s reached the turn in 31 strokes, too. He’s +10.Mickelson was out in 32 this morning. Though he’s since bogeyed 11, he’s two under for his round through 12 right now, +15 for the championship. Also eating up the front nine this morning: Rickie Fowler. A disastrous 84 yesterday put paid to Rickie’s hopes of landing that elusive first major, but he’s going like the clappers today. Birdies at 5, 7, 8 and 9, and he’s reached the turn in 31 strokes. He’s +12 overall.Well, Moving Day sure escalated quickly. The US Open, folks! There’s not another tournament like it!But how about that Phil Mickelson shot? No, not his hockey-puck slap on the 13th. The one on 18, off the back of a green everyone else had been tentatively nudging their ball down, lest it slide ten feet past the hole and they three-putt. He opened up his lob wedge, took a full-blooded swing, sent his ball a thousand miles into the air, and landed it softly by the flag. The ostentatious, showboating shot of a singular man who had nothing left to lose, had already made his grand statement, and fancied making another. If ever there was a middle finger to the USGA, it was surely that.It’ll be unfashionable to say so, the way internet debate is framed these days, but you can see both sides. On the one hand, Mickelson’s behaviour was petulant, and ran counter to the spirit of golf then again, he made his point, and in spectacular style. And perhaps more importantly, seeing sport is supposed to be a distraction from the everyday drudgery of existence, it was very funny to watch, as his easy-going playing partner Beef was quick to point out afterwards. Jaw-dropping entertainment. Nobody died.As for the actual debate regarding the set-up of the course, to which Mickelson was referring via the medium of contemporary dance? Well, a couple of pin positions were ludicrous yesterday, no doubt, the 15th especially, where exquisitely played, delicate chips were rolling slowly past the cup then picking up speed and toppling 50 feet down a huge bank. Generous landing spots on the greens are at a premium. And boy is that rough thick. But some players have been making no adjustments to their usual target-golf Tour tactics of boom and chip. Like an Open Championship links, Shinnecock Hills requires a new way of thinking. And nobody said the US Open should be easy. The way things are going this week is much closer to the USGA’s ideal of Level Par Wins, than the recent birdie-fests at Erin Hills, Pinehurst and Congressional.But like I say: you can see both sides. That’s a reasonable way to go about life, isn’t it?Hey, whatever your opinion, you can’t deny Moving Day was one heck of a thrill. The leading pack came back to Daniel Berger and Tony Finau, who had shot 66s early in less windy, less parched conditions. The 36-hole leader Dustin Johnson crashed to a 77, though did very well to regain his composure in the worst of it after going out in 41. And so, given that Arnold Palmer won from seven back in 1960, there are a fair few people who will fancy their chances of winning this today. Maybe not Phil, mind you.Anyway, it’s on! US Open fever sweeps the nation! Won’t somebody please call Dr Golf? Today’s tee times..."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b50d7b1d8b46c121e3332e6bb5a036bf85c36946/245_123_1411_846/master/1411.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5caaf3e77c891ba4b84c234d0316c5cd","title":"rudolf nureyev documentary unearths unseen avant garde footage ballet","story":"Previously unknown footage of Rudolf Nureyev will be seen for the first time in a new British documentary to be released in cinemas worldwide.Ballet’s most famous star can be seen performing, choreographing and rehearsing in material unearthed by the film-maker Jacqui Morris.She was taken aback to find about 16 minutes of unseen footage relating to the greatest male ballet dancer of all time.In one clip, Nureyev can be seen rehearsing the Nutcracker with Claude de Vulpian, choreographing her while dancing together.Most of the footage shows modern works created with leading choreographers such as Martha Graham.Morris said of the footage: “You see him on stage, dancing very provocatively throughout … This is very avant-garde, very sexually provocative – the opposite of him playing the prince in ballet. In one section, he’s polishing a scaffolding pole in the most provocative way imaginable.”She said the discovery was so important because prior to now there was very little footage of his contemporary work.Morris described the material as “amateur-shot”: “Nureyev didn’t like being filmed because he knew his best angles when he was performing on stage, but he couldn’t control the camera. He knew what an audience was going to see live.“But he had good friends, particularly quite wealthy women, who followed him around the world, and he did allow them to film. There’s a couple of bits that we’ve found from other people who surreptitiously filmed in theatres.”The documentary– Nureyev: All The World His Stage – will be released in September. Morris is a co-directer, with her brother David. Their previous documentaries include McCullin, about the war photographer Don McCullin, which received two Bafta nominations.Nureyev died in 1993 aged 54. The Nureyev Foundation gave the film-makers access to around 20 boxes of old VHS tapes, among other material in a vast archive held in the New York public library.David Morris said: “There’s about 16 minutes of dance footage that even the most diehard fan has never seen … There are things the Nureyev Foundation didn’t know existed.”Over two yearswading through the archive, Jacqui Morris realised that labels did not fully detail their contents.Thierry Fouquet, vice-president of the Nureyev Foundation, was excited by the discovery. “There were lots of things I hadn’t seen before,” he said.In her 2017 autobiography, the former prima ballerina Dame Beryl Grey recalled how Nureyev could transfix his audiences with the grace and beauty of his movement, but said he was also capable of brutal behaviour. He could be rude even to his legendary dancing partner Margot Fonteyn, whom he adored. Grey remembered him kicking a ballerina so hard she required medical treatment.Jacqui Morris said: “He could be a monster and he did hit people. There’s no question of it. But in the footage we’ve got, you can just see how hard he’s working and how much those dancers adored him because he pushed them. He would slap them, but they’d come out of it going, ‘you know what, I’ve just given a performance of a lifetime’. Dance was his whole life.”Saturday marked the anniversary of Nureyev’s dramatic defection from the Soviet Union in 1961. He gave his minders the slip in Paris and presented the west with one of the greatest propaganda coups of the cold war.David Morris said it marked a pivotal moment in history. “Nureyev’s life was dominated by politics, although he wasn’t political himself.”He said the documentary would reflect the great tragedy of Nureyev’s life: “That he came to the west, was the great star of his age, but that he couldn’t see his mother.”“He was a performer on the big classical stage, and those things were not filmed every night … Cameras were also more cumbersome than they are today. A camera on a tripod would be fixed to the floor at the back of row Z … and it wouldn’t move.”The film-makers say that, even a quarter of a century after hisdeath, Nureyev’s story has never been more relevant. “His defection to the west is symbolic as Russia and the west struggle once more to reconcile conflicting values.”The documentary takes an innovative approach to the form. As well as interviews with those who knew Nureyev, there are contemporary dance sequences choreographed by Russell Maliphant that tell his story where no archival footage exists."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3658d13e26b65e4a93e73c6405e05d0457d675fc/144_0_3473_2085/master/3473.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=00bbc18e248d86e4170fb7f4fbba0a55","title":"my love island excuses ring as hollow as its stars heads at least im not alone","story":"Millions of us have been seduced by the show, despite its vapidity. TV has never just been about what we’re watching, but who we’re watching it withI’ll cut to it, I’ve been watching Love Island. Sorry about that, but it’s for intellectuals too, you know. It’s a special time of the year, like the day ants grow wings. Many of my most cultured acquaintances, people who read Barthelme and have opinions on Shostakovich, have started talking like teenagers in Westfield and wearing white jeans. Curious, emboldened by the reduced stigma, and having Googled “is Caroline Flack a gateway drug to the Kardashians?”, I gave the first episode a watch. Like morphine, it took quick hold.We’re a special breed, people who need to rationalise watching popular programmes. “Crucial to stay in touch with the demotic idiom,” I think to myself, to justify the fact I am going to spend 100 hours this summer watching men with 88 abs ask each other where their head’s at. “It’s actually interesting from a sociological perspective,” I say, to explain why I’m interested in whether a shy A\u0026ampE doctor can hook up with a glamour model from Southend-on-Sea. My excuses ring as hollow as some of the contestants’ heads. The fact is, I just enjoy it.I do think the show teaches us something about human nature but I’m not sure it’s something I want to know. What’s that zombie saying – you never understand the appeal of being undead until you’re bitten? Despite my inner conflict about the show’s heteronormative, body-fascist vapidity, I’ve been seduced by it. Or rather, something around it: the fact I’m watching what everyone else is watching.It’s frequently said we’re living through a golden age of television. (The people who say this always sound so smug, as if they had anything to do with it.) And that’s true. Scripted dramas from the Sopranos to Patrick Melrose have hit new heights of world-building, thematic complexity and acting ability. Content-wise, no one should be watching Love Island, or Real Housewives, or America’s Next Top Arsehole, or Keeping Up with the Kardashians or Fucking Off With the Beckhams or whatever’s on now. But TV has never just been about what we’re watching it’s about who we’re watching it with.Thirty million people watched EastEnders on Christmas Day, 1986. These days, 30 million people don’t do anything together, apart from protest against Donald Trump. When I was young, there were four channels. All my friends watched … well, Friends. Next day, we’d talk about the best bits, from the one with the blackout, to the ones with Bruce Willis, to the one where they discover Ross’s monkey is a military bioweapon, and Dustin Hoffman has to stop him being blown up. Actually, that’s the film Outbreak. This was a long time ago, and that monkey worked a lot.My new hobby has recaptured some of that epic intimacy. It shortcuts friendship, lets me strike up conversations with strangers. Speaking the lingua franca is new to me, yet the natives have been kind. Watching week by week, rather than bingeing, means no one knows more than anyone else, and we can speculate together. People don’t suggest a superior series by the same writers you should be watching instead, or lecture you on why the show is important. They just have a gossip, a crucial part of the social glue. The value of connection is connection itself, as Hayley from Love Island would say.It’s a dangerous slope for me, though – self-styled maverick and outsider, discovering the comfort of conformity, and needing to belong. Thank God there isn’t a major sports tournament on at the same time, enabling me to finally win the approval of men I don’t know in the pub.Hey drinkers, there’s a new spot in town you should think about. I’m not saying you should go I’m saying you should think about it. Moonshine Saloon is an immersive, pop-up cocktail joint on London’s King’s Road, themed like a wild west saloon.I was unfortunate enough to visit the creator’s former venture, Alcotraz, an east London bar with a prison theme. I remember changing into an orange jumpsuit and being led to a cell, where we were smuggled cocktails by other “inmates”, while avoiding actors pretending to be guards. Lol. We were given ID numbers, lined against a wall and “strip searched”. Pure bants.Don’t get me wrong, it’s novel to take a thrill ride inside systemic inequality that doesn’t affect you but it’s not something I can relax into. Sam Shearman, the founder of the company that runs the bars, defended his misery safari, claiming it “gently opens the door to fiction and TV showing Alcatraz”. A door gently opening seems like an ironic metaphor.On the face of it, Moonshine Saloon sounds safer. It is “inspired by the captivating tales of the wild west and its covert operations”. Which operations would those be? President Jackson’s Indian removal policy, with its inhumane forced marches? Or the stealing and selling of land belonging to those native Americans who remained? Probably not. They mean the familiar caricature of rugged gunslingers from TV movies, pardner, duelling outside bars.On my visit to Alcotraz, the other inmates all felt unbothered by the environment. Was I overreacting? It made me pause, to see my friends and I through their eyes, as caricatures ourselves: snowflake liberals who only want to stop other people having a good time. There we sat, in our separate cells, drinking together and apart.Luckily, I can denounce these bars in non-political terms. A night of drinking should feel improvisatory, unscripted, pure potential. Alcotraz and Moonshine Saloon are the opposite. As immersive theatre they’re bobbins, having no drama or a believable world. Entry to Moonshine Saloon costs £34, per person, for less than two hours inside. And you have to provide your own alcohol, in unopened bottles. Now that, we can all agree, is offensive."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8926b5e097eb335097d70b8df46487fa65e206d1/0_19_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1f4b28e57946e8122ec1875bc4e0eb30","title":"bruce springsteen asbury park new jersey","story":"The Boss will play a hometown show in Asbury Park on Monday, but as luxury apartments spring up around the seaside resort, not everyone is pleasedInside Asbury Park’s showy new music venue Asbury Lanes, locals stare open-mouthed at what used to be a retro bowling alley played by local bands and burlesque acts. Where just a few years ago there was an orange drop ceiling, some old lanes and a bar with $4 grilled cheese, there are now sleek liquor cages struck by cool blue lights.Kurt Vile and the Violators are on stage, the mostly acoustic band formed by the War on Drugs former lead guitarist, in front of a neon and strobe backdrop flashing in sync with the low-key indie rockers’ vibey tunes.“It’s good to be back,” Vile told the crowd. “I live just over the river in Philly,” he said, and traded out another guitar before sinking back into the music. The stage was flanked by stacks of old guitar amps (they’re just for decoration), and an after-work crowd nodded along.Asbury Park is a seaside town, part of Jersey shore, where working-class surfers, artists, musicians, gay men and women and African American culture mixed for decades. It’s bordered on the east by a kitsch-filled stretch of boardwalk along the Atlantic.Even on a cloudy day in the middle of the week, the air smells vaguely of hotdogs and funnel cake (a calorie bomb of fried dough covered in icing sugar). Sea myst floats off the Atlantic, toward attractions like the pinball museum and its life-sized fiberglass Elvis.Asbury Park’s long history of false starts at redevelopment, in many ways, allowed these groups to continue to live in the 1.5 sq mile town, bordered by more affluent and conservative stretches of beach.This town is best known for fostering the state’s most beloved export: Bruce Springsteen. His 1973 debut album Greetings from Asbury Park thrust the town – and its pushers, peddlers and conmen – into rock’n’roll imagination. It’s only an hour from New York, but feels a world away.“The Turnpike (an inter-state highway) goes from New York to Philly,” said Vini “Mad Dog” Lopez, the former drummer for Springsteen’s E Street Band. “It don’t stop in Asbury Park. Even though people might think it’s a mecca, it’s got a long way to go.”Vile, whose bandmate described him as “Bruce-obsessed”, closed with the Born in the USA deep cut Downbound Train.Asbury Lanes is just one piece of an enormous waterfront redevelopment. The long-awaited, and now hotly contested, changes to the seaside have already started to arrive: the boutique Asbury Hotel recently opened, blocks of new luxury condos sell for $800,000, rooftop restaurants and a bandshell are being built.The centerpiece of these changes is a 16-storey, still-under-construction block of luxury apartments and hotel rooms, built just steps from the low-income residents who moved to the shore when Asbury was down and out. Developers believe the apartments will start at $1m.The site sat half-finished for the better part of 40 years, as one developer after another went bankrupt. Undoubtedly, locals are relieved to see it gone. But, in a town where most buildings are no more than four storeys high, its replacement looms over the town like a giant.“Do we really need a 16-storey structure? No,” said Trish Zanetello, 60. “Do we really need condos starting at $1m? No.” Even so, she said, she is happy to see the “cement science experiment” gone.Prosperity, however, has come with contention.“They turned something really cool into the Hard Rock Café,” said Dale W Miller, a musician whose former band, AtlanticPacific, played the old Asbury Lanes. Its quirks – bands played on a stage over the lanes and people bowled in either side – were what many locals felt made it great. About the new venue, Miller said, “I’m not feeling it.One patron to the Vile show acknowledged, “all places close” and looked up into the high ceilings of the new Asbury Lanes, “processing”. Others described the venue as “over the top” or “Vegas”. One said simply: “It’s really different.” Springsteen will play a show here next week as part of the Asbury Lane’s grand re-opening. Tickets are nearly impossible to come by. Springsteen was paid $125,000 for the show (he will donate proceeds to the Boys \u0026amp Girls Club of Monmouth County, a charity which provides after-school programs for children).Since Springsteen’s debut put the town on the map, Asbury Park has been plagued by blight, corruption and crime. As one resident told the New York Times in 2003: “I can’t even walk my dog without 18 people asking me if I want to buy coke.” Now, as the town experiences an economic boom, long-time residents are ambivalent about the lopsided change.“When I came here in 2000, all there was was art galleries,” said Amy Quinn, the deputy mayor. When people walked the streets, they’d be “met with drug dealers or prostitutes or whatever”.“Was it a bad time for quality of life? Yea. But people took it on themselves to get on a planning board or zoning board,” and improve the town, she said. “As a result, we have corporations coming in and developing.” Asked about Asbury Lanes, Quinn winced, “There’d be no new Asbury Lanes without the old Asbury Lanes.”In addition to Asbury Lanes, developers now own many of the venues most closely associated with the brand of New Jersey quirk that brought Asbury back. For example, the Stone Pony, made famous by Springsteen, is also owned by developers.“It’s much more expensive than it used to be,” said John Lyon, best known by his stage name Southside Johnny. “But it was also dangerous in Asbury Park.” His band, the Asbury Jukes, played around the same time Springsteen was penning songs for the E Street Band and living above a surfboard factory in early 1970s Asbury. “It’s not so dangerous anymore,” Lyon said, and added, “Artists always find a place to live, even if its five people in an apartment.” The depths of Asbury Park’s nadir can hardly be overstated. The seaside resort was relatively wealthy, though segregated, in the 1930s. Two grand structures, the Casino and Convention Hall, still bookend either side of Asbury’s boardwalk, are now owned by developers.But as the decades went on, it slid into decline. Frank Sinatra, a Jersey native himself, derisively compared Asbury Park to failed romance in his 1962 song At Long Last Love (“Is it Granada I see, or only Asbury Park?”). But the town was already sailing toward what was likely the most cataclysmic event in recent history. After years of segregated beaches, schools, and housing, race riots rocked the town in 1970. Businesses were looted and burned.“It started when Dr King was killed”, said Freddie Richardson Jr. “It was chaos.” He was 17 when the riots started. Richardson, a black man and a Muslim, now lives in Florida. People, he said, were “unbelievable distraught”. There was, “a lot of injustice – blatant injustice.” People, he said, “kind of threw up their hands.”This was around this time Springsteen and other musicians played around Asbury Park, trying to convince booking agents audiences wanted to hear original music – not top 40 covers.“I got in a band, and we started listening to all the other bands,” said Lopez. Today, Asbury Park is one of the hippest spots on the Jersey Shore. Business has been “incredibly busy”, said Glen Jones, who works in the Silverball Museum pinball arcade. “I’ve watched the progress since I moved here,” in 2008, he said. Another resident said he rented his loft for the summer to a couple for $20,000 (one half of whom worked for Goldman Sachs).“It’s definitely changed,” said Bichone Syphax, a lifelong Asbury resident, about the town. Even today though, he said, prosperity is uneven. “I would just like to see more unification, instead of being ided by the tracks.”In large part, Asbury Park was shaped by the people the rest of the Jersey Shore pushed out – working-class musicians, gay men and women, African Americans. Today, the city remains a liberal bastion among fiercely conservative Jersey shore towns.For musicians, locally owned venues still act as a proving ground. Asbury Lanes, now booking national acts, has to fill a 760-person hall. The Saint, on Main Street, caps out at 150.The bar is a dimly lit box, cluttered with posters and layers of graffiti that evidence a well loved venue.A ceiling fan helplessly attempted to cool the packed house, as the house music went down. Broadly, Saint owner Scott Stamper said, Asbury Lanes could be a positive development for Asbury’s music scene.“We will lose some here and there,” Stamper about shows, as the Asbury Park-based band Parlor Mob prepares to go on. Moments later, Parlor Mob unleashed a fretboard climbing, ear-ringing basher that picked up where Led Zeppelin and the White Stripes left off. People lifted drinks to the sky and pushed to the front as the band builds a blues tune.“These guys,” said Stamper, as he picks up his phone to stream video, “I think they have a chance to tour the world.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4b2c3c4b5fc5e23833f6d35482ab51eea0f6bb86/0_0_6635_3982/master/6635.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8415d512e28b46614d5c3c528ef612b5","title":"us immigration family separations beto orourke texas","story":"Responsibility for the separation of children from parents at the US border is “on all” Americans, a rising-star Texas Democrat said on Sunday, Father’s Day, and “not just the Trump administration” which has implemented the controversial policy.“I’d like to say it’s un-American but it’s happening right now in America,” said Beto O’Rourke, a US representative who in November will challenge Ted Cruz for his Senate seat. Speaking to CNN’s State of the Union, he added: “It is on all of us, not just the Trump administration. This is on all of us.”The senior White House adviser Kellyanne Conway, however, said the onus was on Democrats to end the policy by negotiating with the president on immigration reform and border security.Despite an unnamed Trump official having said this week that the brutal separation policy was meant “to force people to the table”, Conway denied that the administration was using children separated from their parents as “leverage”. In April 2018, the US attorney general, Jeff Sessions, announced a “zero tolerance” policy under which anyone who crossed the border without legal status would be prosecuted by the justice department. This includes some, but not all, asylum seekers. Because children can’t be held in adult detention facilities, they are being separated from their parents.Immigrant advocacy groups, however, say hundreds of families have been separated since at least July 2017.\u0026nbspMore than 200 child welfare groups, including the American Academy of Pediatrics and the United Nations, said they opposed the practice.\u0026nbspThey are supposed to enter the system for processing “unaccompanied alien children”, which exists primarily to serve children who voluntarily arrive at the border on their own. Unaccompanied alien children are placed in health department custody within 72 hours of being apprehended by border agents. They then wait in shelters for weeks or months at a time as the government searches for parents, relatives or family friends to place them with in the US.This already overstretched system has been thrown into chaos by the new influx of children.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspOn the other side, advocates for children have said they do not know how to find parents, who are more likely to have important information about why the family is fleeing its home country. And if, for instance, a parent is deported, there is no clear way for them to ensure their child is deported with them.When an influx of families and unaccompanied children fleeing Central America arrived at the border in 2014, Barack Obama’s administration detained families.This was harshly criticized and a federal court in 2015 stopped the government from holding families for months without explanation. Instead, they were released while they waited for their immigration cases to be heard in court. Not everyone shows up for those court dates, leading the Trump administration to condemn what it calls a “catch and release” program.According to Department of Homeland Security (DHS) figures, almost 2,000 children have been separated from their families at the border in six weeks. Amidst outcry, Donald Trump has stuck to the untrue claim that Democrats are to blame. On Saturday, the president tweeted: “Democrats can fix their forced family breakup at the Border by working with Republicans on new legislation, for a change! This is why we need more Republicans elected in November ... ”There is no law mandating separation of families. But White House policy is to maximize criminal prosecutions of people caught trying to enter the US illegally. That means more adults are jailed, pending trial, so children are removed from them. Before the Trump policy, many without a criminal record were referred for civil deportation, which generally did not break up families.The president of the American Academy of Pediatrics warned this week that forcibly separating children from their parents is a traumatic experience that will cause “irreparable harm”.On Sunday, Conway told NBC’s Meet the Press: “As a mother, as a Catholic, as somebody who has a conscience ... I will tell you that nobody likes this policy.” But she also echoed Trump in saying Democrats must negotiate. To the NBC host Chuck Todd’s suggestion that it “sounds like you’re holding the kids hostage to get the Democrats to the table to pass some law”, Conway said she “very forcefully” objected and added: “I certainly don’t want anybody to use these kids as leverage.”Earlier this week, an unnamed White House official told the Washington Post: “The president has told folks that in lieu of the laws being fixed, he wants to use the enforcement mechanisms that we have. The thinking in the building is to force people to the table.”A second official said: “If they aren’t going to cooperate, we are going to look to utilize the laws as hard as we can.”Trump’s repeated references to a Democratic law appear to involve one enacted in 2008 that was signed by a Republican president, George W Bush. It was focused on freeing and helping children who come to the border without a parent or  and did not call for family separation.The New York Times reported on Saturday that Stephen Miller, a hardliner who wrote the original travel ban on a list of Muslim-majority countries, is the chief driver of the separation policy. From 19 April to 31 May, 1,995 children were separated from 1,940 adults, according to DHS figures for official border crossings.As the president headed to his golf club on Sunday, Democrats staged protests at detention facilities. O’Rourke organized a march to Tornillo, Texas, and what has been described as a “tent structure” for 16- and 17-year-olds. Some had crossed the border on their own, O’Rourke told CNN. Others had made the journey with their parents and then been forcibly taken away.Those minors were now in Tornillo, he said, “with no idea no idea when or if they will see their mothers or their fathers, on this Father’s Day, again. This is inhumane. We will we be judged for what we do or what we fail to do now.”The Oregon senator Jeff Merkley led a group to the border near McAllen and Brownsville, Texas. On the other side of the country, seven members of Congress visited an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) facility in Elizabeth, New Jersey and demanded to speak to parents separated from their children.The group was denied entry for “over an hour”, they said, and police officers were called before they were allowed inside. At one point, New Jersey Democrat Bill Pascrell wrote, he and another member of Congress were “literally banging on the door to gain entry to the jail to see separated families”.New York’s Jerry Nadler told press and protesters people inside were “like the majority of migrants traveling from Central America, who are fleeing violence that has been well documented. Parents fleeing such unspeakable violence will do almost anything they can to protect their children from that violence. Instead they are being welcomed by more terror.”In a message to Trump on CNN, Illinois congressman Luis Guttierez said the president should “just be a dad”. “I’m sure you love your children,” he said. “Love these children the same way you love your own.”Earlier this week O’Rourke’s opponent, Cruz, defended the Trump policy, saying: “When you see reporters, when you see Democrats saying, ‘Don’t separate kids from their parents,’ what they’re really saying is don’t arrest illegal aliens.”On Father’s Day, Cruz tweeted: “My dad has been my hero my whole life. Here’s to wishing a very happy #FathersDay to all the dads out there!”One Republican congressman from Texas who visited the Tornillo camp said on Saturday it was “a symptom of a flawed strategy”.“In the land of the free and home of the brave we shouldn’t use kids as deterrence,” Will Hurd said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/35174e04dffc7795faecdd5f0794f665dd1aca7f/0_0_3463_2078/master/3463.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d9f28c125c2bf66c79e3830e1c30cb6b","title":"aquarius refusal was betrayal of european values says charity boss","story":"IFRC chief says migration is ‘a situation to manage humanely’ rather than a crisis to solveThe head of the world’s largest humanitarian network has accused Europe of betraying its fundamental values by ignoring the plight of the rescue ship Aquarius, as the 630 people it saved finally reached Spain after eight days of desperation, closed ports and rough seas.Malta and Italy’s refusal to take in the migrants and refugees rescued off the coast of Libya last weekend revealed the extent of the faultlines in EU migration policy, with the French president, Emmanuel Macron, condemning Rome’s “cynicism and irresponsibility”.The fate of those on board the Aquarius was only settled after the new Spanish government offered to take them in to help avert “a humanitarian catastrophe”.Speaking as the ship’s passengers reached Valencia on Sunday, Elhadj As Sy, the secretary general of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), praised Spain’s response but said Europe had let itself down.“There are values that are cultural values and values of civilisation and the world often looks up to Europe for those values,” he told the . “Not because Europe really owes it to the world but because Europe embodies those values. That’s what Europe stands for, that’s what Europe is promoting in its diplomacy, in its policy in its culture, in its civilisation.“When it comes now to applying those values and welcoming people in need – through solidarity, through care, through support, through humanity – a failure to do so is obviously a betrayal of those values.”Even after the political tumult of the past few days, Sy said the IFRC still expected the rest of Europe “to step up to the plate like Spain did”.Asked whether the Italian government’s stance had created a dangerous precedent, he replied: “I hope not. Despite what happened, which we regret, we cannot lose sight of the fact that Italy has been welcoming refugees in their tens of thousands over the years.”Sy’s strong language was echoed by Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), which operates the Aquarius with the charity SOS Méditerranée.“This whole episode is an indication of the failure of European migration and asylum policies,” said Karline Kleijer, head of emergencies at MSF. “It’s high time that politicians put lives before policies. If you look at European asylum and migration policies, the humanity has gone. It’s no longer about human beings but border management. We’ve lost our soul.”Kleijer said the standoff over the Aquarius’s passengers – and the five days it had taken to sail to Spain – had limited the ship’s search-and-rescue capacity. “That might cost lives,” she said.Hundreds of people onboard the ship were transferred to an Italian navy ship and an Italian coastguard vessel this week after Spain proposed Valencia as a safe harbour. The coastguard ship arrived at 6.20am on Sunday, followed five hours later by the Aquarius and, two hours after that, the navy vessel.Their passengers – including at least seven pregnant women, 104 children, as well as people who had been treated for hypothermia and fuel burns – were met by the Red Cross at the docks and given medical checks. Those needing urgent treatment were taken to hospital, while others were taken to a reception centre in the port where supplies of food, clothes, nappies and personal hygiene kits were distributed. An enormous banner hanging from the makeshift camp read “Welcome home” in Valencian, Spanish, English, French and Arabic.The operation, which was coordinated by Valencia’s regional government, also included 400 interpreters and staff from the UN refugee agency, UNHCR, who were present to help passengers fleeing war or persecution claim asylum.Among those rescued were people from Nigeria, Sudan, South Sudan, Eritrea, Ghana, Pakistan and Afghanistan. Although all 630 disembarked in Spain, Macron’s government has offered to take in anyone who wishes to settle in France once the necessary procedures have been completed.Aloys Vimard, MSF coordinator onboard the Aquarius, said the voyage to Spain had been difficult, with four-metre waves pitching the boat about and making people sick.He said many of the passengers had recounted being tortured, sexually assaulted and enslaved while they waited to cross over from Libya. “We’ve been hearing horrific stories. People tell us how they were exposed to a high level of violence – and even torture, including sexual violence,” he said. “It’s unfortunately very common that women are sharing these kinds of stories but we’ve also collected a significant number of testimonies from men who were exposed to this kind of violence. They were forced to witness men being raped in their cells while they were in captivity.”Vimard said one Nigerian man had told of being pushed into forced labour in Libya. “When he was leaving his cell, he saw a pregnant woman who was looking very, very bad and suffering. She was just lying on the floor and he wanted to ask her how she felt. He was beaten by the guards because he was taking care of this woman. He had to leave and when he came back from work, he heard the woman had died.”European leaders are due to discuss migration and asylum at a summit at the end of the month. Spain’s new foreign secretary, Josep Borrell, has described the country’s decision to welcome the Aquarius’s passengers as a “highly symbolic act” intended to jolt Europe out of its “ostrich politics” on the issue of migration.Sy said he hoped the meeting would include recognition of “migration as a situation to manage humanely and not as a crisis or a problem to solve”. He called for leadership, courage, humanity and “a quieter dialogue about migration without the fire and emotion of politics. Looking at it in a more sober way can help to address those extremely important issues.”He said countries such as Lebanon, Jordan, Turkey and Uganda had taken in millions of refugees between them with far less fuss than was being made over the arrival of 630 people in Europe.“I’m looking forward to the day when a boat like the Aquarius can dock in any port in Europe or any other part of the world without creating this media interest and being a sensation or an exception,” Sy said.

That’s how Jay-Z counterintuitively described it, in his autobiography. “We were kids without fathers … and in a way, that was a gift,” the rapper and businessman writes in Decoded. “We got to pick and choose the ancestors who would inspire the world we were going to make for ourselves.”If you choose the right inspirations, growing up without a dad can be a gift. But, as the title of Jay-Z’s album Blueprint 2: The Gift and the Curse suggests, there’s a flip side. Many of us who spend Father’s Day wishing we had somebody to celebrate with haven’t chosen the right influences as substitutes. We might not be making many choices at all.I grew up without a father regularly in my life. I would leave my mom’s house every morning searching for what was missing at home – the role models who could show me how to be a man. Like many kids in the same situation – and many of my peers were fatherless – I found those role models on television and in music.Jay-Z was one of them: the pre-Beyoncé Jay-Z of the late 1990s and early 2000s, big pimpin’ and trading disses with fellow New York rapper Nas. His tough-guy bravado, glorification of crime, flashy jewelry and videos full of dancing women captivated me. I tried my best to emulate him and other rappers. My friends and I wanted to use drugs and thought selling them was cool we got into fights, skipped classes and in some cases dropped out altogether. Studying seemed boring when compared to the gangster fairytales we shared. Delayed gratification, which is vital to living life with long-term benefits in mind, was a foreign concept.I have no interest in blaming Jay-Z – or any other man – for playing a role in my life he didn’t ask for. My father uniquely carried the responsibility of setting an example for me. But he, too, had fallen to the curse of fatherlessness. Born an orphan in Kenya, he was re-orphaned at 14 when his adoptive parents passed away. He persevered, working his way from an apprentice at the Hilton Hotel in Nairobi to a chef at the Hilton Hotel in London by the time he was 21. When the time came for him to have a family of his own, however, the curse caught up with him. He didn’t know how to be a husband to my mom or a dad to me. He had no examples from his past or his present to provide guidance. Unlike the years my father spent training with other chefs to learn how to succeed in the kitchen, he had no role models to show him how to be a family man. It didn’t take long for my father to give up and disappear.Evidently, it’s not easy to fill the void – but even easier to find the wrong influences. Kids today are exposed to a much broader range of media technologies than I was in the 1990s through which to find examples for what a “man” is. Online communities formed through social media and discussion boards can exert their own kind of masculine peer pressure: incel (“involuntarily celibate”) culture, which became the subject of international media coverage after this year’s mass murders in Parkland, Florida and my hometown, Toronto, is an example of how young men can develop resentful, angry and self-victimizing masculine identities while having these identities reinforced by an online peer group.As president, Barack Obama made it a priority to deliberately and strategically steer vulnerable young men away from the negative influences that affect fatherless kids. His initiative My Brother’s Keeper (MBK) galvanized foundations, businesses, local governments and community groups to promote a milestones-based example for young men to follow, including reading at grade level by grade three, attending postsecondary education and staying out of the criminal justice system. MBK offered a way to identify healthy role models at different stages of a young man’s life without being overly exclusive in defining who and what a man can be. MBK was renamed just before Obama left the White House and seems to have gone quiet as a federal government initiative. It continues as a nongovernmental organization.My search for role models wasn’t as deliberate or strategic as Obama advocates for, but after years of trial and error I was able to find positive role models in community college and then university. In particular, professors showed me how learn to read and write effectively, built my self-esteem and encouraged me to find new peer groups. Professors also connected me with role models in books, such as Martin Luther King Jr, Malcolm X, Booker T Washington, Marcus Garvey and WEB Du Bois, who demonstrated the ersity of ways men can and do exist in the world. With the right support, not having a dad became an opportunity for me to choose positive inspirations.A few weeks into my first semester at Yale law school, Jay-Z published his autobiography. It turned out he had transformed over the same period of time I had. In an interview about his book, he recalled the lyrics to one of his songs that I loved as a kid (Big Pimpin’) and confessed: “I can’t believe I said that. And kept saying it. What kind of animal would say this sort of thing?”Today, Jay-Z’s example as a husband and father, detailed in last year’s album 4:44, helps me when thinking about how to be a good partner to my girlfriend and a good father figure to her son, responsibilities for which I often feel deeply unprepared. Knowing that others are fighting a legacy of fatherlessness in their own lives motivates me to continue believing, trying and learning. For those of us lucky enough to eventually see growing up without a dad as a positive opportunity, the challenge remains for us to help more fatherless kids find life’s gifts and escape its curses."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/18fb13aef8d0ea730cd090ca2e0589c74e29d760/0_0_3700_2220/master/3700.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0a5656f5adaa5d98216b768da0bd60c4","title":"taliban refuse to extend truce with afghan forces","story":"Militants posed for selfies with soldiers and handed out red roses during Eid ceasefireAfghanistan’s first taste of peace in 17 years is expected to end after the Taliban refused to extend a three-day ceasefire during which civilians, militants and soldiers hugged and danced together over the festival of Eid.The Taliban’s decision to take up arms once more comes despite the Afghan president, Ashraf Ghani, on Saturday indefinitely extending the Afghan government’s own ceasefire and his request that the militant group follow suit to prolong the first countrywide lull in hostilities since the US invasion in 2001. Hopes are nevertheless higher than ever before that an agreement can one day be reached. On Sunday the Taliban ordered their fighters not to enter major cities after an Islamic State suicide bombing killed 26 people in Narangahar province, near the city of Jalalabad. Another Isis suicide attack in Jalalabad on Saturday killed 17.However, the ceasefire between Afghan forces and the Taliban was scrupulously observed and some analysts said the order to fighters not to enter cities stemmed from concern that they might enjoy peace too much. “Of course the leadership might fear some of them just stay,” said Thomas Ruttig, of the Afghan Analysts Network (AAN).Over three days, Afghans witnessed the kind of scenes few dreamed possible. Thousands of Taliban fighters were welcomed into Kabul, Kunduz, Ghazni and other cities. Some posed for selfies with soldiers, some handed out red roses, and in Kabul some sought out a famous ice-cream parlour. News of the ceasefire’s end came as a blow to many fighters. “I and thousands of Afghan Taliban definitely want the ceasefire extended,” Muhammadullah, 22, told the . “I went to the city and the mosques were full of people, I did not notice anything against the Islamic rules. After the sweet three days of peace, going back to bloodshed looks strange. How can you even compare peace with war?”The Taliban senior council met on Sunday to discuss the ceasefire and Ghani’s overture. According to insiders, the leadership was stunned by the jubilant scenes in city centres.The hardline deputy leader and son of Mullah Omar, Mullah Yaqoob, was particularly dismayed. In an audio message obtained by the , he said there had been “no permission for mixing with Afghan forces”, which he said “totally disobeyed the terms of the ceasefire”.One senior Taliban member said the leadership, recognising the pressure for peace within the group’s ranks, was considering a 10-day ceasefire over the next Eid festival, in September.However, he said there was disappointment that Ghani had not been more specific on the subject of US troop withdrawal. “Ghani should have created a timeline,” he said. “That might have created attraction to extend the ceasefire.”Michael Kugelman, of the Wilson Centre, said a tit-for-tat extension had never been likely. “If the Taliban’s to agree to a reconciliation process, it will do so at a time of its own choosing and not by reciprocating the government’s own moves,” he said.Yet civilian pressure on the Taliban to negotiate is growing. A convoy of 80 civilians on a 400-mile peace march from the capital of Helmand province, Lashkar Gah, to Kabul has come to symbolise the stubborn determination of the public to end a war that has brought so much loss. Conditions abroad have also rarely been as conducive for talks. Pakistan, long thought of as a spoiler, has held an increasing number of bilateral negotiations with Afghanistan since the middle of 2017, partly under pressure from China, its key ally in the region. On 12 June the army chief, General Qamar Javed Bajwa, visited Kabul and expressed support for the ceasefire.

Researchers compiling this year’s Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC) study, a four-yearly analysis on 48 countries, say Dutch children’s happiness scores are up again.It contrasts starkly with the picture in countries like Britain, where depression and anxiety are on the rise among teenagers, and the US, where the number of young people taking their own lives has risen sharply.So why is this flat, damp country of 17 million people with its history of Calvinism and colonialism so good at giving young people an optimistic outlook?Dr Simone de Roos, a researcher at the Netherlands Institute for Social Research (SCP), says initial findings from the 90-question HBSC survey of a representative 7,000 teenagers, to be published later this year, suggest life satisfaction has risen since 2013.“I think Dutch children have generally positive interactions in all their social surroundings,” says De Roos. “They have a supportive environment at home, with friends and also at school. Dutch parents give a lot of support and have mild control. There’s an egalitarian climate, teachers are not authoritarian but accept the feelings of pupils, and pupils trust teachers.”News doesn\u0027t always have to be bad – indeed, the relentless focus on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame risks convincing the public that the world is hopeless and there is nothing we can do.This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come.Readers can recommend other projects, people and progress that we should report on by contacting us at theupside@theAccording to that report, young people in the Netherlands were also in the top five for eating breakfast on weekdays, watching more than two hours of weekday television, having kind and helpful classmates – and in the bottom five for being overweight, having sex before 15, and feeling pressure from schoolwork. They were less likely than average to experience bullying and generally found it easy to talk to parents.The results chime with a 2016 Dutch Statistics Office study of 4,000 people from 12 to 25, who ranked their happiness at 8.4 out of 10, and a PISA report in 2015 noting that the country – alongside Finland and Switzerland – seemed “able to combine good learning outcomes with highly satisfied students”.Of course, the general state of the nation helps. There is little unemployment in the Netherlands, relatively low inequality and a healthy economy. Five months ago the SCP compared the Netherlands favourably with 25 years ago, while another study showed people were more optimistic than last year. “At some point there’s a critical mass of optimistic voices, and then it gets its own dynamic,” says Prof Paul Dekker, the SCP programme leader in values and meaning.The director of the World Database of Happiness, Prof Ruut Veenhoven, also believes young people are less burdened by an expectation to “be good”.“If you look across Europe, the Dutch and the Danes are the most lenient and focus more on developing autonomy than giving priority to obedience – and that fits the society,” he says. “Children are more free to do what they want, and in doing what they want, develop an idea of what they really like and social skills. A happy boy may be sometimes not a very good boy.”In Dutch, there is no phrase that means literally “you are a good boy” or “good girl”, says 14-year-old Tjalling Appelhof, from Amsterdam. “You say ‘bravo, lad’ or ‘well done’ or ‘thank you’,” he says. Like most Dutch teenagers, he cycles to school and feels he has a good level of self-determination. “I can say how late I come home – not at 3am, I mean, but some time before bedtime!” he says. “I think I have enough freedom.”Despite the country’s reputation for cannabis smoking, the Trimbos Institute reports a downward trend for using alcohol and drugs and smoking in Dutch children aged 12 to 16. Such activities are described by HBSC experts as “risk behaviours” that impact happiness.Other negatives are bullying and fighting. At Groen van Prinstererlyceum, Dani Karremans, a 16-year-old majoring in sciences, believes such pressures are not extreme in the Netherlands.“If I compare things with other countries and especially other schools, you hear that people are bullied, often seriously,” he says. “Here, you don’t really see that. If people try to bully me, I just ignore it. I’ve got my own friends who I get on with. I don’t have a social ‘image’ or think that everyone has to like me – it’s not realistic.”Dani, whose mother is Indonesian and Polish and whose father is Moroccan, says his father spends more time on Facebook than he does.Saffron Jones, also 16, and majoring in social sciences, is half-English and half-Dutch. She says that from when her parents split up 11 years ago, her friendship group has always been supportive. “I could always stay with my friends at primary school. Now, if I’m stressed about school, mostly one of my friends is good in that subject, so I’ll call them and they help. It calms me down.”The Dutch school system – almost entirely public –incorporates major exams at about the age of 12 and three levels of secondary education from practical to the most academic. But it is possible to progress from one to the other or repeat a year and, despite concerns about dropping standards and increasing segregation, such flexibility could make for less stress.There are social problems such as differences between minority ethnic and native Dutch achievement, while one in nine children grows up in poverty. But Jacqueline Boerefijn, a biology teacher at the Groen van Prinstererlyceum, says even if a school wants to expel a child, it must find another school for them, so there are incentives to deal with issues.But Boerefijn, who developed happiness classes at the school a decade ago, and also gives positive psychology lessons to educators, is worried that Dutch children are under threat from new pressures around educational achievement.“Please stop putting the bar higher, because we have happy children,” she says. “We already have so many highly educated people, and at the moment there are not enough people to do the plumbing and carpentry jobs.”For Tjalling, it is pretty simple. “In the Netherlands we are rich, most things around children are well organised, like school and healthcare, and if people are poor, we try to help them. That’s maybe why children are happy.“It rains a lot. But you get used to it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8c7d28b4bbf0e52b80e9a21abdde5b26911f55ba/85_37_2563_1538/master/2563.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4d8975712fe67d2844ec0a1f1823c212","title":"woman swallowed giant python indonesia","story":"Seven-metre snake found during search for woman who had gone to do some gardeningAn Indonesian woman has been found in the belly of a giant python after the swollen snake was captured near where she vanished while tending her vegetable garden, police said on Saturday.The body of 54-year-old Wa Tiba was found on Friday when villagers cut open the seven-metre (23ft) python which was found bloated in the village of Persiapan Lawela on the island of Muna, off Sulawesi.“Residents were suspicious the snake swallowed the victim, so they killed it, then carried it out of the garden,” said local police chief Hamka. “The snake’s belly was cut open and the body of the victim was found inside.”About 100 residents and relatives launched a search for the woman after she failed to return from her garden on Thursday night. Hamka said villagers found the giant serpent lying about 30 metres from Tiba’s sandals and machete, adding she was swallowed head first and her body was found intact.The garden in which she disappeared was at the base of a rocky cliff, pockmarked by caves, and known to be home to snakes, Hamka added.Giant pythons, which regularly top six metres, are commonly found in Indonesia and the Philippines.While they have been known to attack small animals, attempts to eat people are rare.In March last year, a farmer was killed by a python in the village of Salubiro on Sulawesi island."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3533905.1529255164!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"lies damned lies and university rankings","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSince their origins in 2003, there are now approximately 17 different global university rankings. The overwhelming majority  are developed by commercial, often media, companies with only approximately 7 per cent developed by a government organisation. File photograph: Getty ImagesMark Twain popularised the phrase, attributed to Disraeli, “lies, damned lies and statistics”. A modern-day take could apply well to university rankings.Take for instance the headlines that appeared in three major Irish newspapers recently.According to the Irish Examiner, “Irish colleges perform well in international rankings” having “been graded above international averages for teaching and learning standards in an international ranking system”.According to The , the picture is one of despair as “Irish universities tumble down latest set of world rankings”. The Irish Independent was equally despondent, claiming the “country’s higher education sector falls further in global rankings”.The Irish Universities Association was not far behind in its lamentations – identifying the situation as “alarming” and placing the blame on the “impact of funding cuts over the years”. Those cuts are real and their implications serious, but we don’t need rankings to tell us that.The confusion is compounded when we reflect that this time last year, The  proclaimed Trinity College and UCD had “climbed in latest world rankings” based on “positive sentiment from employers”. And the Global Innovation Index ranked Ireland at overall 10th in the world.The clue to unravelling the mysteries of rankings can be found in the rankings themselves. The “positive” results are in the European Union-sponsored U-Multirank (UMR), while the “negative” results are in the 2019 QS World University Rankings.Since their origins in 2003, there are now approximately 17 different global rankings.The overwhelming majority of rankings are developed by commercial, often media, companies with only approximately 7 per cent developed by a government organisation. UMR stands out as one of the latter.The popularity of rankings owes much to their simplicity. They claim to compare universities using a range of indicators which are given weightings based upon the criteria of the rankings compiler, and each compiler chooses its own methodology. There is no internationally objective set of criteria and there is no intrinsic reason why indicators need to be either weighted or aggregated into a single score.Many of the areas measured are important, but annual comparisons are misguided because institutions do not, and cannot, change significantly from year to year. Many of the indicators, or their proxies, have at best an indirect relationship to faculty or educational quality and could actually be counter-productive.Despite a common nomenclature, rankings differ from each other. “Which university is best” is asked differently depending upon which ranking is asking the question. This presents a problem for users who perceive the final results as directly comparable. They are not.The current situation is a case in point. QS is one of the “big three”, alongside Shanghai’s Academic Ranking of World Universities (ARWU) and the Times Higher Education World Rankings (THE).QS claim to measure performance under academic reputation, employer reputation, student-faculty ratio, citations, international faculty and international student ratio.But these categories hide the fact that, when weightings are attached, rankings are essentially a measure of research and reputation. For QS, allowing for some overlaps, research equates to 70 per cent of the overall total, and 50 per cent for reputation. Both ARWU and THE are based on 100 per cent researchresearch-related indicators.In contrast, U-Multirank is a multi-dimensional ranking, with a strong emphasis on user customisation. It does not create a single score or profile. Rather it encourages comparability of similar types of universities. It measures performance under educational profile, student profile, research involvement, knowledge exchange, international orientation and regional engagement.As such, U-Multirank is more sophisticated than other rankings – but its complexity is less compelling than the simplicity of QS. It is noteworthy that teaching and learning, the student experience or societal engagement don’t feature in the ranking which has received the most attention by universities or the media. Yet, those are key objectives of the Irish higher education system.Rankings are superficially attractive in their apparent ability to provide simple, quick and easy measurements, but they can misrepresent and foster a strategy of “picking winners” with unintended consequences.In assessing the performance of the higher education system, is it not far better to use indicators which align with national social and economic objectives rather than adopting indicators chosen by commercial organisations for their own purposes?None of us would accept a student’s homework based on the shoddy methodology employed by most ranking systems. Yet, we are quick to use rankings when the opportunity suits us and the case we want to make.One of the big lessons of global rankings is the extent to which higher education policy and institutional strategies have become vulnerable to an agenda set by others. We ignore this at our peril.Ellen Hazelkorn is a founding partner in BH Associates www.bhassociates.eu and the author of ‘Rankings and the Reshaping of Higher Education’ ( 2015)."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"New building will be biggest ever capital investment by Department of Foreign AffairsVaradkar adopts benign D\u0026aacuteil approach to possible post-election supportersIbiza flight reroutes to Paris after group of up to 20 holidaymakers involved in disturbanceWomen in some of the poorest parts of Dublin are taking their own lives in the same numbers as men for the first timeVaradkar delivers annual commemoration for former taoiseach in Deansgrange CemeteryAbortion vote: Bishop of Kilmore Dr Leo O\u0026rsquoReilly says church no longer dominant in societySix men who pressed for commission of investigation are pleased at Flanagan proposalsBody was found on the road from Castlecor to John\u0026rsquos Bridge at Ballybane in Liscarroll\u0026lsquoI don\u0026rsquot know where we are going to go,\u0026rsquo says Ayo Adeshin, a single mother of threeListowel-born author and historian has had several books publishedProperty owner involved in a number of disputes with tenants at Mountjoy SquarePensioner (73) sustained serious injuries when car he was driving collided with ditchDublin plays host to series of events staged to celebrate James Joyce\u0026rsquos Ulysses on BloomsdaySon of fire victim in hospital with serious burns having come to his aidA file is being prepared for the DPP after suspect was arrested on Friday morningMan (32) killed by a passing vehicle while walking on the N4 near Newtownforbes"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3533998.1529261112!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ryanair urges pre 10am airport alcohol ban after flight diverted","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA group of drunken Irish-based holidaymakers forced an Ibiza-bound Ryanair flight from Dublin to ert to Paris on Saturday morning.

Even the team’s own manager appeared less than convinced.But after months of doom and gloom, the nation suddenly believes again. Inevitably perhaps on the eve of England’s first match in the 2018 World Cup, supporters are dreaming of glory. Or at least avoiding failing miserably.The odds on England winning the World Cup were slashed last night from 20-1 a week ago down to 14-1 while that tell-tale barometer of optimism - the purchase of a brand new television - has seen a huge rise in the sale of smarter sets and a ditching of older models.In Volgograd yesterday, ahead of England’s opening game against Tunisia, supporters were starting to wonder if the youngest squad in years could finally deliver after 52 years of hurt.“England can definitely win the World Cup,” declared Luke King, 37, from Bournemouth, one of only 2,000 or so fans who had made the trip to the southern Russian city for the opener.Wearing a red England shirt, he had visited the towering The Motherland Calls statue that dominates the city, formerly known as Stalingrad. “It is better we are coming from such a low expectation. We are not normally realistic. It’s right to have had a realtiy check.”England fans gather in VolgogradAdam Haimes, 29, a geologist from Ilminster in Somerset, unfurling a George’s flag in front of the ‘sensitive’ monument, was suddenly optimistic. “Can England win? Statistically yes. Certainly the quarter finals or semi finals are in our grasp. There’s been no expectation this time which is great.”Kev Johnson, 45, from Nottingham, at the tournament with his 71-year-old father and his brother, added: “England can definitely win. There is a camaraderie. We haven’t seen an England squad that gets on with each other like this one does. Nobody has expected us to do well.”On Sunday evening, ex-England footballer Gary Lineker backed England\u0027s chances of  World Cup success.  After Germany last 1-nil to Mexico, the Match of the Day host quipped to  pundit Alan Shearer: “Well, Alan. If Germany can lose, surely England can  win.” Gareth Southgate, the England manager, has been dampening expectation, saying he is ‘realistic’ about what can be achieved. He has insisted that “we don’t want to inhibit people’s beliefs.” but accepted, with some understatement, that “unfortunately the last couple of tournaments haven’t gone so well for us”.Russia World Cup in pictures: Best photos of teams, games and playersDan Ashworth, the English FA technical director, said the sudden upturn in optimism was nothing new. We always do this as a nation — expectations are low and as soon as we get to the World Cup, everybody gets their enthusiasm going,” he said, adding: “If a World Cup cannot inspire a nation, then I’m not sure what can.”The fans’ belief comes from a decent build up, with wins in warm-up matches a lack of injuries and a sense that this team is no longer encumbered with bigger names - like Wayne Rooney and Steven Gerrard - who failed in the past. The defeat of Germany last night to Mexico potentially makes England’s passage through the tournament that bit easier.Coral, the bookmakers, cut England’s odds on winning the World Cup to 14-1 last night and made them overwhelming 4-11 favourites to beat Tunisia. The odds reflect a nation’s thinking.Wales Street in Oldham has temporarily been renamed by its residents as England Street The gambling firm’s David Stevens said: England have enjoyed a smooth build up to this World Cup, and the odds say they should get off to a winning start against Tunisia.If they gain an impressive victory in Volgograd, the current odds of 14-1 about them lifting the World Cup will disappear, and we could well see the start of a patriotic surge of support from punters. Brazil remain 7-2 favourites.The British Beer and Pub Association suggested the renewed optimism would trigger what it called “a near £2billion booze-up in pubs and at home”.The trade body reckons 900 million pints - 200 million more than usual - will be drunk over the next month. A spokesman said: If England steamroller a team, excitement will build and more beer will be drunk.”World Cup 2018 | The best of the \u0026#039s coverageAt the Railway Tavern in Dereham, Norfolk, the pub landlord Paul Sandford has built hiw own grandstand so pubgoers can watch the game as if at the match.

Over the next two years, he took part in a colonial campaign of racial extermination that left 100,000 Africans dead. Tens of thousands were driven into the desert to die of dehydration. Others died in concentration camps.Almost thirty years later, as the Nazi governor of Bavaria, the same man would preside over the establishment of the first concentration camp in Germany at Dachau, and deportation of thousands of Jews to the death camps of the Holocaust.Von Epp is just one of the figures explored in a new art exhibition opening in Hamburg on Monday which aims to shine a light on Germany’s forgotten genocide.Thirty years before the Holocaust, between 1904 and 1908 German colonial troops in Africa attempted to exterminate the Herero and Nama peoples of what is now Namibia. It was the first genocide of the 20th century.Many of the features that would later become synonymous with Nazi Germany were already there: concentration camps, race theory, twisted scientific experiments and mass slaughter.Neville Chamberlain walks past an Nazi honor guard on the way to a meeting with Adolf Hitler over the latter\u0026#39s threats to invade Czechoslovakia in 1938But it is the genocide modern Germany would rather not talk about. While the country has confronted its historic responsibility for the Holocaust, for decades the genocide of the Herero and Nama was swept under the carpet.Angela Merkel’s government finally recognised the killing as a genocide in 2016. But it has not formally apologised and has steadfastly refused to consider paying reparations.Unser Afrika, or “Our Africa”, aims to change that. The exhibition is being hosted by the Hamburg regional government, in what some are seeing as a direct challenge to Mrs Merkel’s government over the issue.Marc Erwin Babej, a 48-year-old German-American-Jewish art photographer, took a team of models to the genocide sites in Namibia to try to uncover what made German colonial troops try to exterminate the Herero and Nama peoples.The exhibition explores how the colonists wanted to build a German Utopia in Africa, without considering the Africans already living there.Mr Babej’s mother and grandmother were both Holocaust survivors, and his own German-Jewish identity played a role, he says.“As the son and grandson of Holocaust survivors I’m a descendant of the victims. But when it comes to the Herero and Nama genocide, as a German I’m a descendant of the perpetrators.”The links between the African genocide and the Holocaust are often disturbing.“Nazi policies of eastward expansion and Lebensraum bear a striking similarity to settler colonialism. In my understanding Nazi expansionism was a second German attempt to create a colonial empire, this time in the east,” says Prof  Jürgen Zimmerer of Hamburg University, the foremost expert on the Herero genocide.But Germany has been slow to recognise the enormity of what happened in Namibia.“It was only in 2016 that the German government gave up its resistance to using the term genocide,” says Prof Zimmerer.But things are beginning to change. Earlier this year, local councillors in Berlin agreed to renames streets in the city’s “African Quarter” named after German colonial figures.More significantly, Germany is facing a class action lawsuit in New York brought by descendants of the genocide victims to force it to pay reparations.

New research suggests a vital link between our ability to sense our physical bodies and knowing how we feelClick to followThe Independent OnlineSuch profound problems with emotion are sometimes associated with autismStephen has been married twice. Two wedding days. Two “I do”s. Yet Stephen has no happy memories from either – or, in fact, from the marriages or any of his relationships.\u0026nbspHe met his first wife on a pre-nursing course when he was just 16. Six years later, they were married. Three years after that, they got orced she was never really the right one for him, he says.Almost two decades on, in 2009, he met his second wife through a dating site. He threw himself into the relationship and, the following year, with his father and her two adult siblings present, they married at the registrar’s office in Sheffield, where they both live.\u0026nbspHe put on smiles for the wedding photos because he recognised that they were expected but, as he explains: “From an inner feeling point of view, anything I do that requires an emotional response feels like a fake.“Most of my responses are learned responses. In an environment where everyone is being jolly and happy, it feels like I’m lying. Acting. Which I am. So it is a lie.”\u0026nbspHappiness isn’t the only emotion that Stephen struggles with. Excitement, shame, disgust, anticipation, even love… he doesn’t feel these, either. “I feel something but I’m unable to distinguish in any real way what that feeling is.” The only emotions he is familiar with are fear and anger.\u0026nbspSuch profound problems with emotion are sometimes associated with autism, which Stephen does not have, or with psychopathy, which he doesn’t have, either.Last year, at the age of 51, he finally learned what he does have: a little-known condition called alexithymia, a word made from Greek parts meaning, roughly, “no words for emotion”.Despite the name, the real problem for people with alexithymia isn’t so much that they have no words for their emotions, but that they lack the emotions themselves. Still, not everyone with the condition has the same experiences. Some have gaps and distortions in the typical emotional repertoire.Some realise they’re feeling an emotion, but don’t know which, while others confuse signs of certain emotions for something else – perhaps interpreting butterflies in the stomach as hunger pangs.\u0026nbspSurprisingly, given how generally unrecognised it is, studies show that about one in 10 people fall on the alexithymia spectrum. New research is now revealing what’s going wrong – and this work holds the promise not only of novel treatments for disorders of emotion, but of revealing just how the rest of us feel anything at all.\u0026nbspAfter working as a nurse for 10 years, Stephen decided he wanted to do something different. A two-year Access to University course led to a degree in astronomy and physics, and then to a job testing computer games.He built a successful career for himself, working for various companies in their computer testing departments, managing teams, and travelling around the world to speak at conferences. He had no problem conveying facts to colleagues.It was in the context of more personal relationships – or any other scenario that would typically involve expressions of emotion – that he felt things were “wrong”.\u0026nbsp“At the beginning of a relationship, I’m totally into who that person is,” he explains. “I’ve been told I’m very good at maintaining a honeymoon period for ‘longer than expected’. But after a year it takes a massive turn. It all falls apart. I’ve put myself on a pedestal to be this person which I’m really not. I react mostly cognitively, rather than it being emotions making me react. Obviously, that is not valid. It’s not real. It seems fake. Because it is fake. And you can only pretend for so long.”\u0026nbspHe and his current wife stopped living together in 2012. He saw a GP and was prescribed antidepressants. Though he was still in contact with his wife, it was clear that the relationship was no longer working. In June 2015, he attempted suicide.“I had actually been posting on Facebook and Twitter regarding killing myself and someone – I’ve never found out who – contacted the police. I was taken to hospital and treated.”\u0026nbspA psychiatrist referred Stephen for a series of counselling sessions and then a course of psychodynamic psychotherapy, a type of Freudian-based therapy that, in trying to uncover unconscious drivers of thoughts and behaviour, is similar to psychoanalysis.\u0026nbspIt was in a book called Why Love Matters by Sue Gerhardt, which his therapist recommended, that he first came across the concept of alexithymia.“I brought it up in therapy, and that’s when we started talking about how I was very alexithymic. Obviously, I’ve got a vocabulary. I’ve got words for emotions. But whether they’re the right words for the right emotion is a different point altogether… I just thought that I wasn’t good at talking about how I feel and emotions and stuff like that. But after a year of therapy, it became apparent that when I talk about emotions I don’t actually know what I’m talking about.”The term “alexithymic” dates from a book published in 1972 and has its origins in Freudian psychodynamic literature.Freudian ideas are now out of favour with most academic psychologists, as Geoff Bird, a professor of psychology at the University of Oxford explains. “Not to disrespect those traditions, but in the cognitive, neuro, experimental field, not so many people are really very interested in anything associated with Freud any more.”But when Bird read about alexithymia, he found the descriptions intriguing. “Actually, it’s really quite amazing.” For most people, “at a low level of emotion, you might be a bit unsure about exactly what you’re feeling, but if you have a strong emotion, you know what it is”. And yet somehow, here were people who simply did not know.\u0026nbspBird started his academic career studying autism spectrum disorder, empathy and emotional awareness, which led to his interest in alexithymia.In one of his first studies in this field, he linked alexithymia, as measured with a 20-item checklist developed at the University of Toronto, with a lack of empathy. If you can’t feel your own emotions in the typical way, it makes sense that you can’t identify with those of others, either.\u0026nbspBut what really drew Bird into alexithymia research were his interactions with people with autism. “There has been this perception that people with autism don’t have empathy. And that’s rubbish. And you can see that immediately as soon as you meet some autistic people.”In a series of studies, Bird has found that about half of people with autism have alexithymia – it’s these people who struggle with emotion and empathy, while the rest do not. In other words, emotion-related difficulties are intrinsic to the alexithymia, not to the autism.Bird is passionate about spreading this message. He talks with feeling about one particular autistic study volunteer who did not have alexithymia: “A lovely guy with an IQ we couldn’t measure, it’s that good. He couldn’t hold down a job. But he volunteered to work at a care home because he wanted to do something productive with his time.“They said, ‘Oh because you’ve got a diagnosis of autism you can’t do empathy, therefore you can’t look after our elderly people.’ Which is just ridiculous.”\u0026nbspBird has since run a series of studies exploring alexithymia outside the context of autism. He has found, for example, that people with the condition have no trouble recognising faces, or distinguishing pictures of people smiling and frowning.“But for a few of our really alexithymic people, while they can tell a smile and a frown apart, they have no idea what they are. That is really quite strange.”\u0026nbspMany of the people with the condition who Bird has met talk about being told by other people that they’re different, though some do recognise it in themselves early on.“I guess it’s a bit like not being able to see colour, and everybody’s always banging on about how red this is or how blue, and you come to realise there’s an aspect of human experience that you’re just not participating in.”As well as better characterising alexithymia, Bird and his colleagues have also dug into what explains it, taking what could seem to be a circular argument – Stephen has problems with emotion because he has alexithymia, which is characterised by problems with emotion – and blowing it right apart.In situations that Stephen recognises as being in theory highly emotional – like telling someone “I love you” – he experiences changes inside his body. “I feel my heart race and this rush of adrenaline, but to me that feeling is always scary. I don’t know how to react. It makes me want to either run away or react verbally aggressively.”\u0026nbspFear and anger – and confusion – he understands. “Everything else just feels all the same… it’s this feeling of, ‘Errrr, I’m not quite comfortable with this – it’s not quite right’.”\u0026nbsp“Similarly with anxiety, it might be that someone experiences an emotional response associated with a fast heartbeat – which might be excitement – but they don’t know how to interpret that, and they could panic about what’s happening in their body.”\u0026nbspThe ability to detect changes inside the body – everything from a racing heart to a ersion of blood flow, from a full bladder to a distension of the lungs – is known as interoception. It’s your perception of your own internal state.\u0026nbspDifferent emotions are associated with different physical changes. In anger, for example, the heart rate rises, blood rushes to the face, and fists clench. In fear, the heart rate also rises but blood drains from the face.It’s generally thought that these changes are not entirely specific to inidual emotions, and so context is also important: if you feel your heart racing and you’re looking at a spider, you know it’s fear that you’re feeling, not sexual arousal.\u0026nbspWhat Bird, Brewer and others have found in people with alexithymia is a reduced ability, sometimes a complete inability, to produce, detect or interpret these internal bodily changes. People with the condition have normal-range IQs.They can understand as well as anyone else that they’re seeing a spider, rather than an attractive potential partner. But either their brains aren’t triggering the physical changes that it seems are needed for the experience of an emotion, or other regions of their brains aren’t reading these signals properly.\u0026nbspIn 2016, Bird and Brewer, along with Richard Cook at City University in London, published a research paper that characterised alexithymia as a “generalised deficit of interoception”.Here, then, was an explanation for these people’s problems with emotion – but also, in effect, a manifesto stating that the perception of a range of bodily signals is important for the experience of emotion in the rest of us.\u0026nbspIt’s an idea that we already express in everyday language: in English, for an apology to mean anything, it has to be “heartfelt”. If you truly love someone, it’s with “all your heart”.When you’re really angry, your “blood boils”. Instead of saying that you’re anxious, you might talk about having “butterflies in your stomach” (thought to be caused by a ersion of blood flow away from the digestive system).While most people may not be familiar with alexithymia, there is a different disorder involving flat emotions and poor empathy that seems to fascinate us, even more than it repels us: psychopathy. Can we learn more about how we feel by understanding psychopaths?Lieke Nentjes is in her early thirties. She’s slender and softly spoken it’s hard to picture her spending countless hours in small rooms with incarcerated, unshackled psychopaths, including serially violent men who have committed murder.\u0026nbsp“Then he explained that he was at the end of his therapy and was ‘resocialising’ and no one would hire him because they were intimidated by him. He wasn’t really angry. He was frustrated.”While the nature of psychopathy is still debated, psychologists generally agree that it entails, among other things, a lack of empathy or guilt, shallow emotions, and antisocial behaviour – treating other people badly and, in some cases, engaging in criminal acts.\u0026nbspIt has certainly been suggested that the reason some psychopaths are able to torture or murder people is that they don’t process emotions properly – they don’t feel fear, for example, and they don’t recognise it in others.\u0026nbspNentjes is based at the University of Amsterdam. Here in the Netherlands, if a criminal is found to have a psychological condition that relates to the crime, he or she is deemed to be only partially responsible.Such criminals might spend a few years in a regular jail before being sent to a secure treatment centre, or they may be sent straight for treatment.\u0026nbspNentjes decided to assess a range of criminals from these centres and from jails to find out just how psychopathic they were (with particular attention to different aspects of psychopathy), to learn about their lives – their upbringing, and their criminal behaviour – and also to measure their interoceptive ability.\u0026nbsp“Emotion is very central when you look at psychopathy – or rather, lack of emotion,” she says. So could it be that psychopathic offenders just aren’t very in touch with their bodies?\u0026nbspIn the course of the interviews, Nentjes asked questions to probe their levels of empathy, and how much remorse they felt about what they had done to their victims. “Some were just completely honest, and would say, ‘I don’t care,’” she says.“Others who were psychopathic would say, ‘Oh, but I’m very empathic.’ They had learned the lingo to describe feelings very accurately and they could talk about compassionate, empathic feelings towards others – but then when you look at the crimes they have committed…” Her sentence trails off.\u0026nbsp“There is research finding that psychopathic offenders can describe emotions in terms of words, but they lack the inner experience of the emotion,” she adds.\u0026nbspSince assessing a person’s ability to detect a range of bodily signals is tricky, the most commonly used measures of interoceptive sensitivity are based on judgements of heart rate. One test involves asking participants to count their heartbeats over varying periods – 25 or 50 seconds, perhaps – multiple times.About 10 per cent of us are good at counting heartbeats, 5 to 10 per cent are very bad, and the rest fall somewhere in between.In another test, volunteers are played a series of beeps that are either in sync or out of sync with their heartbeat, and asked which it is. On this type of task, about 10 per cent of the general population can do it really well, and 80 per cent can’t do it at all.\u0026nbspNentjes brought the necessary equipment for the heartbeat synch task with her into the interview rooms, and took measures for 75 offenders. She found a clear link: the higher an offender’s score on the antisocial aspect of psychopathy, the poorer their performance on the heart-rate task.This does at least suggest that psychopaths who are poorer at detecting bodily signals feel less emotion and therefore less empathy for others.Psychopathic criminals are sometimes ided into the “white-collar” type, who tend to commit non-violent crimes such as fraud, and the violent type. In her interviews with this violent group, Nentjes was struck by one similarity, in particular, compared with the white-collar group.“That was their upbringing. Or rather lack of it. Emotional abuse. Sexual abuse. Neglect. A lot of physical abuse. I’ve heard people literally say that emotion is not of use to them. All they felt during their upbringing was fear.”\u0026nbspAs a child, Stephen suffered extreme emotional neglect. When he was six, his mother intentionally set fire to their home in Nottingham while she, Stephen, his younger brother and even younger sister were all inside. Fortunately, the children’s father, who had left for work, realised that he’d forgotten his packed lunch and came home.\u0026nbspLooking back, Stephen says it’s clear that his mother was suffering from post-natal depression. But she received no treatment, “and all I knew was anxiety and being worried”. After the fire, his mother went to prison. His father was a steelworker, who worked all kinds of shifts.“A neighbour contacted social services and Dad was told to sort it out or they’d take us away. None of my dad’s brothers or sisters wanted me or my brother because we were little shits. We were always in trouble. Robbing shops. All kinds of stuff. So we went into care.”\u0026nbspFor the rest of his childhood, Stephen was in and out of care homes. The only emotions he remembers feeling, even then, are fear, anger and confusion. “Christmas, birthdays, people out of the blue at care homes being nice to me… I never really got used to it. I always felt uncomfortable. There’s just a mess of feelings inside me that I don’t interpret properly, or respond to properly.”\u0026nbspAlexithymia is often associated with trauma and neglect from a young age, explains Geoff Bird. Twin studies have suggested a genetic component, too. And it’s also linked to certain types of brain damage, particularly to the insula, the region that receives interoceptive signals.\u0026nbspAs Rebecca Brewer notes, the kind of anxiety that Stephen experiences is common in people with poor interoception. At the University of Sussex, Hugo Critchley and Sarah Garfinkel, who have expertise in psychiatry and neuroscience, are looking at ways to alter interoception, to bring anxiety down.\u0026nbspGarfinkel has put forward a three-dimensional model of interoception that has been well received by others in the field. First, objective accuracy at perceiving interoceptive signals – how good you are at counting heartbeats, for example.Second, subjective report – how good you think you are. And third, metacognitive accuracy – how good you are at knowing how good you actually are.\u0026nbspThe third dimension is important because various studies have found that the gap between how good someone thinks they are at counting heartbeats, for example, and how good they actually are predicts their levels of anxiety.Lisa Quadt, a research fellow with the Sussex group, is now running a clinical trial with the aim of testing whether reducing this gap for people with autism can reduce their anxiety.In a pilot study, Critchley, Garfinkel and MSc student Abigail McLanachan recruited a group of students who came into the lab for six training sessions. In each session, they first did the heartbeat-counting task.The volunteer sat at rest, with a loose rubber pulse oximeter on their forefingers, and reported how many beats they’d counted. Then McLanachan told them how they’d done so that they got a better sense of how accurate they were.McLanachan then got them to do a few minutes of jumping jacks or walking fast up the steep hill outside the building – whatever was necessary to raise their heart rate, to make it easier to detect. (“Because some people really can’t feel their heartbeat at all. I can’t,” Quadt explains.)Then they went back into the lab, did the tasks again and, as before, were given feedback each time.\u0026nbspThis was just a pilot study on a general student population. But after three weeks, not only had the students’ accuracy improved on all three dimensions of interoception, but they also reported reductions in anxiety of around 10 per cent.\u0026nbspFor the main trial, volunteers diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder will complete the same tasks as in the pilot, but once at the start and once at the end they’ll do them inside an MRI scanner.This will allow the team to monitor activity in the insula, which receives heart-rate data, and look at how changes in that activity may correspond to connections between the amygdala, which detects threats, and the prefrontal cortex, which can work out whether a potential threat really is or is not dangerous and so whether anxiety is warranted.The hope, Critchley explains, is to see improved connectivity between these two regions, which previous studies have linked to reduced anxiety.\u0026nbspIn Oxford, meanwhile, Geoff Bird wants to look at the idea that there are two different types of alexithymia. People with one type don’t produce enough of the bodily signals necessary for the experience of an emotion, so would be unlikely to benefit from the Sussex group’s kind of training.People with the other type produce all kinds of bodily sensations but their brains don’t process these signals in the typical way. This second group, which includes Stephen, might benefit more.\u0026nbspBird stresses that, although people with alexithymia struggle to understand emotion, that doesn’t mean they don’t care about other people. “For the most part, iniduals with alexithymia can recognise that others are in a negative state, and this makes them distressed.“The problem is that they can’t work out what the other person is feeling, and what they are feeling, and therefore how to make the other person feel better or how to reduce their own distress. I think that’s important because alexithymia is different from psychopathy in that respect.”Stephen says that for him, this is certainly true. And in theory, an emotional training technique is something he would welcome. “I’ve got several books about emotions and feelings and they don’t make a jot of difference because they’re not talking specifically enough about what you actually feel within your body is which emotion.”\u0026nbspFor now, given the absence of available treatments for alexithymia, Stephen plans to use his newfound understanding of himself, gained through therapy, to try to move forwards. At first, he says, he hoped that therapy would fix everything.“I thought every day would be perfect, brilliant… and I’ve come to realise that’s not going to happen. I’m always going to have problems, always going to have issues.”\u0026nbspHe’s learned valuable lessons, he says. Though he and his wife are still separated, they talk regularly and now he tries not to reject her views on his anxiety. “Rather than go, ‘No,’ I will listen. I think, ‘Well, you know what emotions are about and I don’t, so I’m going to listen to you and I’ll either take it on board or I’ll find a way to deal with it’.”He’s also thinking about moving to work with people who are struggling with substance abuse, because he’d like to be back in a career where he can help people.\u0026nbspMost of all, he’s determined to use his diagnosis of alexithymia. “For me, it empowers me – now I know about it, I can read about it. I can find out more about it. And I can develop certain tools that enable me to combat it.”Nutritionist reveals truth about health benefits of soya foodsWhen kids run for 15 minutes in school every day, here’s what happens How the military is helping tackle mental health problems Graphic cigarette-style health warnings also effective on sugary drinkPeople without alexithymia could probably use such tools as well. Bird has led work showing that people who are more aware of their own heartbeat are better able to recognise others’ emotions, a crucial first step in being empathetic.He’s planning studies to investigate whether heartbeat training might therefore increase empathy.\u0026nbspThose who want to reduce feelings of stress and anxiety in daily life, but who either can’t or don’t want to change the sources of stress, could focus on changing the signals coming from their bodies instead.Regular physical exercise should dampen down the kinds of bodily signals (from the heart and circulation, for example) that the brain could interpret as being anxious – so it should dampen down feelings of anxiety, too.\u0026nbspKnowing that signals from our bodies underpin our emotions could be empowering for all of us.

But now here she is, a teenager, and we are watching Love Island together.I am a Love Island virgin, which are three words you won’t hear together very much over the next eight weeks. I have never seen it before, and am only vaguely aware of it. That isn’t to say I’m some television snob I’ve watched copious amounts of Big Brother. I do like I’m A Celebrity… Get Me Out of Here!. I have caught myself laughing at Mrs Brown’s Boys. I even saw The Chase once.But somehow, Love Island has been slightly beyond the periphery of my experience. I mean, I’ve never seen The Only Way is Essex, but I feel like I have. Love Island, though… my reality TV filter must be clogged, and the past three\u0026nbspseries of it have been caught up in the webbing, never really permeating even my subconscious mind.I have a vague idea that Love Island is some combination of castaways having to undergo Bear Grylls-style survivalist trials crossed with the sort of orgy the Marquis de Sade might have dreamed about after eating a particularly pungent cheese too close to bedtime.So, here we are, settling in front of ITV2, my teenage daughter and I. My wife questions the wisdom of Alice encouraging me to watch a programme which, she informs me, will feature a parade of nubile young women in bikinis, as though I am a pensioner in a comedy sketch who might have a heart attack. But I am insistent Alice and her friends have been frantically Snapchatting all evening in excitement at the prospect of series four of Love Island. This will help me get down with the kids, I am sure of it.I ask Alice for a brief précis of what it’s all about as the titles start. She tells me that there will be more boys than girls and everyone has to couple up but the spare boy then has to steal a girl from\u0026nbspone of the others and at the end of the first round the boy without a girl is unceremoniously dumped from the show.How utterly awful, I think. And is there a point to it all? Apparently, yes £50,000 for the last couple standing. And, apparently, “Instagram promotions”, whatever that might entail. But wait monogamy is not the name of the game. Every so often there has to be a process of “recoupling”, says Alice, which sounds to me like something unpleasant from an episode of 1970s sci-fi series Logan’s Run.This, I ponder, is going to be an interminable couple of months. Surely they must do something other than pant over each other? Yes, Alice says. There are tasks and challenges. What, like they have to catch fish and find coconuts and stuff?A glamour model from Essex  who says: I’m definitely more about personality.Londoner Josh, coming to the Island with A-lister stories such as: Anthony Joshua once put me in a headlock for having a terrible haircutBlue-eyed model from Plymouth swapping the catwalk for Love Island.Coming from South Wales, Rosie\u0027s a solicitor: I’m like Legally Blonde… Only Legally Brunette”Student from York: I’m a party animal and I think you really get to know somebody when you go clubbing with them.Recognise the name? Yes, she\u0027s the daughter of Eastenders actor Danny Dyer. From East London, the barmaid says: I am a girly girl. Having a friendship with a girl in the villa is just as important as finding romance.Coming from Newcastle, the personal trainer and gym director says: “I would say I’m a ten out of ten. Maybe a nine out of ten... I’m not good at washing the dishes.”A West End performer from London, Samira says: I’m looking for an experience that I’ve never had before, loads of fun, the opportunity to meet a really nice guy, or even a best friend, and the chance to find myself.A model from Liverpool, Harley says: “My nickname from my friends is a, maybe because I always go after what I want and I always get it.From Staffordshire, the Nuclear Systems Design Engineer says: “I’m looking for a partner, I’m looking for someone I can settle down with and tame my wild lifestyle.”The retail manager and part-time model from Blackpool says: “I don’t do my nails, or have hair or lash extensions. Everything on me is real I am who I am.”An A\u0026ampE Doctor who has already angered the Daily Mail by taking time off his job to appear on the ITV show, Alex comes from Carmarthen, West Wales. He says: I don’t like high maintenance girls. I think it’s brilliant to look good but spending three hours to get ready to go and walk on the beach is too much for me.Another model, this one from London. I have a fun energy and I am a spiritual person, he says. I’d like to think I have a depth to me so I guess that stands out and I look at things quite deeply.The oldest person to join this year\u0027s competition, Laura is a air hostess from Stirling, Scotland. “The emoji that best describes me is probably the blonde girl, she says, because I’m just a weirdo cause I’m always just like, \u0027Hey, soz about me.\u0027A student and construction worker who has a Hermione Granger\u0027s wand tattoo on his arm. Niall says: “My ex would probably say that I’m immature and a bit of an attention seeker - and she wouldn’t be wrong.”Last but not least, we have a Stationary Sales Manager from Kent. “I consider myself really good looking and so far in my life I’ve had no complaints, he says. I get lots of compliments.”She laughs. No, not like that at all. And as the first of the female contestants begins to arrive, I start to understand. This is not so much Bear Grylls as Bare Arse. The girls are deposited at a posh hotel inidually, via Jeep, dressed in the teeniest, tiniest of bikinis. There is Samira, who is a dancer, Hayley, who is a model, Kendall, who manages a shoe shop. They are wearing a handkerchief’s worth of fabric between them. By the time Danny Dyer’s daughter rocks up, I am secretly wishing someone would put some clothes on. I must be getting old.I lose track of who is who because I’ve had a sudden moment of dissonance. The voiceover guy has a Scottish accent that sounds awfully familiar. It is Iain Stirling, Alice informs me. “Don’t you remember? He used to be on CBBC.”Oh my God. He’s the fresh-faced young chap who used to come on with Hacker T Dog. I always had a fondness for Hacker because he was from Wigan, like me. And now his mate Iain is narrating this cesspit. I look at my daughter, and remember those years of Tracy Beaker and Dora the Explorer. Truly, the days of innocence are over.I ask Alice, cautiously, nervously, if she looks up to these girls, whose makeup has more mass than their clothing and who are talking about willies. She rolls her eyes. “It’s just entertainment, Dad.” I think there are five practically naked girls cavorting on screen now, but to be quite honest I’m eyeing up the fire pit on the sun terrace. Is it gas powered? Where does the canister go?But here comes Caroline Flack, presiding over things like some brothel keeper in a Wild West frontier town. Because that’s exactly what it feels like when the boys turn up, one by one, like cattlemen who have been on the trail too long, excitedly wringing their stetsons and being invited by Flack to inspect the lineup of girl flesh on offer and take their pick.Oh, the girls do have a tiny bit of agency they are allowed to take a step forward if the boy in front of them takes their fancy. But ultimately, the guy gets to choose, though I am told these roles reverse in the coming days.The boys are all rippling six packs and tattoos. There’s one called Niall, who seems sweetly funny, and a guy called Wes, who claims to be some kind of engineer in the nuclear industry, except he’s having trouble saying the word “nuclear”. He gives up and falls back on some double entendre, which I’m 100 per cent sure some researcher has not written for him, promising with a leery wink to “engineer the ride of someone’s life” and then, if that was a bit too subtle, says something about having a big gear stick.My wife, no doubt thinking ahead to getting up at 6.30am today, wonders just how these people get eight weeks off work to do this. And that’s never more pressing a question than when Alex turns up. He’s an A\u0026ampE doctor. How can they spare him? He’s presumably done six years of medical school so he can try to crack off with a girl on a televised Club 18-30 holiday. Doesn’t he know how hard-pressed the NHS is? Hasn’t he seen 24 Hours in A\u0026ampE?Half an hour in and I try to get into the spirit of things by betting my daughter a fiver (I know, I know, the sheer crimes of moral turpitude we have descended to) that a boy whose name sounds like\u0026nbspEeyore, but is Eyal, will pick Samira, the dancer, who seems quite switched on compared to the others. I lose the wager. I’m disappointed in Eyal. I thought he had more about him.We meet Jack, who has the most astonishingly white teeth I have ever seen in my life. Apparently he went all the way to Turkey to get them done. You could see the glow of his teeth from the International Space Station.\u0026nbspI have drifted off when someone says, in what context I know not, that it’s “too soon to spoon!” Is it too soon to switch over and watch Lucy Worsley cosplaying a suffragette, I wonder?By this point I am finding it all quite dreadful, and not because I’m old. It’s because it reminds me of what it was like to be young. If you were ever left standing tearfully at the end of musical chairs, if you ever were picked last for games, if you ever walked home alone from a disco and listened to “How Soon Is Now?” by The Smiths on repeat while staring mournfully at your Betty Blue poster, if despite your best efforts you could only ever cultivate the physique of Little Plum from The Beano, then Love Island is a hateful parade of everything you wanted to be but weren’t.I look at Alice. God, I think, please don’t ever be so shallow as these people. But she’s on Snapchat with her friends. One of them likes Jack, he of the luminous gnashers. Alice pulls a face. Who do you like best, I ask? Eyal.Back on screen, Eyal is indeed coming across as, relatively, deep. He is trying to explain to Hayley, the model, what the word “superficial” means. There’s a new guy arrived, called Adam, whose job is to break up one of the couples and get his chosen girl to be with him. It’s becoming like a standard night out, except there are no fights. Apparently giving someone who tries to steal your girl a good shoeing is verboten and gets you kicked out.A little too late, perhaps, I start to wonder if this is really appropriate for Alice. But she has already seen the latest season of 13 Reasons Why, and also informs us that she has watched a movie called Ibiza that is trailed in the ad break which seems to be very heavy on jokes revolving around male ejaculation. Where did those Dora the Explorer days go? When Adam is going round trying to steal girls I want to shout at the screen, “Swiper no swiping!” But it would just make me sad.Everyone goes to sleep, the “couples” sharing beds. They are young and full of self-esteem, and no one is in their forties\u0026nbspand worried about snoring or accidental nocturnal flatulence. As far as I can tell, nobody has sex, which is a relief. It’s probably the best night’s kip Alex the A\u0026ampE doctor has had for years.The full line up for Love Island 2018 has been announcedWhy we need to stop being snobby about Love IslandLove Island bosses used Tinder to find contestants for the new seriesLove Island bosses are thinking of making an LGBTQ versionAre you embarrassed watching this with me, I ask.\u0026nbspAlice shrugs. “Not on the first episode,” she says. “I probably would be, later on.” It will, I am told, get heavy later on. I am slightly aghast. People will actually have sex? On the telly?There was one couple that didn’t last year, says Alice. One couple that didn’t do it? Only one? I’m not sure whether to feel proud of them or sorry for them.It feels like this is going to be a very long eight weeks, daily doses of people pretty much doing the same thing over and over again. A bit like Dora the Explorer. And even with the salacious promise of off-screen sex among these beautiful, vacuous people, I imagine it’s going to be less the Marquis de Sade’s 120 Days of Sodom than 56 Days of Sod All.It’s too much time to devote to these people, and I’m afraid Alice might be on her own – with her pals on Snapchat of course – for the rest of Love Island. I gave it a go and it at best bored me, at worst made me feel vaguely angry and depressed.Though I might tune in tonight, just to see who gets kicked out after last night’s cliffhanger…Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Flat desert on either side, a few lights.\u0026nbspThe Moroccan traveller Ibn Battuta passed this way on camel back in 1326, and wrote of its emphatic wilderness: “He who enters it is lost and he who leaves it is born.”Before mass tourism ruined them for a second time, I’d travelled to the so-called “lost” cities of Petra, Machu Picchu and Angkor Wat.\u0026nbspMy destination tonight was the isolated sandstone valley eulogised by Charles Doughty, the first European to enter it\u0026nbspin 1876, as “the fabulous Mada’in Saleh\u0026nbspwhich I was come from far countries to seek in Arabia”.The prospect of following in Doughty’s flapping shadow gave me a jolt of anticipation that I hadn’t experienced since my twenties.\u0026nbspDoughty’s classic book Arabia Deserta was championed by his friend TE\u0026nbspLawrence, who later used it as a military textbook, as the greatest record of adventure and travel in our language.It begins with Doughty trying to smuggle himself into Mada’in Saleh in the guise of a poor Syrian pilgrim.\u0026nbspEven up until recently few Europeans have visited this cradle of forgotten civilisations, which, though designated a World Heritage Site in 2008, remains a blank page on the archaeological record, closed off by geography, politics, religion.“Visitors last year from abroad? I can say zero,” my guide Ahmed tells me.Mada\u0027in\u0026nbspSaleh\u0026nbspnear Al-Ula\u0026nbsphave survived for 2,000 yearsThis is set to change. Last July, under the impetus of Saudi Arabia’s progressive new Crown Prince, Mohammed Bin Salman, or “MBS” as he is popularly known, a Royal Commission took charge of Mada’in Saleh and its surrounds – “the only crown jewel of a site the country possesses,” says one of the archaeologists recruited to excavate it.In December, public access was halted first in order to survey what actually is there, next to develop a strategy for protecting it, and then to open up Mada’in Saleh to the outside world. My advance visit is aimed at providing an amuse-bouche, as it were.In the bright morning sunlight, Ahmed escorts me through locked gates, past the German-built railway-line linking Damascus with Medina, which Lawrence bombed (“there are still local tribes which call their sons Al-Orans”), to the celebrated Nabatean rock tombs.Doughty first heard about these in Petra, 300 miles north. Fifty years earlier, an awe-struck British naval commander had gazed in disbelief at Petra’s imperishable Treasury, murmuring, as many continue to do: “There is nothing in the world that resembles it.” He was wrong.If a little less rosier than her sister city, Mada’in Saleh shares her capacity to stagger.\u0026nbspOut of the flat desert, one after another, the ornate facades rise into sight, 111 of them, carved into perpendicular cliffs up to four storeys high, their low doorways decorated by Alexandrian masons in the first century AD, with Greek triangles, Roman pilasters, Persian flowers, Egyptian sphinxes, birds.“This is a twin to Petra,” Ahmed says. Except that in Petra we would be bobbing among crowds.Ahmed\u0026nbspis descended from a long line of imamsStanding in reverent silence, with the valley to ourselves, I recall how the Victorian artist who supplied the first images of Petra to the world, David Roberts, responded to that other city. “I turned from it at length with an impression which will be effaced only by death.”These tombs were carved for the Nabatean tribes who ruled this region for 300 years until the Romans annexed them in 106AD. Nomads who had settled and grown wealthy, the Nabateans controlled the lucrative spice route from the Mediterranean to the Red Sea.Then, like the civilisations they’d replaced, the Dedanites, the Lihyanites, the Thamuds, they galloped off into obscurity. Their tombs were looted: the acacia doors plundered for firewood, the marble statues melted to make lime for plaster, the porphyry urns smashed.All that survives of their caravan city, Hegra, is a flat expanse behind a wire fence: “her clay-built streets are again the blown dust in the wilderness,” Doughty wrote.The same desolation holds true for the still more ancient Biblical city of Dedan, situated on the lip of an oasis a few minutes drive way. To visit both sites is to gain the sense of a narrative even now being worked out.\u0026nbspUntil the 20th\u0026nbspcentury the story of these civilisations was scrawled on the rocks in Nabatean or Thamudic script. Ahmed leads me between two steep cliffs to the oldest inscription, written 6,000 years ago.Tombs in Mada\u0027in Saleh were decorated by Alexandrian masons in the first century with Greek, Roman and Persian symbolsThe ancient Biblical city of Dedan is situated on the lip of an oasisCliffs formed out of red and black sandstone have eroded into crazy, hallucinatory shapes such as elephants, mushrooms, and sealsAncient Dedan inscriptions.

Ahmed could be speaking of the cavity in the historical record when he says, “They were making sacrifices to one god, Dhu-Ghaibat, which means ‘the one who is absent’.”Out in the desert, the wind has chiselled its own mysterious deities and hieroglyphs. The scene is stunning. In Petra, which forms part of the same massif, David Roberts threw away his pencil in despair at being able to convey it, believing that the ruins “sink into insignificance when compared with these stupendous rocks”.It’s hard to disagree. Cliffs formed out of red and black sandstone have eroded into crazy, hallucinatory shapes: elephants, mushrooms, braying seals. If they were transcribed into music, it would be Wagnerian.They make you believe in mountain gods, I tell Ahmed, who smiles. “I never try smoking weed, but when I hear someone react, I feel like that. It makes you high, naturally.”For sheer high spirits, no one yields to the British archaeologist I meet that night. Jamie Quartermain is part of an international team employed since March to survey these sites.A surveyor who pioneered the use of drones, Quartermain says: “We’ve been wanting to get involved here, but Saudi has been a closed shop, a completely untapped reserve.The perception is that it’s big, open desert. When I tried to find out anything about it, there was essentially one book. The discovery that there are so many archaeological sites is a big shock for most people. It was a big shock for me.”Advised by the Royal Commission to expect 450 unexcavated sites, Quartermain estimates the truer number between 6,000-10,000.\u0026nbsp“The survival of the archaeology is remarkable, some of the best condition remains I’ve ever seen. We’re not finding it close to the surface, it’s above surface, well and truly visible.”Dedan\u0026nbspinscriptions. Holes in the rock floor denote a sacrificial spot from the time of the DedanitesDeploying a drone, he has begun creating a three-dimensional textural surface of the area. Already, what he has found is ground-breaking. “You can see all the archaeology jumping out and biting you on the bottom.”When, aged 20, I visited Petra, sleeping in one of the caves, I talked to the head of the Bdoul tribe, allegedly descendants of the Nabateans, who told me: “We have a saying that the more wealth you have, the more brain cells you need to be able to cope with it.What impresses about MBS’s plan for Mada’in Saleh is his determination to use his nation’s resources to avoid the pitfalls of Petra.“Wadi Rum is pretty disastrous,” says Chris Tuttle, an American archaeologist seconded to the project. Tuttle spent many years excavating in Petra. He saw at first hand the ruinous impact of tourism, both on the ruins and the local community.By contrast, in Al-Ula, the local town for Mada’in Saleh, there has been a concerted drive to educate the locals, giving scholarships to 150 children, but also to attract experts armed with the latest methodolOne reason for the blankness on Saudi Arabia’s archaeological map, says Tuttle, has been the resistance of conservative religious leaders to question their history. “You don’t need to study the past when you’ve been given a manual from God.”Suddenly, a multi-thousand-year-old story has become an open book, not a closed one, and the revelation it contains could be a complex of sites more significant even than Petra.\u0026nbspMy guide Ahmed Alimam is a perfect representative of Al-Ula’s past and future. He comes from a long line of imams descended from a grand tribal judge who arrived c1400 in Al Ula’s “old town”Abandoned in 1983, the year of Ahmed’s birth, this haunting labyrinth of mud houses and twisting streets replaced Dedan and Hegra. It was built using stones from those cities. They can be seen fortifying the occasional doorway.Ahmed leads the way down an empty street to the house where his parents used to live – collapsed beams, upturned crates.

Attacks on humans are supposed to be as rare as winning the lottery and being struck by lightning at the same time. Yet last\u0026nbspyear, a man’s body was extracted from a 23-foot\u0026nbsppython, in an incident captured on\u0026nbspa gruesome YouTube video.When Ms\u0026nbspTiba\u0026nbspfailed to return by Friday morning, her sister went to search\u0026nbspfor her alongside around 100 people from\u0026nbspthe village of\u0026nbspPersiapan\u0026nbspLawela.

It was 23 feet long and so bloated it could barely move, with a large bulge midway down its body.The villagers killed the snake and opened it up to find Ms Tiba intact inside the snake, clothed just as she had been when she went to check the corn.Found in the Middle East, North Africa and sub-Saharan Africa, the cobra’s venom can kill a human within 15 minutes and an elephant in three hours.

It hunts lizards scorpions and centipedesThe colour varies on this snake, which is found in sub-Saharan Africa. It eats small rodents, lizards and other snakes. Unlike other snakes it projects its venomA reticulated python secures its prey with a bite, then wraps its body around the victim, squeezing down until the victim cannot breathe, before consuming.It’s so rare for humans to be eaten that it’s more common to see hoaxes.

It was seized by German forces during the First World War and was returned under the terms of the Versailles Treaty, only to be taken back by the Nazis in 1942 and eventually returned to Ghent with the help of the “Monuments Men” (curators and professors who recovered countless artworks stolen by the Nazis).Adolf Hitler was never able to admire the complete work, however, as two of the panels, The Just Judges\u0026nbspand St John the Baptist, had been stolen from the cathedral\u0026nbspin 1934.In the months after the theft\u0026nbspauthorities were sent a series of ransom notes demanding one million Belgian francs in cash.\u0026nbspThe St John the Baptist\u0026nbsppanel was recovered during\u0026nbspnegotiations but the other missing section was never returned.A few months later a 57 year-old money exchange agent, Arsene Goedertier, died of heart failure shortly after revealing that papers relating to the theft were at his home in Wetteren.An envelope containing copies of 13 ransom notes was found in his desk, along with an unsent final letter suggesting that the missing panel “rests in a place where neither I nor anybody else can take it away without arousing the attention of the public”.Conspiracy theories involving the Knights Templars and the Holy Grail have flourished ever since, and several people have claimed to have broken the thief’s secret code.The new theory is based on the scribbled words left on the final note: oiseau, arte, jean, nina, erpe and fourrure, along with the number 152.Mr Marchal said he found locations linked to four of the words that were all 152m from a single point on the Kalandeberg. Plotting the routes also spelt out the letters for the name Nina, he claimed.Further details are outlined in his book The Fourteenth Letter\u0026nbspwith Marc de Bel, who is more famous as the author of the children’s books\u0026nbspThe Egg of Uncle Trotter and Master Plume and the Talking Powder.The masterpiece used as a dartboardMr De Bel described the case as “one of the great art robberies of all time”, and added: “We are waiting for a call from Steven Spielberg now.”“This is of great importance for the city and for Flemish art history,” said the mayor of Ghent.“If this new theory was no more than a stunt to promote a book, I would never have cooperated, and as a city we would not have made our council hall available for a press conference.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Without that ultimate weapon we are certain to get a poor deal.The Prime Minister cannot accept what a small handful of Remainers determined to stop Brexit are demanding.As she has rightly said, “No deal is better than a bad deal”.The people said leave, not leave when the EU gives us permission.The EU Withdrawal Bill, which MPs voted on this week, is about ensuring legal certainty at our point of departure.Jeremy Corbyn voted against the Government on this key bill, cynically trying to frustrate the Brexit process for his own political ends.If Conservatives do not demonstrate discipline in support of Theresa May on this, then we risk letting him into power.The Government has already said the EU Withdrawal Bill can be framed so as to give Parliament a vote on the final outcome, but without blocking the UK’s departure even without a deal.The Bill will go back to the House of Lords on Monday, and is likely then to return to the House of Commons.We need to get this out of the way, because it is 14 months on from triggering Article 50 and we still have not discussed the vital trade relationship between the UK and the EU.This is because the EU Commission deliberately set out to ensnare the UK in a tortuous bureaucratic process designed to leave us in the weakest position, bound to the EU as some sort of vassal state — as a rule-taker.In this, the EU has been emboldened by the appalling behaviour of the unelected House of Lords, which made it clear they want to reverse the result of the referendum. One peer even spoke arrogantly of now bringing the British people to heel.You only need to have watched as the EU’s negotiators have gratuitously and remorselessly set out not just to be difficult but, it has become clear, to humiliate us.For example, their refusal to agree to our continuing involvement in the Galileo satellite project, despite the fact that we have invested heavily in it, demonstrates how their behaviour has been calculated to offend.Even the UK’s offer of defence intelligence co-operation, which the EU needs, was brushed aside.That the EU is now strutting like the school bully should not surprise us, because of its ideological commitment to the European project at all costs.Yet, for all their bluster, this masks a weakness.The EU is deeply worried the UK will leave the EU and become a serious trade competitor, thus not only damaging the EU’s trading position but encouraging those in the EU who oppose this centralised, protectionist behemoth.We have reached a critical moment in the Brexit process. Because of the EU’s inflexibility, the Government has been forced to make concessions in the hope of discussing that all-important trade relationship.This has left many of us concerned that the process has been too one-sided.The UK has been behaving as a friend who wants an amicable divorce, while the EU has behaved like an opponent who wishes to impose their will and force the UK to repent what they believe is the folly of Brexit.That is why the UK needs now to change its negotiating stance, once the Brexit bill is passed.Too often it seems as though it is the UK which negotiates as a supplicant — despite the reality that, as the EU’s largest trade partner and the fifth largest economy in the world, with the world’s fourth most potent defence forces, the UK is deserving of much more respect from the EU.After all, there is a great deal at stake for the EU if these negotiations go wrong.There are many among the EU 27 who, like us, are growing weary of the EU’s arrogance. After all, it is many of them who stand to lose jobs if we fail to reach a trade arrangement.The EU Council meeting later this month has now become critical. It is there we should say that, notwithstanding any ongoing issues concerning the Irish border, our requirement is we move now to negotiate our post-Brexit trade relationship.If they refuse, and want instead to continue their border demands, then we must have the resolve to leave the table.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

So far all I’ve come up with is Iggle Piggle, from TV’s In The Night Garden.I think negotiating Brexit would be a stretch for the friendly blue woollen creature with the red Mohawk.But maybe I’ve got him wrong, underestimated his abilities. He has a bell in his left foot. Theresa May seems to have a brain in her left foot. Given the choice, maybe I’d take the kid with the bell.We are in chaos. Not because we voted for Brexit, far from it. The economy is doing well. The sky has not fallen in. Investment up, employment hitting record levels, inflation down.No, the problem is solely a consequence of our Government. Right now we don’t know exactly what deals have been done with the rump of Remainers within the Conservative Party.One moment we’re told the Prime Minister has caved in to their demands. Next minute she hasn’t. Nobody knows quite what to believe.She is tip-toeing between the two sides solely to stay in power. And she has to be told: It isn’t working. It sends out a message to the people we are negotiating with that we haven’t a clue what’s going on.That policy is formulated on the hoof. In fact, it’s not policy at all, just inept fire-fighting. Inept because the flames are spreading — and as a result, our negotiating position becomes weaker by the hour.Some will argue May can only play the cards she has been dealt. That she has a minority Government and a split in her own party.Well, sure. But then, to a considerable degree, she dealt the cards herself. She called an election a year ago expecting to get a huge majority.I could have told her she would lose, if she’d asked. But she didn’t ask me, she asked some other numbnuts instead. This holy mess is of her making.Britain voted to leave the EU. Not to stay in bits of it. Not to remain constrained by the EU’s regulations. The Remainers don’t like that?Don’t care. You lost the argument — so shut up for a while. Or work to get us the best deal we can, outside the customs union.We need to be clear to the EU negotiators that we will happily take a no deal Brexit. They don’t want that — and a tough line will make them respond. If it doesn’t — fine, no deal is still much better than a bad deal.The EU is falling apart, largely for the reasons that convinced us to leave. Bullying, dictatorial, corrupt, undemocratic.We need a leader who can exploit their manifest weaknesses. A lot — perhaps a majority — of European people are on our side.That leader isn’t Theresa May. It needs to be someone within the Tories who is A. a Leave voter and B. has a bit of charisma and nous.I don’t really care who, right now, David Davis, Boris Johnson, Priti Patel, Michael Gove. But ABM — Anyone But May.It is not the EU that is hampering our exit strategy. It is our own Govern­ment. It’s time for Theresa to say: “That’s it: I’m out.”Now, quiz fans, here’s a question for you. What do Terry and Andraya possess that may have helped them come first and second?Jet-powered roller skates? Performance- enhancing drugs? Nope.They were both born with male bodies. And they both competed as boys until very recently.But according to the growing trend, they are now able to identify as girls without question. And so are allowed to compete against girls.And that’s what happens. They win because of biology.SHOULD the Royal Family be allowed to get their baps out? An important constitutional point.Meghan turned up for a royal engagement with her shoulders uncovered. And many people thought this was “inappropriate”. Only a matter of time before the female royals start trying to outdo each other.Kate in a glittery boob tube and Princess Anne in a leather basque with split-crotch undies.Bring it on.THE brilliant writer Lionel Shriver has been sacked as judge of a short story competition.This is because she objected to publishers having quotas that are supposed to “reflect diversity”.She said: “If an agent submits a manuscript written by a gay, ­trans- gender Caribbean who dropped out of school at seven and powers around town on a mobility scooter, it will be published.Whether or not . . . it is an incoherent, tedious, meandering and insensible pile of mixed- paper recycling.”The magazine that runs the competition sacked her for this.It said her comments were “not consistent” with its ethos.What it means is it disagrees with her.Freedom of speech, huh. Well done, Shriver.IN Cretins Corner this week are the libtards criticising President Trump for his attempts to make peace with North Korea.Six months ago these same people were screaming that Trump was leading us all to death and destruction by threatening Kim Jong-un.Now he’s accused of cosying up to a horrible dictator.Truth is, he’s played it brilliantly. Acting tough brought the porky dog-muncher to the negotiating table.And now we have at least a chance of peace in the world’s second most dangerous area (after the Middle East, natch).Barack Obama was bunged a Nobel Peace Prize for, essentially, doing nothing, by the liberals who run the awards.How about one for The Donald for actually achieving something?IS Sadiq Khan going mad?The Mayor of London has demanded that Wikipedia must “close the gender gap” on its entries. Just 17 per cent of biographies on Wiki are about women, apparently.What’s it got to do with you, you bumptious midget?As someone cleverly tweeted, just zero per cent of Imams at Britain’s mosques are female – perhaps they should close the gender gap a little too.Listen Sadiq, just build a few more homes in the capital and stop young ethnic minority people macheteing or machine gunning each other to death.When you’ve sorted that out, mate, then maybe you can start worrying about American online publications.Listen, mate. That’s our money you’re spending. He could have done that trip for sixty quid on the train.And we’d have thrown in a fiver for a packet of cashews and some Red Bull.APPARENTLY, young people are getting thicker.Their average IQ is declining year on year.If you follow the graph to its natural conclusion, by about 2028 they will have an IQ of zero.They’ll be like the Viz character Jellyhead, who had lime jelly between her ears and just lay on the floor all day.They’re already about the level of another Viz character, Terry F***witt.

That’s a fundamental rule whether you’re buying a car or exiting a 45-year-old trading arrangement.Grieve and Soubry know that full well. They are lawyers. Their attempt to make it impossible is a ploy to keep us in a customs union, tied to the Single Market, and negate or block Brexit.Now they must decide whether doing Brussels’ dirty work, as they plainly are, trumps the survival of their own party. This current shambles, this paralysis, cannot go on. Britain is sick of it.Our PM, rightly attempting to fulfil the democratic mandate of the 17.4million majority (namely a Brexit that actually involves leaving), is being held to ransom.She has faced the Remainers down. Next week they have a massive decision. To let Mrs May do her duty...Or potentially destroy her, along with her Government and  their own jobs, while giving Corbyn’s crazies a chance to seize power.BRITAIN needs a sensible policy of controlled immigration, not some blinkered drive to hit an arbitrary limit at all costs.So we welcome Home Secretary Sajid Javid’s new approach.He intends to let in thousands more skilled medics to fill NHS rota gaps — and relax rules to let businesses take in more engineers and IT experts.And foreign, non-graduate entrepreneurs with a promising start-up idea will get a visa to launch it here.That is exactly what taking back  control of our borders should look like post-Brexit: welcoming in the brightest, while stemming the flow of the less skilled. That will benefit our economy and allow our communities to cope.It is far from the “racism” Leavers are accused of. It is simply common sense.ROBOTS, they say, will take all our jobs.

Working mothers are often the most motivated and dynamic workers in the room.And yet working mothers still get seriously bad press.The comments by Kelly Brook this week are a case in point.She said on TV’s Loose Women some working mothers use their children as an “excuse” to skip deadlines or miss work.She also said it’s unprofessional for women to talk about children in the workplace and that “professional” women never do so.Kelly — who doesn’t have any children — made the remarks during a discussion about whether it is a mother’s job to look after her sick children.I honestly wonder what her views are founded on.Since she started modelling when she was still a teenager, it’s hard to imagine she has ever worked any kind of nine-to-five job in an office.And has she ever employed any working mums? I don’t know for sure but I somehow doubt it.I think Kelly’s comments are just founded on prejudice.I also wonder why she didn’t include men in her evaluation of working ­parents.Funnily enough men, in my experience, are way more comfortable than many women about citing ­childcare or a sick child as the reason for their absence or lateness.And most working women I know would go to extraordinary lengths to avoid “blaming” their absence on their children.Either way, Kelly’s suggestion that it’s more professional for women not to mention their children is crazy.But with views like that flying around — from other women — is it any surprise that some women worry that if they mention their children at work they will be discriminated against?I certainly know women who go to work and feel like they have to “present” as being someone without children — for fear of losing out on promotion.But if we all pretend we don’t have kids we will never change people’s opinion.So the more women talk about the fact they are working mothers — and proud — the more perceptions will change.It’s important people realise there IS pressure on a working parent — and particularly on working mums.But that’s very different to assuming the pressure makes them unreliable.No doubt when Kelly Brook has children herself, she will realise all this.And I really hope she does have kids.Unlike Luisa Zissman, who said in retaliation to her comments that Kelly will “never have children” because of her “track record with men”.That’s mean-spirited and unfair.I am sure motherhood will be the making of Kelly, just as it is for so many other women.Having said all of the above though, I will say this: There is a difference between acknowledging that you are a working mother and banging on about your kids and their achievements to anyone who will listen.Don’t get me wrong.I often talk to other working mums whose kids are at the same stage as mine about whatever issues we are particularly grappling with.But no matter how wonderful your kids are, there is nothing more boring to most people than being shown pictures of kids they’ve never met and don’t know.In other words, it’s one thing being proud to be a working mother — but we should all avoid being baby bores.The fact is, breastfeeding is not for everyone. Nor does it necessarily come down to choice – sometimes it just ain’t going to happen, for a variety of reasons.If that’s the case women should be supported, not vilified and pressured.For what it’s worth, I tried breastfeeding – for about five minutes. It didn’t work for me and, having just given birth to another human being, I didn’t feel bad about that one little bit.After all, it’s my body and I’ll do what I like, thanks very much. No one was going to tell me I was letting my kids down by giving them formula and – guess what – they’ve turned out fine. ONE of the highlights of my year was attending a private lunch with the Queen at Buckingham Palace last Wednesday.I left feeling bowled over by how incredible she is, so engaging and knowledgeable on so many subjects, from working mothers to football.The other thing that struck me is how very human and down to earth she is.When we were comparing notes about our various family members and how quickly they grow up, I realised we were just talking woman to woman.It really was an extraordinary lunch with an extraordinary person. IN the wake of the allegations against Harvey Weinstein it is no surprise that large companies – especially those in the film industry – are absolutely terrified their staff might behave inappropriately.But the news that Netflix has banned flirting is pretty unbelievable.It has issued a series of guidelines for employees about how to behave at work.That includes a ban on film crews looking at anyone for more than five seconds and the suggestion that anyone who feels pestered at work yells: “Stop! Don’t do that again!”Employees are also not allowed to touch or hug people for too long.It’s not that I disagree with those guidelines – try locking eyes with someone for five seconds and you’ll realise it’s creepy.It’s the fact that Netflix feels the need to issue them.I guess the company executives think their employees are in need of guidance.But the rules they have set out look, to any right-minded person, like common sense.After all, most of us know if our attention is unwanted or if someone feels uncomfortable – we stop whatever is causing the issue.And if you need a set of rules like this to tell you how to behave then there is a problem.The fact Netflix has decided it needs to do this is, frankly, a terrible state of affairs.It’s also a bit ironic given how many of the shows it makes and airs are about rape, murder and other violence against women.I guess there’s an element here of Netflix wanting to be seen to be doing the right thing.But to my mind it’s a bit holier than thou – and the company has taken it too far.CAN it really be true that Niall Aslam quit Love Island because he is insecure about his ears?If so, that is so sad. What is wrong with our young people? Actually, I know the answer to that.I can honestly say that I was never worried about body issues and none of my friends were either – it simply wouldn’t have occurred to us to compare ourselves unfavourably to everyone else.I’m pretty sure this kind of insecurity, which is rife among our young people and getting worse, is a direct result of reality TV and social media. IN the same week it was revealed that a young girl wet herself rather than interrupt her gaming, new research has proved that video games are addictive in the same way as drugs and alcohol.So what can we do about this new epidemic?There is usually an age limit for these games – and that is often ignored.But the fact is, you can’t expect the Government to sort this out: It is a parenting issue.Technology has given us many positives over the years – but it’s also caused problems that didn’t exist a decade or two ago.And this is one of them.Parents, listen up.If you want to avoid children getting addicted to games, don’t buy them.Limit the time your children have on technology.Get involved with what they are doing online and don’t just turn a blind eye.The best thing you can do is get kids out of the house – active, busy and involved in sport.Also bear in mind that if you are lazy, they will be lazy.And if you spend all day, every day, looking at your phone, so will they.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

To defy it twice, particularly when this is about implementing the result of a referendum, is an act of insurrection.The Commons must act. One of the many good side effects of Brexit should be the abolition of the upper House and its replacement by a much smaller senate.Mr Field added: Our departure should be the starting gun for a renaissance across the whole of public life as a new pride in being British, or English as it is now more often expressed, sweeps across our affairs.Blasting peers who have repeatedly amended the Brexit bill, he said: The group acts, in a sense, as the political agent of Open Britain, the body that in its previous guise campaigned for Remain.Mr Field suggested the new senate should feature experts chosen by specialist bodies, and elected politicians reflecting national sentiment as a whole.He was backed by senior Tories - ex-leader Iain Duncan Smith said: Im with Frank - it is high time for major reform. This time around has shown an abuse beyond anything we have seen before.Tomorrow peers are expected to back an amendment which gives Parliament the right to tell the Government how to proceed if ministers fail to cut a deal with the EU.Theresa May then faces a showdown with Tory rebels as she tries to convince them to vote down the Lords amendment.JEREMY Corbyns Brexit strategy faced another blow today as one of his shadow ministers backed a second referendum on Brexit.Stephen Pound supports the Peoples Vote campaign which aims to overturn the result of the 2016 vote.Labour is currently opposed to a referendum re-run - but hasnt ruled out supporting it in future.Previously, frontbenchers who back a second Brexit vote have been forced to quit by Mr Corbyn.Mr Pound, the Shadow Northern Ireland Minister, said this week: This decision is not something we can just forget about a week later.It is so, so serious that we have to have a cold evaluation.

Two months have passed [since the election] so it would be very strange \u0085 to say that what I told voters during the whole election campaign doesnt stand anymore.She has vowed to do everything to ensure that this country is well led through these difficult weeks.However Merkel is also facing a revolt within her own party, according to one MP.Kai Whittaker, a CDU Bundestag member, said: “We are in a serious situation because the question of the migration crisis evolved into a power question.“The question is who is leading the Government?

Like a true rockstar he takes the pen from my hand and begins to sign my top.“Your pen isn’t working,” he informs me, smiling. “Hang on,” he adds, dipping his hand into his shirt pocket.What a charmer.After, Corbynites pursue me for a selfie.“He’s touched you,” says an awed super-fan, taking his camera out for a pic.I am the chosen one.“He left a sandal over there,” I tell them, pointing in the other direction before making my escape.Around the corner, a young Lenin - I mean Lennon - lookalike approaches, breathless. “Don’t speak to him,” he warns, pointing at a smartly dressed journalist who is politely asking revellers for their picture.Lennon’s wild, curly hair is flying in the wind and he pushes his vintage round glasses up, his nose twitching. “He’s from a right wing paper we don’t like,” he continues, excitedly. “My boss has told me to follow him and warn everyone about him. Got to go, he’s getting away.”With that, he begins to run after him in a zigzag pattern to avoid getting caught.This is North London, not North Korea. Where’s the solidarity?Not in the Solidarity Tent, apparently. Right now it is looking more like the Solitary Tent with a lone tumbleweed blowing through the dancefloor.It is 4pm. And I’m at White Hart Recreation Ground in Wood Green, London, for Labour Live - aka Jezfest.For one day only, I am living as a Corbynite and already the experience has been enlightening.After the positive reception at Glastonbury last year, Jezza fancied himself as Jay-C and decided to headline his own festival.But with a 4,000 turnout filling the 20,000 venue, it feels more like a summer fete on speed.Things could have been so different had Labour not balked at the £100,000 price tag for grime act Stormzy.Turns out the singer preferred to do it for the many (pounds) rather than the few.Which is a shame. He might have saved the day by appealing to the youths and performing his hit single “you’re getting way too big for your boots”. Which by the looks of things, Jezza could do with listening to. On repeat.Instead, privately-educated electronic band Clean Bandit were parachuted in at the last minute and tickets were slashed by 70 per cent from £35 to £10 to save the day, while one batch was given to Unite to give out for free.All in the name of equality.Which has not gone unnoticed by even Jeremy’s biggest fans today - who are still irked about this.“Jez fest?” commented one guy sporting harem pants. “More jizz-fest, I want a refund.”“I’m going to Twitter-bomb Jeremy,” moans a 56 year old dad, from Portsmouth, as he queues for food. “I came up with my wife and son and it’s cost us a bloomin’ fortune. We had to pay for trains, full price entry and it’s £5 a pint in here so it’s not cheap. I want a refund on the price difference, it’s not fair.“What’s Jeremy thinking holding this?” he goes on, as his young son looks away bored. “I’m here because I want some clarity on Brexit, and I’m hoping we’ll get some today.”Talking of which, a 30-something mum wearing a black t-shirt with the word “love and peace” shimmies past. Her adorable toddlers waddle behind like ducklings, both wearing fluorescent yellow “b*****ks to Brexit” stickers.And it is not the only obscene message. A flurry of “f**k the Tories” swamp the event. A bit much for a family event?Suddenly, a woman with brown cropped hair thrusts a leaflet into my hand. It reads: Marxism Festival 2018.“Don’t miss it next month,” she tells me, but it feels more like an order than a friendly message. “We’ve also got two Labour MPs going but they don’t want to reveal their names yet as they fear the press will call them ‘Reds under the bed’.“But it’s a very scary time at the moment,” she continues, shaking her head. “Last week 15,000 Nazis marched for Tommy Robinson. Horrible, violent lot.”Later, I look up the festival on their website, one of the workshops at the event is called Do we need violence to get real social change?Meanwhile, UB40 are speaking live via a video link on the big screens surrounding the main stage. “We wish we could be there today,” they fib, to a lacklustre crowd.The video goes down like a lead balloon and leaves everyone feeling more awkward than watching Jezza try to high five.But if I thought it could not get any worse I was wrong.Now,  columnist Owen Jones is walking onto the main stage and clarifying that he won’t be taking part in a prat battle - I mean rap battle.Instead, he breaks into an impassioned speech where he compares the Labour party to the suffragettes.After all the excitement, I’m feeling peckish so I decide to check out the award-winning street food.But I’m confused. Are they referring to the four miserable-looking stands? There’s a better selection next to the taxi rank on the high street at 2am on a Saturday.And I’m not the only one annoyed.“I’ve been queuing for 45 minutes,” explains one woman with pink hair and facial piercings. “What on earth would Jeremy have done if 20,000 had turned up? He can’t even feed the 5,000 and I don’t even think there’s that many people here.”Another pipes up, “I just paid £7 for a halloumi burger, overpriced and not worth the wait.”And my experience is not much better.After queing for over an hour for £4 cheesy nachos I’m served a stingy portion of eight tortilla chips with a sliver of plastic cheese. I’d find more cheese on the crusty lefties here than on my plate.I sneak a peek of the packet and see the tortilla chips are from Lidl, and cost 46p a packet. Not bad money if you can get it.Capitalist endeavours are rife here. Corbyn has his own stall at the entrance - where you can buy anything from Labour’s £6 manifesto to a £15 t-shirt with Jezza’s face on.But it is stalls which shock the most. The Bakers Food and Allied Workers Union are charging £10 for a t-shirt.“It’s really important the workers are looked after,” says one. I have a sneak peek at the inside label and am horrified to see it has been made in Nicaragua. Not a place known for its high standards of workplace ethics.And it is not the only stall. Love Music Hate Racism also offer a t-shirt made in Nicaragua, while the People’s Assembly are selling a t-shirt made in Honduras. All of them are made by Gildan, a low-cost producer who have been slammed in the past for using sweatshops in Central America.The outright hypocrisy is astonishing and what’s more, none of them can make the link.After listening to the Magic Numbers - a pop band who were famous 15 years ago, not one of Diane Abbott’s methods of police funding, I fancy a drink.I make my way to the bar for a “worker’s beer” - although most of the “staff” are volunteers and not getting paid.But it’s all gone Pete Tong.The card machine is down and people are moaning and groaning about having to walk to the other side of the venue to withdraw cash.Nearby, a disabled woman in a wheelchair is growing increasingly frustrated that her wheels don’t work on the grass. She does not want to sit in the segregated area for disabled people, she wants to be at the front of the stage, in the mix with everyone else.At long last, Jezza takes to the main stage, and his 4,000 disciples flock to see him. To the chants of “Oh, Jeremy Corbyn”, it seems like he is poised to break out into song. “Lenin Be”, perhaps?After JC’s latest sermon, the party’s over, and the Corbynites file out.It’s 8pm. As I make my escape, I notice one woman caught short evacuating her bowels behind a bin, just a stone’s throw from the portaloos. Part of me wonders whether her coiled offering is some sort of protest at this ramshackle event.It seems Labour would struggle to organise a piss-up in a brewery - let alone run a country.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

These things matter when you are 92.You have your favourite chair, tea cup and biscuits, and routine is important.Both of these women will have bonded during the overnight journey in the royal train to carry out engagements in ­Cheshire, with the Queen dispensing the solid, common sense advice she has learned the hard way after 66 years on the throne.They might be from ­completely different backgrounds and ­cultures but the Queen and Meghan do have a ­surprising amount in common.Obviously first and foremost they both share a deep love for Prince Harry, but they also have a real sense of duty and a desire to serve.Meghan has a lot more substance than the majority of self-centred young American actresses and, from an early age she has wanted to change the world for the better.This week she became an official partner in The Royal Foundation, joining William and Kate and husband Harry — all dubbed the “Fab Four” ­— to help charities close to their hearts.Meghan wants to make a difference. She doesn’t want to be just a clothes horse or to merely cut ribbons and unveil plaques, and I don’t believe she’d be ­content with just being a mum and virtual stay-at-home housewife like most upper-class wives. She wants to roll up her sleeves and get stuck in.Those who snarkily accuse her of self-promotion are missing the point.Meghan is canny enough to realise her new position in life means she will ­constantly be photographed and written and talked about.She knows that a new hairstyle or frock will steal the headlines but will hope people will also listen to what she has to say on poverty in Africa, equal rights for women and saving elephants.Meanwhile, her old life could be luring Meghan back to La La Land with news that her performance in Suits has been submitted for an Emmy award.A submission is a long way from a nomination, but it will be interesting to see if those in charge fast-track her into the awards category for best actress. ­Personally, I don’t think it will happen.Even Meghan would admit she wasn’t by any stretch of the imagination the best actor in Suits.If Meghan was nominated and ended up winning, it would be nothing more than a stunt to get some sort of seal of royal approval.Surely even the US entertainment industry wouldn’t be that cynical.Since Meghan met Harry, she has been compared to Grace Kelly, the Hollywood star who gave up her career to marry Prince Rainier III of Monaco.Unlike Grace Kelly, who wanted to go back into movies, I don’t see Meghan being in any way tempted back to her old life after landing the best role of all.That’s not a criticism because I admire her work ethic and single-mindedness — and I think her desire to be a force for good is genuine.The Queen is nobody’s fool and if she thinks Meghan is worth cultivating and training, the new ­American Duchess should have our approval, too.THE two new judges being wooed to join The X Factor could very well save this show’s rather tired-looking format.Robbie Williams is an inspired choice, bringing his own brand of cheeky humour but also a real empathy for all those seeking fame and fortune.I reckon, however, his wife Ayda could prove to be the real star.She’s funny, feisty and has proved to be a TV favourite during her appearances on Loose Women.Ayda won’t take any nonsense from the formidable Simon Cowell and, much as she loves Robbie, you can expect some straight-talking spats between them.Of course there are those who will say she’s only getting a seat on the judges’ panel because of her husband’s fame, but I reckon Ayda , left with Robbie, is more than up to the job and will be a much needed breath of fresh air on a panel that was looking increasingly bored and out of touch.ON World Blood Donor Day this week I repaid my debt to the NHS when my fantastic TV show team donated their very own blood (having already given their sweat and tears on a daily basis).I had to have a life-saving three pints of blood after a serious accident and, like every other patient who is given a transfusion, I am no longer allowed to donate my own.Where can I give blood? Here’s how to find a donation centre and how often you’re able to donateIt’s something that has made me feel very guilty, so I cannot thank my team enough – although there would have been even more of the precious life-saving blood if some of the boys who work with me and happen to be gay had not been banned from donating.Gay men who have had recent sex are not allowed to be donors, which surely is an edict that needs to be changed.There has to be a way to ensure safety without making gay men feel like pariahs.IN Hollywood, money talks and the box office dictates trends.So It’s good news that the all-female Ocean’s 8 has trounced the other male-dominated movies in the franchise, because it clearly shows moviegoers WILL happily pay to see films starring women in leading roles.Ocean’s 8 is a rather silly but hugely enjoyable spin on the heist movie with a satisfying end twist and decent parts for women – who are all too often usually “the wife” or “the best friend”.It shows that the appallingly bad all-girl version of Ghostbusters, a real stinker that bombed horribly, was just a blip.Hopefully, this will be the start of more big- budget films with kick-ass roles for women that aren’t twee or patronising.ALL my fellow Holby City fans know that surgeon Jac Naylor would make a polar bear shiver if she gave it one of her “looks”.She’s the ultimate ice maiden, although we have seen a little bit of a thaw in recent weeks on her return to our screens.In fact, Jac showed her human side when the character had a breakdown on screen, something that Rosie Marcel, who has played the character for 13 years, knows all about.Rosie told me that she suffered her own mental health problems after having a real-life breakdown on set.She suffered from depression and had to seek medical help.Rosie walked out of her house in her pyjamas and bare feet and even had the dark thought that her family would be better off without her.Luckily, she was given treatment and was able to get back to work, but it was a frightening time and demonstrates once again that mental health problems can hit anyone.I salute Rosie for being so open and brave about her struggle.FASTEN your seatbelts, it’s going to be a bumpy ride in Poldark when the admirable Rebecca Front sails into Truro harbour like a magnificent galleon as the formidable Lady Whitworth.This ghastly harridan is the mother of the monstrous Ossie Whitworth, who has made his reluctant wife Morwenna suffer the torments of hell and even had his wicked way with her sister.If you wondered how Ossie could be so self-centred, heartless and cruel, then all will be explained when his mother heaves into view.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

What all cyclists have in common though is the need to stay safe on the road. That starts with the equipment you use and ends with a well-maintained bike. So let\u0027s take a look at some tips for being as safe as possible when you take to the roads this summer. Helmets save heads   From a topple when your youngest is learning to ride a balance bike through to dad wanting to protect himself on his cycle to work - everyone needs a helmet and Halfords has a range of helmets suitable for all ages and cycling abilities. Mums and Dads are covered with the Ridge All Terrain Pro for \u0026pound15. Kids can chose polka dots , princesses , stars or even an absolutely awesome skull design . Let everyone chose the helmet they love and they\u0027ll be excited to wear it when they next go for a bike ride. Be seen   Bike lights aren\u0027t just about finding your way in the dark. Increasingly people are using them like running lights on a car - for visibility. Using flashing lights means that other road users can see you more easily - and when the sun does set you can switch to constant illumination. As a rule the brighter your bike lights the better. During the day they will need to be more than 400 lumens to be easily seen, so get the brightest lights you can - like the Halfords Superbright LED bike light set, \u0026pound15. It\u0027s also worth considering high visibility jackets for big and little riders alike. Halfords has a family pack of these that contains two adult and two childrens vests. You can, of course, buy these individually too. These are especially important as the light fades in the evening and when dark winter nights eventually roll around. Adjust and maintain   It\u0027s important to make sure that you kids bikes are well adjusted to their size. Make sure that the saddle is high enough for them to be able to pedal comfortably, but also still reach the ground with the ball of their foot. Make sure that lights all work, and get recharged or new batteries as they dim. You should also make sure the bikes reflectors are in the right place and are not broken. You can get replacement reflects and other fun light accessories - like spoke lights - at Halfords. Brakes, gears and tyre pressures should all be regularly checked too. If you kids are out on their own then encourage them to tell you if anything doesn\u0027t feel right on the bike - say, brakes getting less effective. Encourage them to check the tyre pressures but back that up with monthly checks of your own. For smaller kids who cycle less you can check all these things before you go on a ride, but remember punctures can vary in size and worsen if you continue to use the bike without fixing them. Likewise, brake cables stretch over time and need adjustment to stay efficient and safe. If there are any problems pop in to Halfords for a free check on your bike, giving you complete confidence without having to get your hands dirty. In-store experts will check tyre pressure, brakes and gears. Consider a new bike for little riders   A child\u0027s bike should last at least two years before they outgrow it. But obviously everyone grows at different speeds and growth spurts make this sort of thing hard to predict. So make sure that your kids bikes are the right size for them. Halfords has a video that guides you through finding the right size bike. You can also pop into a store with your little ones to get some help and advice on the correct size. When sitting one the saddle a child should be able to reach the floor with the ball of their foot. They should also be able to stand over the top tube which runs horizontally from the handlebars to the saddle. There are also size guides on all the Halfords bike pages which help explain what height they are designed for. If you find you need a new bike consider the sort of cycling your child will be doing. If it\u0027s mostly on-road, perhaps for older children who ride to school or out with friends, then consider a hybrid like the Apollo Vortice Junior Hybrid Bike for \u0026pound104 (save \u0026pound26) . If your kids are younger or only want to ride off-road then a mountain bike is a good choice - consider the Carrera Blast Junior for \u0026pound232 (save \u0026pound58) .

But the plan has already spectacularly unravelled, even though she hasn\u0027t officially announced it yet. The Prime Minister insisted said the NHS will receive an additional \u0026pound20 billion a year in real terms funding by 2024, meaning a weekly increase of \u0026pound384 million in real terms, and \u0026pound600 million a week in cash terms compared with now. She was keen to promote the idea of the cash coming from a so-called Brexit dividend - the money Brexiteers claim we\u0027ll claw back once we leave the EU. Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) director Paul Johnson says the dividend doesn\u0027t exist.  He says the UK faces a steep exit bill, much of the money that would have gone to the EU has already been promised elsewhere, and the Office for Budget Responsibility has calculated public finances will be \u0026pound15 billion a year worse off due to Brexit. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell told BBC Radio 5 Live\u0027s Pienaar\u0027s Politics the announcement was a publicity stunt. He said: Can you imagine if I\u0027d come forward like this? There\u0027d be accusations of magic money trees, this a magic money forest that\u0027s come out this morning. Even senior Tory Dr Sarah Wollaston, who chairs the Commons Health Committee branded the idea tosh. She tweeted: The Brexit dividend tosh was expected but treats the public as fools. Sad to see Govt slide to populist arguments rather than evidence on such an important issue. This will make it harder to have a rational debate about the \u0027who \u0026amp how\u0027 of funding \u0026amp sharing this fairly. Referring to controversial promises made by the Leave campaign during the referendum, Mrs May told BBC1\u0027s The Andrew Marr Show: Some people may remember seeing a figure on the side of a bus a while back of \u0026pound350 million a week in cash.  Well, I can tell you what I am announcing will mean that in 2023-24, there will be about \u0026pound600 million a week in cash, more in cash, going into the NHS. Mrs May said the money, which would not be used for social care, would amount to an increase of 3.4%, and said the country would also have to contribute a bit more to health service funding. Asked where the non-Brexit dividend element of the funding would come, Mrs May said: As a country we will be contributing more, a bit more, but also we will have that sum of money that is available from the European Union. It is expected that taxes and borrowing will rise to pay for the increase in funding, and resources will be redirected from the more than \u0026pound9 billion a year the UK currently pays into the EU. The move comes as Mrs May faces another turbulent week in Parliament on the Brexit front with Tory rebels again threatening to defy her over how much influence MPs will have over any withdrawal deal.

Sir Christopher Chope prevented a bill making progress in Parliament on Friday, that would have made taking photos up women\u0027s skirts without their consent a specific criminal offence. After Chope and fellow Tory backbencher Philip Davies had ground the House of Commons to a halt by talking for hours about a previous bill on the order paper, MPs had an opportunity to wave the ban through its first stage without a full debate. But Chope shouted object, which stalled the bill\u0027s progress.  Chope has used similar tactics to slow or block progress on a string of bills - including a pardon for Sir Alan Turing, a ban on revenge evictions, the ban on wild animals in circuses and abolishing hospital car parking charges. Presenting a selected list to the Prime Minister in a broadcast interview this morning, the BBC\u0027s Andrew Marr asked the Prime Minister: Why did you give him a knighthood six months ago?

He was 24, I was 21 and our relationship got off to a really fabulous start. After a couple of months, we decided to pack in our jobs and travel the world together. Our first destination was Bangkok and, excitedly, we headed out for a bite to eat. All the traditional Thai dishes smelled fantastic and looked wonderfully exotic. But I’d heard horror stories about food poisoning from street food, so I decided to stick to chips and mayonnaise.  Boring, admittedly, but I thought it best to play safe. I felt pretty grim the following morning but put it down to jet lag. Two days later, however, I was bedridden and really suffering. I was pale, sweating and having terrible tummy trouble. It was clear I had food poisoning.  At Richard’s insistence I saw a doctor and was sent away with antibiotics. The next day was my birthday. We had planned a great night out – a fantastic meal, with cocktails and dancing. But it was not to be. I took a turn for the worse and my stomach cramps became unbearable.  I went to the doctor again and was quickly admitted to hospital. It was a terrifying experience – being rushed around, with doctors asking me questions in Thai and broken English. The pain was getting worse by the second. Richard and I held each other, anxiously awaiting results of blood tests and scans. Then, suddenly and without warning, my belly was wiped down by nurses. I was being prepped for surgery – and panicked. Rich called his dad, a doctor in the UK, and he Skyped the Thai surgeon to find out what was going on. It took just a few moments for him to work out that I had contracted a rare strain of salmonella, sometimes found in mayonnaise, which had triggered ulcerative colitis.

I was the biggest in the football team, the biggest in my group of mates. I had an unhealthy relationship with food. It was mostly greed – there was just no ‘off’ switch. I have a sweet tooth and can put away a lot of sweets, chocolates and biscuits. I remember being at work once and there were doughnuts so I had one, put two more in my pocket and walked out, then went back and got more. I must have had six of them, it’s embarrassing when you think about it.  As an adult I became an emotional eater – something would upset or frustrate me and the next thing I’m eating a massive burger and a big pudding to make me feel better. I sought a lot of happiness from food. Yet it was that vicious circle where I’d eat because it made me happy and then feel unhappy because I’d eaten. Food is definitely my addiction.  I’d always be trying diets. I’d start in January to get fit for summer, then by Easter I’d have put it all back on and more on top. You name it I’ve done it – cutting out carbs, liquid diets, eating nothing but chicken.  The most extreme would be starving myself. I’d be so low on energy – not ideal with my active job as an electrician on a building site. And I wasn’t as competent as I should be at work, I couldn’t do jobs as quickly or as efficiently as my peers because of my size, and I was nervous about fitting through hatches or into tight spaces.  Losing weight isn’t easy in a blokey environment like a building site – you can imagine the rubbish they eat. And people think you can eat what you want if you are active at work or exercise, that you can out-train a bad diet.  I’ve always had the ‘fat jokes’ too. Being a man I swept it under the table and I realise there is a fine line when it comes to banter. It was a joke but later I’d think, ‘That was a bit more personal than I’d have liked, that was quite nasty.’ I’d laugh and pick on a fault of someone else’s to give a bit back, then I’d walk past Greggs and buy a bag of food that’d all be gone by the time I got home.   One of the things that affected me most was when I put a picture of myself on a paradise beach in Jamaica on Facebook and the first comment someone made was ‘nice moobs’. It’s the only time I’ve deleted a comment, it really got to me.  Another soul-destroying moment came when I realised I wasn’t fit enough to move around on the pitch at football and had to be in goal instead. I’d played since I was four and got to the point when I could hardly run. That was a bit of a wake-up call. But it was a routine health check at the end of 2016 that provided the real turning point. The nurse told me my size was putting my health at risk and used the words ‘morbidly obese’, which was an awful thing to hear.  The thought that I was damaging my health and risking not being there for my daughters Emma, five, and April, 18 months, was devastating. She offered me 12 weeks’ worth of Slimming World membership on the NHS through a scheme in Solihull, where I live.  At first I refused to go, but my wife Rachel was also offered the membership and she did join. Five days later after eating the same meals as her I’d lost 10lb, I couldn’t believe it. That was enough to convince me to join a group myself. It wasn’t easy. Walking into that room was daunting and I’ve never felt so embarrassed, nervous and ashamed, but I was instantly put at ease by my Consultant Gemma, she really looked after me. I lost 6lb the week after, then 3lb most weeks until I reached my target, six months later. Slimming World is great for a man with a big appetite, because you can eat a lot of things like lean meat and pasta. I couldn’t believe I could lose weight while eating burgers and chips.  I can honestly say I eat more now than I did when I was at my biggest – I’ve never before had three big meals a day plus snacks. I just make more educated choices. While everyone else tucked into fry-ups I’d have a lean bacon sandwich on wholemeal bread and feel just as satisfied.  I hadn’t cooked before, but I make a lot of the family meals from scratch now and I enjoy it. I never realised the hidden sugars and preservatives in sauces, so now it’s all about healthy eating. I still allow myself treats – on a Saturday night I have a nice meal or a few beers, but I don’t go mad. Exercise wise, I started 25-minute HIIT (high intensity interval training) sessions at home with my wife once the kids were in bed. And then I started running.  Before, I couldn’t even run after my daughter, I’d give up after a few steps, and I’d get out of breath wrestling with her on the floor. But, over eight months, I built up with the ‘Couch To 5K’ run, and this April I did the Manchester Marathon, going from never running to completing a marathon in 4 hours 45 minutes. And I’m back out of goal – when I went back to football for the new season they didn’t even recognise me! I love food and the best thing is I don’t have to change that. It’s a lifestyle change. I’ve learnt things from Slimming World that will last a lifetime. I live life now so much more than I ever did.

People around the world tuned in to see her dress, and the dramatic ivory silk taffeta gown by British fashion designers David and Elizabeth Emanuel inspired women for years. Like most other royal brides, she also wore a stunning tiana. And this weekend another bride said her vows wearing Diana\u0027s diamond tiara - even though she\u0027s not a member of the royal family.  Celia McCorquodale married George Woodhouse in a country wedding in the small village of Stoke Rochford, Lincolnshire, on Saturday. Celia is the younger daughter of Diana\u0027s sister Lady Sarah McCorquodale, which makes her Diana\u0027s niece.  Prince Harry and Meghan Markle were among the guests on the day, just four weeks after their own special day.  Princess Diana broke with tradition on her wedding day and wore the Spencer family tiara rather than picking one from the royal collection.  The tiara dates back to th 18th century, and the family heirloom is now owned the Diana\u0027s brother Earl Spencer. It has been worn by several members of the family on their wedding day, including both of Diana\u0027s sisters. Celia wore the stunning tiara with a full veil and a beautiful lace-bodiced dress with a bouquet of white roses. She arrived at the church in a vintage 1910 Rolls Royce Silver Ghost and walked into the church on the arm of her father, Neil McCorquodale. The new Duke and Duchess of Sussex were full of smiles as they arrived at the ceremony.  But the new Duchess of Sussex, who was wearing a long-sleeved blue-and-white paisley dress and white fascinator, almost had an embarrassing moment when she took a bit of a stumble walking into the church.

Rimi Thapar appeared on the show looking for \u0026pound50,000 investment in her LoveRaw business. But she turned down Debra Meaden when she asked for 30 per cent stake in return for her investment in the company which makes organic, gluten and dairy-free products. She has now made the company a success on her own and said she\u0027s glad she walked away from the dragons. Speaking to the Manchester Evening News, Rimi said: “They were just asking for way too much. There was no way we were giving that much away. All that time I spent building the business, doing 20-hour days, I just couldn’t give a big chunk of it away.  We did want the investment, of course, but we weren’t in such a desperate position.” Thapar, a former banker, who lives in Altrincham with husband Manav and daughter Marni, two, said she doesn\u0027t regret turning down the Dragon\u0027s offer. After the show we put together an investment deck which valued the company at \u0026pound1.7m and raised what we needed through private angel investors, she said.  Appearing on the show was an amazing experience. It was a great opportunity to show people what we do and the philosophy behind our products. We are passionate about creating wholesome food that makes people feel good. The Dragons are great at what they do having the chance to pitch to them is invaluable. “It was very scary, it’s a very intimidating process. I walked in and saw these poker faces, the dragons are looking right at you. All I was thinking was, ‘don’t mess up, don’t scupper the pitch. Thapar is originally from Wolverhampton where her parents were textile manufacturers. After studying economics at university she got a job at Merrill Lynch working in its private banking arm. I really enjoyed working with a range of people, Thapar said. It was a tough job and taught me to be resilient, organised and certainly better at crunching numbers.  During her seven years at the firm Thapar met and married her husband Manav, who was from Manchester but was running an interior textile business in Spain. In 2010 Thapar quit her job to join Manav in Spain where she started to help developing the e-commerce side of his business. But then 2011 Thapar\u0027s father died after a serious illness. During her grief she started to explore the local markets where she discovered a world of fresh, organic and locally grown food. I found that eating this wonderful food made me feel better and it started me off on a health food journey, she said. I gave up gluten, and felt better, then tried veganism. I found it helped me get out of that dark and negative time. Thapar said the experience completely transformed her attitude towards food.

A 15-point plan written by wife Angie has guided him since she died in 2010. He has carefully plaited hair, ironed shirts, made sure the kids are in before dark – and vetted boyfriends and girlfriends. Proud Ian is now using the same rules to raise a new generation – his five grandchildren. His loving and caring offspring have done him and Angie proud. And, fittingly, the clan will gather round him today to say a special thank you on Father’s Day.  Former miner Ian, 56, lost childhood sweetheart Angie to cancer. Days before she died at 48, she compiled a list of parenting essentials for Ian and the instructions – shown right – inspired the bestselling book called Mum’s Way. Today Ian and the family will walk along the Yorkshire coast, with Angie in their thoughts. He said: “We’re going to do our annual walk across Thornwick Bay at Flamborough Head, where we’ll pay a visit to Angie’s bench, lay flowers and share memories. “We used to lay in that spot as teenagers looking over the bay, so it’s a perfect way to keep her involved. When we used to do the walk with Angie, she’d cook a medium rare steak back at home, with chips, onion rings, mushrooms and a sliced tomato. “This year I’ll order that from a pub, where I’ll unwrap presents from the kids. My older sons get me Joop or Hugo Boss aftershave as a nod to Angie, as she’d always got me that from them.  “Ella usually gets me chocolates in spite of rule 14 – ‘Don’t give them too many sweets’. She’s found a loophole!” Ian and Angie married in 1985 after falling in love at 14 when they met in the park in Grimethorpe, South Yorks. They had three sons – Ryan, 32, Damon, 29, and Reece, 27 – before Angie was diagnosed with breast cancer at 29. Five years later, after the all-clear, they went on to have five more kids – Connor, 19, twins Jake and Jade, 15, Corey, 12, and Ella, 10. But in 2008, non-smoker Angie developed a persistent cough and doctors found incurable cancer in her lung. It prompted her to write the tear-stained set of rules which Ian swears by. The pointers also cover bedtime rituals, how much screen time the kids get, and a reminder to use sunblock. Now mum’s pearls of wisdom are being passed on to Ian’s grandkids – Ryan’s son Issak, seven, Damon’s two sons Warren, 11, and Cohen, 17 weeks, and Reece’s son Jaxon, three, and daughter Willow, one.  And Ian says he is just as strict with the grandkids. They get just one hour computer time and are indoors before dark to enjoy dinner together. And Ian brings out Angie’s note when necessary to remind his brood about what Mum would have wanted. Another rule – number 16 – was scribbled out and, on reflection, Ian believes it was a reminder from Angie to look after himself. He goes on: “I miss Angie every day but I really did feel her absence during the birth of our grandchildren. She’d have loved hugging them, just as I do.” His hard work enforcing Angie’s list really has seen the kids flourish. Ella was just three when her mum died, but is set to leave primary school with a 100 per cent attendance record. Ian \u0026shyrecalled her first nativity play and said it was particularly difficult.  He said: “As I sat down a \u0026shyteacher said ‘Mr Millthorpe, you are in for a real treat’. Then Ella sang a solo number. I could see the parents turning to look at me.

Abi Parker from Newport, South Wales, and 19 of her friends - including the future bride - were supposed to fly to Malaga from Bristol Airport on May 31. But the 32-year-old said the group were left devastated when the budget airline cancelled their flight without warning when they were in the departure lounge ready to take off.  Ms Parker told Wales Online : “We were waiting in the departure lounge and the flight had already been delayed for 40 minutes.  We were then told over the tannoy that the flight had been cancelled. We were escorted out of the departure lounge by the police. “There were only two members of staff dealing with everybody from the flight. There were children on the floor crying, we didn’t know what to do. “Two of our friends went down to the customer service desk and that’s when we found out that it was because the staff had worked too long. They had been working for 11 hours and couldn’t work any longer. But we booked in September, they should have been prepared.”  Ms Parker said the group felt like “criminals” as police escorted them and other passengers out of the departures lounge and were disappointed with the lack of support offered by the flight company. However, a spokeswoman for easyJet said if police escorted passengers away from the lounge, the decision would have been made by the airport or the police force - not easyJet. “They told us there were no flights for the next week, said Ms Parker. The bride thought the hen do was going to be cancelled. “One of the members of staff even turned around and said ‘I hope you’ve got your coats because it’s raining outside’. That isn’t what people want to hear when their flight has just been cancelled. “We were basically told to leave the departure lounge, get our suitcases and leave the airport. “In the end, we managed to get new flights through our travel agent but we had to pay \u0026pound6,000 for the new flights. Half of the group had to fly from Stansted and the others from Birmingham and we had to split it onto two credit cards. “EasyJet wouldn’t even pay for us to the use computers to search for new flights, we had to keep putting a pound in just to use it. “We had to sleep in the airport until the next day when we were able to travel.

The duchesses are both 36, they routinely set fashion trends and they have helped to spark a worldwide frenzy over Britain\u0027s royals. The wives of Prince Harry and Prince William have been pictured looking friendly during their rare public appearances together, but are they really friends? An expert has examined Meghan and Kate\u0027s body language and given her ruling on their relationship.  Author and public speaking coach Judi James told the  that Meghan tends to subconsciously mirror Kate in a bid to embed herself in the Royal Family. She said: “Meghan’s mirroring of Kate currently involves wardrobe and body language mimicry and this reflects a degree of submission to show a desire for rapport and team acceptance.” That kind of behaviour could strengthen their established friendship, she added.  Judi pointed to Meghan and Kate\u0027s appearance at the Trooping the Colour ceremony on June 9. She said: “In this respect we have the nude court shoes, the satellite hats and those small clutch bags held in front of the torso in a very signature ‘Middleton’ style.” Last week, Meghan joined the Queen in Cheshire as they made their first joint royal engagement together.

According to local rumours, the new Duke and Duchess of Sussex are hoping to move in as soon as the development is finished. The luxury manor house has three reception rooms, a huge walk-in wardrobe and staff quarters - so it would be the perfect home for the new couple. Computer-generated images of the development show the stone building in all its glory, including the stunning grounds and garden. But the stunning house, which is set in the Great Tew estate, has a very ironic name which couldn\u0027t be less fitting.  Bizarrely, the huge building is called Beggers Lodge.  A source told the Mail on Sunday : The property has been earmarked for a specific couple and the project is shrouded in secrecy, so naturally the assumption in the village is that Meghan and Harry might move in.  The property will take at least a year to build, which would explain why they are renting in the area for that amount of time.  According to Zoopla , the old building on the site was worth \u0026pound945,000 so the new property will likely have a huge price tag.   The Great Tew estate is just over an hour from London, and is often described as one of the prettiest villages in England. It has been managed by the Johnston Family since the 1960s. The estate\u0027s website lists some of the site\u0027s best features, including a thriving village community and excellent village services. The village also has a local shop, cafe, pub, cricket club and a primary school.

The pair held hands as they walked into church ahead of the ceremony, where bride Celia McCorquodale wore the diamond tiara Princess Diana wore during her wedding to Prince Charles. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex were pictured smiling and looking relaxed as they walked along a footpath with other guests. Meghan took a bit of a stumble next to Harry, but he kept a firm grip on her hand. The 36-year-old former actress stunned in a long-sleeved blue-and-white paisley shirt dress and white fascinator at the wedding of Diana\u0027s niece.  Harry, 33, looked sharp in a morning suit, with a royal blue tie to match Meghan\u0027s dress as he watched his cousin wed exactly four weeks after his big day. Meghan\u0027s dark hair was neatly pinned up and she wore white high heels and carried a small white clutch bag. Celia, who is the younger daughter of Diana\u0027s sister Lady Sarah McCorquodale, looked beautiful in a lace-bodiced dress and a full veil, held in place by the stunning diamond tiara worn by Diana at her wedding to the Prince of Wales in 1981.  Celia, 29, attended Harry and Meghan\u0027s wedding exactly a month ago and she returned the favour by inviting the couple to her country wedding to George Woodhouse at St Andrew and St Mary\u0027s Church in the small village of Stoke Rochford, Lincolnshire. Harry and Meghan looked delighted to be at the occasion as they arrived at the pretty country church holding hands and smiling and laughing with the other guests. The pair were warmly greeted by the Spencer family, with Harry\u0027s cousin, Louis Spencer, 24, who was recently dubbed Britain\u0027s most eligible bachelor, giving him a bear hug and kissing Meghan on the cheek.  The bride arrived at the church in a vintage 1910 Rolls Royce Silver Ghost and walked into the church on the arm of her father, Neil McCorquodale. Her bridal train was carried by a pretty flower girl and she was accompanied by an array of bridesmaids. She carried a bouquet featuring white roses.    Other guests at Saturday\u0027s nuptials included Diana\u0027s brother Earl Charles Spencer and her sister Lady Jane Fellowes, who did a reading for Harry and Meghan at their wedding. Harry\u0027s cousin, Lady Kitty Spencer, 27, who is an aspiring model, was also at the wedding and looked stunning in a floral dress. Prince William and his family did not attend the wedding.  The ceremony lasted around 45 minutes and afterwards the wedding guests were invited back to a reception at Celia\u0027s parents\u0027 home nearby. The glittering tiara worn by Celia is now a family heirloom owned by Diana\u0027s brother, Earl Spencer. Diana wore it on her wedding day and at a number of events in the following years.

The poll of 2,000 eight to 18-year-olds found just 57 per cent of girls currently play some kind of sport outside of school or college, compared to 79 per cent of boys. And while 45 per cent of young boys are part of a local sports team or club away from school, just 27 per cent of girls said the same. More than a third of girls blame their lack of participation on feeling like they are not good enough to take part while 18 per cent say they are too shy. In fact, 43 per cent of youngsters believe it is easier for boys to play sports at a grassroots level than girls. And 47 per cent of all children surveyed perceive most sports to be male-orientated, but one quarter of 8-18-year-olds would like to play a sport usually associated with the opposite sex. Ben Newbury, Senior Brand Manager from supporters of grassroots cricket, Yorkshire Tea, who commissioned the research in partnership with national cricket charity, Chance to Shine, said: “Sport can play a key role in building up confidence and self-esteem in children and young adults, so it is disappointing that these are the key reasons girls are playing less sport than boys.  “Women’s sport is really thriving at the moment, with female teams securing high profile wins on the world stage in sports such as cricket, hockey and netball. “We feel more should be done to break down the barriers that make girls less likely to take up sports at a grassroots level particularly in sports like cricket, which can be perceived as male-dominated. \u0027\u0027Initiatives like National Cricket Week give children an equal opportunity to have fun and learn through cricket.” The study found just four in 10 girls describe themselves as sporty – compared to almost two thirds of boys. Football is the most common sport for boys to play outside of school, followed by swimming, tennis and cricket. But girls are most likely to be part of a swimming club, with football, tennis and cricket also popular choices. It also emerged that while 62 per cent of boys plan to continue playing their favourite sport once they finish their education, just 38 per cent of girls think they will.

Emma Almond, 32, says her daughter Navaeh was swarmed by the parasitic insects on the first night of her family\u0027s weekend break in Southport, Merseyside.  The mum-of-four told the Liverpool Echo she found tiny black bugs on Navaeh\u0027s body and the girl was suffering from painful bites.  But Pontins has hit back, saying the mum brought her own travel cot and bedding, and it disputes the allegation of bed bugs.  Emma, from Bolton, Greater Manchester, said her daughter later began vomiting and has been left incredibly distressed over their stay at Pontins. The mum said: They let us know they weren\u0027t checking in until 5pm because the rooms weren\u0027t clean. We got to our room and they were filthy. It was just dirty. It wasn\u0027t until we went to bed that I thought anything of it. I put the bedding on, we woke up the next morning and I went to undress the baby and thought \u0027what\u0027s that?\u0027  There was a little black bug on her skin. I brushed it off her and didn\u0027t think anything of it until my cousin said \u0027she\u0027s got chicken pox overnight\u0027. I said I didn\u0027t know, then she had another bug under her arm. I said they look like bed bugs. I had seen them on Facebook. She added: [Navaeh] was distressed, she was throwing up and everything. She has been really poorly since we got back.  Concerned at the state of her daughter, Emma took her to the nearest pharmacist in Ainsdale, where she claims she was told little Nevaeh had been bitten by some sort of bugs. She said: I went to the pharmacist in Ainsdale and said \u0027what\u0027s this?\u0027 and he said the doctor is right next door and you need to go and book in because they\u0027re bites. I said I\u0027m here on holiday at Pontins and he said you really need to go see a doctor.  He said it was some sort of bite, bed bug, ants, and she had an allergic reaction and that\u0027s why they were so big. I said we\u0027ve not been on the beach yet, we\u0027ve not started the holiday and it was already ruined. He said it must have been in the rooms. They could have been on the floor where she was playing. Emma said she was appalled at the state of the resort, where she stayed with her children and partner Dominic Cullen after arriving on May 28. After Nevaeh\u0027s nasty bites were discovered, Emma complained to staff at Pontins.  She said: I went to them and they said we will move you rooms. We were in 517 then they moved us to 463. That was absolutely immaculate the second one. They had scrubbed everything in that room - you could smell the beds had been sprayed - but obviously I wasn\u0027t happy. She added: I\u0027m absolutely appalled - I\u0027ve only been there three times. My mother-in-law has been there all her life. In a year the place has gone to s***, I can\u0027t believe it.

Dr Jane Barton, 69, is accused of prescribing fatal overdoses of opiate painkiller diamorphine to elderly patients in the 1990s. An independent panel led by ex-Bishop of Liverpool James Jones is looking into whether she shortened hundreds of people’s lives. It has examined 833 death certificates she signed at Gosport War Memorial Hospital, Hants. A report compiled after the \u0026pound13million probe is due to be published on Wednesday. It will reportedly say Dr Barton was responsible for a number of deaths. Dori Graham said her husband, Leonard, was killed after receiving care from Dr Barton and then a fatal injection by a nurse – the probe has included deaths involving other health workers acting on her orders.  Dori, 86, said: “Len said he wasn’t in pain but they gave him the injection anyway. I sat there. Within a few minutes he was dead.” The number of people who died suspiciously under her care could exceed the 92 cases examined by police previously. Families have suggested relatives were routinely given huge doses to “keep them quiet” on over-stretched wards. Another patient Arthur Cunningham, 79, died at the hospital in 1998, but his stepson Charles Farthing said: “He went in to be treated for bedsores. There’s no way he was near death.” Concerns about Dr Barton date back to 1991, when two nurses said they believed patients were being given diamorphine instead of the sedative diazepam.

Lord Aleem has 576,000 followers on Instagram and 336,574 subscribers on YouTube , and it is through his following that he has managed to help so many people overseas.  Lord Aleem, whose real name is Aleem Iqbal, told the paper: My grandfather worked the in the Royal Mint polishing coins. My father is a self-made man who had everything against him. I am grateful for what I have been blessed with.  It is surreal seeing my own showroom when my father and I used to stare through showroom windows many years ago dreaming of owning just one car inside. Now we own the whole lot and more. I thank God everyday. As for my humanitarian work, there’s a lot more to do. BirminghamLive caught up with the celebrity YouTuber while he was on pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia, having just completed a second trip to Lebanon to help provide food parcels to Syrian refugees. I have been blessed with so much in life, I feel it is my duty to help those that are less fortunate, he said.

I never applied for Top Gear, I don’t know where people got those facts from, he laughed. I think the current presenters are great and are doing a fantastic job. My life is Top Gear every day. My business is my baby.  My business has allowed me to live every one of my childhood dreams. I couldn’t ask for more. When you\u0027re a millionaire, there\u0027s not much you want for.

Nigel Chappell, who was 21 stone in January, had been \u0027unhappy\u0027 with his weight for some time but decided to give Slimming World a go after doctors told him he needed to lose weight for an upcoming operation. At first he thought the groups were only aimed at women and assumed the focus would be on \u0027diet\u0027 food and talking about people\u0027s emotions.  It was nerve-wracking walking through those doors for the first time but I wasn’t the only man there and everyone was so supportive, he told Cornwall Live.

Nigel is now 16 stone two pounds and he has scooped up his group\u0027s Slimming World Man of the Year 2018.  He said: I’ve realised now though that far from being weak, asking for help takes strength of character and getting support to make changes has given me a sense of confidence that is benefitting every aspect of my life. I didn’t know what my mates would think about me attending Slimming World but they’ve been right behind it. Once they realised I could still have a beer they started to take an interest and when they see me eating things like steak and homemade chips, chicken curry or a roast dinner they always ask how it’s possible to eat like that and still lose weight. What really had them sitting up and paying attention though was how well I was losing weight. As the weight came off, Nigel found he had more energy and so he was eager to use it. He added: As a man I always thought that physical activity would be the best way to lose weight, but when I was at my heaviest I just wasn’t fit enough to do it.

Warning signs have also been posted around the building telling travellers: Please do not lay down on the seats. The Essex airport brought in the new policy amid claims that hundreds of passengers were camping out overnight - some of them on hammocks or blow-up beds.  But it isn\u0027t going down well with passengers, who say the move is unfair and mean to tired travellers. Under the lock-out policy, which began on Monday, the departures wing is closed after the final flight of the night. It remains shut from midnight until 2am, meaning anyone arriving at the budget flight airport during that time is directed to the arrivals area. They can take a seat and rest there, but they are banned from having a nap on the floor.  Guards are on patrol to wake up those who are fast asleep. Passengers who book early morning flights have been told not to arrive sooner than their scheduled check-in time. Stansted said it has seen up to 600 people camp out in the terminal overnight. Some travellers would rather sleep on the terminal floor instead of a local hotel, where rooms can cost upwards of \u0026pound140 a night. They can hamper overnight work or get in the way of passengers arriving later in the morning.

Details of the new coins had not then been released by the Royal Mint , which is based 10 miles from her hometown of Caerphilly in Llantrisant, Wales.  It is believed to have been accidentally pocketed by someone at the Mint, before being spent at a nearby shop.  She put it on eBay where it fetched bids of \u0026pound16,000 - but these are believed to be fake.   Jordan, 19, told Wales Online : I was just out shopping in Caerphilly, I came home and checked my bag to make sure my card was still there and I saw a lovely coin.  I Googled it to see if it was worth anything but there was nothing about the coin anywhere so I went on Facebook and contacted a group - it was something like UK Coin Collecters.  I spoke to them and said I had this coin and they told me about it. I couldn\u0027t believe it. When they are officially launched, the coins will feature the travelling bear in two of his most famous locations, Paddington Station and Buckingham Palace. Launched to celebrate the 60th anniversary of his first adventure in A Bear Called Paddington, the coins will be released on Monday, in both silver and colour. The Royal Mint says the coins won\u0027t be released into circulation, and to get your hands on one will cost \u0026pound10. You can buy them direct from the Mint. Jordan added: I\u0027m not a coin collector so it was a bit of a surprise. I have been contacted by the Royal Mint. We had advice and were told it was their mistake so I could keep the coin if I wanted to. I put it up on eBay and it went up for \u0026pound16,000 but I think it was a fake bid. It\u0027s currently still in my bedroom. I\u0027m just keeping it for now. I\u0027ll have to get in contact with eBay and see what can come of it because I\u0027m worried as there are so many fake bidders.

Temperatures are expected to soar to 30C in parts of the UK on Tuesday amid a mini-heatwave. June is on track to be Britain’s hottest for 42 years, when stifling heat led to standpipes on streets as drought hit. Forecasters say a lot of fine and dry weather is set to come this summer, with this month warmer and drier than average.    This month’s average temperature of 14.7 - from June 1-14 - is 1.7C above normal. That makes it the warmest June since 1976 when it was 15C over the whole of June, Met Office figures show. Storm Hector, which brought strong winds to northern England, Northern Ireland and Scotland just days ago, will be forgotten as the Met Office forecast drier skies from Sunday with sunny spells and temperatures soaring.    Highs pushing close to 30C were forecast by ex-BBC and Met Office forecaster John Hammond of weathertrending. Temperatures are poised to pip the 29.1C hottest day of the year, set on April 19 at St James’s Park, London. Until then, Sunday will remain cool and breezy across much of the UK with temperatures lingering in the high teens or low twenties.  There will be rain or drizzle in some places with occasional clear spells. Monday will be a vast improvement with temperatures hitting about 25C in South East England and 22C in the South West, where it will be rather breezy with some rain possible. Temperatures will be in the low twenties through the Midlands and parts of Wales, and in the high teens across northern England and Northern Ireland.

However, today a spokesman told : We have told managers at each of our pubs that there should be no restrictions on customers wearing football shirts during the world cup.    “If a manager decides not to let someone in because he/she is wearing a football shirt, then we would expect the manager to have a good reason for doing so.” Outraged by the earlier news, one fan tweeted: F**k Wetherspoons and let\u0027s go somewhere else.

Ben Noctor tweeted: Wetherspoons potentially not allowing people wearing England shirts into their pubs and not displaying England flags is straight up out of f**king order, where\u0027s the patriotism. Although shirts now will be permitted, fans will not see the England flag hanging up on the walls.

Footage has emerged of a giant stingray lighting up the skies over northern Russia. A nervous woman who spotted the mystery lights in the city of Kirov wrote: “What the hell was that? It doesn’t look like anything I’ve previously seen.  Many suggested an extraterrestrial phenomenon over Russia.  “The aliens have arrived for the World Cup,” said one. The spooky display was visible from Nizhny Novgorod where England play on 24 June.  “Is that a rocket, a fireball or a UFO over Nizhny Novgorod? Talk to me comrades, I\u0027m worried!,” posted Andrey. The spectacular footage had another explanation, according to Russian space officials. The eerie light show coincided with a Soyuz-2.1.B launch from Plesetsk cosmodrome in the country’s sub-Arctic Arkhangelsk region. The rocket with a Glonass-M satellite was at 00.46 Moscow time on Sunday, 17 June.  The satellite was safely delivered to target orbit by a Fregat upper stage rocket, said military officials. While the Ministry of Defence reported a successful launch, some people on Russian social media went into a panic mode after seeing the spectacular visual display.

Whether it\u0027s them asking you a question addressed in your detailed report or just a complete disregard to the changes you requested - you always know it just went straight in the trash. One woman who believed her colleagues were guilty of this decided to prank her colleagues to test them - and she quickly realised she was right. So the next time Jordan, who works at Australian online fashion company Showpo, wrote her weekly report she added a fake announcement at the bottom. She wrote: I\u0027d also like to take this time to let you all know Matt and I are expecting! Little bubba on the way, due November.   She then waited to see how many people congratulated her on the happy news, and had therefore actually bothered to read the email, reports MamaMia .  Nothing. So either her colleagues are extremely rude and hate her or she was right and all her hard work is a complete waste of time. Eager to give them a second change, she spent the next few weeks giving them updates on her pregnancy - and even invited them to her baby shower and gender reveal party. How kind.  Still without any replies, Jordan took the opportunity to tell her colleagues she would be heading off on maternity leave in the next few weeks.  And then, after an extremely short pregnancy, Jordan shared the happy news that her baby boy had arrived.  And then - finally - some actually paid attention to her email and there was a little celebration in the office to celebrate the arrival of little Malachy.

Wa Tiba\u0027s children became concerned when she failed to return to her home in Southeast Sulawesi Thursday, June 14. A search party was launched the next morning in a desperate bid to find the 54-year-old - and her sandals, machete and torch were later found 30 metres from a patch of bushes. Nothing could have prepared Wa Tiba\u0027s sons for what happened next. The pair discovered an enormous python on the ground, barely able to move due to an enormous bulge in its belly after it had swallowed the housewife head first.  Resident Ayu Kartika said: Everybody was crying, everybody was shocked. The poor woman. This is like a horror movie. People are terrified. We are scared to go outside. We can only pray for a safety. The frantic lads called police and by 9am hundreds of villagers had gathered round the patch of grass in the remote Mabolu Village in the Lohia Regency of Muna province.  Nightmarish footage captured the moment the snake\u0027s skin was sliced open to reveal the slime-covered corpse of the housewife. She was still wearing her brown leggings and dark red top.  While the knife that Wa Tiba had gone out with the previous evening was found on the floor - suggesting she had dropped it after being struck with deadly power by the killer python. Her head was towards the snake\u0027s tail and her feet at its mouth - showing that she had been swallowed head first.  Police superintendent Agung Ramos from the Muna district Indonesian National Police said Wa Tiba had went out to check her garden the previous evening and never returned. He said: Children and residents had been looking for Wa after she did not return home. Some items belonging to victim, sandals, machete, and flashlights, were found but the victim was not there. The family then reported this to the police and the search reached its conclusion at 9am. Residents found a python that looked like it was unable to move. Residents then suspected the snake swallowed Wa Tiba.  People took the snake into the village and started splitting the snake. The suspicions were true and there was a body in tact inside the snake. Unfortunately the victim was lifeless. Wa Tiba had a traditional burial ceremony later that afternoon in keeping with traditional religious customs.  Sulawesi is an island in Indonesia that is home to some of the biggest and most deadly wild pythons in the world. In March last year, a young farmer was found dead having also been swallowed by an enormous killer snake.  Footage showed him being cut from the python\u0027s stomach after going missing the night before while harvesting on a rubber plantation.

The pair are thought to have lost their balance as they posed for selfies on the cliff in the early hours of June 12.  But family members are now demanding investigators properly explain how the pair died.  There is concern local police have not yet interviewed anyone who was with the couple immediately before they died, the Herald Sun reported.   The couple were said to be drinking at 4am before they fell with one witness hearing a scream or shot around an hour later.  But the witness has still not been interviewed by police and CCTV of the fall has not been sought.  The owner of a bar where the couple were seen drinking has also not been quizzed by investigators. And further questions surround why the pair would have been taking selfies in the pitch black.  It has also been claimed Ms Benson was clutching hairs when she was found, which have been taken away for forensic investigation. Rui Pereira da Terra, head of Cascais port\u0027s rescue service, said: Everything seems to indicate that the fall happened when they were probably trying to take a selfie. It seems they dropped their mobile phone and fell down while leaning over to retrieve it. Mr Kearns\u0027 father Bill said he was desperate to know what happened to his son.

The 29-year-old, from the Midlands, took down the terror trio after following them into an underground Afghan cave complex. He had already blasted three other fighters with his Glock when the weapon failed and he was forced to use a hammer instead. He smashed two fighters over the head inside the narrow cave. A third man then attacked him, but he was killed with a single blow.   The soldier had volunteered to crawl into the complex in a bid to take down the extremists when they escaped from a raid on their Taliban base, the Star on Sunday reported.  He was operating in total darkness and the caves had barely enough room for one man to crawl through. A source told the paper: “There wasn’t enough room to use a long-barrelled weapon so the Brit used his Glock 9mm pistol and grabbed a claw hammer.”  “He couldn’t see the Taliban but he could hear and smell them. He shot three of them dead one after the other but then his pistol jammed.” The source described how the SAS man picked up the hammer instead and continued the battle. He said: He fought two more in the dark where the tunnel opened into a larger room which was partially lit by a candle.

School received overwhelming support from parents during their Charter journey, with some writing letters to the head teacher reflecting on the positive impact it had on their children.“An equality and diversity team of nine pupils took a lead role in reviewing and developing the school’s policies, a process that involved the ideas and opinions of young people every step of the way.”The LGBT Charter has been awarded to organisations including Barnardo’s Scotland and Scottish Women’s Aid, as well as 18 high schools across the country. It represents a serious and ongoing commitment to improving and evidencing an organisation’s policies and values around LGBTI inclusion.The spokesman added: “LGBT Youth Scotland provide comprehensive training for staff members.“We also guide each organisation’s LGBT Charter team through the collation of a folder of evidence that tells the story of their journey and roadmaps the future.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b14fff082b8e.jpg ","title":"dundee people westports scout bar reopens as ballys two years after closure","story":"\t\t\t\t\tTwo years after the closure of the famous Scout Bar in Westport, it was reopened after a renovation and name change to Bally’s.The image shows Bob Palmer, manager William McKelvie, Joe Wilkinson and John Marshall at the grand opening.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b238ee9a6428-376x564.jpg ","title":"dundee school staff shortages it is getting better compared to a few years ago","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThe city council’s education convener has hit back over claims that staff shortages are affecting pupils.Councillor Gregor Murray, of the SNP administration, insists the staffing levels at Dundee schools are improving compared to a few years ago.But Labour say pupils and staff are bearing the brunt of unfilled positions and are calling for tighter financial controls.The party’s children and families spokesman, Councillor Charlie Malone, said he would be writing to the council seeking an update on teacher numbers for the next session.Recent figures showed that for 2017, there were 1,374 teachers employed in public schools in Dundee compared with 1,397 the previous year.Currently, there are 25 primary vacancies, though no head teacher roles are unfilled.But Councillor Murray denied there were concerns over unfilled vacancies ahead of the new term.The SNP politician said: “I was definitely perplexed at the claims of the shortage of head teachers. We’ve got one retiring at Baldragon and we’ve filled that.“You’d think that they (Labour) would know that, considering that elected members sit on the panel to determine head teachers. It’s fair to say the position is getting better compared to a few years ago.“The posts that are unfilled at the moment will be filled. It’s not a case where we’ll just not replace anyone.“We’ve got applicants and candidates for every position. That’s not to say that they are all necessarily the right candidates and we still have to go through the interview process along with all the correct checks to prove that they are suitable.”Mr Malone believes vacant posts are having an adverse impact on closing the attainment gap in Dundee and called on the administration to “up its game” or risk “complete failure”.He added: “If we are to meet targets for enhancing the learning experience and closing the attainment gap, then we need to ensure our schools have the resources necessary for every child to get the educational opportunities they deserve.“Also, that our teachers can receive the support necessary to continue their efforts to deliver high-quality teaching without any undue stress due to staffing shortages.“Tighter financial controls would have allowed the council to free up money to deliver an incentive to attract the subject teachers.“The administration rejected Labour’s proposals at budget time that would have delivered a golden hello to the subject teachers we need to attract.“More financial control by the administration could have delivered so much more and resolved the problem we currently have in attracting teachers.”But Councillor Murray said Labour’s alternative was unviable, adding: “Other councils have done that but that’s not the route I want to go down.“It doesn’t work. It becomes an arms race where one authority can offer more than the other.“It doesn’t create any more staff and it’s just a waste of public money.“I’ve only been in the position for 12 months and it’s definitely been a lot easier this year finding staff.“I think a lot of it is down to there being more confidence in the city.“We’re doing a lot of work with Dundee University for people who can’t afford to quit their jobs to apply for teaching vacancies in city schools and that’s been positive.“There’s certainly no shortage of people applying.“We’ve been inundated particularly with people wanting to become head teachers, which is a good thing.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b238ed81901b-846x564.jpg ","title":"dundee va could host weddings as approval given to sell booze","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThe V\u0026ampA Dundee museum could host events as varied as weddings and casino nights, its operators have revealed.The details emerged during a meeting of the council’s licensing board, during which the gallery made its case to sell booze for consumption both on and off the premises.The museum’s operation plan, distributed ahead of the meeting, revealed V\u0026ampA bosses hope to stage live music, dance performances, film screenings, private events and casino nights.Janet Hood, representing the V\u0026ampA at the board meeting, said this could even stretch to include weddings.She said: “As I am sure you are all aware, there is a cafe in the foyer.

the favourites last season to top the table but fell well short of champions St Mirren.This time around, it promises to be even more difficult with two teams coming down from the Premiership.Starting with those two, let’s have a look at the Tangerines’ main challengers this coming season.Partick ThistleThe Jags became only the second top-tier side to lose out in the play-offs and are among the favourites to go straight back up.Alan Archibald has stayed on at Firhill and is rebuilding his side for the Championship.How strong they are remains to be seen but the experienced duo of Chris Erskine and Kris Doolan will be big factors in any success they have.Ross CountyAlso coming down, the Staggies aren’t hanging about putting together a team that can win the division.Co-managers Stuart Kettlewell and Steven Ferguson are determined to make their first chance in management a success.County will be a tough nut to crack for most teams in the Championship.Inverness CTCaley Thistle were expected to be Dundee United’s main challengers last season but got off to an awful start.Boss John Robertson turned things around and a late surge almost saw them into the play-offs.Expect that good form to continue in the new campaign.DunfermlineAllan Johnston’s 2017/18 team has been ripped apart with players leaving left, right and centre.With a lot of work to be done in the transfer market at the moment, another finish in the play-offs looks unlikely but Johnston has a history of getting his sides into the top four.FalkirkFormer Dundee manager Paul Hartley is slowly making the Bairns side his own after big changes in the winter and more to come this summer.Way off the pace last season, another mediocre campaign won’t be acceptable for the Falkirk faithful.MortonFormer United boss Ray McKinnon is just in the door at Cappielow and is busy bringing in players.His aim is the play-offs – Jim Duffy was sacked for not making them – so pressure is on.Queen of the SouthThe Doonhamers haven’t done much business this summer, the arrival of Gary Harkins apart, and will have to tighten up their defence if they are to cause any trouble at the top end of the division in the new campaign.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2017/08/599ec5e750c39-561x564.jpg ","title":"the tele guide to the world cup group cs local

yet to take place ahead of any big decisions.Highland Council\u0027 announcement\u0026nbsplast week that it is to buy the notorious 1960s Upper Bridge Street buildings as part of a bigger redevelopment of Inverness Castle has been broadly welcomed.Already there have been suggestions for the site ranging from demolishing the entire block to creating a green space.But any action to redevelop the concrete carbuncles will not happen immediately as possible options have yet to be drawn up ahead of a public consultation, while tenants in some units still have several years left on the leases.They include the Scottish Children\u0027 Reporter Admin-istration (SCRA) which has stated its intentions to remain in its unit until the end of the lease in October 2025 while the Shapla Indian Restaurant is among the businesses yet to be contacted by the council on how the takeover and potential plans might impact on its future.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspRestaurant owner Shabaro Ali said this week\u0027 announcement had come as a surprise, although he welcomed the news.\"Obviously, if Highland Council is going to redevelop the site, it is good for the city, it is good for us, it is good for everyone,\" he said.With about another 10 years remaining on the lease, Mr Ali wants the restaurant to remain in its prime riverside location where it has been for the last 22 years.\"I am sure Highland Council will try to keep everyone happy,\" he said.Orkney businesswoman Judith Glue opened her shop in Bridge Street 10 years ago and although she has yet to be directly approached by her new landlord, she was not unduly worried about the change in ownership,\"I hope it will be positive for businesses to be a part of a brand new project which would be good for Inverness,\" she said. \"Until they get in touch and tell us about the plans, there is not a lot I can say.\"The SCRA, meanwhile, occupies the main concrete block nearest the river which many would like to see removed.When contacted by the Inverness Courier last week ahead of the official announcement, a spokeswoman said there were no plans to move out.\"This is where our staff are based and where we hold children\u0027 hearings,\" she said.Following discussions with the council, that position remained unchanged this week.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspScotland\u0027 rural economy secretary Fergus Ewing \u0026ndash also the Inverness and Nairn MSP and co-chairman of the steering group overseeing the castle redevelopment \u0026ndash warned the project would take time.\"I don\u0026rsquot wish expectations to be raised in that things will happen in the next year or so,\" he said. \"I think that most things worth achieving in life do take several years. That will be the case here and it\u0027 important that there\u0027 a sense of ownership of citizens in the city.\"He said the aim of the group, which had met 14 times over the last three-and-a-half years, was to create an international-class attraction which drew people to Inverness rather than being something people simply saw when in the Highland capital.LDN Architects will look at the Bridge Street site to help create a masterplan by autumn prior to public consultation. A Highland Council spokeswoman said the local authority would become the landlord of any occupants or tenants.\"There will be no changes to the buildings until consultation has taken place, apart from any minor repairs which a landlord would be responsible for,\" she said.Sunday 17 Jun 2018 8:37 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04111000/04111979.jpg","title":"Flying the flag for equality for women","story":"\u0026nbspAN eye-catching banner made by a group of women in Inverness will take centre stage in a mass procession this weekend to celebrate the centenary of British women being given the right to vote.Members of Highland Multicultural Friends joined forces with a Merkinch craft group to create the artwork which will be carried through the streets of Edinburgh.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe parade, which takes place on Sunday, coincides with others in London, Cardiff and Belfast involving tens of thousands of women.\u0026nbspThe Inverness banner is one of just 100 which have been specially commissioned by 14-18 Now, the UK\u0027 arts programme for the World War I centenary, in conjunction with public art producer, Artichoke.It is intended to echo the suffrage movement, voicing women\u0027 contemporary hopes and concerns.The two groups involved in its creation were Common Threads \u0026ndash part of Highland Multicultural Friends \u0026ndash and Blazing Needles of Merkinch.Common Threads\u0026nbspis an informal friendship and support group for women from different cultural backgrounds who share a common interest in handiwork ranging from embroidery and patchwork to knitting and crochet.It meets weekly at the Cameron Youth Centre in Planefield Road.Blazing Needles, formed under the now defunct\u0026nbsp Arts in Merkinch organisation, meets weekly at the Bike Shed in Grant Street.Project co-ordinator Catherine MacNeil said the women were delighted with the completed artwork which was created with the help of a professional artist.\"They wanted to make it clear that they were women from the Highlands,\" she said.\"They also wanted it to show that while this is a celebration of women getting the vote there is still a long way to go.\"Words such as equality, diversity and compassion feature on the banner.\"These are things which they feel we are still working towards \u0026ndash and not just for women,\" she said.The project brought together a broad range of women,\u0026nbsp some of whom came to the Highlands from countries where equality is still a dream rather than a reality.\"Every woman is different,\" Ms MacNeil said.\"They all brought something different to the project.\"They all had their own perspective which added to the dialogue because of their own life experiences.\"She also felt it had enabled new links and friendships to be formed.\"I think the main thing they enjoyed was that it was a collaboration,\" she said.\"It was not just one group which meets regularly \u0026ndash it was two groups coming together.\"They enjoyed meeting new people from the other group.\"They also enjoyed the opportunity to work with a professional artist who helped them to develop new ideas.

GREATER sense of empowerment for residents of one of the Highlands\u0026rsquo most deprived communities is being promised as part of a new plan for the area.The South Kessock and Merkinch locality plan, launched this week, details measures to boost quality of life there.Drawn up by the Inverness Community Partnership (ICP) \u0026ndash a body bringing together representatives of a range of bodies including Highland Council, police and NHS Highland \u0026ndash it includes proposals to improve support for school leavers and provision for unemployed people looking to move into work, as well as plans for a new family science event and a community clean-up.As part of moves to develop \"stronger connections for local voices\", as well as improving participation by young people and schools in community planning, there are also proposals for a new focus group drawn from local residents to support the ICP\u0027 work.This is off the back of evidence that residents have \"little confidence that their voices are heard\".Marked by lower than average incomes and a lack of qualifications in young people leaving school, in 2016 the average life expectancy in Merkinch was just 66 years \u0026ndash compared to 82 in the affluent Crown area, barely a mile away.The report stated: \"Community partners recognise that, in order for health and wellbeing interventions to be effective, they need to be delivered in the local community in partnership with existing community projects and activities.\"We recognise that our best chance of achieving success is to put people and communities at the centre of our planning and delivery processes.\"We will work with the people to tackle what matters most to them and will make a positive difference to their lives and to the community.\"Notwithstanding this, it also means that we recognise that communities can and do achieve great things for themselves.\"We need to harness such achievements and increase the level of influence and sense of control that people have over decisions and services across the locality.\"The plan also raises the possibility of support for residents to take direct control of a range of

It just shows the fine margins in football.“Switzerland are a very good side but over in Basel in the second leg (0-0) I thought we were far better.“We created the better chances and on another time it could have been our night.“Looking back we probably shot ourselves in the foot as we were maybe a bit more cautious at home than we usually are.”With no World Cup action McGinn has opted to return to Pittodrie a week earlier than the rest of the squad to ensure he can make an immediate impact in the new campaign.Aberdeen enter the Europa League at the second qualifying round on July 26 and discover their opponents in Wednesday’s draw.McGinn said: “I had a frustrating end to the last campaign picking up a few niggly injuries but I’ve had a good break now which has been really beneficial.“We come back near the end of June but I’m going in around a week prior to that to give myself time with the physios before I go back into full training.“I want to get myself ready to go and am determined to do well for the team.“I’m really excited about the season as we have European football and I really look forward to those games at the start of the campaign.“Hopefully we can do well in the Europa League then make a strong start domestically, which can build belief we can have another good season.”This summer though McGinn and his Northern Ireland team-mates will be left considering what could have been after the disappointment of the play-off loss to the Swiss.In the first leg at Windsor Park last November Ricardo Rodriguez scored the only goal of the play-off from the spot after Corry Evans was adjudged to have handled.The ball clearly struck the defender’s shoulder.It prevented Northern Ireland a second straight finals appearance having advanced to the Euro 2016 knock-out phase in the nation’s first appearance at a major finals since World Cup 1986.“Having experienced the Euros and all that followed from that tournament it is very frustrating not to be at the World Cup,” said McGinn.“It was an unbelievable experience and I saw just how much it meant to the people of Northern Ireland and that group of players.“To go to another tournament would have been incredible, especially the World Cup.”Following the World Cup play-offs the SFA made a botched attempt to secure Northern Ireland boss O’Neill as replacement for Gordon Strachan whose contract was not renewed.O’Neill rejected the SFA’s advances and opted to sign a new contract until 2024.“It is one of those ones where we didn’t qualify so we just have to keep moving forward,” said McGinn.“We are happy the manager has stayed and things are very positive in Northern Ireland at the moment.”The play-off disappointment had added poignancy for McGinn as he watched it from the other side of the world in South Korea having moved to Gwangju after rejecting a new deal at Pittodrie at the end of the 2016-17 season.The switch to the K League did not work out as he dropped out of the international reckoning and struggled to get regular game time at Gwangju.He said: “I was left out of the squad for the play-offs which was disappointing as I am an experienced player.“I wasn’t playing much club football at the time so I couldn’t really have an answer to that.“However, I have shown in the past that even when I have been on the bench and called upon I have always done a good job.“I came on and scored in the Euros and played my part in that campaign as well.“Being an experienced player it was disappointing I wasn’t involved.”Following Gwangju’s relegation and change of manager McGinn’s contract was terminated by mutual consent, opening the way to a Pittodrie return where he penned a three-and-a-half year deal in January.It propelled McGinn back into the international reckoning as he was selected for the squad to face South Korea in March but had to pull out through injury.He also missed out on the end-of-season friendlies away to Panama (0-0) and Costa Rica (3-0 loss) with a groin injury that ruled him out of the final games of the domestic season.He sat out the 1-0 win against Celtic at Parkhead.McGinn said: “The lads went into that game knowing if Rangers won at Hibs and we lost, Rangers would finish second – so to achieve what we did was fantastic.“To finish above Rangers was huge considering the financial side of things and the difference in that aspect between the two clubs.“I’m not sure we were recognised as much as we should have been for that.“It was probably our best achievement in the league under Derek McInnes.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/06/5b26423574d7b-459x564.jpg ","title":"could you help rehome any of these beautiful kittens","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAre you looking to get a new pet?

Therefore, we support separating pedestrians, cyclists and motorists through an expansion of the network of walking and cycling paths across Scotland.We would like to stress, however, that measures like these will not single-handedly lead to safer roads. The road mentality in Scotland still favours the motorist over more vulnerable road users, which presents a huge barrier to more people taking up active lifestyles.More needs to be done to change our road culture for people in Scotland to feel safer regardless of their means of transportation, ultimately empowering them to lead healthier and more active lifestyles.Perhaps it is time we started to beat the ‘presumed liability’ drum once again?Brenda Mitchell, Road Traffic Accident Law (Scotland) LLP, Edinburgh.Sir,Some people have difficulty getting up and down the steps on the Glasgow bus. We asked West Coast Motors about this and they gave us the answer we wanted.All Citylink buses are fitted with an access ramp, worked by the driver. A platform comes out on to the pavement, with a holding bar, and is then raised up to floor level. This is designed as a wheelchair lift, where two seats at the front have to be arranged to be taken out, to give plenty of room.It was agreed, however, that if someone felt nervous about climbing up or down the stairs, they could also use the access platform. Once they have paid their ticket, they can walk to a seat.West Coast Motors asks anyone wanting this service to please remember two things.Firstly, book your single or return tickets by phone or on the Citylink website.Then, 48 hours before your journey, phone Citylink and tell them the times and details of the booking you have made and let them know you will be using the access ramp. The telephone number is 08712 663333.Kirsty McCuaig and Patricia Crawford, Mid Argyll Buddies.Sir,The ongoing effects of weather, bureaucracy and concern for the future continue to put our countryside under pressure, with few avenues to turn to for support.This can have dramatic consequences for the rural economy and the people who live and work there.The Prince’s Countryside Fund is committed to supporting community-led projects that will re-invigorate and sustain farming networks and the countryside by providing services and amenities through its grant programme.Open for applications until June 14, grants are available for up to £50,000. If you are involved in a community-run or farming support project and think your organisation may benefit – or if you know someone who might –  visit  www.princescountrysidefund. org.uk/grants.The fund has supported a diverse range of projects, including a community transport app in Argyll and projects on Barra, Orkney and Shetland. We are proud to have distributed more than £9 million since 2010 to more than 250 projects led by these grassroots organisations.It is crucial we help rural areas during these times of change to retain a thriving countryside and encourage a sustainable farming sector in the UK and would encourage people to apply for our funding.Claire Saunders, director, The Prince’s Countryside Fund.Sir,At first sight, it seems odd that the controversy over the reported disturbance to common gulls, oystercatchers and black guillemots at the old oil depot in Ardrishaig is focused on a breeding colony of common gulls.I’m no bird expert and hadn’t realised common gulls are less common than the bigger varieties or that they’re a declining species.But among the reasons given for this are predation by mink and the loss of open rubbish dumps and both might be contributing factors in Mid Argyll.It’s surely hardly surprising that the only breeding colony along the canal is at the Ardrishaig end, where the urbanisation around the tidal flats of Loch Gilp and the Lingerton dump offer prime scavenging opportunities.I don’t know whether they lose out to the bigger gull species when it comes to local island nesting sites, or whether the old Gleaner site might offer other advantages, for example, maybe less vulnerable to mink predation – but could it be the gulls are there primarily because of man-made feeding opportunities and that they’ll find an alternative site that’s similarly convenient?Likewise, the smaller populations of oystercatchers and black guillemots, however, although they’re also both amber listed they don’t scavenge and seem to be more dependent on the sea and shore for their livelihoods.Their decline might be of more concern but they’re hopefully less swayed towards easy pickings around Loch Gilp and more evenly distributed to Loch Crinan.Perhaps Jim Dickson and Andrew Tongue can enlighten us further on just how endangered the populations of these three species are in Mid Argyll.Robert Wakeham, Lochgilphead.Sir,Please would the parents of the young girl who may have witnessed a recent incident with a man and dog in Inveraray Main Street contact my husband and I through this newspaper?We saw a man who, we believe, mistreated a dog in the street at 8.30pm on Sunday April 29.We are both keen to know this young person is alright as she appeared to be frightened, running off at speed with her two dogs.Knowing she was fine would put our minds at rest. We can still see her face full of horror and hear her cry.Otherwise we had a lovely holiday. You have a most beautiful part of the country to live in.Name and address supplied.Sir,It has been announced recently a Scottish Conservative government would invest £100 million into fixing potholes over the course of the next parliament.We all rely on our roads but they are now plagued with potholes which are damaging cars. Beyond our concerns for public safety, this systematic under-investment is slowing our economy and costing local councils a fortune in compensation for car owners.We recognise the importance of well-maintained roads and we are willing to invest in it.The SNP has consistently neglected Scotland’s roads and the results are obvious for everyone to see.Councillor Alastair Redman, Islay.On Monday May 14, I spotted six swallows over the rear of Meadows Place, hopefully heralding a decent summer.First seen this year.Mike Power, Lochgilphead.Sir,During this week\u0026#8217s Holyrood vote on the UK Government’s Withdrawal Bill, Labour, the Greens and LibDems joined the SNP in an overwhelming rejection of the UK Government’s currently-drafted Brexit plans, voting 93 to 30 against the bill.While the Scottish Government agrees in the need for UK-wide frameworks, it has described the retention of the overall control of agriculture, fisheries, food labelling and public procurement as a power grab.The Scottish Parliament has spoken loudly and clearly, and if the UK Government wants us to believe they value Scotland and devolution, they must respect the vote and remove the proposed power grab.Any constraints placed on the existing powers of the Scottish Parliament without consent would be a democratic outrage.During Prime Minister\u0026#8217s Questions, Theresa May failed to reassure us she will respect the decision of the Scottish Parliament. If she does choose to ignore the vote and force through this legislation, she will be breaking the conventions of the 20-year-old devolution settlement and imposing a power grab upon Scotland against our will.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 21/05/18, 3:33 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Some would argue it has been an eyesore that should have been knocked down long before now and replaced with a more modern building.But it\u0026#8217s sad to see the old Inveraray Community Hall crumble and rot with neglect.What makes the building\u0026#8217s current predicament all the more galling is that there was the chance, according to Inspire Inveraray, to make the building safe six years ago.

As with other gull species which are opportunist in diet, junk food and bits of plastic provided by us humans can be inadvertently consumed.Over many years the Gleaner oil depot, which has a concrete bund in case of oil spillage, has provided a safe nesting site for around 20 pairs. The suggestion that this colony could easily find an alternative site is perhaps wishful thinking as suitable sites nearby in Mid Argyll are already occupied by other gull species or don’t have the required habitat features.Thankfully, however, this should not prove necessary. Following a productive on-site meeting last week with the Scottish Canals\u0026#8217 environmental scientist, the project architect and TSL contractors we noted 10-15 birds sitting on eggs and unaffected by the work going on around them.Planned works over the coming weeks should not affect these gulls, Oystercatchers or Black Guillemots from nesting and will also not impede the building work which is scheduled to be completed by next spring.The Mid Argyll hub project and new canal museum will largely reflect the social and cultural heritage of the Crinan Canal, but should also encompass the important and often decreasing natural history of the Crinan Canal corridor. These breeding birds are also a part of this and should not just be something to ‘chase off’ to somewhere else.Excellent viewing and educational opportunities from the new build will be possible to watch this colony raise their chicks as well as providing a point to lookout for other wildlife on the loch.Nearby, the tidal estuary of Loch Gilp provides us with an often highly under-valued unofficial nature reserve that links Ardrishaig with Lochgilphead, which in winter hosts important numbers of duck and waders, in summer includes breeding Eider ducks and Common Terns and during migration is a vital stopping off point during adverse weather for passage Whooper swans, Brent geese and Black-tailed Godwits to name a few.Increasingly good work is being undertaken by locals and the Phoenix Trust to help clear up some of the increasing amounts of shoreline rubbish.Keep up the good work!Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,I have been out and about Islay the past week speaking to my constituents, visiting local businesses and monitoring the roads department\u0026#8217s progress with road repairs.Unfortunately CalMac management\u0026#8217s shocking handling of our local ferry service is really taking it\u0026#8217s toll on many local businesses that depend heavily of Islay\u0026#8217s growing tourist trade. We simply cannot allow CalMac to continue to make the same errors every year without consequences.On another subject, I have been unimpressed with our local roads department management\u0026#8217s sluggish response to a large number of complaints from local residents and myself about the plague of potholes scattered across Islay.There are many roads across Islay that have some potholes marked to be filled while others remain unmarked despite them in many cases being side by side. This scattershot approach to pothole repairs is as random as it is ineffective.In the future we will need to see a more long term resurfacing solution to our local roads with less short term, random and piecemeal patchwork.Cllr Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,In the run up to National Volunteering Week (June 1- 7), Cats Protection would like to extend our thanks to the many thousands of volunteers throughout the country who offer their time and expertise to help cats and kittens across the UK.In 2017, our 10,200-strong volunteer network contributed an incredible 5.5 million hours, each volunteer gifting a wealth of expertise and immeasurable passion to the charity.

In fact many of the passing ferry passengers stopped to watch from the road.The new timing equipment, purchased with aid of a grant from Tarbert and Skipness Community Trust, was in full use by judge Mairi Henderson and made for more professional accuracy in timing aspects.The final Grand Prix had only two competitors but it was a masterclass of style and competence from Jojo and Katie which made it a joy to watch.As usual the event ended with some fast and exciting games and after the field was cleared there was the prizegiving in the Pony Club’s brand new blue tent.The Junior Trophy for the day was won by Louise Ralston from Campbeltown and Iris McMillan from Tayvallich took the Senior Trophy for a second year while the non-members trophy was won by Andrea McShannon.Pony Club PonyClass 11 Frazer Prentice, Firefly2 Louise Ralston, Nero3 Rory Shaw, Libby4 Jake Rowan, AliceClass 21 Willow Ryan, Ryan2 Zoe Prentice, Cowal3 Isla McShannon, ColeyClass 31 Iris McMillan, Conker2 Katie MacKay, Eva3 Josephine Boase, ValerieClass 41 Andrea McShannon, Nicole2 Julie McLeish, Eclipse3 Shelagh Oakes, Pery4 Catriona Ryan, DoneyShow JumpingStars of the Future \u0026#8211 Lead Rein1 Louise Ralston, Nero2 Frazer Prentice, Firefly3 Rory Shaw, Libby4 Jake Rowan, AliceStars of the Future1 Iris McMillan, Conker2 Zoe Prentice, Cowal3 Isla McShannon, Coley4 Willow Ryan, RyanNewcomers1 Iris McMillan, Conker2 Andrea McShannon, Nicole3 Michelle McAloon, Eclipse4 Catriona Ryan, DoneyDiscovery1 Josephine Boase, Valerie2 Andrea McShannon, Nicole3 Katie MacKay, Eva4 Michelle McAloon, EclipseGrand Prix1 Josephine Boase, Valerie2 Katie MacKay, Eva\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 07/06/18, 4:46 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.This week\u0026#8217s photograph comes from Jacqui Barker of Tarbert.

After a pit stop in the Royal Burgh it was on to Fort William, then Inverness and back home again- all to raise money for Cancer Research UK and Target Ovarian Cancer.Spokesperson for Breast Way Round, Laura White, said: ‘This year was full of fun, laughter, meeting new family members and although the daily miles are hard going, the weather and the beauty of the Scottish scenery made it that little bit easier.’As well as the sponsored trek, the bikers raised money in more traditional ways, such as bucket shaking (the men wearing bras) and hosting a raffle and auction in Caol Community Centre. The most coveted item, a patchwork quilt made by rider Cathy Anderson, went for a whopping £700.The annual trip was started in 2008 by Shirley-Ann McKnight as a last tour of Scotland for fellow biker and close friend, Alyson Porter, who was suffering from cancer. Sadly, Alyson never made it to her trip and now each year the journey is retraced in celebration of her life and all those affected by cancer.Since 2008, more than 600 riders have participated, each clad with a pink mohawk courtesy of Hairy-RS, and the team has raised £347,000 for Macmillan Cancer Support.

They won a throw-in deep in the Glasgow Red Star half, taken by Craig Aitken. After playing a neat one-two with Woody Hoad, Craig sent in a teasing cross for Keiran Caskie to glance past the Glasgow Red Star keeper.Lochgilphead introduced Jamie Stewart and Ciaran Gibson who helped freshen things up and work hard to close the game out.Special mention to subs Lee Harris, just returning from injury, and the ever reliable Calum Paterson.At the end of the game the Lochgilphead boys were presented with the League Cup and also the League Championship for 2004 age group teams to make it a double celebration.With three games still left to play the boys are looking to make it through the season with only one league defeat.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column 27","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 10/06/18, 3:50 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.The last thing David MacInnes sees himself as is a hero.Be we believe differently.

The pair were seeded car 30 in the two wheel drive section, run first on the day in a new schedule being piloted by the rally, the two wheel drive cars covering the stages before the four wheel drive cars followed in the afternoon.With the dry conditions in the weeks running up to the event dust would be the main problem for those running further down the field. Douglas attacked the first stage, Twiglees, and was catching the car in front when, unfortunately due to the dust being created by that car, came out of a 90 degree corner with zero visibility and connected heavily with a rock, damaging the suspension and forcing his early retirement.The car, and the driver, are noticeably quicker  each event they compete in and it\u0026#8217s only a matter of time before the results are there.The other Argyll car out on the stages was Ally Currie from Mull and Grant McNiven in the Ford Fiesta ST picking up 9th overall and 1st in Class 6.The next round of the Scottish Championship is Argyll Rally, based in Dunoon on June 23 \u0026#8211 the closest round for most Argyll rally enthusiasts and one not to be missed. The stages look absolutely breathtaking this year and well worth a watch.The Scottish Tarmac Rally Championship continues as well with round three being the Granite at Leuchars Stages hosted by Aberdeen and District Motor Club at the MOD base in Leuchars, Fife.Argyll was well represented both in the drivers seat and the co-drivers. All Argyll crew Willie and Steven Beattie were out in the newly finished and beautifully finished Escort MkII. They were absolutely flying and really getting to grips with the car when a sixth gear lock-up threw them into a spin and off the stage, clouting a fairly substantial fence post in the process.The navigators side now looks decidedly second hand, but nothing a few hours in the workshop won\u0026#8217t sort. A bent bottom suspension arm put paid to them re-joining but they will take the positives and the blistering pace into the next round for sure.Willie Beattie Snr in his equally exquisite Escort was also beginning to get the hang of the car, with some more seat time this year, not to mention experienced co-driver, Phil Sandham, pushing him on. He, after making sure his boys were okay when they didn\u0026#8217t show up at service after their spin, continued on to secure 12th overall and second in class: his first honours since building the car.The next round may see some family ties severely stretched, at least until the final results are announced.Ian Parker was also out in familiar machinery, co-driving for Fraser Smith in his Canal Garage-prepared Honda Civic. The pair were also making good progress up the class rankings until the diff decided to implode and finished their rally on Stage six.The drive of the day was not in question. Alan Kirkaldy led from start to finish despite some interesting issues in the first test. His door came loose after about a third of stage and he continued, holding the door shut by the open window whilst steering, changing gear and waving with the other.Astonishingly he still managed quickest stage time by five seconds. His co-driver for the day could forgive himself for being a little green about the gills after that.Eoghan Anderson from Cairnbaan was lucky enough to win the seat in a charity auction at the Annual STRC Dinner earlier in the year. An experience he is unlikely to forget in a hurry, although some of the memories may be a little bit blurry and perhaps just a little sideways. The top three were rounded out by Ian Forgan, ably guided round in his Subaru by his daughter in her first rally and the final position on the podium went to Ian and Allan Paterson, also in a Subaru.The next round is this weekend at Crail where the Beattie boys will be back out, Ian Parker swaps a Civic for an Escort MKII and Donald Bowness is set to get back out in the Nova.PICS:Photos: Gavin Brown, West Coast PhotosRed Escort (Car 1) Alan Kirkaldy/Eoghan Anderson (first overall) no_a24rally01\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"high tech preparation for mid argyll art show","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 14/06/18, 7:45 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThis year has seen a lot of preparatory work ahead of the 2018 Mid Argyll Art Society exhibition in August.The popular show will again be held in the Drill Hall, Lochgilphead and will run from August 6-11.As in the last few years, the Mid Argyll Camera Club will have photos on display.The society is harnessing modern technology in a campaign to raise the profile of this year\u0026#8217s event.There is now a Mid Argyll Art Society Facebook page that can be used to get updates on what is happening.There will shortly be a website giving details about the art society, its history, information on the exhibition and how to participate, and photos of past exhibits to give a flavour of what the event is like.A lot of work has been done on modernising the entry process.

Now scientists from the University of Aberdeen have added a third species to the mix \u0026#8211 the European pine marten. These native squirrel predators are recolonising Britain after years of persecution, and so the scientists set out to uncover the impact of this on red and grey squirrel populations.Three study sites in Scotland were in the Highlands (marten recolonisation for over 45 years, no grey squirrels), Central Scotland (marten recolonisation for 8-14 years, grey squirrels since 1945) and the Borders (early stages of marten recolonization, grey squirrels since 1980).Populations were monitored for five months using cameras and multi-species feeders \u0026#8211 the latter with glue strips on the underside of the lid to obtain visitor hair samples. This material provided DNA to determine visitor species and identify individual martens.The results showed that while red squirrels avoided feeders used by martens, greys were equally likely to use feeders whether frequented by martens or not. So grey squirrel numbers were reduced where exposure to pine martens was high, whereas numbers of red squirrels increased – unequivocal evidence that recovering marten numbers affect competition between red and grey squirrels.This finding is likely explained by the fact that reds, having co-evolved with martens, instinctively avoid areas used by martens but invasive greys, having no such instincts, showed no avoidance behaviour at all.Since pine martens’ range is increasing and extending southwards, scientists are optimistic that this will control the invasive grey squirrel species.As they say in the title to their report, in this case ‘the enemy of my enemy is my friend’.PIC:The native grey squirrel may have an unlikely ally.

We simply don\u0026#8217t have enough children playing shinty in each school to make up separate clubs.Surely, in 2018, this shouldn\u0026#8217t be allowed to happen?It is only three clubs that are being affected by this, and they\u0026#8217re all in the south of Scotland,  half way through a season, leaving all our kids devastated at the though of losing their chosen sport.My son has been playing shinty since Primary One. He is now heading into Primary Four and is even more passionate about the sport. He enjoys quality team time, striving to be the best he can and just loving playing the game.It\u0026#8217s very difficult to explain something like this to an eight-year-old child, never mind the Primary One children we have in our club.One quote from a child was: \u0026#8216Everyone is going to be so sad if we don\u0026#8217t have shinty. Why would shinty people do this to us?\u0026#8217It\u0026#8217s a very sad day indeed for the children of Argyll and Bute who are simply being punished for what school they go to and where they live. We have to stand together and fight for our club and our children.The Camanachd Association needs to step up and find a solution to allow all children to compete nationally and stand as one united shinty community.Ailsa and Alastair Crawford, LochgilpheadSir,The Camanachd Association has put politics before the needs of the children and the development of the sport in Argyll.The kids are disappointed and the coaches who have worked tirelessly to set the club up are deflated. Surely the association knows this is a mistake that needs rectified immediately.Personally, Kilmory and Dunadd children\u0026#8217s club has inspired our son and daughter to get involved with the sport and to grow in confidence amongst other like-minded children.Stuart and Simone Charnock, LochgilpheadSir,My son has trained with Kilmory/Dunadd shinty club since he was in Primary One. The club has always treated the kids equally and welcomed all kids to participate.After years of hard work, the team was progressing well and was worthy of competing at national level.In his last year before high school, to be told he is no longer allowed to play is not only devastating to my son but greatly confusing and he is left wondering what he has done wrong.I fail to see how this can be classed as progress by the Camanachd Association. This needs to be readdressed to allow kids to compete in the game they love.Susan Jackson, LochgilpheadI was very angry to hear from local residents in Portnahaven that their recycling bins have been used by numerous motorhomes for disposing of general waste, including food waste.I have visited the recycling bins site in Portnahaven and spoken to my constituents in person about this and I can confirm that unfortunately Portnahaven\u0026#8217s recycling bins are full of general waste.This is as unacceptable as it is disrespectful. I have contacted the appropriate department with the council and asked for an investigation to be done. I also asked for some addition signage for the bins area.I made it very clear that my constituents should not lose their recycling facilities as a result of their bins being misused by someone else.I will continue to monitor this situation and provide an update as soon as I have more information.Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,It is fitting to mark this Diabetes Week (June 11-17) for Scotland’s 30,000 adults and children living with type one diabetes by noting that life-changing monitors are now available on the NHS.A child diagnosed with type one diabetes at five faces 50,000 finger prick blood glucose tests by the time they are 18.Each painful finger prick is part of a daily routine which also includes calculating carbohydrate intake and frequent insulin injections, all to prevent life-threatening hypoglycaemia and long term complications.But since November last year, a \u0026#8216flash glucose monitoring\u0026#8217 system called the Freestyle Libre can be prescribed by local GPs, offering an alternative to such intensive finger-pricking.The roll out of flash glucose monitoring, which gives a reading via a simple sensor, however, is not consistent across all local health boards. So, our message for Diabetes Week is to call for health boards in Scotland to speed up prescription policies and step up much needed prescriptions.As someone who has lived with type one diabetes for 21 years, new technology, such as the FreeStyle Libre, makes a world of difference.Type one diabetes cannot be prevented and until we find the cure for it, research and technology are vital.Holly Davies, development manager, Aberdeen\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"brave mum set skydive charity","story":"NewsBrave mum set to skydive for charity for inspirational nephewJoanne Dunlop, of Ayr, will jump from a hair-raising 10,000ft at Skydive St Andrews.\u0026nbspShareByLochlin Highet10:32, 15 JUN 2018NewsMegan Mcphearson and Joanne Dunlop\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA brave mum is set to take to the skies for her inspirational nephew.

Villagers - and residents across the greenbelt in Muirhead - mounted a stiff rearguard action after a bid to get it zoned for housing. For the first time it emerged a developer WAS behind the plan, rather than, as was insisted, South Ayrshire Council officers just selected it as a prospect. Senior SNP councillor Craig Mackay said on Tuesday it was now “highly unlikely” it would make the next stage. And he told Troon Community Council : “No decisions have been made and we are not out of the woods yet with the Muirhead-Loans site yet. “But on the basis the available land pretty much matches what we need for new housing over the next five years, there should be no need for any release of greenbelt sites. “It is highly unlikely it will be built on.” We revealed the secret plan for the soggy 30 acre field in October, which would link the medieval clachan to the town of Troon. It sparked an emergency meeting of Loans Community Council and the public packed out Troon Community Council meetings.  And at the time town councillor Peter Convery said: “That ground is sacrosanct and it should never have been suggested for the local plan.” Planners were promoting the sight, saying the “layouts of both settlements turn their backs twoards each other at the moment and this doesnt create an attractive approach to either of them.” Councillor Mackay said the house sites currently available “pretty much” matched the demand. And he revealed South Ayrshire Council has now taking a slightly different approach from the developer-led schemes. He added: “Brownfield land will be prioritised even though that is not as lucrative for developers.” Councillor Mackay also revealed a developer had been circling on the Loans site - despite insistence from council officers there was no developer. He said:”Planning officers gave assurances there was no developer.. but there was.”  The breakthrough has been hailed by David Chalmers, chairman of Loans Community Council. He said: “It is obviously encouraging hearing Councillor McKay’s statement that development be allowed on the greenbelt between Loans and Muirhead is unlikely to be adopted in LDP2. “We will, of course, anxiously await SAC’s verification of this which we understand will not be until nearer the end of this year. “Every praise should be given to the overwhelming response given by the residents of Loans and Muirhead - a 367 signature petition and 246 letters - which clearly demonstrated the level of feeling against.” South Ayrshire Council said the process to publish the new Development Plan was still active. A spokesman said: “There are a range of issues that are suggested, discussed and determined. This is a very thorough process to ensure that all stakeholders are given due consideration. As a result, we’ll only be able to give assurance of what is included in, or excluded from the proposed plan when a report is considered by the Council later this year.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnScottish National PartySouth Ayrshire CouncilTroonAyrAyr News"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"council perform u turn over","story":"NewsCouncil perform U-turn over car park feesThe astonishing cave-in by wobbling South Ayrshire Council came amidst a 1700-name petition signed by furious residents and businesses.\u0026nbspShareByStephen Houston15:41, 13 JUN 2018NewsSouth Beach car park (Image: Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailParking charges WON’T be introduced at two Troon car parks, we can reveal. The astonishing cave-in by wobbling South Ayrshire Council came amidst a 1700-name petition signed by furious residents and businesses. The council ARE pressing ahead with fees at a third Troon car park, at Bellevue in Prestwick and Ayr Blackburn. They argued the \u0026pound2 charge would destroy much-needed trade and lead to chaos in surrounding streets in Troon The U-turn was revealed by Councillor Craig Mackay at Troon Community Council last Tuesday. He managed to finally nail down an answer from his officials, admitting: “This issue has caused confusion within the council.” There will be no charges at the car park at the Walker Hall or the Italian Gardens.  But council officers are pressing ahead with a \u0026pound2 fee at the South Beach car park next to Royal Troon. This lead to anger from Community Councillor Robert Milligan, who said: “I suggest if you are going to charge for South Beach you actually need to provide loos, even temporary between May and September, to meet demand. If people are paying for parking the least we can do is to have toilet facilities without peeing in the dunes. “People are urinating in the sand dunes and residents can see it from their houses.” At the community council police revealed Troon only gets a traffic warden once every 2.8 days. And townspeople feared cars would be abandoned on the streets rather than pay for parking. The Ayrshire Post has led the way on the issue, revealing Troon has NEVER had to pay parking fees. Councillor Mackay said: “ We were working on the basis of parking charges being introduced to three car parks in Troon.  “I had a meeting with senior officers to discuss concerns of residents and businesses, in particular at the Walker Hall. “The knock-on conserquences are complex, particularly with displacement into residential streets.” He finally got an admission the council were axing the charges in a statement from SNP party colleague Ian Cochrane. Councillor Mackay added: “I was still struggling to get full clarity. “Traffic Orders are being progressed at Royal Troon, Belevue Road in Prestwick and Blackburn Road in Ayr. “It came as a surprise to me as the statement said no other parking charges are proposed at this time and that is quite a changes from what we were looking at.” Troon council vice-chairman Dougie Graham added: “We will wait to see what happens.” Five days after being asked for a comment on the U-turn, South Ayrshire Council would only say: “We’re currently finalising plans for the introduction of charges at Blackburn Road, Bellevue Road and Troon seafront car parks – all of which will require a new Traffic Regulation Order (TRO). We’ll soon be getting the TRO process underway, which will include a period of public consultation, and further details on this will be shared in due course.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12539593.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/14478946.jpg","title":"lawrence shankland agrees new deal","story":"NewsLawrence Shankland agrees new deal to stay at Ayr United for Championship pushThe 29-goal striker has put pen to paper on a new deal at Somerset Park.\u0026nbspShareByStuart WilsonLochlin Highet13:14, 15 MAY 2018Updated13:18, 15 MAY 2018NewsShankland is staying on at Somerset (Image: Daily Record)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailLawrence Shankland insists money can’t buy happiness after he sensationally spurned a host of lucrative offers to pen a new deal at Ayr United. The prolific striker turned down Premiership riches and clubs in England to agree a one-year contract at Somerset Park on Tuesday. Shankland, 22, told the Ayrshire Post: “It’s a great club to be a part of. The main thing for this decision is that I am enjoying my football. The gaffer has been great with me and that’s why I came here. He gave me a chance to get back into football. I am happy and I don’t think there’s any amount of money that beats happiness.

Boss Ian McCall said: Lawrence could have doubled his money elsewhere and had offers from the Premiership up here and League One down in England. But the affection he has had from our supporters has played a huge part in his decision. It’s a huge piece of business for this club. Be in no doubt that Lawrence could easily have gone, but he has made a footballing decision.

Mhari said: “We had the perfect day with amazing weather and a beautiful sunset.  “All our closest friends and family joined us for a simple but loving ceremony carried out by Peter Clark of the Scottish Humanist Society.” The bride wore a Mori lee dress from Bijoux Bridal, Hamilton. Mhari’s veil held a special sentimental value to it. She said: “The veil is 25 years old which was worn by my aunt on her wedding day.” The groom and best men wore Grey Spirit kilts from Slaters, Ayr. The couple’s wedding party consisted of bridesmaids Sara Bryce (bride’s sister) and Lyndsey Bickerton and best men Grant Russell and Mark Rowe (groom’s brother). The newly married Mr and Mrs jetted off for a fortnight in the sun after the big day.  The couple said: “We flew to St Lucia for 2 weeks and stayed at The Royalton. “It was amazing - so relaxed, exactly what we needed after the wedding.” Adore Weddings captured the couple’s big day, with both photography and videography, leaving them with lovely memories to look back on. Mhari added: “Both Barrie and Jim were fantastic all day, with us and all the guests. “The pictures are just too hard to pick from.” Stems and Gems in Saltcoats created the bouquets, buttonholes and flowers for the centrepieces while the cake was made by a relative.

Stuart Laing gets a glittering OBE for nearly 50 years hard graft in the shiny world of jewellery. And Kirsty Letton is now an MBE after more than four decades of dedication to Scottish curling. That they live within 500 yards of each other in Troon is highly noteworthy in that NOBODY else who lives in mainland Ayrshire received anything this year. Stuart,68, has been honoured not just for running the family’s firm Laings, but his foundation of a UK consortium that allowed independents to flourish. He said: “I am thrilled and delighted to speak about it . . . this has been very difficult not to mention.  “I am proud and honoured, but also very humbled as well.” In 1970 he joined the family firm which was begun 130 years earlier. He expanded it to seven branches and started the Houlden (his mother’s maiden name) buying and professional services group for independent jewellers. Stuart remains active as executive chairman of Laings, though his son-in-law Joe Walsh is now chief executive. The father-of-three and now grandad-to-five has been such an influence in the jewellery market he’s regarded by the trade throughout the world. He said: “Strengthening and creating a strong, independent retail sector and giving the UK industry a global identity has been extremely rewarding.” “But this honour is for my entire family and colleagues as a lot of people have been with me on this journey.”  Stuart and his wife Lynda have three children - son Simon and daughters Susanna Laing, and Wendy Walsh. Stuart added: “I would like to pay tribute to my wife Lynda, she has been a wonderful support, a real rock. “We have travelled the globe together representing the UK trade.” He also created the ‘Jewellers of Excellence’ brand, which is a hallmark of trust within the industry. Stuart has been involved in all aspects of the industry and was the only UK Director of SIHH (Salon International de la Haute Horlogerie), a renowned association of the best jewellers in the world, in co-operation with high-end watch houses. Curling champion and coach Kirsty Letton reckons her MBE is an accolade for the entire sport. She says: “Of course I am thrilled and proud. It was a big surprise, I must admit.”  And so are the family - husband Jimmy and children Avril, who now lives in Ascot, and Keith who is in Grenada. Superfit Kirsty - now a 77-year-old grandmother of three - is still playing on the rink as well as coaching at Ayr and manages to find the time to grab an oar for some coastal rowing. Last year she picked up a Sportscotland lifetime volunteering award. And although moving to Ayrshire 21 years ago and joining the Troon Portland club the link with her orginal Glasgow four has never been broken. The highlight of Kirsty’s playing career was winning senior silver in the World Championships in Finland in 2008. She is particularly proud of motivating South Ayrshire primary pupils to have fun on the ice, with 269 youngsters participating in her taster sessions last season.  As well as inspiring the stars of tomorrow, Kirsty instigated the strongly contested World Senior Curling Championships in 2000.

The bill for absent workers comes on the back of 42,736 days lost during the last 12 months. Employees recorded an average of nine days on the sick during 2017/18. Psychological reasons (30 per cent) were cited as the leading cause for absence, followed by musculoskeletal (19 per cent) and hospitalisation (12 per cent). By far the biggest service to feel the strain was the Health and Social Care Partnership, where an average of 16 days per employee was lost. Teachers, who account for 23 per cent of the council’s workforce, were the best performing ‘directorate’ with a loss of just five days per worker.  All figures were recorded between April 1, 2017 and March 31, 2018. Council officials said trends were showing a “gradual and consistent improvement”. An average of 11.7 days were lost to absence by local government employees (all staff bar teachers) in 2010. The revised figure stands at 10.06 days for 2017/18. A council spokesman said they were “committed” to supporting staff and have a “number of policies and supports in place to maximise employee attendance”. They added: “In recent years, more robust monitoring and reporting arrangements have been introduced which have seen a steady improvement in this area, with our figures below the national average. “We continue to closely monitor employee attendance levels and take all appropriate steps to ensure appropriate standards.” "},{"url":null,"title":"Steam returns to the Borders Railway","story":"STEAM

Fund to help with the work.\nThe graveyard, which contains the remains of Stow\u0026rsquos Auld Kirk as well as memorials dating back to the 17th century, has been in need of repair for decades.\nStow and Fountainhall Community Council worked with Scottish Borders Council and Historic Environment Scotland to gain the required permissions as the Auld Kirk is a scheduled monument.\nThe Auld Kirk, which was consecrated in 1242, has previously been painstakingly restored by local resident Robin McMillan.\nAnd the restoration of the graveyard will complete his work to showcase part of the fascinating medieval history of Stow.\nAlistair Riddell of Stow and Fountainhall Community Council told the Border : \u0026ldquoThe repairs to the graveyard have long been a priority for the local community and it is great to finally get the first grant of money to allow these works to go ahead.\n\"There is a lot of specialist work to be undertaken and the repairs may take several years to complete.\n\"However, once finished the old graveyard will become a real focus for locals and visitors alike.\nStow\u0027s history includes a visit in 1142 by King David I, a visit in 1297 by William Wallace and a visit in 1513 by Queen Margaret Tudor, wife of James IV, prior to the battle of Flodden.\nThe restoration, which is widely supported across the local community, will commence this summer with the repair of an iconic monument, after the required funding was donated by residents of Stow.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"Mum and baby left shaken after crossing near miss in

horses to horse-power engines as a mode of transport...\nWhile much is currently talked about the transition to electric and driverless cars, here we look back to the last transition, in the early 1900s, with a move from horse to fuel-burning, engine-powered vehicles.\nThe High Street Smiddy (pictured below right), now the High Street Garage, was the very core of Innerleithen\u0026rsquos powerhouse.\nEach powerful animal had to be shod and fitted with appropriate pulling tackle.\nNot only was the horse used for its pulling power but many of the smaller breeds were used for leisure purposes.\nAs can be seen in the second photo (bottom right), a family group of riders prepare for a ride from outside Caerlee House in around 1910, no doubt off to explore the many trails by the river and on the hills around the town.\nFeaturing in the various processions of the day \u0026ndash pictured right at the St Ronan\u0026rsquos Games Week in Innerleithen and photographed by Thomas Colledge in 1907 \u0026ndash horse drawn carriages were the limousine of the day for local dignitaries such as the town Provost and Baillies.\nDaily coaches also ran to a time table from Innerleithen to St Mary\u0026rsquos Loch and Tibbieshiels and to the other Border towns of Peebles and Galashiels.\nThe change finally came in the early 1920s, as seen on the High Street in Innerleithen with a car outside the St Ronan\u0026rsquos Hotel (below).\nThereafter the horse and its power was gradually replace by horsepower provided by the internal combustion engine for transport, working the land and

For services to the Scottish seafood industry.\u0026#8217Mr MacMillan, from Carradale, East Kintyre, has already been invited to the Palace of Holyroodhouse garden party on Wednesday July 4.During more than half a century in the industry, Mr MacMillan, 72, has moved from working on a fishing boat, ring netting herring, to fine tuning a computer-controlled smoker to create smoked products for worldwide export.Mr MacMillan, has six employees, one of whom said: \u0026#8216Archie was awarded an MBE for being the best boss.\u0026#8217He took control of the artisan business in 1988 and has incrementally improved it ever since, eventually buying a £60,000 computer controlled smoker which it took him three months to fine tune.Mr MacMillan\u0026#8217s life in the seafood business started at the sharp end. Aged 15,  in 1961 he went to sea in the Amy Harris with an uncle.Mr MacMillan, who eats fish most days, said: \u0026#8216Sometimes in the mid-1960s we were earning between £9 and £11 a week which was a good wage.\u0026#8216It was spring 1962 when we started fishing for scallops and the price of a dozen sold to London was 12/6.\u0026#8217It was a brother of his mother, Mary MacMillan, née Paterson, Archie Paterson, who taught him all he knew, in a decade aboard Harvest Queen.By 1972 some Clyde boats were gearing up for pair trawling, where a net is trawled between two boats.Mr MacMillan, helped with a £12,000 loan from the Highlands and Islands Development Board, bought his own boat, Remembrance, from Finlay Cunningham.For pair trawling Mr MacMillan worked with a partner James Rennie on Monarch and in the 1980s they began exporting scallops to markets, including Belgium, Barcelona and Johannesburg.At the same time as fishing from a boat Mr MacMillan was learning about smoking products.\u0026#8216I used to come to the smokehouse when the weather was too bad to go out on the boat,\u0026#8217 said Mr MacMillan, \u0026#8216That is how I learned to smoke fish \u0026#8211 such as kippers.\u0026#8216It was different days there were not environmental health officers coming chapping at the door,\u0026#8217 added the man who has a prized certificate from SALSA \u0026#8211 Safe and Local Supplier Approval for hot and cold smoking of salmon. Cold smoking of haddock, herring, scallops, mussels and cheese.MacMillan Food\u0026#8217s environmental efforts have also been recognised by the Carbon Trust.That certificate states: \u0026#8216Cutting carbon emissions.

Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.

Plain clothes police officers joined colleagues in uniform and members of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos community warden team at John Muir Park and Lochend Woods.  John Muir Park has regularly been used by teenagers who are celebrating the end of their exams.  But in recent years there have been complaints regarding underage drinking, with about 200 people at the park\u0026rsquos Bullet Hill in 2016.  Police have patrolled the area after concerns at public meetings regarding underage drinking and the flouting of local bylaws involving drinking in a public place.  On Friday and Saturday, police and community wardens seized the alcohol from youngsters aged 14 to 21, with a variety of lager, cider and spirits, including 12 litres of vodka, taken.  Inspector Andrew Harborow said: \u0026ldquoEvery year around this time we are aware of youths congregating at Bullet Hill. Whilst this started out as an end-of-school celebration involving those mainly in S6, the ages of those taking part has clearly widened.  \u0026ldquoIn order to reduce the risk to those involved, we have taken action over the weekend and seized alcohol to prevent harm being caused and will be making follow-up enquiries with parents, carers and local shops as to where the alcohol came from.  A council spokeswoman confirmed they had and would continue to work closely with police colleagues in \u0026ldquotackling anti-social behaviour in its many forms.  She said: \u0026ldquoThis can involve action being taken against the individuals responsible for the behaviour itself, alongside engagement with parents or s when appropriate.  \u0026ldquoOn the back of operations like the one at Bullet Hill, we also work with colleagues from other council departments to co-ordinate the clean-up of any affected areas so that members of the public can continue to enjoy our open spaces without debris from anti-social behaviour."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/4089089.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=180\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Residents call for change on recycling boxes","story":"              LOCAL residents have urged\u0026nbspEast Lothian Council to ditch recycling boxes for wheelie bins after the local authority produced a video about the\u0026nbsprecycling process.

The Musselburgh MSP met with doctors and staff at the surgery, along with representatives from East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership.

Riverside was also looking at different options as to how to more effectively manage phone calls at the volume it was receiving, he said.  Mr Beattie said: \"I have encouraged the practice to expedite the introduction of the online appointment booking system, which I feel will have the greatest and quickest effect on the experience of patients contacting the surgery.\"  He also raised the concerns of patients who might have to speak to multiple staff over a period before they were dealt with.  \"Clearly a single point of contact who can immediately direct the patient to the correct destination would be cheaper for the surgery and more efficient and less frustrating for the patient,\" added Mr Beattie."},{"url":null,"title":"Fund in memory of much-missed Jess Mackie helping others","story":"              A MEMORIAL fund set up following the tragic death of a caring 14-year-old girl is on target to reach \u0026pound10,000 raised.  Jess Mackie\u0026rsquos family created the fund in her name after the Gullane youngster, who loved to sing and help others, passed away suddenly on January 2 this year.  The North Berwick High School pupil was a member of the National Youth Choir of Scotland and sang with Aberlady and Gullane Parish Churches, at care homes and for charities, and at school concerts.  Despite her young age, she had a sense of how music could help people in need.  And now the Jess Mackie Memorial Fund will \u0026ldquohelp her to keep helping others, as she had always done, and would have continued to do if she was still with us, said parents Michael and Jackie.  \u0026ldquoWe cannot let our beautiful daughter\u0026rsquos name and character be forgotten, they said. \u0026ldquoShe had so much to offer.  All monies raised will be used to provide support and comfort through music therapy at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Edinburgh.  Dad Michael, long-standing chairman of Gullane Sports Development Trust, said: \u0026ldquoWhen Jess passed away, we had a memorial service for her and decided to use it to donate to the Edinburgh Children\u0026rsquos Hospital Charity. Quickly thereafter, we learnt about an initiative involving music therapy they were running with Tinderbox Orchestra in the hospital. We met with one of the trustees initially and we decided to put in place something that would allow Jess to help other kids.  The memorial service, which was held at Aberlady Parish Church, raised more than \u0026pound2,000, with money continuing to be donated by members of the public and through organised events.  Michael, 52, said: \u0026ldquoWe were approached by Gullane and Aberlady Parish Churches and they asked if they could run an event in Jess\u0026rsquo memory, which they did last Sunday.  \u0026ldquoFrom the family point of view, it was another show of overwhelming support by the village and the community. We have raised a substantial amount of money. Gullane and Aberlady Parish Churches posted on Facebook that it had raised about \u0026pound1,800 for the fund and Gullane Athletic [FC] are running an event in August in support of the fund.  Twelve members of staff at North Berwick High School also took part in the recent Edinburgh Marathon Relay.  Split into three teams, they raised more than \u0026pound1,500 for The Royal Hospital for Sick Children Jess Mackie Memorial Fund, Richmond\u0026rsquos Hope and Leuchie House.  Jess, who was in S3 at the secondary school, was, like her twin sister Lauren, a keen singer.  Her dad told the Courier Jess \u0026ldquoloved singing and tried to help people and raise their spirits through her voice.  That love of singing and trying to help people has been mirrored through the success of the memorial fund, which sits at about \u0026pound9,800.  Michael added: \u0026ldquoI think that the fund reflects Jess completely. It reflects the impact she had while only 14 years old.  \u0026ldquoIt reflects the impact she had on people that she met and what she did in terms of her church singing, singing in local care homes, school concerts, helping out at various events like for the Bethany Christian Trust and Leuchie House. I think that reflects what she did while she was here.  The project aims to ensure children and young people who are feeling vulnerable in hospital are given the chance to enjoy music, which can have an enormous and positive impact, helping ignite a spark in them and giving them back a sense of control.  Michael added: \u0026ldquoMusic is a great comforter at times and what Tinderbox do is amazing for the kids.  \u0026ldquoWe had no hesitation in supporting what they do.  Janet Anderson, who is involved with the choirs at the two villages\u0026rsquo churches, also paid tribute to the talented teenager.  She said: \u0026ldquoI could not speak more highly of Jess.  \u0026ldquoShe did not think she had a special talent, she was just the most unassuming, normal girl you would ever meet.  \u0026ldquoShe was so pretty, so kind and so thoughtful and generous and she never thought she was anything special.

Chester, from Dunbar, is one of 13 pets, including cats, dogs and even a rat, taking part in the PDSA Pet Fit Club.  Together they weigh more than 200 kilogrammes and need to shed 75kg to reach their ideal weights.  Ten-year-old Chester, who lives with the Gilmour family on Newhouse Avenue, is looking to shift 2.6kg \u0026ndash or six pounds \u0026ndash to reach his ideal weight.  Chester, who tips the scales at 7.6kg, was gaining so much weight that his owners thought he must have an underlying medical condition. But when tests came back negative, it was clear Chester\u0026rsquos appetite and lazy ways were the root of the problem.  Owner Lisa said: \u0026ldquoWe realised everyone in the house was feeding him without knowing he\u0026rsquod already being fed, so he was getting fed by all four of us every day!  \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove tried to help him lose weight, even putting a collar on him that says \u0026lsquoDo not feed me!\u0026rsquo for the neighbours, but that hasn\u0026rsquot worked.  \u0026ldquoHe eats whatever he can find including crisps left on the floor by the kids. He even stole my dad\u0026rsquos cheesecake that was on the kitchen counter! Another time my son woke up to the sound of rattling and he was trying to claw his way into a box of chocolates.  Lisa, along with partner Lindsay and sons Rhys and Ryan, got Chester when he was just a kitten.  Now they are determined to do what they can to help their pet lose some weight and be happier.  Lisa, who works in the family newsagent, added: \u0026ldquoHe\u0026rsquos getting older now and his weight will play on his joints if we don\u0026rsquot do something to help him. He can\u0026rsquot be comfortable carrying all that weight around and we want him to be happier and healthier as he ages.  Chester\u0026rsquos six-month Pet Fit Club diet and exercise programme will be specially tailored and overseen by the vets and nurses at Edinburgh PDSA Pet Hospital.  He is up against seven dogs, including a Cavalier King Charles spaniel who once ate a set of false teeth, a cat too fat to fit through the cat flap, and a rat who is double his ideal bodyweight.  If crowned the winner, Chester will receive a year\u0026rsquos supply of pet food, a pet-friendly holiday and a pet hamper.  Kathryn Marshall, PDSA Veterinary Care Assistant, will be helping to oversee Chester\u0026rsquos diet.  She said: \u0026ldquoWith the help of PDSA and Pet Fit Club, Lisa and Chester are making the necessary diet, exercise and lifestyle changes to help get Chester down to a healthier weight.  \u0026ldquoWe will support them every step of the way over the next six months to ensure they succeed."},{"url":null,"title":"Log found at Yellowcraig beach transformed into stunning violin","story":"              A VIOLIN maker has crafted a violin from driftwood found on an East Lothian beach to help raise awareness about the environment and the plight of the oceans.

Len Smith, 92, was conscripted at the age of 18 and was a supply lorry driver for the British Liberation Army.  He landed at Gold Beach, Normandy, where he said he was not shot at and saw little combat.  But he drove some of the first troops into Berlin in 1945 and moved supplies through a war-ravaged France, Belgium, Holland and Germany.  Despite his actions, modest Len, who went on to work in the civil service, said he had never thought of himself as veteran, never mind a hero.  He told the Courier: \u0026ldquoThere were thousands of young men like me. I never considered myself a veteran until the recent events marking the anniversary led to me looking back.  \u0026ldquoAt the time we just got on with it the real heroes are the soldiers who fought and died over there.  Mr Smith was one of eight children born in Pencaitland to local couple John and Euphemia Smith.  His sister Ellen, 97, still lives in Pencaitland and he visits the area regularly but after he was demobbed in 1947, Mr Smith moved to Longlevens, Gloucestershire, to find work.  Now a widower, Mr Smith\u0026rsquos sister sends him the Courier every week so he can keep up with local news.  His L\u0026eacutegion d\u0026rsquoHonneur medal was sent to his home in Cheltenham by post and contained a letter from Jean-Pierre Jouyet, French ambassador to the UK, which said: \u0026ldquoI offer you my warmest congratulations on this high honour, which recognises your military engagement and steadfast involvement in the liberation of France during the Second World War.  \u0026ldquoAs we contemplate this Europe of peace, we must never forget the heroes like you who came from Britain and the Commonwealth to begin the liberation of Europe by liberating France.

The inspection team talked to young people at the school and worked closely with the interim headteacher Lauren Rodger, who is returning to North Berwick High School after the summer holidays.  She will be replaced by Susan Cook, currently acting headteacher at Trinity Academy, Edinburgh  Other members of staff were also spoken to, to hear about the steps the school had taken to improve on areas previously identified in the original inspection.  Education Scotland noted the following key improvements:  - The interim headteacher has provided effective leadership in taking forward work to secure improvements, including a review of the school values  - Staff have developed a range of policies to improve practice in equalities and inclusion, including a new safeguarding policy  - The recently created Pupil Support Faculty is now better placed to address the needs of young people, and those with social, emotional and behavioural needs in particular  - The school has made progress in establishing a more positive learning environment for all.  The report did note that there were still some improvements to be made.  Issues highlighted included using evidence from self-evaluation activities to ensure consistency in learning and teaching across the school reviewing the purpose of the pupil support base to ensure there was a greater focus on learning for the young people using it and ensuring there was a whole school approach to equalities and inclusion.  Fiona Robertson, head of education at East Lothian Council, praised staff at the school for their efforts.  She said: \u0026ldquoI am pleased that Education Scotland acknowledges that Knox Academy has made important progress since the last inspection, and I would like to thank all the staff and pupils for their hard work and commitment in making these improvements.  \u0026ldquoIt is really encouraging that the positive relationships between pupils and teachers, and the fact that almost all young people recognise the value of learning in their lives, was noted.  \u0026ldquoThis is a strong basis for ensuring that the school continues to be a positive learning environment for staff and pupils alike.  And she added: \u0026ldquoWe will continue to work with the school and Education Scotland to make further improvements, and to working with Susan Cook, our new headteacher, who joins the school in August.  Education Scotland will continue to work with East Lothian Council regarding the school\u0026rsquos capacity to improve and will return to carry out another inspection within 18 months."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7898185.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Thousands oppose Dunbar town centre parking charge plans","story":"              MORE than 2,000 people have signed a petition against the idea of parking charges being introduced on Dunbar High Street.

Meetings and workshops were held throughout the county by East Lothian Council, including one in Dunbar Royal British Legion.  A number of suggestions were put forward, including for a disc parking system where visitors to the busy street would set a disc showing when they had parked.  Another idea being explored is parking charges \u0026ndash but that has met with the opposition of Dunbar Trades\u0026rsquo Association (DTA).  Philip Mellor, DTA chairman, said that the group \u0026ldquostrongly oppose the introduction of parking charges.  A petition, which was put in various businesses in the town, has attracted more than 2,000 signatures.  Mr Mellor added: \u0026ldquoThe DTA feel introducing parking charges to High Street and other key off-street parking areas will have a detrimental effect on our High Street and the local economy.  \u0026ldquoThe current system since the introduction of traffic wardens has already addressed concerns around space for shoppers on High Street and it now seems counterintuitive to then introduce a measure which will drive more customers away to out-of-town developments.  \u0026ldquoWhilst parking during heavy summer visitor times can be difficult, it is very few special event days where parking is congested enough to even consider parking charges viable the majority of the time parking is available and this potential charge seems to be nothing more than a money-raising exercise at the expense yet again of already-struggling independent business owners.

Plans to close Haddington Infant School and King\u0026rsquos Meadow Primary School were revealed last autumn.  East Lothian Council intends to create a new primary school, operating from the existing school buildings, which will cover nursery through to primary seven. The proposal was approved by East Lothian Council in April after a public consultation. It has now also been approved by the Scottish Government.  Combined, the two schools currently have a school roll of about 700 pupils. However, it remains unclear who the new headteacher for the primary school, which is yet to be named, will be.  Current headteacher Seonaid McGillivray is set to be appointed at another as yet unnamed school in the county, with the final details expected to be tied up within a matter of days.  Fiona Robertson, head of education at East Lothian Council, said: \u0026ldquoWe believe that the decision to establish one new primary school, operating under a single management structure, offers the best solution to not only developing a stronger and more cohesive curriculum, but that local children will benefit from improved progression planning and transition as they progress from infant to upper stage.  \u0026ldquoOur education service will work closely with our current headteacher Mrs McGillivray, and the chairs of both parent councils, to recruit a headteacher for the newly established school.

Five retail units are planned for a site at Gateside previously earmarked for a Sainsbury\u0026rsquos supermarket and petrol station.  The site, which totals about 60,000 sq ft, could be made up of units ranging from 7,500 sq ft to 20,000 sq ft in size.  Alastair Dickie, development director with Ediston Real Estates, which now owns the site, attended the town\u0026rsquos community council meeting on Tuesday, one week before plans are unveiled to the public.  He told members the proposal was for the site to include three food retailers, with the other two units including \u0026ldquoa household-type retail business and a coffee drive-through facility.  However, he was keeping tight-lipped on the identity of the businesses until legal agreements were in place.  Mr Dickie hoped planning permission for the site, off Oak Tree Roundabout west of Haddington, could be achieved by the end of the year.  He said: \u0026ldquoIf we submit an application in August, we would hope. . . we would hopefully have a consent in December or January next year.  \u0026ldquoWe could be on site quarter one of 2019.  It is then hoped that the retailers could be trading in the lead-up to Christmas that year or early in 2020.  The development, which has been described as \u0026ldquoEast Lothian\u0026rsquos first retail park, will involve in the region of \u0026pound14 million investment, with 150 jobs potentially created, as well as those during the construction process.  It has already been revealed that talks are ongoing with \u0026ldquoa number of major retailers who will be new to East Lothian.  Concerns have been expressed by a number of retailers in the town centre that the creation of a retail park on the outskirts would be detrimental to their business.  But Mr Dickie, who previously lived in the town and continues to stay in the county, was hopeful the additional retailers would encourage people to remain in the area rather than heading further afield to retail parks in Edinburgh.  The proposals are on display to the public from 2pm to 7pm on Tuesday at the John Gray Centre.  The developer is also continuing to make progress at a second Haddington site for retail development \u0026ndashat Harperdean, between the A1 and the A199, east of Aberlady Road.

The new scheme offers people an opportunity to support Our Community Energy \u0026ndash a partnership between not-for-profit Scottish firm Our Power and Mongoose Energy, which manages community energy assets \u0026ndash and hopes to find investors in the county.  They say that the site at Pogbie Windfarm \u0026ndash already home to the turbines \u0026ndash will create enough energy to power 7,200 homes and believe that, when they combine it with a second site in Berwickshire, the scheme will raise an estimated \u0026pound1.9 million in surplus profit over 25 years.  Our Power said that profit from the wind turbines it takes over would then be used to keep energy prices down, helping people who are struggling with the costs.  They need to raise just over \u0026pound3 million for the project, which covers both sites, and community groups and individuals are being invited to invest in bonds and shares to raise the money needed to get the project up and running, with investments ranging from \u0026pound500 to \u0026pound100,000.  Andrew Smith, Our Community Energy acting chairperson, said: \u0026ldquoFuel poverty is a huge issue for Scotland and we\u0026rsquore proud to be launching such an important fundraising opportunity to directly tackle it.  \u0026ldquoInvesting with a social purpose is something close to the hearts of many Scots, and these bond and equity offers provide the chance to have a huge impact locally.  \u0026ldquoThese offers aim to support those who struggle to afford sufficiently heated homes, as well as providing investors with an exciting new option which not only targets a significant social impact but a positive environmental one too.  \u0026ldquoHowever with these types of investments there are some risks and funds are not readily realisable.  \u0026ldquoInvestors should note that capital is at risk and returns are not guaranteed.  A fuel poor household is defined as one which needs to spend more than 10 per cent of its income on all fuel use and to heat its home to an adequate standard of warmth.  Last year, the East Lothian Poverty Commission found that almost half of local pensioners were forced to spend more than 10 per cent of their income on energy bills.  Mark Kenber, CEO of Mongoose Energy, added: \u0026ldquoWith the majority of Scots recognising the critical level that fuel poverty has reached, it is now more important than ever for investors to put their money into causes that work for the social good, not just their own.  \u0026ldquoOur Community Energy not only gives investors the potential to earn competitive interest rates on their money, but also the opportunity to support the wider Scottish community.

A pressure group called \u0026lsquoBowls for Gullane\u0026rsquo was established on Facebook in the wake of concerns that the village\u0026rsquos bowling club \u0026ndash with a membership of only about 30 \u0026ndash was to be sold to developers.  Councillor Jeremy Findlay, ward member and former chairman of Gullane Area Community Council, said: \u0026ldquoAll three ward councillors are behind the campaign to save the club and we hope that the members understand the feeling in the village.  \u0026ldquoI understand that the committee own the club and it would be the members who benefit from any potential sale.  About 50 residents gathered outside the bowling club on Monday evening to show their displeasure at the possible loss of the club.  The group told the Courier they had had hundreds of offers of support.  Catherine MacKenzie said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove had people phone up, email and text us \u0026ndash and face-to-face \u0026ndash to tell us that they\u0026rsquore willing to become a member.  \u0026ldquoSome of them don\u0026rsquot live locally, or won\u0026rsquot be able to bowl, but they are willing to pay the membership fees. People do not want to see the club close.  Gordon McLelland, a local resident and member of the community council, added: \u0026ldquoThe community council want to save the club for the community.  \u0026ldquoWe have tried hard to offer the club our support to work with them but so far they have turned that down.  Billy Mellors, the county\u0026rsquos bowls development officer, said: \u0026ldquoThe overwhelming support from the local community indicates to me the future of Gullane Bowling Club can be sustained if the current members accept it.  Many locals have tried to sign up as members but have been turned away by the club, it has been claimed.  Another member of the group said: \u0026ldquoWhat has shocked us as a group is how many people have been refused membership in recent years \u0026ndash young and old have come forward with their personal experience of being turned away.  Mr Mellors added: \u0026ldquoTime will tell on the way the club want to go but we all hope a common sense approach is taken to preserve this community facility.  East Lothian MSP Iain Gray met representatives of the Bowls for Gullane group last week and is keen to find a solution to ensure the club\u0026rsquos survival.  He said: \u0026ldquoThis is an unfortunate situation Gullane has lost too many local assets recently, so every effort should be made to avoid losing another. I did meet with representatives of the campaign and have said that I will support them in trying to find a way the land, and preferably bowling too, can remain part of the village community.  Ian McMillan, CEO of Bowls Scotland, said that he was \u0026ldquodelighted to see local residents lend their support to the campaign to save the 116-year-old club.  He added: \u0026ldquoI would encourage all in the village to support their historic club, get on the green, enjoy the great game of bowls and ensure future generations can benefit from the opportunity to play an accessible, inclusive sport. Bowls Scotland fully supports the work being undertaken to keep bowls an important part of Gullane\u0026rsquos community fabric.  Les Ritchie, secretary of East Lothian Bowling Association, told the group: \u0026ldquoWe are ready to support you and the community in whatever steps might secure a future for bowling in Gullane.  Attempts by the Courier to speak to Michael Baxter, vice-president and secretary at the bowling club, were unsuccessful this week. In April, Mr Baxter told us: \u0026ldquoThere are not enough members to support the running of the club.  He had said then that the club was \u0026ldquotrying to find a solution but that it was not viable to continue with a dwindling membership.  A spokeswoman for East Lothian Council confirmed the land was earmarked for leisure and recreation use in the Local Development Plan and any deviation from that would require planning permission for a potential change of use."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7297144.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Haddington hosts world record attempt for the Slosh dance","story":"              HUNDREDS of people are set to lace up their dancing shoes in a bid to break a world record.

Colin Beattie stressed that \u0026ldquoradical thinking needed to be done to create a solution, highlighting a possible extension of a tram or light rail system out to Musselburgh.  During a recent Holyrood debate, he said: \u0026ldquoPeople meet the queues of traffic heading on to the bypass on the main roads around my constituency before they are even near the bypass. This causes more congestion and more air pollution.  Mr Beattie later said: \u0026ldquoYou can go along the road at any time of the day and there are queues of traffic, mainly at Sheriffhall Roundabout.  \u0026ldquoIt is important that when the Government are looking at all the possible changes required to the bypass, all options are considered. The main priority should be that it is cost-efficient and done as soon as possible.  \u0026ldquoIt may be that it is more economic to extend a tram or light rail system out to the main population centres such as Musselburgh than to take on the eye-watering cost of enlarging the A720. This would also benefit the environment and be much faster than using road transport.  \u0026ldquoClearly more radical thinking needs to be done on creating a sustainable solution. I am not convinced that simply replicating a system which moves traffic speedily and efficiently into new choke points is the answer.  Miles Briggs, Lothian region MSP who led the Parliamentary debate, said: \u0026ldquoThe transport information company Inrix in late 2016 identified the bypass as the most congested trunk road outside London, with four of the UK\u0026rsquos worst bottlenecks.  \u0026ldquoI continue to be contacted by frustrated constituents and businesspeople who face frequent delays when using the bypass to commute or transport goods, especially but not exclusively at peak times or when there is an accident on the route. Many drivers tell me their experience is that these tailbacks and traffic jams are becoming more and more regular.  He said that while proposed work at Sheriffhall would be an important improvement, he added: \u0026ldquoIt is only one part of what needs to be a far broader, long-term and coordinated programme of improvements to the bypass which will ensure traffic can keep moving in the decades ahead.  \u0026ldquoThis means looking at innovative solutions, assessing whether extra lanes will be needed, looking at the possible use of hard shoulders in some situations and utilising technology so the bypass can become a smart motorway.  Mr Briggs called on the Scottish Government to take forward a feasibility study into widening the city bypass and new options to address the growing congestion.  A Transport Scotland spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe Edinburgh and South East Scotland City Region Deal includes investment of up to \u0026pound120m in the A720 city bypass for the grade separation of Sheriffhall Roundabout and \u0026pound20 million investment in public transport infrastructure in west Edinburgh.  \u0026ldquoThis investment will improve journey reliability and safety for all users and support significant planned investment in Edinburgh and South East Scotland.  \u0026ldquoThe Scottish Government remains committed to undertaking the improvements at the Sheriffhall junction at the earliest opportunity. We are continuing to progress the detailed design development and assessment of the preferred option and expect to publish draft orders in 2019."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7930076.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Haddington pub seeking new owners","story":"              A TOWN centre pub which changed its name less than a year ago is on the lookout for new people to run it.

The planning statement added: \u0026ldquoWith strong links to the adjacent Queen Margaret University, the site offers the potential to build upon the reputation of Edinburgh and the Lothians for its research and innovation.  Barry Turner, spokesman for Musselburgh Conservation Society, said: \u0026ldquoThe issue at Craighall is that major development here will be very close to major development in Edinburgh at Newcraighall and in Midlothian at Shawfair, turning the whole area into a cross-boundary urban sprawl and effectively an extension to Edinburgh\u0026rsquos built-up area.  Predicting that the plan for 1,500 houses would be approved, given that was the number in the Local Development Plan, he added: \u0026ldquoAll that we can hope for is that conditions will be put in place to make this amount of housing as acceptable as possible in terms of layout, design, amenities and access to walking and cycling routes and to public transport.  \u0026ldquoOf note is that the secondary-age children here will have to get to Musselburgh Grammar School, which is some distance away and not an easy walk, certainly not from the other side of the A1.  \u0026ldquoThe recently promoted Active Travel Network shows no cycle link to Musselburgh Grammar School. We are worried about the prospect of increased car usage to get kids to and from school thus adding to the gradually worsening traffic problems in the town.  Jim Kirkpatrick, managing director of Persimmon Homes East Scotland, said: \u0026ldquoWe have had extensive engagement with East Lothian Council and the local community prior to the application being lodged and have generally been encouraged by the positive response to our masterplan.  \u0026ldquoThe comments of Musselburgh Conservation Society are noted and we believe the issues raised are addressed in the suite of information provided to the council.  \u0026ldquoThe application is fully compliant with the proposals contained within the emerging East Lothian Local Development Plan and we look forward to working with officers and other stakeholders during the determination process."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7868119.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"12 new rules the council is making over selfish parking in Musselburgh","story":"              A RAFT of traffic restrictions are to be introduced in Musselburgh to control inconsiderate parking.

A group of 42 people from all over the world set off on Sunday morning from Friedrichstrasse Station in Berlin, where the first train departed from in 1938.  The riders will cycle to the Hook of Holland and take a ferry to Harwich in Essex before arriving at London Liverpool Street Station on Saturday.

It\u0026rsquos getting emotional. pic.twitter/y9LtJm43sn          \u0026mdash World Jewish Relief (@WJRelief) June 17, 2018  The Kindertransport was organised immediately after the anti-Jewish violence of Kristallnacht, often referred to as the Night of Broken Glass, in Germany in November 1938.  An evacuation of mostly Jewish children to Britain began, with the UK government waiving the need for visas and agencies including World Jewish Relief helping to bring trainloads of children across.  Most of the cyclists are descendants of people rescued by the Kindertransport, but one experienced the journey first-hand.  Paul Alexander, 80, was just 19 months old when his mother bravely handed her only child to a British volunteer nurse and waved goodbye at a railway station.  He said he arrived in England just six weeks before the outbreak of World War Two and that it must have been a difficult decision for his mother, who had lost two previous children in childbirth.  Speaking shortly before the ride, on which he will be joined by his son and grandson, he said: \u0026ldquoFor me, this is a culmination, a vindication and a celebration of my life.  \u0026ldquoSeventy-nine years ago I was sent as a child of one and a half from Germany \u0026ndash which was a country of persecution and hatred \u0026ndash to a country where I found freedom and safety.  \u0026ldquoThat journey was the most significant I have ever made, and ever will make, in my whole life.  \u0026ldquoThis journey that I\u0026rsquom starting today is a victory over oppression and over everything that I was sent away from.  \u0026ldquoI can\u0026rsquot think of a more poignant and meaningful thing than doing this with my son and grandson. This is my answer to Adolf Hitler. This is my chance to say thank you to World Jewish Relief for orchestrating the Kindertransport.  Mr Alexander, who lived in London until he was 24 and now lives in Israel, was reunited with his parents when he was four or five.  \u0026ldquoI knew from an early age that I was sent alone from Germany by my mother, he added. \u0026ldquoIt must have been so hard for her. She did an amazing thing. Many of the children who got out were not as lucky as me.  On the ride itself, Mr Alexander said he was feeling confident.  \u0026ldquoI might not be able to do the whole of the ride but I\u0026rsquom going to do as much as I can, he said. \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom pretty fit, I don\u0026rsquot feel 80 at all!  \u0026ldquoThe most emotional bit will be when I get to London, please God I get there! It will be extraordinary to meet the other Kinder there and to see my whole family.

The cause of the fire at the Charles Rennie Mackintosh masterpiece is yet to be established and its full condition is not yet known.  Muriel Gray, GSA board of governors chairwoman, said: \u0026ldquoIt is an understatement to say everyone is utterly devastated but as usual the GSA executive team, staff and students, have been outstanding, positive and supportive.  \u0026ldquoWe now have a difficult waiting game until Scottish Fire and Rescue Service, Glasgow City Council and associated agencies have completed their investigations into the condition of the Building.  \u0026ldquoWe remain hopeful of as positive an outcome as possible because it is clear that the love for the Mackintosh and recognition of its importance to Glasgow and the wider world is shared by absolutely everyone.  A few pockets of fire remain at the site, with crews using thermal imaging cameras to identify any remaining hot spots.  The blaze is the second in four years to hit the Mackintosh Building, which was undergoing a multimillion-pound restoration project to return it to its former glory.  Both UK Scottish Secretary David Mundell and Scotland\u0026rsquos Culture Secretary Fiona Hyslop said fire service investigations into the cause of the blaze should be allowed to progress before any decision on an inquiry is taken.  Earlier, Scottish Fire and Rescue Service (SFRS) group manager Martin Hill said: \u0026ldquoThis has clearly been a protracted incident and today we are still very much in a firefighting phase.  \u0026ldquoOur firefighters have been working effectively throughout the night and we are continuing to dampen down any remaining pockets of fire.  \u0026ldquoWe are also using thermal imaging cameras to identify any hidden hotspots and will continue, working alongside partners, to assess our priorities and our tactical firefighting operation over the course of the day.  \u0026ldquoWe will remain on the scene for as long as it takes \u0026ndash we are absolutely committed to preventing any further damage to surrounding properties and ensuring the area is made safe.  \u0026ldquoI would like to express a sincere thank you to our crews on the ground and our firefighters in operations control for continuing to effectively co-ordinate our resources as well as our partners along with the wider community.

Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard MSP last week met East Lothian Labour Party campaigners at Holyrood as they delivered a petition signed by more than 1,000 people to Kevin Stewart MSP.  While Councillor Lachlan Bruce, ward member for Preston, Seton, Gosford was joined by South of Scotland MSP Michelle Ballantyne, both Conservative, as they sent letters to Mr Stewart calling for the same action (see image inset).  The campaign comes after the minister called in a planning application by Inch Cape Offshore Ltd (ICOL) to build a substation \u0026ndash which would bring energy ashore from a planned offshore wind farm \u0026ndash on a large section of the site, which was recently purchased by East Lothian Council from ScottishPower.  That sparked cross-party condemnation from county politicians, who fear it could jeopardise local plans to create jobs and boost the economy on the site.  Mr Leonard added his signature to the Hands Off Cockenzie petition before it was submitted.  Iain Gray (Lab), East Lothian MSP said: \u0026ldquoMinisters claim the call-in is because the site is of national importance, but even the leader of the SNP Group on East Lothian Council has condemned the decision as unnecessary.  \u0026ldquoBy signing our petition in such large numbers, local people have sent a clear message they want East Lothian to decide on decisions about the future of the site.

Painted on a 60ft by 40ft wall overlooking the city\u0027s Clutha bar, it features a portrait of Mackintosh looking through a stained-glass window.  The street art was commissioned by Radisson RED and designed and created by Art Pistol Projects and well-known Glasgow street artist Rogue-one as a gift to the city.  As part of the project, Radisson RED has donated \u0026pound1,000 to The Clutha Trust, the charity set up after 10 people died when a police helicopter crashed onto the roof of the pub in November 2013.  Michael Weston, curator at Radisson RED hotel in Glasgow, said: \"After opening our doors in April, we wanted to give something that showed our commitment to the local art scene as well as the city of Glasgow itself.  \"It was important to us that the mural represented a key piece of Glasgow\u0027s history, so commissioning a mural of one of the city\u0027s most iconic artists, Charles Rennie Mackintosh, was perfect.  \"It is a fitting tribute to one of Glasgow\u0027s greatest talents in his 150th anniversary year - and I\u0027d encourage everyone to come see it.\"  Born on June 7 1868, Mackintosh trained as an architect and went on to create much-admired buildings including the Glasgow School of Art and Scotland Street School in Glasgow.  The mural was given the go-ahead following a planning row after an objection from a neighbouring business.  Alan Crossan, owner of the Clutha bar, said: \"This mural is a fantastic piece of artwork and a fantastic donation to the Clutha Trust.\"  Bobby McNamara, known as Rogue-one, is renowned for his photo-realistic style and is behind a number of artworks in Glasgow, including Mitchell Street\u0027s floating taxi.  Mr McNamara said: \"From the original design sketch to the completion of the mural, it\u0027s been hard work but of course great fun.  \"Using scaffolding to access the wall was awkward at times as it\u0027s hard to see what you\u0027re doing, but I pushed on utilising my skills and experience. In the end I think I achieved something special.\"  Ali Smith, founder of Art Pistol Projects, said: \"Mackintosh is a bit of a global superstar so we had to get this one right.  \"Stepping away from the wall now it really feels like a special one, a just portrayal of such an iconic and well-loved figure.  \"Everyone that\u0027s been involved deserves a big thanks.\""},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7936576.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Singing for England  Musician   s rallying call for Scotland to get behind their old rivals in World Cup","story":"              A SCOTTISH musician has issued a rallying call for his countrymen to get behind their old rivals in the World Cup.

But Sir Brian Souter, who has also ploughed in part of his fortune to the SNP, has taken aim at his fellow millionaires.  At a prayer breakfast earlier this month, the transport tycoon said the most \u0026ldquonarcissistic and \u0026ldquoself-obsessed people he had met were rich.  He added that wealthy people are in need of \u0026ldquotransformation in their lives just as much as heroin addicts.  Souter and his sister Ann Gloag made their money by founding Scottish-based bus company Stagecoach, which also owns coach operator Megabus and South West Trains.  Stagecoach serves around 2.5 million passengers a day and the transport giant also operates in North America. Souter and Gloag were said to be worth \u0026pound920 million, although it was reported last year that the siblings had split their wealth in order to follow \"different investment strategies\".  Souter is also known for his charitable giving via his family trust, which has awarded more than \u0026pound32 million over the last three years.  An evangelical Christian who is linked to the Church of the Nazarene, the tycoon\u0026rsquos charity is interested in projects that relieve human suffering and promote spiritual welfare.  Souter recently fronted an event in Edinburgh at which he promoted the theory of \u0026ldquotransformation, which in Christianity focuses on changing individual lives.  He interviewed a former heroin addict, Alfie McCracken, who told of how he used to be homeless and had considered taking his own life.  In conversation with Souter, McCracken said his life changed after he visited a church in Largs and was \u0026ldquosmothered in love. He said he found Jesus and stopped using drugs.  Souter then made a speech in which he said \u0026ldquorules and \u0026ldquorole models are not enough to transform lives, a process that also requires a \u0026ldquoredeemer.  He claimed McCracken had found his redeemer: \u0026ldquoWhen he [Alfie] had an encounter with Jesus Christ, transformation happened in his life. When a supernatural power, greater than his own, was able to deliver him from the addiction of heroin.  However, he added that other individuals did not feel their own lives required the same change: \u0026ldquoI meet a lot of wealthy people in my walk of life, and let me tell you, they need transformation just as much as Alfie.  Souter added: \u0026ldquoThe most narcissistic, self-obsessed people I have met have had a lot of money, and I don\u0026rsquot find that amongst the homeless. The truth is we all need transformation.  The tycoon\u0027s political donations have attracted more attention than his charitable giving. Souter has donated over \u0026pound2m to the SNP and pro-independence causes, including sizeable pre-election donations.  He also spent over \u0026pound1 million in 2000 bankrolling a private referendum opposing Government plans to repeal anti-gay rights legislation. His high-profile campaign was widely criticised by MSPs, who believed he was hijacking democracy in a bid to keep a discriminatory law.  Christian Wolmer, who wrote a book in the 1990s which charted the rise of Stagecoach, said of Souter\u0026rsquos remarks:  \u0026ldquoI am glad that Brian is prepared to be critical of some of his fellow millionaires but it is a mistake to think that only religion offers solutions. If the rich paid taxes commensurate with their income and their wealth, then there would be sufficient money in the public services to ensure that there would be fewer people like Alfie who find themselves in bad situations.  He added: \u0026ldquoThe rich need to develop a social conscience, recognise the problem of inequality and be prepared to put back into society what they have gained from it. To be fair, I do recognise that Brian does that."},{"url":null,"title":"How did we determine the weather pre-digital age ","story":"              THERE\u0027S a storm coming. I can feel it in my throbbing temples and in the oppressive, muggy heat that\u0027s been building all day. I also know from this morning\u0027s radio forecast that thundery showers are expected by nightfall but having just read a book that claims humans don\u0027t need professional meteorologists to predict the weather, I have switched off all my gadgets and determined to study the world around me for clues as to when the storm will break.  This, after all, is what our ancestors did. \u0026ldquoIn the past, writes Peter Wohlleben in The Weather Detective, \u0026ldquoit was vital that everyone could recognise and interpret these signs. People were dependent on nature and intimately familiar with it.  So highly attuned were they to nature\u0027s sights, scents and sounds that in the centuries before barometers, clocks and digital calendars, humans used those signals not only to predict the weather but to establish the time of day and season of the year.  These days, most of the UK population is urban and even here in Scotland, where 98 per cent of the landmass is rural, only 20 per cent of us live in the countryside. But if we think our ancient bond with the natural world no longer matters we are dangerously deluded, argues Wohlleben, a German forester whose last book, The Hidden Life Of Trees, was an international bestseller. \u0026ldquoIn the face of climate change and damage to the environment, he argues, \u0026ldquoit is more urgent than ever that we recognise and understand the signs of nature. Only then will we appreciate what we stand to lose.  With those ominous words ringing in my ears, I step out through my front door and prepare to tune in to those elemental messages, but instead find myself negotiating a sensory assault course of traffic noise, reeking dustbins and ugly building sites.  Once inside the fecund haven of my nearest park, however, I sit on the grass and look heavenwards as our great, great, great grandparents would routinely have done before deciding whether this was a good day to sow their oats or bring in the sheep, cast their nets or batten down the hatches. Their existential dread of spoiled harvests and shipwreck was written into folklore and Met Office research conducted last summer suggests 75 per cent of us still set store by those old proverbs, particularly the one about a red sky at night foretelling shepherd\u0027s (or sailor\u0027s) delight, which 70 per cent of us believe. And apparently we are not far wrong, since that nocturnal rosy glow is caused by the high pressure associated with good weather. \u0026ldquoHigh pressure traps dust and dirt in the air, which scatters blue light, only leaving the red remaining \u0026ndash hence the reddish appearance of the sky, explains the Met Office website.  A red sky in the morning, meanwhile, actually does act as a reliable shepherd\u0027s (or sailor\u0027s) warning since, as Wohlleben explains, \u0026ldquothe sun rises in the east, where the sky is clear, and shines onto the clouds gathering in the west, which will rapidly spread and fill the sky.  Useful as it may be, that old adage is no help to me now in the middle of a sultry afternoon so I decide to examine the clouds themselves, which people seem always to have known were linked to weather even if they didn\u0027t understand the scientific reasons. In Greek mythology, clouds were nymphs who gathered river water in cloudy pitchers before ascending to the sky where they floated around in billowing robes, emptying the contents over the earth. Ancient Hindu tradition construed clouds as heavenly white elephants, which used their trunks to shower rainwater over the land below. And for the Native American Navajo people, clouds were formed by the flapping wings of a great white swan.  As we now know, of course, the more prosaic explanation is that low pressure causes water vapour to condense into droplets or ice crystals. Thinner cloud lets more light through and so appears white. \u0026ldquoIf you see tall, towering clouds on the horizon, it means rain (or snow) is likely soon, writes Wohlleben. \u0026ldquoIf they seem to puff out at the top, or form an anvil shape (where the cloud tower is being pulled apart at the top), then a thunderstorm is on the way.  Right now, there is no discernable shape to the cloud, which is lightish grey but so widely dispersed across the sky that although I can hear the drone of an aircraft overhead, I can\u0027t see it and nor can I tell whether it has left one of those lingering condensation trails which Wohlleben says act as \u0026ldquoearly harbingers, of bad weather since if they don\u0027t dissolve, \u0026ldquothat means humidity is on its way, and with it a low-pressure area. The sky will soon cloud over.  Clearly, we have passed that milepost so I lower my gaze and look around for earthly omens. With no cattle around, I can\u0027t test the old trope about cows lying down before a cloudburst (which is nonsense anyway, according to the Met Office, even if 61 per cent of us believe in it), so I look for botanical soothsayers in the form of daisies. \u0026ldquoOne glance at the white and yellow flowers is enough to tell if you should hang your laundry out, writes Wohlleben. \u0026ldquoIf rain is on the way, or a storm, the petals close up. Some also droop downwards, to avoid letting a single drop in.  Evidently, the daisies in this Glasgow park are rebellious little flowers, for despite the fact that the sky has darkened and I can actually hear the rumble of distant thunder, their petals are defiantly open. So I search instead for some dandelions, having heard that the seeding heads shut up like umbrellas when bad weather is approaching. And Eureka! I find a clump of elderly dandelions with one fully formed clock and three of those feathery heads, all tightly furled like little green and white brollies.  And now I close my eyes and listen for the sound of silence. We all know calm is supposed to precede a storm, and it\u0027s generally thought that birds go quiet beforehand. And if evidence for this is hard to come by, they are known to be extremely sensitive to small changes in atmospheric pressure and to time their migratory flights accordingly. A 2014 study by the University of California found that golden-winged warblers took a substantial detour from their usual migration route to avoid ferocious tornadoes which killed 35 people.  Our feathered friends feature prominently in weather lore. \u0026ldquoHawks flying high means a clear sky, runs the old rhyme. \u0026ldquoWhen they fly low, prepare for a blow. Seabirds flying inland and solo-flying crows are also supposed to presage foul weather, while birds singing in the rain reputedly do so before a change for the better.  More pertinently for today\u0027s purposes, low-flying swallows are meant to warn us that storms are approaching but Wohlleben casts doubt on this theory, arguing that \u0026ldquoif anything, it\u0027s the other way around: as the wind picks up before a storm, swallows are likely to fly higher than usual. The saying \u0027when swallows fly high, the weather will be dry\u0027 could well lead you astray.  He says chaffinches are better barometers, apparently modifying their song when the weather is set to turn. When the sun is shining, he writes,\u0026ldquothe males usually trill a melody that sounds a little like \u0027chi-chip-chirichirichiri-chip-cheweeoo\u0027. If storm clouds loom or rain falls, however, he switches to a monosyllabic \u0027raaatch\u0027.  Sadly, I couldn\u0027t tell a chaffinch\u0027s cry from a sparrow\u0027s, which is probably symptomatic of how detached I am from the natural signals with which my great-great-great-etc-grandmother would have been intimately familiar. The Weather Detective contains fascinating, if depressing, insights into the way our urban lifestyles are shattering our ties with nature \u0026ndash not least through light pollution, which is obliterating the nocturnal star-shows that once guided our ancestors\u0027 footsteps. Meanwhile, moths, which mistake artificial lights for the moon by which they orientate their flight paths, find themselves hopelessly circumnavigating those electrical orbs until they die of exhaustion. (Bats, apparently, have learned to profit from their confusion, by patrolling street lights on warm summer nights, where they feast on disorientated moths.)  Here in the park, it\u0027s still broad daylight and in fact, the clouds have lightened to a greyish white. The thunder appears to have passed overhead and only a few splashes of rain have fallen. Perhaps those daisies were better informed than the dandelions after all. And indeed even my troubled bones \u0026ndash or rather, the headache that\u0027s been nagging since morning \u0026ndash has miraculously cleared with the storm clouds.  For as Wohlleben confirms, your granny is not necessarily havering about the rheumatic twinges or other physical symptoms that supposedly presage a change in the weather, since humans \u0026ndash like other animals \u0026ndash are hardwired to detect the shifts in air pressure that determine meteorological variations. Why some people are more sensitive than others to their inbuilt barometer is unclear, though Wohlleben surmises that it could be linked to changes in the conductivity of our cell membranes, which can become more sensitive as a result of certain medical conditions.  Whatever the cause, in the days before central heating and ready-meals, paying attention to those physiological indicators, and to their surroundings, would have been second nature to our ancestors.  Today, we are increasingly alienated from the natural world. In 2005, American author Richard Louv coined the term \u0026ldquonature deficit disorder to describe the harm we are doing to our children by robbing them of the opportunity to run, play and climb trees in the great outdoors. Even the language of childhood is changing. In 2015, prominent authors such as Margaret Atwood and Michael Morpurgo expressed \u0026ldquoprofound alarm at the Oxford University Press\u0027s decision to drop words such as \u0026ldquobuttercup and \u0026ldquominnows from its children\u0027s dictionaries, in favour of terms such as \u0026ldquobroadband and \u0026ldquocut-and-paste.  So does Wohlleben want us to throw away our smartphones? Apparently not. \u0026ldquoI\u0027m not advocating a return to our roots or a rejection of modern life, he insists. \u0026ldquoWhat I\u0027m really interested in is reclaiming our sensitivity to nature and reawakening our powers of observation. When we use our senses at full capacity, we access the wealth of thrilling and calming experiences waiting for us just outside our back doors, in nature and in our gardens. He urges us to train our sense of hearing, by attending to nature\u0027s noises. \u0026ldquoFind out what your own favourite garden sound is: perhaps it\u0027s the song of a blackbird at dusk, the rustle of a hedgehog under a hedge or the brisk buzz of a bumblebee in the shrubs. There are so many amazing things to hear out there beyond the everyday tumult of cars and planes.  Here in this city park, the rumble of cars and planes remains audible through the trees but so does the chirrup of birds (which may or may not be chaffinches) and the rustle of something that just might be a hedgehog.  The storm clouds, meanwhile, have all but disappeared. And I\u0027m sure I can smell sunshine.  The Weather Detective: Rediscovering Nature\u0027s Signs by Peter Wohlleben is published by Rider, \u0026pound12.99  PREDICTING THE SEASONS  Does a bumper summer crop of nuts, berries and fruits mean a hard winter is coming? Not necessarily. \u0026ldquoSadly, we can\u0027t predict the future from a bountiful crop, writes Peter Wohlleben. \u0026ldquoAfter all, the fruit buds are produced the previous summer. If it indicates anything, an abundance of acorns and beechnuts in the forests suggests \u0026hellip a dry summer the previous year.  Can snowmen sense the coming of spring? Astonishingly, yes \u0026hellip though only in the sense that if you can manage to build one, it means the snow itself is of the right consistency to be rolled into balls. And since this happens when temperatures are comparatively mild, it could mean that a long, hard spell is coming to an end.  Do pine cones act as weather stations? Sort of. \u0026ldquoThey open up in sunny, dry weather making a big puffy cone, while in rainy weather they close up making the cone smaller and narrower, explains Wohlleben. \u0026ldquoHowever, since the change lags behind the weather \u0026hellip they are completely useless as a forecasting instrument.  HOW TO TELL THE TIME BY NATURE\u0027S CLOCK  You can set your watch by flowers, many of which open at different times of day. \u0026ldquoPumpkins and courgettes kick things off first by opening their flowers at 5 o\u0027clock in the morning, writes Peter Wohlleben in The Weather Detective. \u0026ldquoFrom 8am the marigolds spread out their petals and the daisies follow at 9.  Meanwhile, birdsong can help tell us the early morning time but only if your ears are attuned to the melodies of particular birds, since the various species vary their peak dawn chorus moment, in order to ensure their territorial and mating calls aren\u0027t drowned out by others.  On the RSPB\u0027s website, Jenny Shelton offers this evocative chronology of the UK\u0027s dawn chorus, which she says peaks in the half-hour before and after sunrise: \u0026ldquoRobins, blackbirds and song thrushes begin, then the wrens and warblers join in. Finally, come the chaffinches, goldfinches and sparrows. It\u0027s thought that, because this last group have smaller eyes, they need more light to find food.  WHY DOES MIDSUMMER\u0027S DAY FALL AT THE BEGINNING OF SUMMER?  On Midsummer\u0027s Day, June 21, the sun is at its peak in the sky. \u0026ldquoThe reason why summer only truly begins after this peak, writes Peter Wohlleben, \u0026ldquois that the sun needs several weeks to heat up the air. This means the temperature increase lags a little behind the sun\u0027s height in the sky, and the air temperature only reaches its maximum later in the season when the days are already getting shorter again."},{"url":null,"title":"Alex Salmond says he urged Ian Blackford to adopt more disruptive tactics ahead of SNP Commons walkout","story":"              ALEX Salmond says he was behind the SNP\u0027s dramatic mass walkout at Westminster.  SNP MPs stormed out of the Commons chamber earlier this week when Ian Blackford was kicked out by the speaker during Prime Minister\u0027s Questions amid protests that MPs had not been given enough time to consider over 50 amendments to the Brexit bill on devolution.  Salmond said he suggested the dramatic protest during a chat with Blackford, the SNP\u0027s Westminster leader.  The former First Minister said Blackford phoned him on the eve of the clash.  \u0026ldquoOne of the iron laws of parliamentary politics is that if you always play the Westminster game then you will always lose,\" Salmond told the Sunday Herald.  \"And the way to turn that round successfully is to target interventions at those occasions which mean so much to the Westminster establishment - PMQs, budgets, state openings etc, and then use their own procedures against them.  \"Certainly that was my advice to Ian Blackford when he phoned me last Tuesday night and I was delighted to see him carry it through.\"  Salmond said he was filming in Gibraltar for a TV programme about Brexit when Blackford sought his advice about taking on the Tories.  Writing in today\u0027s Sunday Herald, Blackford blasted the \"absolute scandal\" of what he said was a lack of debate on a \"power grab\".  After the transfer of powers from Brussels to Whitehall and Westminster, London will take charge of policy areas traditionally devolved to Holyrood.  The SNP has said that means completely demolishing the principle at the heart of the devolution settlement by giving Westminster the final say on many devolved policy areas.  The UK wants to retain control over 24 devolved areas, most related to agriculture, fisheries and the environment, for up to seven years.  Blackford said MPs had been given just 15 minutes to debate the measures in the EU Withdrawal Bill, and warned that the stand off was a \"defining moment when the UK Parliament chose to reject devolution\".  Blackford is to use a debate in Westminster tomorrow (Monday) to make the case for emergency legislation to halt the \"power grab\".  Salmond was famously thrown out of the Commons chamber in 1988 after he interrupted the then chancellor, Nigel Lawson, in mid-flow.  In a dramatic move, Salmond \u0026ndash who had been an MP for just a year \u0026ndash spoke out against the controversial poll tax, a flagship policy of the Thatcher government.  After barracking Lawson and becoming the first MP in history to break parliamentary convention by intervening during the Chancellor\u0026rsquos budget, Salmond was ordered to leave the Commons.  In a frank admission, Salmond said that some SNP MPs between 2015 and 2017 had been \"intent on winning the gold star for good attendance rather than independence\".  He suggested that the SNP\u0027s loss of 21 seats in the 2017 general election was partly due to it becoming too comfortable with the Westminster set up.  Salmond, who was one of the SNP\u0027s casualties last year, said the walkout was a return to a much more effective style of opposition by the party.  \"The challenge for the SNP is to keep up the momentum. Westminster is treating Scotland with contempt,\" he said.  \"Now they are receiving a taste of their own medicine.  \"If they want business as usual then they should get their mitts off the powers of the Scottish Parliament.  \"In my opinion the SNP fell into the Westminster trap after 2015 and then paid the price at the polls.  \"Too many of the current crop of MPs then seemed intent on winning the gold star for good attendance rather than independence. Now all that has changed and well done to them.  \"The people who send the SNP south expect their MPs to shake it up, not settle down.  In response, a UK Government spokesman said: \"The UK Government is proceeding entirely in line with devolution. Rather than manufacture grievance the SNP should be working with us to get best deal for people in Scotland as we leave the EU.  Scottish Tory MP John Lamont added: \u0026ldquoThis really demonstrates the utter immaturity of the SNP.\""},{"url":null,"title":"Digital currency Scotcoin holders to be given bonus if they transfer to new version of coin","story":"              HOLDERS of the digital currency Scotcoin will be given a bonus of four times their stake if they transfer, or \"migrate\", to a new version of the coin.  The Scotcoin owners are building a new blockchain, the engine which drives cryptocurrencies. The present one handles the buying and selling of coins, as a kind of digital bureau de change, with the information on transactions shared between thousands of computers throughout the world making it, in theory, uncrackable.  \"But it\u0027s creaking and it\u0027s expensive,\" says Scotcoin co-owner David Low, \"so our new one will be cheaper, faster and more reliable.\" It will be, he adds, \"the rock \u0027n\u0027 roll version\".  To encourage the present 4,000 holders of the currency (including Sunday Herald readers who took up a free offer 18 months ago) to migrate to the new coin they will be offered four new ones for each one they hold. \"We value each present coin at one pence, a hundred is a pound and so you\u0027ll get five pounds for your pound if you take up the offer.\"  That offer is likely to last six months but Low can\u0027t say when it will start \u0026ndash that will depend on when the new blockchain is finished, and he isn\u0027t putting a time on that. But he is confident that holders will make the switch. \"Why keep an old Russian bearer bond,\" is how he puts it, \"when you can have a dollar?\"  Another advantage of the new system is that people will be able to switch directly to and from the main established currencies, like sterling, the euro and the dollar. And it will take the volatility out of crypto-trading because scotcoin will be linked to the pound and not bitcoin, which has been highly volatile. So its value will rise or fall with sterling.  Low has also offered scotcoin\u0027s IP address to the Scottish Government which, if taken up, would make it the country\u0027s official digital currency. He described initial meetings about it as \"highly encouraging\".  As he told the Sunday Herald in the past: \u0026ldquoHere\u0027s me, a guy who makes money out of the system and I basically latched onto the currency issue, the single biggest thing which lost the referendum. An independent Scotland must have its own currency, for better or worse.\"  Low may seem an unlikely rebel against financial orthodoxy but the accountant and financial adviser has a starry track record. It was him who organised, on the ground, the shareholder uprising which removed the seemingly impregnable families who owned Celtic and ushered in Fergus McCann, the jaggy bunneted Scottish ex-pat from Canada, who transformed the football club.  When the new scotcoin is launched, Low and his partner Temple Melville will hold a stake worth, notionally, around \u0026pound950 million. But he doesn\u0027t intend to profit from it, all of it will go into what he calls a common wealth fund. \"It will be the polar opposite of a sovereign wealth fund because it will benefit the poor and the disadvantaged.\" Administered by a group of \"the great and the good\", the plan is to pay young people in scotcoin to do good works for the benefit of the community.  It\u0027s a kind of quantitive easing in reverse, contrary to the present system where \"the rich get richer and poorer get poorer, the poorer will get richer\". If under-25s are given, say, pounds1000 or pounds10,000 \"they can do with it what they want, save it or spend it and if they spend it then it benefits the economy\".  To spend it they need outlets, and not just the Arlington Bar, which Low owns. \"I\u0027m confident that the big companies will get involved so that the kid will be able to walk into Greggs or M\u0026ampS or any large retailer and buy what he or she wants using a card, just like now. It\u0027s coming.

After the shock in May 2014, fears about the continued existence of the building subsided and it appeared that, by some miracle, it was salvageable. Rather than devastation, the tale was shaping up take its place in history is a miraculous escape. It would take more than that to break a building which held such passion and history within its walls.  It\u0026rsquos difficult to articulate the richness of that history, and its importance to Glasgow. The Mackintosh building cements the place of Charles Rennie Mackintosh into the fabric of the city. It sits among the buzz of the bustle, both soaking up the Glasgow culture and helping define it.  The building has occupied its place in the Glasgow landscape since 1899, when the first half of the project was completed. It was designed by Rennie Mackintosh, then a junior draughtsman at firm Honeyman and Keppie, which submitted the plans as part of an architectural competition.  The school itself, as an institution, was founded more than 50 years before, and had already gained a substantial reputation in the field. Before it settled in its new home in Renfrew Street, in the glory of Rennie Mackintosh\u0026rsquos design, it had enjoyed stints in the Merchant City\u0026rsquos Ingram Street and the McLellan Galleries.  The prestigious institution went on to hold a number of academic schools: the Mackintosh School of Architecture, the School of Design, the School of Fine Art, the School of Simulation and Visualisation, and the Innovation School.  While maintaining its reputation as a revered place of study and continuing to appeal to international students as well as local, the School of Art, and in particular the Mackintosh building, has been popular with tourists as a place of historical and cultural significance.  Its relevance to modern art as well as history is undisputed. The School has been host to numerous winners and nominees of the Turner Prize in recent times, such as Richard Wright, Simon Starling and Martin Boyce.  Indeed, it boasts a strong roster of alumni. As well as its most famous son, Charles Rennie Mackintosh, Glasgow School of Art has also counted artist Peter Howson, Travis singer Fran Healy, author Alasdair Gray, former Doctor Who Peter Capaldi, former Scots Makar Liz Lochhead and broadcaster Muriel Gray among its students.  While Rennie Mackintosh is celebrated in the modern age and he has secured his place in the history of art and architecture, he wasn\u0026rsquot always appreciated in his time. Despite his unexpected success with the Art School design, he struggled to get other major commissions in his time. The Glasgow School of Art is the most emphatic physical expression of his contribution to cultural history, and the building therefore represents something bigger for Scotland than just as a hub of rich art and cultural nurturing.  For the city of Glasgow, it hurts. Locals have dealt with several tragedies in recent years. While there is relief at the lack of any casualties as a result of the fire, the same could not be said for the disasters in 2013, when a police helicopter crashed into the roof of the Clutha Bar, and at Christmas 2014, when a number of people were killed in the bin lorry tragedy in the centre of town.  The first fire at the School of Art almost became a ray of light after the initial shock and sadness had calmed. For once it seemed the city may have caught a small break when it became clear that the School could be saved and restored. Now, the double blow feels like a knockout punch to the gut for a city looking forward to a grand re-opening of the Mackintosh building next year. And if it hadn\u0026rsquot already seemed like the planets had for some reason aligned to seal the famous building\u0026rsquos fate, the added salt in the wound is that the second fire happened on the School\u0026rsquos graduation day.  Perhaps one of the most difficult things to consider when thinking, when writing, about events since Friday night is accepting that we now may be discussing the Mackintosh building as something that once existed. It is not the chapter of history anyone could have imagined. It feels cruel and unfair. It\u0026rsquos hard to imagine it as something that was, but that no longer is. Glasgow will, of course, recover, and the School\u0026rsquos admirable reputation will continue. For now, however, the city needs a moment to mourn. Then, the questions, and anger, will inevitably come."},{"url":null,"title":"Beaumont sets British record on penny farthing","story":"              ENDURANCE cyclist Mark Beaumont has set a British record for the furthest distance travelled on a penny farthing in an hour.

McDonald told her party\u0027s ard fheis (annual conference) in Belfast that this month\u0027s summit of European leaders in Brussels represented \"crunch time\"."},{"url":null,"title":"Future shock  Behind the dark matter of Albert Einstein  39 s lurid racism lies a bitter irony","story":"              IT was out of character when the aloof, distant, emotionally unavailable Albert Einstein gifted his wife some artwork. She knew better than to get excited \u0026ndash it was simply a detailed drawing of his foot so she could tailor him the perfect sock. Ever the logician, this selfish gesture made perfect sense to Albert. He had feet and a wife who could sew. Socks or mc2, both are simply conclusions to cold calculations.  Perhaps Einstein had simply outgrown his brain\u0026rsquos empathetic static, that hunger for emotional reciprocation gifted to us by evolution to maintain social order. Despite his saintly posthumous persona, there is clear evidence that paints the young Einstein as a chap whose much-vaunted \u0026ldquohumanity was actually a wildly prejudiced, dispassionate study in societal anthropology.  Certainly, a dark disdain for his fellow man has been revealed in private diaries which finally went on public view this week.  Penned in the 20s, these jottings mainly detail the physicist\u0026rsquos tour of Asia and his highly questionable attitudes towards folk he observed on his travels. In particular, the Chinese. A great bunch of lads, according to Father Ted. Einstein disagreed. Like Ted, he preferred to group individuals as a collective and branded the entire Chinese population \u0026ndash 400 million at the time \u0026ndash \u0026ldquopeculiar, herd-like \u0026hellip often more like automatons than people. And, typical of Einstein, he was thinking of the future when he signed off with the zinger: \u0026ldquoIt would be a pity if these Chinese supplant all other races. The Bernard Manning of physics had spoken.  A spectacular level of conceit is also evident in a lame yet rather lyrical piece of \u0026ldquoothering which conveyed Einstein\u0026rsquos distaste for Chinese women. Unlike his foot sketch this critique was, assumedly, an attempt at humour \u0026ndash yet its laboured structure suggests a sentence squeezed out by the bowels of the mind as some sort of dirty protest against decency. Einstein wrote: \u0026ldquo... how little difference there is between (the) men and women. I don\u0026rsquot understand what kind of fatal attraction Chinese women possess which enthrals the corresponding men to such an extent that they are incapable of defending themselves against the formidable blessing of offspring. A simple \u0026ldquodon\u0026rsquot fancy yours much would have done, Albert. He certainly wouldn\u0026rsquot have been a fan of xhamster.  The irony of having expressed such abhorrent views on racial superiority was likely not lost on Einstein when he was forced to flee Germany 10 years later. Dehumanising Nazi propaganda, echoing his own musings on Chinese inferiority, had stoked anti-semitic fervour to fever pitch in his homeland. Einstein was forced to face himself in the mirror and see the real-world consequences of casual stereotypes and generalisations when used as weapons by politicians.  And as his star rose and influence grew in America, a newfound devotion towards civil rights and race relations made it clear that this great teacher of the universe\u0026rsquos secrets had learned a powerful lesson of his own in humility.  THE FUTURE IS IN CHINA\u0027S HANDS  IT\u0026rsquoS especially ironic that the most forward-thinking of modern physicists chose China as his target for blinkered offloading of the id. Shame on the young Einstein if he was already aware that no civilisation on Earth has enjoyed a longer continuous tradition of astronomy and science than the Chinese.  Around 1500BC, China\u0026rsquos stargazers inprinted detailed depictions of complex cosmic events on to shells and bones \u0026ndash with one of these fascinating relics being the earliest known record of a solar eclipse.  The Chinese are far from done with their 4,000-year quest to unlock the secrets of the universe. In fact, they\u0026rsquore just getting started \u0026ndash having recently spent billions to build the Jehovah\u0026rsquos dinner plate of satellites \u0026ndash Earth\u0026rsquos largest-ever communication structure. It was created with the single objective of discovering signals from alien civilisations.  A government splurging so much of its new-found wealth on alien hunting may seem a frivolous waste of cash, especially one with appalling levels of socio-economic hardship, but a newly-revived China views such expenditure as an investment in the future.  Above all their myriad Earthly geopolitical ambitions, what China truly desires is \u0026ldquofirst contact. Keen to solidify their superpower status in the eyes of the world, they\u0026rsquore too late to put the first man in space (Russia) or on the moon (Kubrick. Kidding, USA) so they have turned their focus on something even more seismic and culturally significant.  Of course, the Chinese also want extra-terrestrials to view them as Earth\u0026rsquos dominant nation \u0026ndash but whether aliens will recognise lines on maps as a viable way to draw distinctions between this lukewarm rock\u0026rsquos self-destructive, territorial hate machines is another matter.  Chinese ambitions don\u0026rsquot end at discovering extraterrestrial civilisations either \u0026ndash there are advanced plans for building an observatory on the dark side of the moon within the next few decades. They also quite fancy trumping the Americans by colonising Mars first too. Make no mistake, putting that first human foot on the red planet is presently the superpowers\u0026rsquo most highly contested prize, one desired beyond all other Earthly concerns.  Admirably, China has also raised a salutary two fingers towards the strain of xenophobic isolationism favoured by young Einstein, with plans to link up their alien-hunting satellite with countless other SETI projects across the planet. A vision of one big united skin condition itching Earth\u0026rsquos crust together to explore the great unknown \u0026ndash it\u0026rsquos a beautiful thing.  In fact, it\u0026rsquos the kind of progressive \u0026ldquostrength in numbers societal partnership that might one day save us all from being skinned alive by interstellar big game hunters from Zeta Reticuli that China inadvertently alert to our presence.  HARDWIRED FOR PREJUDICE  THE more hysterical media reports covering Einstein\u0026rsquos racist indiscretions were predictably light on the physicist\u0026rsquos attempts to confront the issue of civil rights in his adopted home of America \u0026ndash a lifelong crusade perhaps born of a desire to make amends for his rather prejudiced views as a younger man.  Yet, it\u0026rsquos not so easy to brush off Einstein\u0026rsquos mindset as simply a naive reflection of the prevailing attitudes of the era. Racism isn\u0026rsquot quite so clear-cut \u0026ndash one day, the dissonant turbulence left in the wake of a Trump presidency, Brexit and rise of the far-right across the globe will likely rank high among humanity\u0026rsquos most dangerously xenophobic eras \u0026ndash depressingly arriving just half a century after the Jewish holocaust.  Although humanity toils under the illusion of forward progress, human cultural norms and societal attitudes \u0026ndash as Einstein discovered with light \u0026ndash don\u0026rsquot always travel in a straight line.  Our perceptions of reality swim in a continual state of flux, adapting by expanding and contracting to fit the sociological, cultural and economical climate of the era. Evolution has evidently built our brains to be vulnerable to societal herdthink, and we only have to open our eyes to see our willingness to fall in line with hive mentality.  Prejudice certainly sharpens the hazy chaos of internal dialogue to a sharp point, giving the meaninglessness meaning and reinforcing the heady delusion of racial superiority. Reciprocated antipathy releases a highly addictive brain chemical cocktail of dopamine, serotonin, oxytocin and endorphins.  Territorialism is seriously addictive \u0026ndash quite likely a hardwired evolutionary hangover. Yet ironically, many individuals only feel that they truly exist when becoming anonymous in the echo chamber \u0026ndash with the hive validating their infected mindset.  Einstein\u0026rsquos own addiction to the rush of personal prejudice was clearly still evident during the twilight of his career, having mutated from blinkered racism to a stubborn refusal to accept new scientific ideas \u0026ndash most famously his denial of the reality of quantum physics.  It led to wasted decades of dead-end research, with Einstein himself acknowledging the relative uneventfulness of his post-fame career.  A fruitless search to find a unifying theory to marry the world of the very small with Newtonian physics once again showed that even genius is not invulner-able to that opiate of the human condition \u0026ndash the rose-tinted comfort of our own long-calcified mindsets.  As Einstein himself said: \u0026ldquoBrief is this existence, a fleeting visit in a strange house. The path to be pursued is poorly lit by a flickering consciousness."},{"url":null,"title":"Plans to increase weeks off work for paternity leave would help 17 000 families in Scotland","story":"              Around 17,000 families in Scotland would benefit from an increase in paternity pay and leave, according to Labour.  Plans by the UK party would see new dads able to take four weeks off work to help look after a newborn, compared with the current two weeks.  Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard released figures to mark Father\u0027s Day, claiming 17,000 families would benefit from their proposals.  He said: \"The next UK Labour Government will deliver policies to transform the workplace and deliver better security and equality for working people in our fast changing economy.  \"Fathers must have the right to spend more time with their newborn babies and support their families.  \"Increasing paternity leave will lead to greater equality in the workplace.  \"Our plan to double paternity leave from two to four weeks and increase paternity pay would benefit 17,000 families in Scotland.  \"That\u0027s the real change Labour can deliver for working families in Scotland and across the UK.\"  A UK Government spokesman said: \"This Government is supporting millions of parents to balance work and family life not just in the weeks after birth.  \"That\u0027s why we launched a task force to promote awareness of flexible working patterns and are running a campaign to encourage couples to take up Shared Parental Leave and share childcare in their baby\u0027s first year.\""},{"url":null,"title":"Cabinet divisions not making Brexit harder  insists May  denying Remainer betrayal claims","story":"              THERESA May has rejected claims that UK Cabinet divisions are making Brexit negotiations with the EU harder as the Prime Minister insisted she was a \u0026ldquowoman of her word, saying she had not reneged on a deal with Tory Remainers over the Brexit Bill.  When asked what message she had for Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson after he was recorded expressing concern the UK could end up remaining in orbit around the EU and not fully free to make trade deals, Mrs May said: \"The message is Government has agreed that we will have an independent trade policy. We will be free to negotiate those trade deals around the rest of the world.\"  She explained how in the week beginning July 9 the UK Government would publish a White Paper on Brexit, setting out in more detail its ambition for a future relationship with the EU.  The PM told BBC1\u0027s The Andrew Marr Show that she could not agree to any EU move that would harm the Union of the United Kingdom by creating a trade border between Britain and Northern Ireland, declaring: \"That\u0027s not right. That\u0027s not acceptable.\"  Ahead of a debate in the House of Lords tomorrow on the EU Withdrawal Bill and a crunch, potentially knife-edge vote on Wednesday when the amended legislation returns to the Commons, Mrs May insisted she was a woman of her word after some Tory rebels expressed fears they were not getting the compromise deal they believed had been on offer over Parliament having a greater influence on Brexit.  \"I did indeed meet a group of my fellow MPs. I listened to their concerns and I undertook to consider their concerns. And the next day I stood up in Prime Minister\u0027s Questions and said I\u0027d put an amendment down in the House of Lords. I\u0027ve done exactly that.  Facing claims of betrayal by some pro-EU colleagues, Mrs May insisted that she and her Cabinet colleagues recognised the concerns some people had about the role of Parliament in the Brexit process but she made clear she would not budge on the primacy of Government in the talks with Brussels, saying: \"Parliament cannot tie the hands of Government in negotiations.\"  However, her Tory colleagues Dominic Grieve made it clear the Conservative rebels did not intend to back down on getting Parliament more say on Brexit.  Asked if they did not secure a so-called \u0026ldquomeaningful vote on the final Brexit deal, they would oppose the Government in Wednesday\u0026rsquos vote, the former Attorney General replied: \u0026ldquoThe meaningful vote pledge has to be fulfilled, yes.  Asked if the rebels could collapse the Government by voting against it, he told BBC1\u0027s Sunday Politics: \"We could collapse the Government. And I can assure you I wake up at 2am in a cold sweat thinking about the problems that we have put on our shoulders. The difficulty is that the Brexit process is inherently risky.\"  Robert Buckland, the Solicitor General, insisted UK ministers intended to press on with their own meaningful vote amendment, which suggested a Government motion on the final deal could not be amended rebels believe this means the meaningful vote would, therefore, not be meaningful.  Mr Buckland stressed that while Tory rebels argued the vote they wanted would only be advisory, he stressed that even this vote could have a political consequence and send a signal to Brussels that the UK Government was not in control of its own negotiating strategy. \u0026ldquoThere is a political contest to all of this, he insisted.  Ahead of the Lords debate tomorrow, Lord Newby, who leads the Liberal Democrats in the upper chamber, accused Mrs May\u0026rsquos plans on the Brexit bill as \u0026ldquobreathtaking in their arrogance and deceit.  \u0026ldquoHaving reneged on a promise made to her own colleagues, it is clear she cannot be trusted. The Government\u0026rsquos current proposal would neuter Parliament if the Government failed to reach a Brexit deal. This is simply unacceptable, he declared.  Lord Newby went on: \"Parliament must be given a meaningful vote on all possible outcomes of Brexit and this must be guaranteed in writing in the Withdrawal Bill.  \u0026ldquoThe Conservatives are making a complete mess of Brexit. They are gambling with the country\u0026rsquos future purely in an attempt to patch over divisions in the Tory Party.  He added: \"At some point there will be a reckoning: either with a cobbled-together Brexit deal or if the negotiations fail.

His response came after Theresa May appeared taken aback as to why she had allowed Sir Christopher Chope, who has sought to block a number of bills over the years, to receive a knighthood just a few months ago.  The MP for Christchurch in Dorset sparked outrage when, to cries of \u0026ldquoshame in the Commons, he single-handedly blocked the criminalisation of upskirting in England and Wales it has been banned in Scotland since 2009.  After the outcry, Sir Christopher told his local newspaper he supported outlawing what he called was the \"vulgar, humiliating and unacceptable\" act of upskirting but stressed he had objected on a point of principle about Government misusing parliamentary procedure.  He shouted down Liberal Democrat MP Wera Hobhouse\u0027s Voyeurism Offences Bill, which would have made illegal what the Prime Minister branded an \"invasive\" and \"degrading\" act she has pledged to revive an attempt to ban it.  The 71-year-old backbencher told the Daily Echo on Sunday: \"I feel a bit sore about being scapegoated over this. The suggestion that I am some kind of pervert is a complete travesty of the truth. It\u0027s defamatory of my character and it\u0027s very depressing some of my colleagues have been perpetuating that in the past 48 hours.\"  Sir Christopher urged the Government to find the \"fastest, fairest and surest passage\" for a bill banning people from taking pictures up someone\u0027s clothing without their consent as he accused ministers of \"hijacking\" backbenchers\u0027 time with the Friday afternoon debate.  But Ms Hobhouse, the MP for Bath, demanded the Tory MP apologise, saying: \u0026ldquoBy objecting to the Bill, Christopher Chope let women in England and Wales down. I, therefore, expect him to make a full apology to all the woman who have been harassed and degraded by this vile practice.  Earlier, Culture Minister Margot James said her Tory colleague had brought their party into disrepute while the Prime Minister expressed her \"disappointment\" at his move.  However, when Mrs May was asked why she had permitted the knighthood of Sir Christopher - who has attempted to block the pardon of the World War Two Enigma code-breaker Alan Turing and the proposed ban on using wild animals in circuses - she seemed taken aback.  The PM said: \u0026ldquoChristopher Chope has been a long-standing Member of Parliament, before adding what was important was not the individual but the Government\u0026rsquos clear intention to get upskirting banned."},{"url":null,"title":"Expert  Iconic Mackintosh building can be saved","story":"              The iconic Mackintosh building can be rebuilt using world-leading digital blueprints of the masterpiece, a leading expert has claimed.  Despite being ravaged by fire at the weekend, leading architectural conservationist, Professor Miles Glendinning, believes the Glasgow School of Art building can be completely restored - it is just a question of finding the money to do it.  Following the fire in 2014, Historic Environment Scotland worked with the school to draw up a digital record of the site using photographs and drawings, with exacting detail down to the nearest millimetre.  Professor Glendinning, director of the Scottish Centre for Conservation Studies, claims this \"astonishing\" record means that despite the damage being far worse this time round, the building is in a much better position for restoration.  Speaking to Good Morning Scotland, he argued that the structure was of such significance that it should be restored, despite the financial barriers.  \"In terms of conservation and restoration, we\u0027re funnily enough a lot better off this time because of a very remarkable recording project that GSA undertook after the last fire,\" he said.  \"The building still exists digitally, even if the inside is for the moment physically absent.  \"It\u0027s a digital recording and reconstruction of the whole building down to the nearest millimetre outside and in, using photos and measured drawings.  \"This is kind of a world first for Scotland and it means the start of the restoration work doesn\u0027t need to involve questions over whether it can be done at all.  \"However bad it looks now, the problem now is not about that, but about when and how it is to be paid for.\"  Professor Glendinning, who chairs architectural conservation at Edinburgh College of Art, said Scotland could look to other countries for examples of ruined buildings being brought back to life - including Germany where a church destroyed during World War II was rebuilt after 50 years.  Frauenkirche in Dresden was reduced to a pile of rubble but was reopened in 2005 after a 10-year restoration project.  Mr Glendinning said: \"As far as the physical damage is concerned, it does look very bad, but it\u0027s not as bad as some other cases we\u0027ve seen in recent history.  \"It\u0027s really a matter of how long it will take and where the money\u0027s going to come from.\"  He added that he would be \"very surprised\" if a decision was taken to demolish the building, saying he believes it is more likely that the existing walls will be reinforced.  \"It may look absolutely daunting at the moment, but there have been a lot of buildings worse than this that have been successfully restored - and they didn\u0027t have this digital record.\"  Fiona Hyslop, cabinet secretary for Culture, Tourism and External Affairs, said she has already been in touch with Historic Environment Scotland about the digitisation and has asked officials there to be involved in looking at possible options for the site.  Speaking on Sunday Politics, she said: \"I\u0027ve asked for Historic Environment Scotland, who have worked very closely with Glasgow School of Art over the last four years, to assess... what might be able to happen going forward.  \"They have world-leading digitisation. They digitally recorded everything within the days and weeks after the last fire.  \"But the severity of this is very serious indeed, so I\u0027m not giving any commitments at this stage.\"  She explained that firefighters are still at the scene and building control staff and fire investigators have not been able to access the building yet.  Ms Hyslop added: \"The Scottish Government stands ready to do what it can to help, as we have done in the past.  \"We\u0027ll have to identify what the possibilities are going forward, but we\u0027ve got to be very realistic.\""},{"url":null,"title":"pupils to benefit from new mentoring scheme","story":"\t\t\t\tMCR Pathways\u0026rsquo Young Scottish Talent initiative will be available to support disadvantaged and care-experienced pupils at St Machar, Banff, Inverurie, Fraserburgh and Peterhead Academies, as well as The Gordon Schools from August.

The North-east is the first area for the nationwide expansion of the programme outside of Glasgow. Aberdeen has the second highest proportion of young people failing to move onto \u0026lsquopositive destinations\u0026rsquo when they leave school.        The Wood Foundation\u0026rsquos UK Director Ali MacLachlan said: \u0026ldquoNurturing young people at this crossroads in their lives is vitally important in terms of supporting them to find the right path to fulfil their potential.\u0026ldquoPeople may be surprised to learn that the North-east has such high rates of young people unable to move onto positive destinations after school. We must harness the potential of these young people to support the current and future economic performance of our region.\u0026ldquoMany of these vulnerable young people lack the stability and support many of us take for granted. This imbalance is something the programme aims to address.\u0026ldquoMCR Pathways has already demonstrated significant impact and we are pleased to support its introduction to the North-east.                                                                                                        The Wood Foundation will be hosting an open event next week to inform potential mentors and business partners about the programme.A mentor meets a young person weekly in their school. They provide a listening ear and supportive voice \u0026ndash a constant adult role model who will build confidence, aspirations and a route to meaningful training or employment. Mentors are trained to guide young people through subject choices, training and professional routes to broaden their mind-sets and realise their potential.One of the opportunities, which requires support from the local business community, is \u0026lsquoTalent Tasters\u0026rsquo \u0026ndash a bite-sized work experience programme showing young people different aspects of industry.Iain MacRitchie of MCR Pathways said: \u0026ldquoA young person\u0026rsquos future should be determined by their potential, never their circumstances. Our mentoring scheme levels the playing field and gives young people structured, enthusiastic and dedicated support to really find a way to realise and achieve their goals as they make that transition from childhood to their adult lives.                                                                                                        \u0026ldquoWe are very proud of what the programme and our young people have achieved to date and we have no doubt the same successes will be realised in the North-east where we have recognised a real need and desire for this support.\u0026lsquoPathways Coordinators\u0026rsquo have been hired for each of the six schools and will begin work after the summer break.

More than 80% of mentored participants have moved onto further education, higher education or employment in sharp contrast to the national figure of 54%.Businessman Iain MacRitchie launched the charity in 2007 after being shocked by a professional experience restructuring a youth care business. While the business health was restored, the poor outcomes for young people remained the same and he realised the need for relationship-based, meaningful support.He commented: \u0026ldquoThat professional experience was a real eye-opener for me, seeing that these young people were not getting the support they needed and nowhere near achieving their potential. I vowed then to do something and have taken time out from my business to make a difference.

A legal battle is ongoing between the Action Group Company and Manx Capital, the investment vehicle and major claimant that took control of the mass legal claim and secured the settlement on behalf of the claimants..In his letter, Mr Clark said that investigations by a Sunday newspaper had raised serious questions about the credibility of the Action Group Company.He has joined parliamentary colleagues including Kevin Hollinrake, Conservative MP and co-chair of the All Party Parliamentary Group on Fair Business Banking in calling for an inquiry.Mr Clark said: \u0026ldquoThis is an issue that was raised with me by a constituent that is directly affected by issues with the settlement agreed with RBS last summer.                                                                                                        \u0026ldquoMany RBS shareholders believe that the rights issue undertaken by RBS in 2008 was promoted on a misleading basis.\u0026ldquoThey believe there were serious omissions of information which should have been brought to the attention of investors.\u0026ldquoThe RBS Shareholders Action Group Company was set up in 2009 purportedly to represent the interests of those investors.\u0026ldquoHowever, since the £200million settlement was agreed, a very small fraction of that sum has been paid out.                                                                                                        \u0026ldquoThere are serious concerns about the Action Group Company and the lack of regulation in place to protect shareholders.\u0026ldquoI have now written to the Justice Secretary to join calls for an investigation into the RBS Shareholders Action Group Company, which should happen as a matter of urgency.

The all-grass farm extends to 500 acres owned, plus 300 acres grass and 364 acres hill rented seasonally, and supports a suckler herd of 320 Salers and Salers cross cows and flock of 200 breeding ewes.                                                    Cows are crossed with Charolais, Salers and Aberdeen-Angus bulls and all calves are either finished on the farm or sold as forward stores, depending on market conditions and available space.        “We run a very commercial operation with a focus on profitability,” says Mr Milne. “We place great emphasis on ease of calving with the aim of achieving a high calving percentage and rearing as many calves as possible.”SBA chairman, Neil McCorkindale, Scammadale, Oban, said the Milne’s reputation for efficiency and the production of quality store and finished cattle made North Bethelnie an ideal venue for Scotland’s Beef Event.“The farm epitomises the North-east’s long-held reputation for the efficient production of high quality beef cattle,” said Mr McCorkindale.Vice-chairman, David Barron, Nether Aden, Mintlaw, who will chair the organising committee, said he was delighted the Milne family had kindly agreed to host the event.                                                                                                        “North Bethelnie will be a great draw for beef farmers throughout Scotland and further afield,” he said.Organisation will be in the hands of Natalie Cormack who has acted as organiser for the last two Scotttish beef events, at Mains of Mause, Blairgowrie, in 2015 and Fans, Earlston, in 2017.Sponsorship and trade stand enquiries are invited now to Natalie Cormack, Organiser, Scotland’s Beef Event 2019, Dairy Cottage, Tower Road, Ayton, Berwickshire, TD14 5QX.

Isobel Campbell (missing from photo) makes up the team.THE 70-plus volunteers working for Befriending Caithness have been praised for their commitment as the organisation continues to expand.\u0026nbspIt now has groups running throughout Caithness and into north Sutherland and there is a growing waiting list for the service which aims to tackle isolation and loneliness.Speaking during Volunteers\u0026rsquo Week, Befriending Caithness senior co-ordinator Angie House said: \u0026ldquoThis is an opportunity to say thank you very much to all our volunteers for all that they do and to raise awareness of what Befriending Caithness is about.\u0026ldquoAcknowledging what our volunteers do is really important, as we couldn\u0026rsquot work without them.Their role involves being matched with a befriendee, meeting up for at least one hour a week, hearing about their experiences and enhancing their lives.\u0026ldquoThe generosity of some people\u0026rsquos time is absolutely amazing, Angie said. \u0026ldquoOur volunteers show an absolutely tremendous commitment and do over and above what they\u0026rsquore supposed to do.For example, one befriendee had lived in India as a child so her befriender did some research and brought a map in to her. She was delighted someone wanted to hear her story.Befriending Caithness \u0026ndash part of Caithness Voluntary Group \u0026ndash now has groups in Wick, Thurso, Mey, Berriedale and Bettyhill. Mey is especially popular, with befriendees meeting from across the county every couple of months for soup and sandwiches, where there is a \u0026ldquoconstant buzz of chatter, like music. It\u0026rsquos lovely to hear, Angie said.The intergenerational group involves S5/S6 school pupils visiting hospitals and care homes. One befriendee said these befrienders are \u0026ldquolike young relations.The benefits of this are twofold. As well as keeping the befriendees company, it gets the young befriendees into the voluntary mind-set early on, encourages them to become more empathetic and confident and it shows they can make a difference.Befriendees also benefit from regular contact with people \u0026ldquoso they feel as though they\u0026rsquore part of the community, according to befriending co-ordinator Elspeth Manson.Angie added: \u0026ldquoHelping someone recognise their worth is a benefit for both the befriendee and the volunteer.The recruitment procedure includes volunteers receiving Protecting Vulnerable Groups (PVG) clearance and providing three references. Once accepted, training includes support from other groups such as stroke awareness, Hearing and Sight Care and Parkinson\u0026rsquos awareness.Befriending Caithness is not a standalone organisation \u0026ndash it is helped by the community.An event to look out for is a fashion show at M\u0026ampCo in Thurso on June 28, starting at 7pm. Tickets cost \u0026pound5 and this will go towards the July summer lunch.As well as being greatly appreciated by co-ordinators, the joy felt by the befriendees is evident. Co-ordinator Isobel Campbell shared a few, including \u0026ldquobefriending has saved my life, \u0026ldquohaving a befriender would be a luxury and \u0026ldquobefriending is a cup of kindness.One volunteer remarked: \u0026ldquoI just love a laugh and the banter.Befriending Caithness is looking for a volunteer marketing/social media intern. Anyone interested is asked to contact Angie at angie@cvg.org.uk or call 01955 609962.Volunteers\u0026rsquo Week takes place from June 1-7 every year.window._taboola = window._taboola || []_taboola.push({mode:\u0027autosized-generated-2r\u0027, container:\u0027taboola-below-main-column\u0027, placement:\u0027below-main-column\u0027})\t\t\t\t\tMore storieswindow._taboola = window._taboola || []_taboola.push({mode: \u0027thumbnails-d\u0027,container: \u0027taboola-below-article-thumbnails\u0027,placement: \u0027Below Article Thumbnails\u0027,target_type: \u0027mix\u0027})\t\t\t\t\tQuick LinksFamily NoticesPropertyJobsMotorsBusiness FinderPhoto SalesSubscriptionse-editionDatingTop 25 Days OutHighlands ExplorerNewsSportFeaturesYour CaithnessHighland HeroesWhat\u0027s OnMusicFilmTravel and TransportWeatherJohn O\u0027Groat JournalFollow us on  Sunday 17 Jun 2018 8:39 PMvar addthis_config = {data_ga_property: \u0027UA-25496687-7\u0027}\u0026nbspif (window.adgroupid == undefined) {window.adgroupid = Math.round(Math.random() * 1000)}document.write(\u0027\u0027)//--if (window.adgroupid == undefined) {window.adgroupid = Math.round(Math.random() * 1000)}document.write(\u0027\u0027)//--document.write(\u0027\u0027)//--border=\"0\"if (window.adgroupid == undefined) {window.adgroupid = Math.round(Math.random() * 1000)}document.write(\u0027\u0027)//--document.write(\u0027\u0027)//--border=\"0\"if (window.adgroupid == undefined) {window.adgroupid = Math.round(Math.random() * 1000)}document.write(\u0027\u0027)//--document.write(\u0027\u0027)//--border=\"0\"window.___gcfg = { lang: \u0027en-GB\u0027 }(function() {var po = document.createElement(\u0027script\u0027) po.type = \u0027text/javascript\u0027 po.async = truepo.src = \u0027https://apis.google/js/plusone.js\u0027var s = document.getElementsByTagName(\u0027script\u0027)[0] s.parentNode.insertBefore(po, s)})()MOST COMMENTSMOST POPULARFury over threat to John O\u0027Groats bus link\u0027I wanted to do it for my mum\u0027 says Old Man of Hoy climber Edward (8)Councillor Donnie Mackay joins ConservativesNorth MP calls for action from Sturgeon and May over town centre decline Author takes a road trip through history at Wick illustrated talkJune vents its rage on CaithnessLewis shines for Scotland in CanadaJohn O\u0027Groats go the distance to reach last fourStaxigoe keep their eye on a cup final boostBus users voice concern at threat to \u0027lifeline service\u0027 between Wick and John O\u0027GroatsMarc\u0027s Croatia role gives Caithness a World Cup connectionAuthor takes a road trip through history at Wick illustrated talkBus users voice concern at threat to \u0027lifeline service\u0027 between Wick and John O\u0027GroatsSpecial delivery for retiring Lybster postieJune vents its rage on CaithnessNorth MP calls for action from Sturgeon and May over town centre decline Man dies following collision on A836\u0027I wanted to do it for my mum\u0027 says Old Man of Hoy climber Edward (8)Fury over threat to John O\u0027Groats bus linkNew posts will help hospital patients(function(d, s, id) {var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]if (d.getElementById(id)) {return}js = d.createElement(s) js.id = idjs.src = \"//connect.facebook.net/en_US/all.js#xfbml=1\"fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs)}(document, \u0027script\u0027, \u0027facebook-jssdk\u0027))\u0026nbspFollow @GroatNews property-northBuying, selling or renting - we\u0027ve got it coveredjobs-northLooking for a job?

When he left the club and took over the national team he asked me to come help with a few bits, and from there I\u0026rsquove been working with the team since November 2017.\u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom not based in Croatia. I only come into the country for the preparations and matches, but when I\u0026rsquom there everyone is very friendly and welcoming.\u0026ldquoThe language is very difficult but luckily most of the team and all the staff speak English. Croatia is a beautiful country and the food is delicious so it\u0026rsquos always a pleasure to go over.\u0026ldquoWhen I\u0026rsquom there you see the culture is a strong passionate people but they are also very considerate and well mannered in general, with everyone happy to help each other out.\u0026ldquoIn my current role I am responsible for the gathering and compiling of our information to share with the coaching staff on the opposition and our own performances and training sessions, then to make that information available through video and written documents.\u0026ldquoWe record all our performances in training through GPS and video and then feed that back each night. Along with this we look to prepare our team through use of video meetings and documents on the opposite team.\u0026ldquoMy role is very much a support role for the coaches where I produce information so they can make the best and most informed decisions.\u0026ldquoThe post-match sessions are used to highlight areas which we can improve and the players are very professional and take this on board and process it into better performances where required next time.\u0026ldquoAs for Croatia\u0026rsquos World Cup campaign, the process began when we saw the draw for the group stages and we\u0026rsquove been building to now since then.Marc says a large chunk of his success has come down to the support of family and friends back home in Caithness.His grannies Nanette Plowman (Wick) and Lilian Campbell (Castletown) both still live in Caithness.Marc added: \u0026ldquoAll of my grandparents and my mum have been very supportive of me throughout my life and have always encouraged me to continue to do better. We speak each week and they always give me a boost in energy through encouragement.\u0026ldquoI always know they are there to support me and my little family and we are forever grateful for their love and support.\u0026ldquoPlus all of my aunts, uncles and cousins have also had an influence in who I am and what I do today. I have a few friends still around Caithness.\u0026ldquoI used to come up and play football at the garages in Papigoe or in Castletown, I would jump the neighbours\u0026rsquo wall and have a kick-about with the boys next door. It\u0026rsquos from experiences like this that I have developed a deep passion for football and a love of the game.window._taboola = window._taboola || []_taboola.push({mode:\u0027autosized-generated-2r\u0027, container:\u0027taboola-below-main-column\u0027, placement:\u0027below-main-column\u0027})\t\t\t\t\tMore storieswindow._taboola = window._taboola || []_taboola.push({mode: \u0027thumbnails-d\u0027,container: \u0027taboola-below-article-thumbnails\u0027,placement: \u0027Below Article Thumbnails\u0027,target_type: \u0027mix\u0027})\t\t\t\t\tQuick LinksFamily NoticesPropertyJobsMotorsBusiness FinderPhoto SalesSubscriptionse-editionDatingTop 25 Days OutHighlands ExplorerNewsSportFeaturesYour CaithnessHighland HeroesWhat\u0027s OnMusicFilmTravel and TransportWeatherJohn O\u0027Groat JournalFollow us on  Sunday 17 Jun 2018 8:39 PMvar addthis_config = {data_ga_property: \u0027UA-25496687-7\u0027}\u0026nbspif (window.adgroupid == undefined) {window.adgroupid = Math.round(Math.random() * 1000)}document.write(\u0027\u0027)//--if (window.adgroupid == undefined) {window.adgroupid = Math.round(Math.random() * 1000)}document.write(\u0027\u0027)//--document.write(\u0027\u0027)//--border=\"0\"if (window.adgroupid == undefined) {window.adgroupid = Math.round(Math.random() * 1000)}document.write(\u0027\u0027)//--document.write(\u0027\u0027)//--border=\"0\"if (window.adgroupid == undefined) {window.adgroupid = Math.round(Math.random() * 1000)}document.write(\u0027\u0027)//--document.write(\u0027\u0027)//--border=\"0\"window.___gcfg = { lang: \u0027en-GB\u0027 }(function() {var po = document.createElement(\u0027script\u0027) po.type = \u0027text/javascript\u0027 po.async = truepo.src = \u0027https://apis.google/js/plusone.js\u0027var s = document.getElementsByTagName(\u0027script\u0027)[0] s.parentNode.insertBefore(po, s)})()MOST COMMENTSMOST POPULARFury over threat to John O\u0027Groats bus link\u0027I wanted to do it for my mum\u0027 says Old Man of Hoy climber Edward (8)Councillor Donnie Mackay joins ConservativesNorth MP calls for action from Sturgeon and May over town centre decline Author takes a road trip through history at Wick illustrated talkJune vents its rage on CaithnessLewis shines for Scotland in CanadaJohn O\u0027Groats go the distance to reach last fourStaxigoe keep their eye on a cup final boostBus users voice concern at threat to \u0027lifeline service\u0027 between Wick and John O\u0027GroatsMarc\u0027s Croatia role gives Caithness a World Cup connectionAuthor takes a road trip through history at Wick illustrated talkBus users voice concern at threat to \u0027lifeline service\u0027 between Wick and John O\u0027GroatsSpecial delivery for retiring Lybster postieJune vents its rage on CaithnessNorth MP calls for action from Sturgeon and May over town centre decline Man dies following collision on A836\u0027I wanted to do it for my mum\u0027 says Old Man of Hoy climber Edward (8)Fury over threat to John O\u0027Groats bus linkNew posts will help hospital patients(function(d, s, id) {var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]if (d.getElementById(id)) {return}js = d.createElement(s) js.id = idjs.src = \"//connect.facebook.net/en_US/all.js#xfbml=1\"fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs)}(document, \u0027script\u0027, \u0027facebook-jssdk\u0027))\u0026nbspFollow @GroatNews property-northBuying, selling or renting - we\u0027ve got it coveredjobs-northLooking for a job?

Few local high street businesses remain in Tain, Mr Stone\u0026rsquos home town.\u0026ldquoThe presence of these empty and increasingly derelict properties undermines one of the most important industries of the Highlands \u0026ndash namely tourism, he says.\u0026ldquoI would therefore suggest that properly tackling this problem should now be one of the most urgent issues for both the UK and Scottish governments.\u0026ldquoThis problem can no longer be ducked by plans that turn out to be more about words than actions \u0026ndash or, worse still, by means of the argument that the decline in the UK\u0026rsquos high street retail sector is inevitable.\u0026ldquoIf we really value our communities and their built heritage, then we must use every means at our disposal \u0026ndash grants, infrastructure investment, tax breaks, local and national planning \u0026ndash so that we can find new ways of bringing these buildings back into sustainable use.Speaking yesterday, Mr Stone said: \u0026ldquoIt pains me greatly to see what is happening, and also to witness nothing better than fine words and hand-wringing when it comes to tackling the problem.\u0026ldquoThis letter is my first move in a campaign that I am going to pursue with the greatest vigour. Tain is my home town and I care about it \u0026ndash and the same is true of the other communities that I have the honour to represent.window._taboola = window._taboola || []_taboola.push({mode:\u0027autosized-generated-2r\u0027, container:\u0027taboola-below-main-column\u0027, placement:\u0027below-main-column\u0027})\t\t\t\t\tMore storieswindow._taboola = window._taboola || []_taboola.push({mode: \u0027thumbnails-d\u0027,container: \u0027taboola-below-article-thumbnails\u0027,placement: \u0027Below Article Thumbnails\u0027,target_type: \u0027mix\u0027})\t\t\t\t\tQuick LinksFamily NoticesPropertyJobsMotorsBusiness FinderPhoto SalesSubscriptionse-editionDatingTop 25 Days OutHighlands ExplorerNewsSportFeaturesYour CaithnessHighland HeroesWhat\u0027s OnMusicFilmTravel and TransportWeatherJohn O\u0027Groat JournalFollow us on  Sunday 17 Jun 2018 8:39 PMvar addthis_config = {data_ga_property: \u0027UA-25496687-7\u0027}\u0026nbspif (window.adgroupid == undefined) {window.adgroupid = Math.round(Math.random() * 1000)}document.write(\u0027\u0027)//--if (window.adgroupid == undefined) {window.adgroupid = Math.round(Math.random() * 1000)}document.write(\u0027\u0027)//--document.write(\u0027\u0027)//--border=\"0\"if (window.adgroupid == undefined) {window.adgroupid = Math.round(Math.random() * 1000)}document.write(\u0027\u0027)//--document.write(\u0027\u0027)//--border=\"0\"if (window.adgroupid == undefined) {window.adgroupid = Math.round(Math.random() * 1000)}document.write(\u0027\u0027)//--document.write(\u0027\u0027)//--border=\"0\"window.___gcfg = { lang: \u0027en-GB\u0027 }(function() {var po = document.createElement(\u0027script\u0027) po.type = \u0027text/javascript\u0027 po.async = truepo.src = \u0027https://apis.google/js/plusone.js\u0027var s = document.getElementsByTagName(\u0027script\u0027)[0] s.parentNode.insertBefore(po, s)})()MOST COMMENTSMOST POPULARFury over threat to John O\u0027Groats bus link\u0027I wanted to do it for my mum\u0027 says Old Man of Hoy climber Edward (8)Councillor Donnie Mackay joins ConservativesNorth MP calls for action from Sturgeon and May over town centre decline Author takes a road trip through history at Wick illustrated talkJune vents its rage on CaithnessLewis shines for Scotland in CanadaJohn O\u0027Groats go the distance to reach last fourStaxigoe keep their eye on a cup final boostBus users voice concern at threat to \u0027lifeline service\u0027 between Wick and John O\u0027GroatsMarc\u0027s Croatia role gives Caithness a World Cup connectionAuthor takes a road trip through history at Wick illustrated talkBus users voice concern at threat to \u0027lifeline service\u0027 between Wick and John O\u0027GroatsSpecial delivery for retiring Lybster postieJune vents its rage on CaithnessNorth MP calls for action from Sturgeon and May over town centre decline Man dies following collision on A836\u0027I wanted to do it for my mum\u0027 says Old Man of Hoy climber Edward (8)Fury over threat to John O\u0027Groats bus linkNew posts will help hospital patients(function(d, s, id) {var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]if (d.getElementById(id)) {return}js = d.createElement(s) js.id = idjs.src = \"//connect.facebook.net/en_US/all.js#xfbml=1\"fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs)}(document, \u0027script\u0027, \u0027facebook-jssdk\u0027))\u0026nbspFollow @GroatNews property-northBuying, selling or renting - we\u0027ve got it coveredjobs-northLooking for a job?

Making the presentation is Duncan Winfield (right) accompanied by wife Gail (left). Pic: Marshall BowmanWELL-known Lybster postie Murray Smythe has retired after 30 years on his rounds serving the communities of south-east Caithness.\u0026nbspHe started in 1988, taking over from another postie who was a familiar figure to a certain generation, Donnie Bremner from Mid-Clyth.Thirty years ago Murray had to go over the Ord to Helmsdale to meet the train north to collect the mail then take it to the local sorting offices in Dunbeath and Lybster. All the small local post offices and all the postboxes between Berriedale and Lybster had to have the mail uplifted on this run.Now two trucks each morning bring the mail north from Inverness and Murray has been working mainly, since these changes, on the rural run through Occumster, Roster, Clyth, Bruan and Ulbster.Murray frequently found himself stuck in snow in past winters and has been rescued by farmers pulling him out of drifts in the rural hinterland of south-east Caithness.He served under three postmasters in Lybster \u0026ndash firstly as a part-time postie as well as being a fisherman under the late Hugh Gunn, whose father before him had been the Lybster postmaster. After Hugh retired, Des and the late Mary Somerville took over before handing over to the present incumbent, Duncan Winfield, and wife Gail.One incident in particular has stayed with Murray and harks back to his early days on his rounds. When arriving at the late Annie Bain\u0026rsquos place on the Smerlie road he was implored to catch a ewe that had got loose.Murray jumped the fence and caught it as Annie almost simultaneously thrust her arm up its rear to pull out a new lamb and straight back in for another.After a quick wipe down of the livestock he was then asked if there was anything in the post, almost as if nothing had happened in the previous five minutes. Murray duly delivered Annie\u0026rsquos mail having firstly helped with the other delivery, and on to his next stop.A collection was taken in Lybster Post Office and the money was handed over by local postmaster Duncan Winfield accompanied by wife Gail in a small ceremony on June 6.window._taboola = window._taboola || []_taboola.push({mode:\u0027autosized-generated-2r\u0027, container:\u0027taboola-below-main-column\u0027, placement:\u0027below-main-column\u0027})\t\t\t\t\tMore storieswindow._taboola = window._taboola || []_taboola.push({mode: \u0027thumbnails-d\u0027,container: \u0027taboola-below-article-thumbnails\u0027,placement: \u0027Below Article Thumbnails\u0027,target_type: \u0027mix\u0027})\t\t\t\t\tQuick LinksFamily NoticesPropertyJobsMotorsBusiness FinderPhoto SalesSubscriptionse-editionDatingTop 25 Days OutHighlands ExplorerNewsSportFeaturesYour CaithnessHighland HeroesWhat\u0027s OnMusicFilmTravel and TransportWeatherJohn O\u0027Groat JournalFollow us on  Sunday 17 Jun 2018 8:39 PMvar addthis_config = {data_ga_property: \u0027UA-25496687-7\u0027}\u0026nbspif (window.adgroupid == undefined) {window.adgroupid = Math.round(Math.random() * 1000)}document.write(\u0027\u0027)//--if (window.adgroupid == undefined) {window.adgroupid = Math.round(Math.random() * 1000)}document.write(\u0027\u0027)//--document.write(\u0027\u0027)//--border=\"0\"if (window.adgroupid == undefined) {window.adgroupid = Math.round(Math.random() * 1000)}document.write(\u0027\u0027)//--document.write(\u0027\u0027)//--border=\"0\"if (window.adgroupid == undefined) {window.adgroupid = Math.round(Math.random() * 1000)}document.write(\u0027\u0027)//--document.write(\u0027\u0027)//--border=\"0\"window.___gcfg = { lang: \u0027en-GB\u0027 }(function() {var po = document.createElement(\u0027script\u0027) po.type = \u0027text/javascript\u0027 po.async = truepo.src = \u0027https://apis.google/js/plusone.js\u0027var s = document.getElementsByTagName(\u0027script\u0027)[0] s.parentNode.insertBefore(po, s)})()MOST COMMENTSMOST POPULARFury over threat to John O\u0027Groats bus link\u0027I wanted to do it for my mum\u0027 says Old Man of Hoy climber Edward (8)Councillor Donnie Mackay joins ConservativesNorth MP calls for action from Sturgeon and May over town centre decline Author takes a road trip through history at Wick illustrated talkJune vents its rage on CaithnessLewis shines for Scotland in CanadaJohn O\u0027Groats go the distance to reach last fourStaxigoe keep their eye on a cup final boostBus users voice concern at threat to \u0027lifeline service\u0027 between Wick and John O\u0027GroatsMarc\u0027s Croatia role gives Caithness a World Cup connectionAuthor takes a road trip through history at Wick illustrated talkBus users voice concern at threat to \u0027lifeline service\u0027 between Wick and John O\u0027GroatsSpecial delivery for retiring Lybster postieJune vents its rage on CaithnessNorth MP calls for action from Sturgeon and May over town centre decline Man dies following collision on A836\u0027I wanted to do it for my mum\u0027 says Old Man of Hoy climber Edward (8)Fury over threat to John O\u0027Groats bus linkNew posts will help hospital patients(function(d, s, id) {var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]if (d.getElementById(id)) {return}js = d.createElement(s) js.id = idjs.src = \"//connect.facebook.net/en_US/all.js#xfbml=1\"fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs)}(document, \u0027script\u0027, \u0027facebook-jssdk\u0027))\u0026nbspFollow @GroatNews property-northBuying, selling or renting - we\u0027ve got it coveredjobs-northLooking for a job?

We\u0026rsquore getting a lot of Australians in at the moment.\u0026ldquoOne thing we would like to get more of is local people. It\u0026rsquos great that we get these visitors from all over the world, and many of them have Caithness connections and they come on that basis, but it would be nice to get more local people.\u0026ldquoOur open day on January 2 was a good start in that respect because it opened the door to people from the local area to come and see what we have.\u0026ldquoA number have come back on the basis of that.\u0026ldquoThe local people are very supportive of the Wick Society. Everything in this museum is donated by people who either live locally or have connections with this place.\u0026ldquoI mentioned at the AGM about the amount of donations that we get in monetary terms. That\u0026rsquos considerable, from local businesses and local people. Some of those are also in-kind donations, certainly in terms of the boat section \u0026ndash they get quite a lot of in-kind help from businesses around the harbour.\u0026ldquoSo, while we would like more local people to come in through our doors and appreciate what we\u0026rsquove got here, it\u0026rsquos not a criticism of the local people because they are very, very supportive.He added: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos an honour to be part of the Wick Society and to be part of its development.\u0026ldquoWe have a number of plans in place for things we want to do. We\u0026rsquove achieved quite a lot in the last couple of years and we\u0026rsquore looking forward to continuing that.The Wick Society will be supporting the Industrial Archaeology Conference taking place from June 22-27. It will cover many aspects of industrial heritage in Caithness, including talks, tours, an exhibition and a visit to Orkney.\u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore involved in that on two fronts, Mr Leith said. \u0026ldquoThe Johnston photographic collection is having a display in Caithness Horizons throughout the month of June but Wick Heritage Museum will also host some of the tours as part of the conference programme.\u0026ldquoWe will open our doors at appropriate times to let delegates see the museum.window._taboola = window._taboola || []_taboola.push({mode:\u0027autosized-generated-2r\u0027, container:\u0027taboola-below-main-column\u0027, placement:\u0027below-main-column\u0027})\t\t\t\t\tMore storieswindow._taboola = window._taboola || []_taboola.push({mode: \u0027thumbnails-d\u0027,container: \u0027taboola-below-article-thumbnails\u0027,placement: \u0027Below Article Thumbnails\u0027,target_type: \u0027mix\u0027})\t\t\t\t\tQuick LinksFamily NoticesPropertyJobsMotorsBusiness FinderPhoto SalesSubscriptionse-editionDatingTop 25 Days OutHighlands ExplorerNewsSportFeaturesYour CaithnessHighland HeroesWhat\u0027s OnMusicFilmTravel and TransportWeatherJohn O\u0027Groat JournalFollow us on  Sunday 17 Jun 2018 8:40 PMvar addthis_config = {data_ga_property: \u0027UA-25496687-7\u0027}\u0026nbspif (window.adgroupid == undefined) {window.adgroupid = Math.round(Math.random() * 1000)}document.write(\u0027\u0027)//--if (window.adgroupid == undefined) {window.adgroupid = Math.round(Math.random() * 1000)}document.write(\u0027\u0027)//--document.write(\u0027\u0027)//--border=\"0\"if (window.adgroupid == undefined) {window.adgroupid = Math.round(Math.random() * 1000)}document.write(\u0027\u0027)//--document.write(\u0027\u0027)//--border=\"0\"if (window.adgroupid == undefined) {window.adgroupid = Math.round(Math.random() * 1000)}document.write(\u0027\u0027)//--document.write(\u0027\u0027)//--border=\"0\"window.___gcfg = { lang: \u0027en-GB\u0027 }(function() {var po = document.createElement(\u0027script\u0027) po.type = \u0027text/javascript\u0027 po.async = truepo.src = \u0027https://apis.google/js/plusone.js\u0027var s = document.getElementsByTagName(\u0027script\u0027)[0] s.parentNode.insertBefore(po, s)})()MOST COMMENTSMOST POPULARFury over threat to John O\u0027Groats bus link\u0027I wanted to do it for my mum\u0027 says Old Man of Hoy climber Edward (8)Councillor Donnie Mackay joins ConservativesNorth MP calls for action from Sturgeon and May over town centre decline Author takes a road trip through history at Wick illustrated talkJune vents its rage on CaithnessLewis shines for Scotland in CanadaJohn O\u0027Groats go the distance to reach last fourStaxigoe keep their eye on a cup final boostBus users voice concern at threat to \u0027lifeline service\u0027 between Wick and John O\u0027GroatsMarc\u0027s Croatia role gives Caithness a World Cup connectionAuthor takes a road trip through history at Wick illustrated talkBus users voice concern at threat to \u0027lifeline service\u0027 between Wick and John O\u0027GroatsSpecial delivery for retiring Lybster postieJune vents its rage on CaithnessNorth MP calls for action from Sturgeon and May over town centre decline Man dies following collision on A836\u0027I wanted to do it for my mum\u0027 says Old Man of Hoy climber Edward (8)Fury over threat to John O\u0027Groats bus linkNew posts will help hospital patients(function(d, s, id) {var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]if (d.getElementById(id)) {return}js = d.createElement(s) js.id = idjs.src = \"//connect.facebook.net/en_US/all.js#xfbml=1\"fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs)}(document, \u0027script\u0027, \u0027facebook-jssdk\u0027))\u0026nbspFollow @GroatNews property-northBuying, selling or renting - we\u0027ve got it coveredjobs-northLooking for a job?

Picture: Robert MacDonald / Northern StudiosThe memorial overlooking the town\u0026rsquos harbour has been refurbished by John Hood \u0026amp Son (Sculptors) and paid for by local building firm MM Miller.\u0026nbspThe Wick Paths Group, which was instrumental in getting the work at the memorial under way, plans to place an interpretive panel at the site telling people about the work Bremner carried out.Group secretary John Bogle said: \u0026ldquoThere are a wealth of stories about James Bremner. I\u0026rsquom sure there are a lot of people who won\u0026rsquot know them.He explained that only the base of the memorial, which was erected in 1903, was still to be refurbished with the interpretation panels set to complete the whole project.The path along by the memorial is on the Wick section of the John O\u0026rsquoGroats Trail, a 147-mile route from Inverness.Mr Bogle pointed out that interpretation panels were already in place on the stretch of the trail through Wick, with one at the Trinkie. However, two existing panels are being moved to the Braehead and North Head.He said the paths were already proving popular with local people and visitors and the group is keen to provide information about the area.Mr Bogle added that the civil engineer\u0026rsquos gravestone \u0026ndash in the graveyard of Wick St Fergus Church \u0026ndash had also been tidied up recently.Wick Harbour Authority chairman Willie Watt MBE said: \u0026ldquoFor me James Bremner is one of the unsung heroes of Caithness. He is just an amazing character. Nothing was too difficult for him and he treated everybody he worked with the greatest of respect. He was a great leader and motivator.Mr Watt pointed out that one of the Wick engineer\u0026rsquos greatest achievements was the refloating of the SS Great Britain \u0026ndash the largest ship of its time \u0026ndash when she ran aground off Ireland in the 1840s.He said that Mr Bremner was sent for from Wick, along with a few of his men, when other engineers had failed in one of the biggest salvage operations of that era.James Bremner (1784-1856) was born at Stain, Keiss. He was an apprentice in a Greenock shipyard and returned to Wick to establish his own shipbuilding business, constructing over 50 vessels in as many years as well as designing and building many harbours. He was involved in the construction of the breakwater at Wick harbour.A local author, John Mowat, once described Mr Bremner as \u0026ldquothe Ulysses of the north and \u0026ldquoour greatest Caithnessian.Mr Bremner is still remembered in Keiss with a plaque at the harbour erected by the Institution of Civil Engineers.window._taboola = window._taboola || []_taboola.push({mode:\u0027autosized-generated-2r\u0027, container:\u0027taboola-below-main-column\u0027, placement:\u0027below-main-column\u0027})\t\t\t\t\tMore storieswindow._taboola = window._taboola || []_taboola.push({mode: \u0027thumbnails-d\u0027,container: \u0027taboola-below-article-thumbnails\u0027,placement: \u0027Below Article Thumbnails\u0027,target_type: \u0027mix\u0027})\t\t\t\t\tQuick LinksFamily NoticesPropertyJobsMotorsBusiness FinderPhoto SalesSubscriptionse-editionDatingTop 25 Days OutHighlands ExplorerNewsSportFeaturesYour CaithnessHighland HeroesWhat\u0027s OnMusicFilmTravel and TransportWeatherJohn O\u0027Groat JournalFollow us on  Sunday 17 Jun 2018 8:40 PMvar addthis_config = {data_ga_property: \u0027UA-25496687-7\u0027}\u0026nbspif (window.adgroupid == undefined) {window.adgroupid = Math.round(Math.random() * 1000)}document.write(\u0027\u0027)//--if (window.adgroupid == undefined) {window.adgroupid = Math.round(Math.random() * 1000)}document.write(\u0027\u0027)//--document.write(\u0027\u0027)//--border=\"0\"if (window.adgroupid == undefined) {window.adgroupid = Math.round(Math.random() * 1000)}document.write(\u0027\u0027)//--document.write(\u0027\u0027)//--border=\"0\"if (window.adgroupid == undefined) {window.adgroupid = Math.round(Math.random() * 1000)}document.write(\u0027\u0027)//--document.write(\u0027\u0027)//--border=\"0\"window.___gcfg = { lang: \u0027en-GB\u0027 }(function() {var po = document.createElement(\u0027script\u0027) po.type = \u0027text/javascript\u0027 po.async = truepo.src = \u0027https://apis.google/js/plusone.js\u0027var s = document.getElementsByTagName(\u0027script\u0027)[0] s.parentNode.insertBefore(po, s)})()MOST COMMENTSMOST POPULARFury over threat to John O\u0027Groats bus link\u0027I wanted to do it for my mum\u0027 says Old Man of Hoy climber Edward (8)Councillor Donnie Mackay joins ConservativesNorth MP calls for action from Sturgeon and May over town centre decline Author takes a road trip through history at Wick illustrated talkJune vents its rage on CaithnessLewis shines for Scotland in CanadaJohn O\u0027Groats go the distance to reach last fourStaxigoe keep their eye on a cup final boostBus users voice concern at threat to \u0027lifeline service\u0027 between Wick and John O\u0027GroatsMarc\u0027s Croatia role gives Caithness a World Cup connectionAuthor takes a road trip through history at Wick illustrated talkBus users voice concern at threat to \u0027lifeline service\u0027 between Wick and John O\u0027GroatsSpecial delivery for retiring Lybster postieJune vents its rage on CaithnessNorth MP calls for action from Sturgeon and May over town centre decline Man dies following collision on A836\u0027I wanted to do it for my mum\u0027 says Old Man of Hoy climber Edward (8)Fury over threat to John O\u0027Groats bus linkNew posts will help hospital patients(function(d, s, id) {var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]if (d.getElementById(id)) {return}js = d.createElement(s) js.id = idjs.src = \"//connect.facebook.net/en_US/all.js#xfbml=1\"fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs)}(document, \u0027script\u0027, \u0027facebook-jssdk\u0027))\u0026nbspFollow @GroatNews property-northBuying, selling or renting - we\u0027ve got it coveredjobs-northLooking for a job?
