Nilsen (pictured) wife of Man Utd\u0027s Victor Lindelof are staying at the Renaissance with the England teamEngland\u0027s players will be staying in the same hotel as the Swedish WAGs ahead of tomorrow\u0027s World Cup quarter final, MailOnline can reveal.Harry Kane and his teammates will sleep in the 196-room Renaissance in Samara where Sweden\u0027s wives and girlfriends will also be staying.But the Swedes are bragging they already have the edge after they were booked into Samara\u0027s only five-star resort - leaving England in a more modest four-star hotel. Sweden\u0027s FA President Karl-Erik Nilsson joked: \u0027You could say Sweden is one-zero up already.\u0027  His countrymen are in the Lotte Hotel, which opened in April, and is the best hotel in the area.   The hotel\u0027s sumptuous  fine food menu lists the amount of calories contained in each item for weight watchers - which even has its own caviar menu where a spoonful of Stugeon is available for £71 and a lesser \u0027Pike\u0027 variety for £16.Their players can also tuck into tuna with chukka seaweed salad, crab cake with tomato salsa, roast duck, creme of pumpkin soup with Kamchatka crab and cream cheese and tiger shrimp and scallop brochettes and a filet Mignion steak.          Harry Kane and his teammates will sleep in the 196-room Renaissance (pictured) in Samara where Sweden\u0027s wives and girlfriends will also be staying          England has been allocated the four-star Renaissance (foyer pictured) Hotel in Samara while their World Cup quarter final opponents are staying at the town\u0027s only five star resort           Sweden are crowing to have been allocated better accommodation than their rivals. Their FA President Karl-Erik Nilsson (left) joked: \u0027You could say Sweden is one-zero up already.\u0027Rebekah Vardy reveals the England sex ban has been lifted...Share this articleThe country\u0027s FA general secretary Hakan Sjostrand chuckled: \u0027Yes we also have caviar on the menu, but that will be OK as long as England have their fish and chips.\u0027 Meanwhile Gareth Southgate\u0027s men will be staying on the outskirts next door to an Ibis hotel with a McDonalds nearby and traffic streaming outside and fridge magnets are on sale in the foyer for  £1.50. The Renaissance offers a range of salads, soups, grilled meat and fish in its \u0027Terrace\u0027 restaurant with its most pricey item being a grilled steak for £22.           England boss Gareth Southgate had no say in the hotel, which was chosen by FIFAHowever, England\u0027s players rarely eat in hotel restaurants and have their own food prepared for them by an official FA chef.The 196-room Renaissance was opened in 2003 with rates starting at £70 a night compared to the more expensive Lotte where the cheapest rooms are £200. But the standard of cotton sheets and the fine food will be forgotten once the teams do battle for a place in the World Cup semi-finals.Mr Nilsson, who was wearing his country\u0027s football short and is a Wolverhampton Wanderers fan, said: \u0027 FIFA chose this hotel. So it is one-zero for us then.\u0027We do have caviar, but I am pretty sure they can manage without caviar and it will be a good game. Otherwise they are welcome to visit us. It will be a fantastic match between two great teams.\u0027He added: \u0027We had Netherlands and France in our (qualifying) group and we beat Italy in a play off. We beat Portugal last year in a friendly.          The Swedes are in the Lotte Hotel (pictured), which opened in April, and is the best hotel in the area where the cheapest rooms available at the moment are £200 per night          The Lotte\u0027s sumptuous fine food on offer even has its own caviar menu where a spoonful of Stugeon is available for £71 and a lesser \u0027Pike\u0027 variety for £16\u0027And we won the group of four here which had Germany in it and we have just beaten Switzerland in Russia who are ranked sixth in the world…why shouldn\u0027t we be confident?\u0027We also have the biggest respect for our opponents. But we go in to the quarter final in a very good mood.\u0027  The Swedish delegation have been privately meeting human and civil rights leaders in Russia and supporting their work. Mr Sjostrand added: \u0027 England have so many good players and they should beat us. But it would be so boring if life was always like that.\u0027He said the Swedish fans would support England if Sweden is knocked out and added: \u0027Harry Kane is a fantastic player and we follow the Premier League in Sweden.    Despite Sweden claiming victory in the battle of the hotels, Gareth Southgate\u0027s men will be hoping for a repeat of their heroics when they beat Colombia on Tuesday (pictured)\u0027I am a Manchester United supporter and one of my daughters is called Ester because of Manchester.\u0027 I also follow Ashley Young , Rashford and Lingard. England have so many good players.He said he expected between 1000 and1500 fans to be in the Samara Arena on Saturday evening to be supporting Sweden.He added \u0027To come here is a challenge because of a lack of flights and it is really expensive.\u0027We had 500-6000 people at our last match because it was in St Petersburg and it not so difficult to travel from Sweden. People came by car and by train through Finland.\u0027We hope for a great match and of course a Swedish victory. But overall, a fair match which will be great for the supporters and enjoyed by the world.\u0027"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/06/10/4DF8318B00000578-5924913-image-a-22_1530869652502.jpg","title":"How Jesse Lingard Englands King Social Media","story":"    This tweet by Jesse Lingard this week assured his place as the king of social media in the England team, whose image has been transformed by players\u0027 use of Instagram and Twitter          He is now turning his footballing and online prowess into a strong brand, based on his distinctive goal celebration, in which he spells out his initials with his hands          He is now busy building a brand around his celebration and his nickname \u0027JLingz\u0027The public\u0027s love of the England team is a million miles from when Sam Allardyce lost his job as England manager  after he was filmed talking to undercover reporters posing as businessmen.Back then, confidence in the national team was at rock bottom.  But now, just two years on, England have rebuilt their public image, thanks to squeaky-clean Gareth Southgate and his squad of fresh-faced young players.Among them is 25-year-old Lingard, who, with four million Instagram followers, is at the head of a group of stars whose social media posts are watched by thousands of young fans.EXCLUSIVE: Sweden\u0027s WAGS will stay at the same hotel as the...EXCLUSIVE: Man dumped by Gareth Southgate\u0027s wife for England...Share this articleA social media hit this week came Jesse filmed fellow young player Trent Alexander-Arnold saying \u0027It\u0027s coming home\u0027 to him on the pitch after the Colombia victory.Lingard has also posted videos of himself dancing in his pants with Ruben Loftus-Cheek in the changing room, being shaved by teammates and celebrating with fans.Such videos give fans a players\u0027 eye view of the World Cup and take supporters inside the England camp in a way never seen before.     He is currently believed to be single after his relationship with Jena Frumes ended in scandal          Jena split from Jesse before tweeting: \u0027At least I can say I tried plus enjoyed the ride\u0027          Lingard and Ms Frumes split up in March after she posed for steamy pictures in his shirtSocial media experts say his and other players\u0027 tweets and videos are building a new image for the national side, totally distinct from the days of \u0027dentist chair\u0027 drinkathons and Graham Taylor\u0027s \u0027turnips\u0027.Former Twitter head of sport Lewis Wiltshire told The Daily Star: \u0027If there is a player who uses Instagram better or more effectively than Jesse Lingard, I\u0027m yet to see them.\u0027These players are from a generation where they understand and enjoy this stuff.\u0027I\u0027m convinced it\u0027s at the heart of why this England team\u0027s public image is different from, say, 10 years ago.\u0027Mr Wiltshire says he doesn\u0027t believe a representative handles Jesse\u0027s social media for him, as with other players, which may be part of its success.The Manchester United midfielder could now use his performances in the World Cup to launch a strong Beckham-like \u0027brand\u0027.He has used Instagram to give fans a players-eye view of the World Cup, including video of him dancing in his pants in the changing room  He stays close to his grandmother and grandfather, who helped get him into football as a childThree weeks before the tournament, Lingard applied for four trademarks, three centred on his nickname \u0027JLingz\u0027 and another featuring his goal celebration, in which he holds his hands in front of his face and spells out his initials.He has since launched a clothing range, including caps, T-shirts and hoodies emblazoned with his goal celebration logo, which have already all sold out on his website jlingz.com.Andy Sutherden, head of sport  marketing at H+K Strategies, told CityAM: \u0027Jesse Lingard\u0027s team has acknowledged the fact that if he does well in Russia, there’s an immediate opportunity but one with a very short shelf life. \u0027They’re also understanding of the fact that people who become known for something different - think Crouch and the robot - extend their marketing appeal beyond the audience of sport.\u0027 Meanwhile, there are rumours that Manchester United bosses are set to increase his wages from £75,000 to £150,000 to keep other clubs from trying to tempt him away.

We believe it to be one of his earlier watercolours.\u0027          Libby Sheldon, pictured, agrees the painting is a genuine TurnerMs Archer-Thompson revealed that cross-border cooperation had resulted in the lost Turner coming to light.She said: \u0027The private collector of the lost Turner watercolour is English.We met him through a Scottish connection, who is another art collector.\u0027\u0027I first saw the painting in March at the collector\u0027s private residence.\u0027He bought the painting a few years ago but has been researching it because he wanted to find out more as he thought there was something special about it.\u0027I knew it was a genuine Turner. I was completely moved when I held it in my hands. It is something to hold it in your hand rather than behind a glass, which is great about my job. This is probably the highlight of my career.\u0027The private collector paid peanuts for it - a two-figure sum - only for a national gem to be discovered.\u0027Extensive archival research was undertaken to build up a case for why this was a genuine Turner painting from his life and time at Abbotsford.Her role was using her expert knowledge in the subject to help the owner unravel the story behind the painting of Scott\u0027s home. Combining that with the scientific study of the painting has enabled Ms Archer-Thompson to make the case.Ms Archer-Thompson is convinced it is a Turner because a pencil sketch, which can only be seen by infra-red imaging reveals the artist\u0027s original sketch. This has been adapated and changed siginficantly in the paint.The type of paper used for the watercolour also matches Turner\u0027s use of materials but the main focus was on the date of the frame and the paint.The scene of the Tuner painting is also found in the engraved commemorative book after Scott\u0027s death.Ms Archer-Thompson added: \u0027Not very long ago another lost Turner watercolour appeared and was sold for £230,000.\u0027The tiny watercolour, which is poket sized, measures at 5.5 inches by 3.5 inches.Libby Sheldon, a painting analyst expert, \u0027supports the theory\u0027 the Turner is a genuine.Ms Archer-Thompson, added: \u0027All of this analysis, including work by painting expert Libby Sheldon, demonstrates that it was executed by an astonishingly skilled hand.\u0027          The painting is believed to have been painted at the Scottish home of Sir Walter Scott, picturedWhen Turner stayed at Scott\u0027s house in August 1831, the writer showed the renowned painter his art collection, amongst which is believed to be a view of Abbotsford and the River Tweed by Scottish artist Elizabeth Nasmyth.Ms Archer-Thompson said: \u0027This painting is from exactly the same vantage point we believe Turner painted.\u0027Scott had a personal attachment to the Nasmyth painting and its composition and my theory is that this gave Turner the idea to compose the same scene, which he based on sketches in the Abbotsford sketchbook used during his visit in 1831.\u0027Abbotsford House Trust chairman James Holloway, a former director of the Scottish National Portrait Gallery in Edinburgh, added: \u0027It is wonderful for Abbotsford to be able to show such a fascinating painting.\u0027It will intrigue and delight our visitors.

Players, such as Dele Alli, have models as girlfriends — in his case one who specialises in lingerie.These are lifestyles and behaviour utterly alien to the wives of 1966.The Football Association even excluded them from the victory champagne reception at London’s Royal Garden Hotel in Kensington. Instead, the wives — and one fiancee — dined separately in the chop house upstairs. Their husbands came up to collect them at around midnight.Kathleen Peters, the wife of midfielder Martin Peters, said: ‘We were overwhelmed and just sat in the hotel room, staring at his medal like two kids. We didn’t even drink champagne — I think I made us a cup of tea.’One wife was absent, Jack Charlton’s wife Pat, who — now 83 — likes to joke that she is the ‘oldest WAG in the world’.She watched the World Cup Final on a black-and-white TV in her modest semi-detached house in Leeds with her mother. ‘Of course we were very proud of them, but we were not involved like the wives and girlfriends are these days at all,’ she says.          WAGs on a night out in St Petersburg. From left: Millie Savage, Gemma Acton, Megan Davison, Becky Vardy, Annabel Peyton, Fern Hawkins, Shannon Horlock, Annie Kilner and Lucia LoiLike current England captain Harry Kane’s fiancee, Katie Goodland, Pat was pregnant and opted to stay at home for medical reasons. ‘I watched it at home because I was about to have a baby. I already had two children.‘I wanted to go to the final, but the medical advice was against it and you don’t want to go into labour in the middle of the World Cup Final at Wembley.’She adds: ‘I know that some of the girls were upset because after the final they could not sit with the husbands but had to go into another room for dinner. They felt it was not right, stuck in a different room, like you are nothing. But that was the way it was.’Pat, married to Jack for 60 years, remembers he rang her about an hour after the match, and came home the next day — stopping at a transport cafe for a plate of egg and chips.The separations while the tournament was on were hard, she said. ‘They would go off for two or three weeks before the World Cup and you wouldn’t see them.’But that was the way England manager Alf Ramsey insisted that it should be. He didn’t want his players to have any contact with their wives — they were allowed phone calls and letters only.Patricia Hunt, who was orced from Roger in 1981, explains: ‘We had a very different relationship with the management. They kept the wives and families at a distance. We were definitely not involved or invited. Our role was not even considered.’She seems astonished that one of this year’s players, Fabian Delph, returned from Russia to the UK to be with his wife for the birth of their third child.‘If that had happened in Alf Ramsey’s day, he would have said: ‘‘Go home...and don’t come back after.’’ It would not even have been considered a possibility.          Roger Hunt and wife Patricia pictured a few weeks after England\u0027s triumph in the 1966 final‘Football is not just a game any more,’ says Pat. ‘The money they earn, the cars they drive, the mansions they live in and the lifestyles they lead are totally different from the way it was for us.’This much is true — the England team were paid a tiny fraction of current wages.Martin Peters earned around £120 a week at Tottenham (the equivalent of £1,770). Harry Kane, who plays for the same club, is on £200,000 a week.Pat Hunt says: ‘We were ordinary people. Your husband was playing a game of football, but it was no big fuss made. I would have hated to have been looked at and analysed and watched as the WAGs are, but now it’s all big money and celebrity.‘Rebekah Vardy flies out with all the family on a private jet, then she’s on the telly on Loose Women and is out until 3am or 4am, and it’s all about publicity.‘I suppose they do it and absolutely love it, and good luck to them, if they can handle it.’Tina Moore, married to 1966 England captain Bobby until 1986, agrees. ‘We didn’t have anything like their money, but we did have a wonderful life. Would I like to be a WAG today? I don’t know, to be honest. My husband was handsome and charismatic, but you never had too much concern (about predatory female rivals).‘Nowadays it’s horrendous — women pursue footballers because they know that they could end up with a great lifestyle. I wish them luck with it.’ "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/06/22/4DFC974400000578-0-image-m-34_1530913063689.jpg","title":"Boycott boycott Rio Ferdinand enjoys cup tea slice cake Vladimir Putin","story":"    Former England internationals Alex Scott, second left, and Rio Ferdinand, right, were pictured with Vladimir Putin centre, despite a boycott of the tournament by British politicians and members of the Royal Family over the ongoing dispute with RussiaAnd Ferdinand was sitting just two spaces away from Putin as they chatted around a grand, white table.

Shockingly, cousin marriages are a key factor in an average of two child deaths every week.This figure is derived from the fact that a total of 545 boys or girls born to closely related couples have died in childhood during the past five years, according to the Department for Education, which collates data from Child Death Overview Panels in every council area. (It is the job of these panels to examine the deaths of any child under the age of 18.)Thousands more children of consanguineous marriages survive, but with appalling physical or mental problems. These include blindness, deafness, blood ailments, heart or kidney failure, lung or liver problems and a myriad of often incurable and complex neurological or brain disorders.According to a report for the BBC’s Newsnight, British Pakistanis are 13 times more likely to have children with genetic disorders than the general population.They are responsible for three percent of all births, but produce just under a third of all British children with such health problems.In Birmingham, around one in ten children from first cousin marriages either dies in infancy or develops a serious life-long disability caused by genetic ailments, according to health officials in the city, where half the mothers of Pakistani origin are married to a close relative.Meanwhile, a research document by the NHS-funded Enhanced Genetic Services Project reveals that in Birmingham in 2009-2010, the combined infant stillbirth and death rate ‘definitely or probably’ due to genetic disorders inherited from Pakistani cousin parents was 38 times higher than that among white European babies in the city.The report — one of the most thorough into this health and social problem — says: ‘Almost a third of the affected children die before five years of age.Most of the survivors suffer chronic disability, and they are cared for by their families, posing tremendous emotional and financial strain.’Up in Bradford, where teenager Hiba Maroof lives, doctors and nurses have told me paediatric wards look after numerous children who are unable to speak, and are fed through tubes.

Apologies to the English contingent, definitely the Welsh family side that picked the date.\u0027 And Zoey Olivia, of Watford, added: \u0027Just realised I\u0027m at a wedding on Saturday and England are playing... I\u0027m so torn. I hope there\u0027s a TV.\u0027Sandra Millar, the Church of England\u0027s head of \u0027life events\u0027, said: \u0027For those attending a wedding service at 3pm, I\u0027d strongly encourage you to make sure you are fully on-side with the happy couple and switch off your mobile phone in advance.\u0027Rev Millar added that while guests \u0027may be forgiven\u0027 for checking the score at the reception - doing this in church should be given the \u0027red card\u0027.She told the Daily Telegraph: \u0027For those getting married on Saturday, like England fans you might experience a few nerves - but you can be sure that it will also be the best day of your life, with memories to cherish. \u0027Who knows, come 6pm, that may be something you share with the rest of the nation too\u0027.  Though she is English, bride-to-be Carmel, 27, from the Midlands, says there would not be any options for fans to watch the game at her wedding to Killian, 30, in South Wales on Saturday.\u0027We don\u0027t have the facilities to do so in the venue, so that\u0027s a good excuse.\u0027No-one has directly asked for us to put it on but there have been several jokes and suggestions, if you know what I mean. People who would like to have it on but don\u0027t want to straight out ask or come across as rude or anything.\u0027Asked how she would react if anyone sneaked off to catch a glimpse of the television, Carmel said: \u0027I\u0027d probably be like, \u0027Are you serious?!\u0027\u0027I don\u0027t mind people checking the scores or having a quick look on their phones while we\u0027re all milling about but if anyone goes off to the accommodation I won\u0027t be best pleased!\u0027It\u0027s at 3 so it sits quite nicely between our ceremony and dinner. As long as they\u0027re around and engaging, I\u0027m happy to have a little give and take,\u0027 she said.\u0027I think all our friends and family are pretty respectful so I don\u0027t think they\u0027d push it really.\u0027\u0027There\u0027s been some heated debates\u0027George Morey, 25, and the soon-to-be Aimee Morey, 24, have managed to secure a screen for their wedding reception at a golf club in Swanley, Kent, and say \u0027dinner will be pushed\u0027.\u0027There\u0027s certainly been some heated debates about the game but she\u0027s come round to the idea of it now,\u0027 said George, a Millwall fan who works as a trainee lift engineer.\u0027If we win it will just add to the atmosphere of the day. We can\u0027t wait.\u0027I\u0027ve had this in my head that England will play this day since the draw in December.\u0027He added: \u0027I was thinking it would be the Germans in the quarter-final but I\u0027ll take Sweden and a first semi-final in 28 years instead.\u0027Couple who began romance aged 13 allow wedding guests to watch England match during vows | Great Yarmouth News - Great Yarmouth MercuryNorwich couple to screen World Cup game at wedding | Latest Norfolk and Suffolk News - Eastern Daily Press"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/07/15/4E01DA9B00000578-5928441-Video_footage_reveals_a_seal_who_sat_in_the_centre_of_a_home_s_f-a-22_1530973508678.jpg","title":"Seal chases woman street","story":"This is the hilarious moment a seal was spotted defending his owner\u0027s turf in the middle of an unsuspecting Australian suburb (pictured)  Video footage reveals a seal who sat in the centre of a home\u0027s front yard in Beachport, South Australia engaging in a stare-off with a female passerbySeal pups play tug of war with a sheet of plastic washed up...Give us a lift, mate!

We believe it to be one of his earlier watercolours.\u0027          Libby Sheldon, pictured, agrees the painting is a genuine TurnerMs Archer-Thompson revealed that cross-border cooperation had resulted in the lost Turner coming to light.She said: \u0027The private collector of the lost Turner watercolour is English.We met him through a Scottish connection, who is another art collector.\u0027\u0027I first saw the painting in March at the collector\u0027s private residence.\u0027He bought the painting a few years ago but has been researching it because he wanted to find out more as he thought there was something special about it.\u0027I knew it was a genuine Turner. I was completely moved when I held it in my hands. It is something to hold it in your hand rather than behind a glass, which is great about my job. This is probably the highlight of my career.\u0027The private collector paid peanuts for it - a two-figure sum - only for a national gem to be discovered.\u0027Extensive archival research was undertaken to build up a case for why this was a genuine Turner painting from his life and time at Abbotsford.Her role was using her expert knowledge in the subject to help the owner unravel the story behind the painting of Scott\u0027s home. Combining that with the scientific study of the painting has enabled Ms Archer-Thompson to make the case.Ms Archer-Thompson is convinced it is a Turner because a pencil sketch, which can only be seen by infra-red imaging reveals the artist\u0027s original sketch. This has been adapated and changed siginficantly in the paint.The type of paper used for the watercolour also matches Turner\u0027s use of materials but the main focus was on the date of the frame and the paint.The scene of the Tuner painting is also found in the engraved commemorative book after Scott\u0027s death.Ms Archer-Thompson added: \u0027Not very long ago another lost Turner watercolour appeared and was sold for £230,000.\u0027The tiny watercolour, which is poket sized, measures at 5.5 inches by 3.5 inches.Libby Sheldon, a painting analyst expert, \u0027supports the theory\u0027 the Turner is a genuine.Ms Archer-Thompson, added: \u0027All of this analysis, including work by painting expert Libby Sheldon, demonstrates that it was executed by an astonishingly skilled hand.\u0027          The painting is believed to have been painted at the Scottish home of Sir Walter Scott, picturedWhen Turner stayed at Scott\u0027s house in August 1831, the writer showed the renowned painter his art collection, amongst which is believed to be a view of Abbotsford and the River Tweed by Scottish artist Elizabeth Nasmyth.Ms Archer-Thompson said: \u0027This painting is from exactly the same vantage point we believe Turner painted.\u0027Scott had a personal attachment to the Nasmyth painting and its composition and my theory is that this gave Turner the idea to compose the same scene, which he based on sketches in the Abbotsford sketchbook used during his visit in 1831.\u0027Abbotsford House Trust chairman James Holloway, a former director of the Scottish National Portrait Gallery in Edinburgh, added: \u0027It is wonderful for Abbotsford to be able to show such a fascinating painting.\u0027It will intrigue and delight our visitors.

Then I saw the police jump out and run to the building.‘They split up: some went to the upper road and some took the lower road and some went by the lake. It was getting dark. We were sitting there thinking “Should we be afraid?” — because one of the policemen took his gun out.’Then, leaping from the first-floor balcony, the man attempted to flee, jumping down to the lawn below.Luckily, officers who had been staking out the flat for days were ready and waiting — wrestling him to the ground and securing him with handcuffs.He has been under lock and key ever since. And, if the authorities have their way, he will remain so for some considerable time.Because the smooth-talking ‘business executive’ is none other than Mark Acklom, Britain’s most wanted conman.He’s been on the run for more than four years, having allegedly fleeced orcee Carolyn Woods out of her £850,000 life savings while posing as a wealthy banker and MI6 agent, and is suspected of cheating dozens more by claiming to be a property developer, City broker, lawyer and even a gynaecologist.Cancer-stricken England fan, 63, will be held in Russia for...Tragic Alesha, six, was \u0027raped and murdered before her body...Share this articleHis arrest brings to an end a Europe-wide manhunt for the privately-educated swindler. Acklom, known for his love of fast cars, first-class travel and expensive hotels, is alleged to have used dozens of false identities to stay one step ahead of the authorities.At the weekend, his luck finally ran out after an international operation involving the National Crime Agency, Avon and Somerset Police and the Swiss authorities.Proceedings to extradite him to the UK are now underway and he is expected to face at least 20 charges of fraud and other offences.For his alleged victims, the news, while welcome, is bittersweet. Because it is almost impossible to overestimate the devastation they say Acklom has left in his wake.‘It has been a very long haul and my health has suffered,’ 61-year-old Miss Woods, who lives in Bath, told the Mail this week. ‘It seems every time I try to start afresh, something else happens with him and it brings the whole episode rushing back.’Meanwhile, IT specialist Christopher Frampton, 55, of Ashbourne, Derbyshire, claims his health and marriage collapsed under the strain of being fleeced out of £50,000 when, he says, the conman persuaded him to give up his lucrative corporate job for a business venture that turned out to be a scam.‘It devastated my life so much, I’m having therapy,’ he says. ‘I am cross that Acklom was living in a million-pound property in Switzerland — I lost all the money I’d saved and my family went from living comfortably to living hand-to-mouth.’          Mark Acklom (pictured) with his wife Maria Yolanda Ros Rodriguez at Ascot\u0027s Royal EnclosureEven Acklom’s own family, from whom he has been estranged for years, still bear the scars from his behaviour.His mother, Diana, told us: ‘My marriage broke up over this, and his children by his first wife don’t have anything to do with him.‘If he wanted to really run away, he should have gone to South America, like Ronnie Biggs. But I think he liked to live on the edge — he needed to have a buzz.‘I was speaking to his brother and he said: “How can he live not knowing who would be behind the next knock on the door?’’’And, make no mistake, in recent months the net had been steadily tightening around him.The current manhunt was launched in October 2016 when a European arrest warrant was issued by Avon and Somerset Police, originally focusing on allegations of fraud linked to Ms Woods.She claims that in 2012, Acklom had walked into the boutique where she worked in Tetbury, Gloucestershire, and swept her off her feet, saying he was Mark Conway, a Swiss banker.By the end of their year-long ‘romance’, Miss Woods says she had lent him every penny of her £850,000 life savings.The mother-of-two claims that she was financially ruined and on the brink of suicide when Acklom left her.When the warrant was sought, British police believed Acklom was hiding in Spain: he had a Spanish wife, Maria Yolanda Ros Rodriguez, whom he married in 2009 and with whom he had two children.But in May 2017, the hunt switched to Switzerland after he was photographed at a Geneva cafe by one of his alleged victims, who spotted him by chance.When police examined the images, they realised he was drinking coffee with a Spanish fraudster, also then on the run.The café was staked out — but Acklom never returned.Then, earlier this year, he was linked to a flat in a northern suburb of Zurich, from which it was believed he had been setting up various companies in a bid to attract investors.One business claimed to be manufacturing computer chips for black-box data recorders for cars. The company’s website suggested it had customers from the luxury car industry.Its motto is: ‘Being Defeated Is Optional.’At one point, undercover police mounted a surveillance operation on a bank following a tip-off that Acklom was planning to meet staff and business associates there, but he did not show up.At the time, Sky News revealed that Acklom still had a current passport and a Swiss residency permit in the name of Marc Long — one of several aliases he has used. The legitimate documents were obtained in 2014, shortly after Acklom fled Britain and after he had changed his name by deed poll.          As a teenager, his behaviour rapidly deteriorated from difficult to the downright dreadfulWhat we have now established is that for the past year he has been living in a stunning first-floor apartment overlooking Lake Zurich and has continued to have access to considerable sums of money.The apartment he was renting in the town of Wädenswil, 25 miles south of Zurich, would have cost him up to £2,500 a month. The children were being educated at a local private school.‘My first impression of him was that he was someone who didn’t really want to talk to people,’ said one neighbour. ‘I saw the wife and kids on the paddle board but they’d never say hello.’And Acklom himself was seemingly concerned about being recognised. He generally spoke Spanish, had grown shoulder-length hair and a bushy beard and would always wear sunglasses and a baseball cap. He looked very different, say neighbours, from his police ‘Wanted’ picture.His 47-year-old wife, meanwhile, had continued to indulge her life-long love of yoga.Since last August, she had been paying for one-to-one yoga classes, booking five sessions in advance each time. In the holidays, her ‘very sweet’ children accompanied her to the classes.She used the name Maria Longi and paid in cash — the only one of the instructor’s clients to do so.The instructor, who asked not to be named, said Maria claimed her husband managed a project concerning electronic ‘black boxes’ for cars and was ‘in the IT business’. Out of curiosity, she had searched the internet for more information, but found nothing.Although his wife is not believed to be wanted for any crime, sources close to the case have speculated whether the very existence of a wife and children — three extra people for the authorities to try to trace — may ultimately have hastened his downfall.Last autumn, police had specifically appealed for information about his wife and daughters. They said they believed the children would be attending private schools and that his wife was likely to indulge her passion for yoga.They were right on both counts.‘We have an incredibly high success rate in tracking down fugitives from British justice,’ said Ian Cruxton, head of international operations for the National Crime Agency, in the wake of the arrest.‘We do that through a host of techniques, including mobilising the ability of the public to assist us, which is why we publish the identities of these iniduals.’While celebrating the good news, those who know Acklom say they will not be happy until he is back in Britain to face justice.  Proceedings to extradite him  are now underway and he may face at least 20 charges of fraudRaised in Bromley, Kent, Mark Acklom was the eldest of four children born to a City insurance consultant. He was educated at the prestigious Dulwich Preparatory school. He then went on to board at Eastbourne College, an independent boarding and day school in East Sussex.Despite having all the advantages money could buy, from the beginning, he was a troublesome child. His mother, Diana, believes that a difficult birth may have left him with a brain injury that meant he struggled to empathise with others.‘When he was two, I bought our first puppy,’ she recalled. ‘I had just brought her home and she was sitting on the stairs. He went up and just kicked her out the way. That was the first time I thought this was odd. Most children would go up to a puppy and cuddle it.’In a bid to embrace his difference, when her son was seven, Diana placed a sign on his bedroom door reading: ‘Why be normal?’But as a teenager, his behaviour rapidly deteriorated from difficult to the downright dreadful.As an adult, Acklom made plans to become a Catholic priest then just as quickly dropped them.Next, he married a girl he met in a nightclub. His daughter and son were born shortly afterwards. But the relationship didn’t last, and Acklom walked out on his family when the children were young and never saw them again.Soon afterwards he headed to Spain, but later returned to Britain and became the director of a series of short-lived companies.In 2012, he allegedly met Miss Woods, as well as others, including Mr Frampton, and reportedly once even claimed to be a ‘close business associate’ of Formula One supremo Bernie Ecclestone.While many who met him say they suffered, Acklom and his family continued to live the high-life. Following the events of last weekend, that, however, looks set to change.Two days after his arrest, his wife, who yesterday was still in the lakeside apartment with her children, turned up as usual for her yoga session, telling the instructor that it would have to be her last.‘I don’t have the money to pay for them any more,’ she said.Quite whether she had any idea of her husband’s alleged deceptions remains to be seen. For now at least, it seems, she will no longer be enjoying the fruits of his labours.Additional reporting: Stephanie Condron "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/06/11/4DF3845F00000578-0-image-a-84_1530874646844.jpg","title":"A shallow gassy opportunist QUENTIN LETTS Sadiq Khan","story":"    London Mayor Sadiq Khan (pictured) and U.S. President Donald Trump have engaged in a long-running war of words over issues such as crime and terrorismHe attended a boxing gym to improve his weedy physique and to learn how to dodge punches. Useful in politics, that is. He read law at university and became a solicitor. He had a good brain but there was also a hankering for wider acclaim. Humdrum legal work, attending to conveyancing or wills or marital disputes, will not grab headlines the way a big yellow balloon can. Human rights was where the political juice was. The eager Khan was soon developing a speciality in minority-grievance cases.He became a partner in his firm by his mid-30s, dabbled in local politics and increasingly styled himself the representative of high-profile victims of what he might in those days have called ‘the establishment system’. From there, in those days of early Blairism, it was a comparatively easy step to become Labour MP for Tooting in 2005.At first he was impressive: his energy palpable as he caught the Speaker’s eye. His voice had an urgency. He worked his fringe into a little quiff with hair gel. He was a boxy-shouldered, bustling figure and earned some respect for the way he ignored the New Labour Whips and – apparently acting from the highest principles – opposed Tony Blair’s plans to lock up terror suspects for 90 days without charge. He also criticised Blair for the invasion of Iraq.But then ambition again infected his bones. After Gordon Brown replaced Blair as Prime Minister, the Whips sidled up to the man who had so recently rebelled against them.Did he fancy joining their crew? A job in the Government! Mr Khan almost bit their hands off and became a Whip (ie an enforcer among Labour MPs). Soon he was badgering other MPs to vote for detention periods of 42 days without charge. How easily had those once precious principles been blunted.\u0027The biggest insult to a sitting US president ever\u0027: Nigel...Meet the men behind the anti-Trump protests: The wealthy...Share this articleSince then this oddly insubstantial figure has floated upwards – and away from his working-class roots – on a series of felicitous thermals. Most politicians are egomaniacs but this one takes it to new, almost comical extremes (there is a glorious photograph of him striking a butch pose and placing his hand on some railings which had a ‘WET PAINT’ sign on them).Most politicians break or bend their word but this one does it with bells on. Most politicians are opportunists but Sadiq Khan has made short-term posturing so much his speciality, he would win the gold medal for it at any Interstellar Olympics. Take his non-gender-specific traffic lights. When ‘trans rights’ were the big thing a couple of years ago, someone suggested – for all I know in jest – that it was a denial of trans people’s rights that pedestrian signals at road crossings only showed a little green or red man.And so the newly-elected Mayor Khan ordained that such lights, at public cost and to widespread mockery, should be altered so that the signals now show politically-correct diagrams rather than a little chap.Take his indignant demand for a national bank holiday for Prince Harry’s wedding (er, it was held on a Saturday). One day it was a headline, the next day, amid embarrassed coughing, it could be filed under ‘Y’ for ‘yesterday’s news’.Or his feckless declaration that new homes in central London should not be allocated parking spaces because residents should use public transport – the same public transport whose fees he has allowed to rise – and save the planet by reducing their carbon footprint. How were homeowners meant to struggle home with the weekly supermarket shopping?          An inflatable balloon depicting Donald Trump as a baby wearing a nappy, which will fly over London when the President visits on July 13, with one of its creators Leo MurrayMr Khan’s eco-lecturing did not stop him making a much-trumpeted vanity trip to Pakistan and India where one of his great photo-opportunities coincided with a terrible smog in Delhi and he was almost completely invisible posing for photographs in the pea-souper. The trip was depicted as a ‘coming home’ for him, yet when he was asked about that, he said, ‘I’m from London, mate’. Was he playing it both ways, tacking to the minority-ethnic vote while at the same time asserting his London-born credentials? Perish the thought!But that, alas, is the nature of this shallow, self-serving figure, a man many Labour MPs have still not forgiven for encouraging Ed Miliband to stand against his brother David for the Labour leadership in 2010, a disastrous misjudgement which led to the party being taken over by the extremists of Momentum.Mr Khan may not worry much about that. After all, he himself is safely ensconced as London mayor, having beaten a weak challenge from the Tory candidate Zac Goldsmith in 2016. I’m all right Jack!Likewise, he will be thinking himself jolly clever this weekend as the country prepares for Mr Trump’s visit. He has got one over the most powerful man in the world!In London, it is claimed, Donald Trump is widely disliked. He is certainly opposed by the metropolitan elite, who have never forgiven him for beating their heroine Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election.You wonder, however, what they think of Trump on those building sites and boxing gyms where the young Sadiq Khan spent his time.I suspect they have a rather higher opinion of the US President as someone who stands up for the working classes and who speaks their language.Trump is certainly a better communicator than arid, charmless Khan. The best political communicators speak from the heart. It is when politicians strike false poses, with words written for them by strategists and advisers, that they fail to convince.And the sorry fact is that since he became London mayor, Mr Khan has struggled to say anything interesting or radical.When the creators of the ‘Baby Trump’ balloon first told London’s City Hall about their stunt, they met with little reaction. But then, suddenly, the project was given the mayor’s blessing.Did Mr Khan’s Press handlers suddenly get wind of the wheeze and spot its potential for a few headlines that might move the public’s attention away from his dreadful record on crime prevention?Mr Khan’s decision to make a political thing of this balloon lark will no doubt win the acclaim of the Twittersphere. But the City of London’s banks and finance houses depend greatly on American custom and goodwill. Donald Trump is a notoriously touchy president. As a nation we need to persuade him to give post-Brexit Britain a trade deal.The balloon stunt will gain Mr Khan oodles of publicity. But what will it do for the reputation of a City, and our country, which needs to earn the goodwill of the White House?Would a serious mayor, a proper, substantial, internationally-minded leader of our capital city, in touch with his real constituents rather than fringe protesters, not have put such considerations above his own childish posturing?As for that Baby Trump inflatable, we must earnestly hope it is not peppered by someone with a long-distance rifle. Pop goes the weasel Khan’s silly stunt. One can but hope.  "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/07/00/4DF7DA2400000578-0-image-a-16_1530920636540.jpg","title":"Alan Titchmarsh says water companies stop blaming gardeners","story":"    Aerial images highlight the effect the heatwave is having on Britain\u0027s green and pleasant land as the parched earth turns an arid yellow amid scorching temperatures and little rainfall    With the heatwave set to last, suppliers are warning their customers to use less water or face a banBut Titchmarsh, 69, hit out at the warnings, saying that water firms waste so much in leaks themselves.Three billion litres of water simply drains away every day, according to regulator Ofwat. Titchmarsh told Horticulture Week magazine: ‘A hosepipe ban would be galling when so much water is not properly managed and leaks.

It\u0027s obvious he\u0027s not playing as well on the big points.\u0027I think you have to go in and not overplay just because Djokovic has 12 majors. Djokovic is playing better because grass I think suits his game at themoment, grass usually suits your game better when you\u0027re less confident because it\u0027s about staying alive in the points.\u0027Kyle will have time to maybe manoeuvre Djokovic around with his forehand. Obviously he has to serve well. The longer the rallies, the longer the match, the better the chances probably for Djokovic. Not that Kyle gets tired, butexperience at some point plays a role.\u0027But he\u0027s won his first match on Centre Court, that\u0027s huge. I think Kyle isready.\u0027Edmund has so far appeared utterly unfazed about carrying the weight of home expectation at Wimbledon for the first time, and can take confidence from his last meeting with Djokovic in Madrid in May, when he claimed his first win in four against the Serbian.  Coach Fredrik Rosengren wants Kyle Edmund to enjoy facing Novak Djokovic ahead of their contest on Centre Court today          Former Tennis players Billie Jean King and Rod Laver (pictured) were among the stars in the royal box on centre court todayRosengren said: \u0027To play one of the best guys ever in tennis on the mostfamous court on home soil, in my opinion it can\u0027t be bigger than that.\u0027That is something he has to be very proud of. He has achieved so much so it\u0027s great, but at the same time you have to find a balance of not being too excited,you go in and try to play to win. He is in unbelievably good shape mentally. We talk a lot about that, to enjoy it.

We are hoping that the weddings at the end of the day will be able to fill us in on how we are doing.\u0027However, another couple have rearranged their wedding.  Groom Nick Hawley has even postponed the wedding reception until after 5.30pm in case the knockout game goes to penalties.

So it was going to happen whatever.\u0027          Groom Nick Hawley has even postponed the wedding reception until after 5.30pm in case the knockout game goes to penaltiesSue, 43, the owner of The Picnic Stop sandwich bar and cafe in Cleethorpes said: \u0027Nick got on to the lady at the hotel and brought it forward to 2.30pm and then got the reception and speeches put back to 5.30pm.\u0027Despite the upheaval, Sue said she was excited about tying the knot with Nick after being together 18 years.\u0027We decided to do it this year. Nick wanted a massive wedding but I have persuaded him to keep it small and there are 29 of us going to Gretna Green,\u0027 said Sue.\u0027I love him because of his weird sense of humour and he makes me laugh everyday and he is kind and very sociable. Everything turns into a massive party when he is around,\u0027 the bride said. Sue said nothing was going to get in the way of their honeymoon - not even the start of Grimsby Town FC\u0027s season.Nick will miss the start of the season and the derby match with Lincoln City at Blundell Park on August 18 at 1pm.\u0027Nothing is going to get in the way of the honeymoon. He is not crossing that line,\u0027 said Sue.    Football-mad Nick was almost instantly on the phone to wedding planners to rearrange the times of their wedding and reception when England got through to the quartersShe added: \u0027We are big football fans and Nick never misses a Grimsby Town game.\u0027Football has ruled my life for years. Window cleaner, Nick runs his son Sam\u0027s under 16 football squad Sussex Elite Windows.The happy couple will be joined by daughter Ellie Stevenson, 24 and Libby Hawley, 13.Nick said: \u0027As soon as England won I was straight on to the wedding planner. But it is not as easy as you think. The photographer is into football too so was happy to accommodate us.\u0027They were all very thoughtful and moved the wedding at The Courtyard forward and the reception at Greens of Gretna to 5.30pm.\u0027We are massive England fans.\u0027            Katrina and Samuel Williams were married at a ceremony attended by their parents in Cyprus last month. Their plans for a reception in the UK have been hit by the England match She added: \u0027We can\u0027t get hold of everyone that\u0027s due to come so I\u0027ve had to drive about telling people the news.\u0027I\u0027ve found the whole thing traumatising - we have a toddler to look after and I work full time as a nurse and just don\u0027t need this extra stress.\u0027The couple believe the venue\u0027s change of plans is due to the England match. But the bar insists it never offered the large function room that Katrina and Samuel, 31, say they requested.          They believe the decision not to give them the room they wanted is due to the England gameA spokesman said: \u0027It was unfortunate that on this occasion, communication between ourselves and the party involved was delayed and details were not finalised until just over a week before the event. We would like to make it clear that this was not a failure on our part.\u0027Due to this delay, the apparent mix-up over the function room offered only came to light very late in the day.\u0027We have done our utmost to find an alternative solution and it is a shame that we have not been able to do so.\u0027England\u0027s quarter final tie, which kicks off at 3pm, has caused headaches for scores of couples planning their big days.            Humber Dock Bar and Grill in Hull insists the dispute is the result of an administrative mix-upOne couple, from Norwich, have arranged for the game to be screened at their wedding.Hayley Cullum, 31, and her fiancée, James Adams, 33, will wed at 2pm today - and have their photos taken at the same time as kick off.  \u0027I\u0027m not bothered by it but all of the men on both sides love football, especially Adam\u0027s mates who cry over it, so I thought instead of losing half of my wedding party I would put a TV up\u0027 she told the Eastern Daily Press. Ahead of the game, one senior Church of England cleric has warned people not to watch the game on mobile phones or tablets if they are in church.One couple have installed a satellite dish so their guests can watch the quarter-final - but they will have to wait until after the speeches and watch the game \u0027as live\u0027 two hours later. Elsewhere gig-goers at the British Summer Time in Hyde Park didn\u0027t arrive until at least 5pm - three hours after it starts - because \u0027unpatriotic\u0027 organisers aren\u0027t showing the football and won\u0027t allow people to come and go from the site.And organisers of London\u0027s Pride festival are considering putting up giant screens so the tens of thousands taking part on Saturday afternoon can cheer England on rather than stay away.            Matt Yeo and fiancee Sophie Wood (pictured) are installing satellite dishes at their wedding reception but guests will have to wait until 5pm and watch the match \u0027as live\u0027 Graphic designer Matt Yeo told the Daily Telegraph: \u0027It has changed our plans quite dramatically. My fiancee Sophie is not a football fan and is very against the idea of having any football because you don\u0027t want to detract from the big day. \u0027But I felt that everyone will be looking at their phones or feeling like they wish they were watching it.\u0027Matt and fiancee Sophie Wood, both 30, will instead set up a television for their guests to watch the match at 5pm, instead of having the speeches ruined by the distraction of the World Cup. Guests will be told to turn their phones off so they can watch the game later without knowing the result. Meanwhile groom-to-be Carl Gould, who finds himself in a similar position, told the Guardian he would not install screens as \u0027we\u0027re not getting married in a Wetherspoons\u0027.    He said he hoped the wedding day would bring the England team luck, saying: \u0027If we could have a wedding win, and an England win – that would be ideal.\u0027 Bride-to-be Jodie Houlston, from Lincolnshire, said: \u0027OK England, you\u0027re starting to worry me now.\u0027If you\u0027re kicking a ball around a bit of grass upstages me on my wedding day I may have to have the first a strop of my life.\u0027        Wedding plans have been thrown into chaos because of the big game at 3pm on SaturdayDanni Jordan, of Ipswich, said her brother had posted a Facebook status asking his fiancée if they could move their wedding to Sunday, so he doesn\u0027t miss the match.   Ashleigh Marie said: \u0027When the England game will be playing during your wedding... woo, nothing like paying all that money to have missing guests.\u0027  Groom-to-be Gary Snoad tweeted: \u0027My own wedding clashing with the big game on Saturday - what have I done? Apologies to the English contingent, definitely the Welsh family side that picked the date.\u0027 And Zoey Olivia, of Watford, added: \u0027Just realised I\u0027m at a wedding on Saturday and England are playing... I\u0027m so torn. I hope there\u0027s a TV.\u0027Sandra Millar, the Church of England\u0027s head of \u0027life events\u0027, said: \u0027For those attending a wedding service at 3pm, I\u0027d strongly encourage you to make sure you are fully on-side with the happy couple and switch off your mobile phone in advance.\u0027Rev Millar added that while guests \u0027may be forgiven\u0027 for checking the score at the reception - doing this in church should be given the \u0027red card\u0027.She told the Daily Telegraph: \u0027For those getting married on Saturday, like England fans you might experience a few nerves - but you can be sure that it will also be the best day of your life, with memories to cherish. \u0027Who knows, come 6pm, that may be something you share with the rest of the nation too\u0027.  Though she is English, bride-to-be Carmel, 27, from the Midlands, says there would not be any options for fans to watch the game at her wedding to Killian, 30, in South Wales on Saturday.\u0027We don\u0027t have the facilities to do so in the venue, so that\u0027s a good excuse.\u0027No-one has directly asked for us to put it on but there have been several jokes and suggestions, if you know what I mean. People who would like to have it on but don\u0027t want to straight out ask or come across as rude or anything.\u0027Asked how she would react if anyone sneaked off to catch a glimpse of the television, Carmel said: \u0027I\u0027d probably be like, \u0027Are you serious?!\u0027\u0027I don\u0027t mind people checking the scores or having a quick look on their phones while we\u0027re all milling about but if anyone goes off to the accommodation I won\u0027t be best pleased!\u0027It\u0027s at 3 so it sits quite nicely between our ceremony and dinner. As long as they\u0027re around and engaging, I\u0027m happy to have a little give and take,\u0027 she said.\u0027I think all our friends and family are pretty respectful so I don\u0027t think they\u0027d push it really.\u0027\u0027There\u0027s been some heated debates\u0027George Morey, 25, and the soon-to-be Aimee Morey, 24, have managed to secure a screen for their wedding reception at a golf club in Swanley, Kent, and say \u0027dinner will be pushed\u0027.\u0027There\u0027s certainly been some heated debates about the game but she\u0027s come round to the idea of it now,\u0027 said George, a Millwall fan who works as a trainee lift engineer.\u0027If we win it will just add to the atmosphere of the day. We can\u0027t wait.\u0027I\u0027ve had this in my head that England will play this day since the draw in December.\u0027He added: \u0027I was thinking it would be the Germans in the quarter-final but I\u0027ll take Sweden and a first semi-final in 28 years instead.\u0027Couple who began romance aged 13 allow wedding guests to watch England match during vows | Great Yarmouth News - Great Yarmouth MercuryNorwich couple to screen World Cup game at wedding | Latest Norfolk and Suffolk News - Eastern Daily Press"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/07/15/4E01DA9B00000578-5928441-Video_footage_reveals_a_seal_who_sat_in_the_centre_of_a_home_s_f-a-22_1530973508678.jpg","title":"Seal chases woman street","story":"This is the hilarious moment a seal was spotted defending his owner\u0027s turf in the middle of an unsuspecting Australian suburb (pictured)  Video footage reveals a seal who sat in the centre of a home\u0027s front yard in Beachport, South Australia engaging in a stare-off with a female passerbySeal pups play tug of war with a sheet of plastic washed up...Give us a lift, mate!

In homage to the team, the white mini featured a football with \u0027England 2018\u0027 emblazoned on the front.Letting her brunette tresses cascade over her shoulder, Rebekah teamed the look with a pair of chic white trainers. She captioned the post: \u0027Come On England\u0027.           Showing their support: In another post, Rebekah shared a snap of her four children, with the whole family donning red England shirts as they jetted out of Repino to head to Samara          Sultry: Rebekah Vardy continued to show off her patriotism as she shared a sultry snap in a  minidress ahead of Saturday\u0027s England vs Sweden quarter final of the World Cup in Russia  Boozy: The ladies seemed to be calming their nerves with some hard refreshments as Rebekah revealed she was having a \u0027much needed\u0027 glass of white wine while Fern was indulging in a refreshing sip of champagneIn another post Rebekah shared a snap of her four children, with the whole family donning red England shirts as they sat in the private jet.The wives and girlfriends of Gareth Southgate\u0027s team have been staying in Saint Petersburg, where the footballers have their base in Repino, before the team flew over to Samara on Friday afternoon. Harry Maguire\u0027s long-term girlfriend Fern was begroaning her early start as she took to social media to share a snap of the dreary runway while layering the time over the top of the shot - revealing it was 7.52am.Rebekah too shared a snap of the plane\u0027s departure from her window, writing early start alongside an unhappy face.

It felt true to life.Cuz: The Life and Times of Michael A (Bodley Head) by Danielle Allen, a memoir about the loss of a beloved cousin, is unbearably moving. It illuminates the injustice often meted out to young black men by the American criminal justice system.Uzodinma Iweala’s Speak No Evil (John Murray), in which a young Nigerian American comes out as gay, is a coming of age story about the difficult, churning mix of family expectations. It is elegant and elegiac, and evokes Washington DC with subtle power.The Years by Annie Ernaux (Fitzcarraldo) is a remarkable work, a truly innovative autobiography that opens new ways of remembering and recuperating the past. The Long Take, by Robin Robertson (Picador), is a narrative in verse set in the immediate post-war years in America, that is at once heartbreaking and bracing. Think of it as the best black and white 1940s movie you will ever encounter in print.The Order of Time, by Carlo Rovelli (Allen Lane), hardly seems like pool-side reading, but anyone with the least interest in the science of the physical world will be by turns astonished, baffled and thrilled by what Rovelli has to say about the true nature of time, which has little in common with our everyday conception of it. Rovelli is the poet of quantum physics.Seamus Heaney 100 Poems (Faber) is an essential collection, which the poet meant to make before he died, and which the Heaney family have now completed. A feast of beauty.I’ve greatly enjoyed two group biographies: Agnès Poirier’s rich and funny Left Bank (Bloomsbury), about cold rooms and hot ideas in postwar Paris and Martin Gayford’s wise and generous Modernists and Mavericks (Thames \u0026amp Hudson), about artists in London from 1945 to 1970. And what to read in homage to Philip Roth? Maybe American Pastoral.Mark O’Connell’s To Be a Machine (Granta), a very lively book about transhumanism, won the Wellcome prize. Sally Rooney is 27 and so won’t be worrying about mortality – she entered the landscape fully fledged in the now traditional Irish manner, and with great power, – like Katherine Mansfield and Elizabeth Bowen fused together – with Conversations with Friends (Faber). Just in case it gets lost in the newer dazzle, it’s worth mentioning again Red Dirt (Head of Zeus, 2015) by EM Reapy, which won the Rooney prize, an Irish stormer set in Australia.I’m lucky enough to be reading Only to Sleep by Lawrence Osborne (out from Hogarth in September). A brilliant Raymond Chandler continuation novel with an ageing Philip Marlowe. Osborne and Chandler are a perfect match. Luke Kennard’s wit and astonishing virtuosity, so present in his poetry, have safely made the journey to his beguiling first novel The Transition (4th Estate): very funny, gimlet-eyed observation. Talking of poetry, Michael O’Neill’s latest collection Return of the Gift (Arc) is wise, lucid and pitch perfect.I just read Kamila Shamsie’s Home Fire (Bloomsbury). It’s brilliant in itself, but it also made me rethink Sophocles’s Antigone, on which it is loosely based. For some high-fibre holiday reading, I shall be packing Josephine Quinn’s In Search of the Phoenicians (Princeton), which dares to ask whether that famous ancient people really existed, and promises to expose the modern fantasies and ideologies that created them.Broad Band (Portfolio) is a brilliantly written and necessary history of our foremost cultural technology by Claire Evans. It illuminates the occluded contributions of many women to the medium over more than 150 years, and transforms our understanding in doing so. From mathematicians to community managers, engineers to speleologists, Evans shows how the internet’s past, present and future are all utterly contingent upon its radical ersity.Daniel Trilling has spent years tracing the routes taken by migrants from across Africa and the Middle East to Europe, meeting people and keeping in touch with them along the way: in camps, in cafes, and on Facebook. In Lights in the Distance (Picador) he tells their stories – or, more often, allows them to tell their own – calmly, clearly and deeply affectingly, never losing sight of the violence, brutality and pervasive racism that underlies and maintains the present situation.Let Me Be Like Water by SK Perry (Melville House) is a wonderful debut novel about how we find our feet again after a bereavement. It’s one of the best evocations of the grieving process I’ve read and is written in a fluid engaging style that draws you in to the protagonist Holly’s world.There is not a word wasted in Fondue, the second collection of poems by AK Blakemore (Offord Road). I was struck by Blakemore’s gift for crafting memorable and devastating images that stay in the mind long after you’ve closed the book.I saw Michael Donkor read at Brixton library recently and was enthralled by the extract he shared from his debut novel Hold (4th Estate), which moves between London and Ghana. I am looking forward to reading it in full.Far and away the funniest (and saddest) new book I’ve read this year is The Collected Letters of Flann O’Brien (Dalkey Archive), although I’m slightly reluctant to suggest that anybody packs this 600-page doorstop in their beach bag. Otherwise, having just finished writing a novel myself, I’m eager to e back into other people’s fictional worlds, and am looking forward, equally, to Whistle in the Dark (Viking) by Emma Healey – which I’m told is even better than the excellent Elizabeth Is Missing – Old Baggage (Doubleday) by Lissa Evans (a novel of the suffragette movement that promises to be both warm and funny) and, for a bit of cold-eyed post-Brexit satire, Perfidious Albion (Faber) by Sam Byers.I am really enjoying Catherine Lacey’s short stories Certain American States (Granta) so will read her first novel Nobody Is Ever Missing to catch up. She is playful and smart, one of a generation of American women who seem entirely unafraid. Rachel Kushner’s The Mars Room (Jonathan Cape) shows what happens when a smart writer gets truly serious. It is a necessary and compelling book, and this year’s must read. I will also bring proofs of Robert Alter’s translation of the Bible (out from Norton in December), the first single author translation ever to be published, and Human Relations and Other Difficulties (Profile), a collection of essays by Mary-Kay Wilmers, whose intelligence I find endlessly opaque and interesting.This is a brilliant summer for books by women: novels, memoirs and poems that address the difficult questions in women’s lives from an intimate perspective, but also with an unsentimental, distancing acuity and a preparedness to invent new forms for writing and for living. Three that seem to speak to each other in this respect are Deborah Levy’s game-changing The Cost of Living (Hamish Hamilton), Rachel Cusk’s Kudos (Faber) and Sheila Heti’s Motherhood (Harvill Secker). I also love Kathyrn Maris’s new poetry collection The House With Only an Attic and a Basement (Penguin), which tackles motherhood and family life with a comic thoughtfulness that’s unusually open to cruelty and that can rise and fall easily between the heroic and the bathetic. And right now, the book that’s really gripping me, and making me start again in thinking about many things, is Silver Press’s reprint of Nell Dunn’s 1965 Talking to Women, a series of artfully transcribed conversations with 10 of her friends. What’s striking, reading this, is how much has changed but also how little. And, unusually, the lack of change doesn’t feel depressing, reading these interviews, because there’s a pleasure in feeling so connected to these women across the decades. Also, there’s a kind of satisfaction in feeling that it’s just as important to keep asking the questions she asked about how we live, and why, and it makes me grateful that we have Cusk and Heti and Levy and Maris still asking them.In Calypso (Little, Brown), David Sedaris’s essays marry meditations on family, suicide, grief and mortality with the hazards of bodily functions and frequent travel for his massively popular public readings. Sedaris is as much standup comic as writer, making this a great audio and one for the car journey. I’m currently reading The Female Persuasion by Meg Wolitzer, highly relevant in this fourth wave feminism moment and quietly gripping. I shall also be packing What It Means When a Man Falls from the Sky (Tinder) by Lesley Nneka Arimah, whose New Yorker short stories I have enjoyed. Tsitsi Dangaremba’s This Mournable Body (Graywolf) isn’t out until August, but I shall read it before summer’s end.Nassim Nicholas Taleb’s Antifragile (Penguin) really made me think about how I think. I am also rereading Homer’s Iliad (the Robert Fitzgerald translation) and making my way through Susan Wise Bauer’s History of the Ancient World (Norton).The Road to Unfreedom (Bodley Head) by Timothy Snyder is a brilliant and disturbing analysis of the rise of authoritarianism in Russia, Europe and the US in the second decade of the 21st century. Essential reading for anyone wishing to understand the political crisis currently engulfing the world.In Enlightenment Now (Allen Lane), Steven Pinker extols the amazing achievements of modernity, and demonstrates that humankind has never been so peaceful, healthy and prosperous. There is of course much to argue about, but that’s what makes this book so interesting.Yuval Noah Harari’s new book, 21 Lessons for the 21st Century, will be published on 30 August by Jonathan Cape.I’m sure Rachel Kushner’s The Mars Room is going to be great – at least if The Flamethrowers is anything to go by. In Ma’am Darling, 99 Excerpts from the Life of Princess Margaret (4th Estate), Craig Brown achieves the impossible by finding a tone in which to write about monarchy. Not bitchy, not snide, not angry, but not fawning nor deferential either. Just funny.I am rollicking through Pretend I’m Dead by Jen Beagin, which is one of the funniest, most twisted and freshest things I’ve read in a long time. It follows the fortunes of Mona, who cleans houses and falls for a man she calls Mr Disgusting. Beagin combines deep compassion and irreverent humour to create characters with nasty, wonderful, human flaws. Helen Barrell’s Fatal Evidence, Professor Alfred Swaine Taylor and the Dawn of Forensic Science is an engrossing read. It follows the career of Taylor, a remarkable scientist who gave evidence at the trial of William Palmer, “The Rugeley Poisoner”, pioneered the study of forensic medicine and let Charles Dickens nose around his laboratory. Barrell explores Taylor’s (occassionally bizarre) cases, his public and private persona and his wide-ranging interests, which included geology and photography. Her description of the ways in which forensic experiments evolved is as fascinating as the courtroom dramas they accompanied.Your Silence Will Not Protect You (Silver) collects Audre Lorde’s essays and poems together for the first time in the UK. I look forward to getting stuck in to Talking to Women, Nell Dunn’s 1964 conversation about sex, money, work and art with a group of friends – including the writer Ann Quin and pop artist Pauline Boty.My love affair with the explosive, erotic, modernist poetry of Apollinaire is the one enduring passion in my life. Many of his best poems were written when he was a soldier fighting on the front lines in WW1. It was Apollinaire who invented the word, Surrealist. In Zone: Selected Poems of Guillaume Apollinaire (NYRB), Ron Padgett’s translation from the French (Padgett wrote the poems for the bus driver poet in Jim Jarmusch’s film, Paterson) is pitch perfect and dazzling.I will also reread four books I initially read very fast, mostly because the skill of the writing itself is the main event in all of them: The Years by Annie Ernaux, Kudos by Rachel Cusk, The Little Virtues by Natalia Ginzburg (Daunt) and Three Poems by Hannah Sullivan (Faber).If you have not already met The Secret Barrister (Macmillan), he or she makes an entertaining and acerbic holiday companion for those who don’t switch off their brains in summer it seems our resource-starved legal system is poised on the brink of not working at all. Tessa Hadley’s short stories, Bad Dreams (Cape), are simple and artful and leave you wanting more. Didier Eribon’s memoir Returning to Reims (Allen Lane) is a haunting book, fiercely political and deeply personal I shall be thinking about it this summer and for many seasons to come.Chantal Mouffe’s For a Left Populism (Verso) is influencing left parties as they enter government, from Greece to Portugal to Mexico. It is a beach-sized introduction to a major left thinker of the 21st century. Mike Davis’s Old Gods, New Enigmas (Verso) is a challenging re-exploration of Marx in the light of the atomisation of class struggle, the climate crisis and the centrality of cities to social justice struggles. Patrick Langley’s debut novel Arkady comes beautifully presented by Fitzcarraldo. What’s not to like about a book where revolutionaries take over a city in the north of England?People always say not to judge a book by its cover, but people are wrong. Ashleigh Young’s collection of smart, funny, insightful and unexpected essays, Can You Tolerate This? (Bloomsbury), has a bright yellow cover, making it perfect summer reading. I love it. I’ve been telling people about Lucy Wood’s short stories ever since her debut collection came out a few years ago she’s back with another collection, The Sing of the Shore (4th Estate), and she’s better than ever. Finally, Melissa Harrison’s forthcoming All Among the Barley (Bloomsbury) is an astonishingly good evocation of rural England in the 1930s, complete with creeping fascism and the subjugation of women. It’s subtle and mesmerising and brilliantly detailed, and I’m going to lie down in a meadow and read it all over again.Fiction in English from Pakistan has redeemed its promise with dazzling consistency. Mohammed Hanif’s Red Birds (Bloomsbury) is a fresh marvel, describing with cool wit and steely yet tender intelligence the interlinked fates of antagonists in a forgotten war-scape – and the complicity of our own sheltered lives in remote conflicts. Anna Tsing’s The Mushroom at the End of the World (Princeton) is a poetic and remarkably fertile exploration of the relationship between human beings and the natural environment, and what can still be done to stem its rapid deterioration.The term neoliberalism provokes much choleric denial. But Quinn Slobodian’s Globalists: The End of Empire and the Birth of Neoliberalism (Harvard) decisively establishes it as a coherent project, tracing it back to the political and intellectual synergies of the 1920s. Michelle Dean’s Sharp (Fleet), a portrait of 10 female writers and thinkers, is a bracing tribute to the life of the iconoclastic mind: a reminder, in our age of flashy hot takes, of the matchless power of sustained and elegant argument.Kept from the world by a crazed fundamentalist father, cowed herbalist mother and violent misogynist brother, it’s a miracle Tara Westover escaped her childhood in rural Idaho. Her memoir Educated (Hutchinson) brilliantly recounts her journey towards knowledge and enlightenment bravely, too – her family are still alive. With Rachel Cusk as with Karl Ove Knausgaard, you wonder what makes you keep turning the pages. But while he’s confessional, her narrator Faye lets other characters do the talking, giving little of herself away Kudos completes a remarkable trilogy. The crepuscular, dreamlike, post-1945 London that Michael Ondaatje invents in his novel Warlight (Cape) continues to haunt you long after the plot itself.Three Poems by Hannah Sullivan is the best first collection I’ve read for a long time: moving, technically adroit, clever in all the right ways, and full of brilliant small-scale effects as well as large achievements. Angela Leighton’s Hearing Things (Harvard) is as good as her previous book on poetic form – which is to say it’s terrific – and illuminates a great deal about the sound effects of poetry that cannot be disentangled from its page-sense. Rachel Cusk’s Kudos brings her enthralling trilogy to a well-judged conclusion, at once rounded and open.Now that Terry Pratchett is gone, Stephen King is one of the only authors I buy in hardback on publication day. His latest, The Outsider (Hodder), is both a detective and a horror novel, and it gripped me to the point of checking under the bed before I went to sleep. It reminded me of what it was like to lie reading by torchlight late at night, when camping in the summer.I’ve never been much of a reader of contemporary poetry, but I have been seduced by some of the brilliant young poets writing now, of whom Amy Key is perhaps my favourite. Her new collection, Isn’t Forever (Bloodaxe), is playful, surreal and enchanting but also rooted in brutal emotional honesty. She is writer of a rare and strange magic.I am lucky enough to have an advance proof of Mrs Gaskell and Me, the new book from the brilliantly gifted Nell Stevens: she describes it as a love letter to “her own very special, dear friend”, Mrs Gaskell, and I have it patiently waiting on my desk.On my bedside at the moment: Go, Went, Gone (Granta), a novel about the refugee crisis in Germany by Jenny Erpenbeck that is not only timely but masterful Matt Walker’s illuminating review of the science of sleep and how we’re all doing it wrong: Why We Sleep (Allen Lane) The Overstory (Heinemann), Richard Powers’ weird and wonderful novel about the intricate relationships among trees and humans and Carlo Rovelli’s mindbending The Order of Time.Liz Nugent’s Skin Deep (Penguin) is the perfect holiday read for those who like their escapism on the darker side. If Patricia Highsmith were Irish she might well have come up with this tale of a scarred woman who taints all she touches while remaining as charismatic as she is enigmatic.In The Smiling Man (Doubleday) Joseph Knox pulls off the “difficult second novel” with ease and considerable style. Labyrinthine Mancunian noir with the obligatory battered but dogged detective.Ambrose Parry, The Way of All Flesh isn’t published until late-August, but it’s a rip-roaring tale of murder amid the medical experiments of 19th-century Edinburgh. The book brings both city and period to colourful life and is a joy to read. It’s a collaboration between seasoned novelist Chris Brookmyre and his wife, consultant anaesthetist Marisa Haetzman.Irish lawyer Steve Cavanagh writes excellent courtroom thrillers set in the US. His latest, Thirteen (Orion), sees him at the top of his game. It features a serial killer who’s sitting on a jury. Terrific premise, and the resulting story doesn’t disappoint.I recently read Vivek Shanbhag’s Ghachar Ghochar (Faber), a perfectly formed short novel about a family in India undergoing a rapid change in fortune. Published in translation last year, it’s an admirably slim book – you could read it in one sitting – and for me it conjured up a whole world.I’d also recommend Sayaka Murata’s Convenience Store Woman (Portobello), an exhilaratingly weird and funny Japanese novel about a long-term convenience store employee. Unsettling and totally unpredictable – my copy is now heavily underlined.Finally, I don’t think I’ll ever forget the day I spent reading Olivia Laing’s Crudo (Picador). I couldn’t put it down, and then it overwhelmed me so much I had to put it down, and then I had to pick it back up again. A beautiful, strange, intelligent novel. My favourite book for adults this year, by some margin, has been Fifteen Dogs (Serpent’s Tail) by André Alexis. It opens with two gods having a quiet drink at The Wheat Sheaf in Toronto and debating whether, if animals had human intelligence, they would be only as unhappy, or more unhappy, than humans. It’s unhinged, wise, sharp, witty and daring. I’ve also fallen in love with Rachel Cusk’s Outline trilogy her work is staggering.In the world of children’s books, I can’t wait to read Hilary McKay’s The Skylarks’ War (Macmillan), set in the approaching shadow of the first world war. McKay couples warmth and grace with wry humour like nobody else out there.My recent (re-)reading includes Cervantes’ Don Quixote, Vladimir Nabokov’s Lolita and Speak, Memory, Ralph Ellison’s Invisible Man, and Thomas Mann’s The Magic Mountain, all books that don’t need me to recommend them. I have, however, immensely enjoyed David Grossman’s A Horse Walks into a Bar (Cape) for its pitch-perfect black comedy and Jeet Thayil’s The Book of Chocolate Saints (Faber), easily the most original and formally inventive novel to come out of India in years.Uprooting her life, London-based Kamin Mohammadi relocated to bucolic Florence. Her glorious memoir Bella Figura is witty, intelligent and heartfelt in equal measure and will delight anyone dreaming of a summer holiday – or a brand new life – in Italy.Recently optioned to become a film, Katja Meier’s timely memoir Across the Big Blue Sea: Good Intentions and Hard Lessons in an Italian Refugee Home avoids easy sentiment in favour of honesty and humour. The African women we meet at this Tuscan refugee home are fierce, scared, brave, vulnerable — triumphant yes, but human too. A beautifully complex account.And finally, I cannot heap enough praise upon Freshwater, a daring, sexy debut. Raw and lyrical, Akwaeke Emezi’s semi-autobiographical narrative takes on sexuality, spirituality, family and more — all with a clarity that belies her 30 years.I basked in the interwar twilight of Cressida Connolly’s After the Party (Viking). The novel a beautifully written evocation of the era, and the woolly self-absorption of its party-going protagonist. However, it’s also a pitiless exercise in ideological revelation, as it becomes clear that the party in question doesn’t feature dancing until dawn and a sumptuous breakfast buffet, but men and women wearing black shirts, who greet each other with fascist salutes. In a year that’s seen bigotry of all kinds on the rise, and the storm clouds of nationalist intolerance gathering on the near horizons of Europe, Connolly’s novel achieves the rare feat of at once summoning that foreign country, the past, then returning us, uncomfortably, to a contemporary Britain with a burgeoning fatherland complex.I have just finished reading The Reactionary Mind (Oxford) by Corey Robin. So many writers and thinkers today, East and West, are questioning the rise of conservatism, populism and tribalism. What makes Robin’s book extraordinary is the long-term pesrpective he introduces in this book. Robin shows that Trump is not a break from the conservative tradition, in fact, he is the fulfilment of a tradition that goes all the way back to Edmund Burke and his reaction to the French Revolution. It is a deeply thought-provoking book with utmost clarity and astonishing depth.What struck me about Neel Mukherjee’s novel A State of Freedom (Vintage) was the mesmerising complexity and the sharpness mixed with compassion and empathy. All the stories are beautifully written, and while they remain semi-independent, they are also subtly interconnected. Long after I finished it I realized the characters were still with me, vivid, compelling, haunting.Janesville: An American Story (Simon \u0026amp Schuster) by Amy Goldstein is incredibly well-researched, empathetic and moving. Political experts and pundits talk about “the American working class” all the time, making massive generalisations without paying much attention to inidual stories, but this book is extraordinary in the way it sheds light on an industrial town in America’s heartland by masterfully combining analysis and storytelling.I’ve already read Tishani Doshi’s poetry collection Girls Are Coming Out of the Woods (Bloodaxe) but I know I’ll return to it many times. One of the poems talks about poets ‘holding the throat of life till all the sunsets and lies are choked out till only the bones of truth remain’ - that’s precisely what Doshi does in this intelligent, elegant, unflinching collection. It’s very much a collection for this moment in history, but one that will endure long past it.The publishing house And Other Stories has committed to making 2018 a Year of Publishing Women – I’m planning to work my way through their entire list for the year over the summer. First up: Fleur Jaeggy’s Sweet Days of Discipline, translated by Tim Parks. It is set in a boarding school in postwar Switzerland, the opening pages are spare and beautiful, with an intriguing darkness.This summer the book I’m telling anyone who asks me about is Guy Gunaratne’s In Our Mad and Furious City (Tinder), a novel that’s a piece of communal vitality, choral in its urgency, one that squares up to the history of ision, makes contemporary disjuncture come alive on the page, doesn’t flinch, and demands change right now. The book I’ll take with me on holiday is Michael Ondaatje’s Warlight. I love his writing, I wait for his books.Now that America has come to seem so unsettled and so strange, two books help us to become more alarmed. One is Michèle Mendelssohn’s Making Oscar Wilde (Oxford). It charts the early rise of Wilde, with special attention to how, during the 1880s, his lecture tours in America, a country beguiled by novelty and in need of excitement, made his name. As long as it was new, it seemed, America wanted it. Rachel Kushner’s The Mars Room is set in the American prison system, but manages to be a novel with its own worldview and its own textures, as much as a chronicle of a system that holds more prisoners per head of population than any other country in the world. On a more uplifting note, there is a wonderful doorstopper called Gillian Ayres (ArtBooks), with a text by Martin Gayford and David Cleaton-Roberts and examples of Ayres’s work that will lift your heart.Do you want to understand yourself? To understand why you say and do what you do? To know why you, and the rest of our human race, are capable of paradoxical extremes, from compassion to cruelty (even within minutes of each other)? With humour, sublime insight and supportive data, Robert Sapolsky serves up all the answers in Behave, his gem of an explanatory masterpiece.Many of us feel that an occasional lie is fine, perhaps when trying to protect someone’s feelings, or when pressured to maintain political correctness. Lying by Sam Harris is a timely, well-reasoned treatise exposing how wrongheaded such beliefs are. It proves out the lack of utility in lying, in any scenario. Yet, that is not the reason I prescribe this book. Rather, it is the palpable sense of liberation and relief that you will feel when you practice what Harris preaches. Such is the truth about lying.My most beguiling read lately has been Rupert Thomson’s Never Anyone But You (Corsair), a beautifully written fictionalised account of the decades-long lesbian love affair between surrealist artists and anti-Nazi activists Claude Cahun and Marcel Moore. I’m currently very much enjoying Diana Evans’s novel Ordinary People (Chatto), which takes a forensic look at the pleasures and perils of marriage and parenting and modern London living. And, as a Londoner myself, and one who likes to make as many journeys as possible by foot, the book I plan to turn to next is Lauren Elkin’s Flâneuse (Vintage), which promises to be an inspiring a piece of feminist psychogeography based on the experiences of several notable female city-strollers including Jean Rhys, Virginia Woolf and Martha Gellhorn.What books are you reading this summer?

The 11th, Calypso, has just been published. His books draw on his life and the people he meets, with particular regard to his large, colourful family. He lives in West Sussex with his partner, Hugh Hamrik.Is it fair to say there is a lengthening shadow of mortality hanging over this collection?Not intentionally. I mean I always use my life as material and as I’m getting older I suppose it just makes sense that there would be. I don’t sit around wondering how many years I have left to live. But I do notice, like, what do you mean, another root canal?Why is your family so important to\u0026nbspyou?From the very beginning the way we hung out with each other was, I noticed, different to other families. In high school, when everyone was going to soccer practice or doing something else, none of us had anything, because it would have meant not being together. On Saturday night, nobody had a date. That would have been betraying the family. It just felt like the centre of the world, my family. I knew we weren’t important, but I knew we were important.Do you find that people become self-conscious with you, as though they’re either trying to get in or stay out of your books?Most often when someone says: “You can’t write about this,” it never would have occurred to me to write about it. It’s not that interesting. I hear it more from people I don’t know well. I think I have a pretty good idea of what people want known and what they don’t want known.And are you immediately aware of a situation that you’re going to write about? For example, when you found yourself with a small tumour in the vicinity of snapping turtles, did you think, here’s a story?I’d been thinking for a while that if you have your tonsils removed, a cat would like to eat them. Then I thought, “Well, I have this tumour, and I’d been hanging out with these turtles,” and I thought, “Well, a turtle would really like to eat my tumour.” And I was surprised by the things that got in my way, like the surgeon who said: “It’s against the law to give you anything I remove from your body.” That seemed unfair to me. So when that woman came up and said: “I’ll cut it out”, there was no guarantee she’d be a good character, but she was. I guess I thought if someone was going to pitch me the story of feeding a tumour to a turtle, I’d have said: OK!Your writing flows from your life. Is there ever an anxiety that the well is drying up?When I was younger, I wrote stories that you might tell if someone didn’t know you, and you wanted to give them a general idea of who you were. Now it’s more of an exercise of making something out of nothing, which doesn’t bother me. It’s harder to make something out of nothing, but the story can often be better. That’s where you’re really writing. I remember after I got out of college I had a boyfriend and he said: “Do you think someone’s just going to call and offer you a job?” And I said: “Yeah.” And do I think a story is just going to come to my door? Yeah.You write about your sister coming to see you at a gig, and you had someone close the door on her backstage, shutting her out of your life. It was the last time you saw her before she killed herself. Was that difficult to write about?I didn’t mean to write about that. I thought: “Oh my, am I really doing this?” I thought it was important to do because anything that makes a story more complex is good to do. What I didn’t say in that story was whenever you talked to Tiffany it took you weeks to get over it, because she’d say something so disturbing or make you so angry, you couldn’t stop thinking about it. Does it make you think you’re a heartless person?When I read that out loud on stage, I can’t believe I did it. I can’t believe I’m reading it. It is just as bad as it sounds. That you’re going to have someone close the door on that person’s face, and they’re going to commit suicide and you’ll never see them again... there’s not a way to make that funny. I read someone saying you can’t surprise a reader without surprising yourself, and in your life what surprise is there? But there are things, admissions that you can make, or scratch below the surface and say how you actually felt, and you can be there at your desk and you’re just shocked. So I think that was a situation where the reader can be surprised the exact way that I was surprised. I think the audience thinks that I’m monstrous.Your mother is very present in this book. It seems as if your storytelling comes from her. What do you think she would have made of your success?My mother died when she was 62 and her health wasn’t great. She couldn’t walk because she smoked so much. If my mother had lived I imagine she’d have had an oxygen tank or something. But if that weren’t the case I’d have said to my mother: “Would you come on tour with me? Would you come on stage and introduce me?” She’d have loved\u0026nbspit. Because she deserved attention.There’s a growing concern in publishing about cultural sensitivities. Do you make a point of ignoring them? A lot of times people will say after a reading: “I can’t believe what you said”, and I’m literally thinking: “What did I say?” I feel like so many of those issues are really just the enemies of comedy. After every show it’s something. There’s an essay where a woman shits in her pants on the aeroplane and I said it looked like she’d taken her skirt off a long-dead Gypsy, because I want people to see the colour of the skirt. I read that in Edinburgh and this young man comes up and says: “I have a bone to pick with you. I’m one-tenth Gypsy. I really don’t appreciate you using that word.” I’m like: “Call me when you’re nine-tenths Gypsy.” I mean, who isn’t one-tenth Gypsy? Writing isn’t propaganda. You live in England but America is the centre of your writing. Do you find it helps to have a distance from it?Yes I do. I mean, Donald Trump said recently that America is finally being taken seriously in the world again and so, not that it helps, when I’m arguing with his supporters, I live in the world and it’s actually not true at all. It does help to be away from it. You know I wrote something recently about guns, how difficult it is to get one here. And I was saying, despite the fact you can’t buy guns here, British people feel free. Is it that they don’t know what they’re missing or is the freedom they feel the freedom of not being shot to death in the classroom or movie theatre?What’s the last really great book you read?Homesick for Another World by Ottessa Moshfegh. I can’t remember the last time I laughed that hard at a book. Also Hunger by Roxane Gay. It opened my eyes to another world.Which genres do you avoid reading?I’m not a mystery reader. I’m not a big thriller reader. I don’t want to say never to either of them. You know when you read a really good book, you get so excited about writing and you think: “Wow, look at everything that’s possible.” And from a bad book you learn a lot. It’s easier to learn from a bad book because with a good book, if you knew how to do it, you’d be doing it yourself.Which classic novel did you read recently for the first time?Moby-Dick. About 15 years ago, Esquire asked me to pick a classic I’d never read, and I started it and thought there is no way I’m going to finish this book, so I told myself I could not take a bath or wash my hair until I finished the book. I hated that book.Which books do you feel are the most overrated?Moby-Dick. And Joseph Conrad. I’m like: “Oh my God, can we please get to the point?”Which bookauthor do you always return to?I always return to Richard Yates, and I read Revolutionary Road once a year. I usually read The Easter Parade once a year as well. Flannery O’Connor I return to again and again. She’s such a good comic writer.• Calypso by David Sedaris is published by Little, Brown (£16.99).

But the scale of Ryanair’s operations also means that quite a significant number of people could be affected,” he said.One concern for Ryanair is that any cancellation comes with the memory of last winter’s travails still relatively fresh. Thousands of passengers had their flights cancelled due to a blunder in the airline’s staffing roster.“Their brand is built on being reliable bastards,” said Dan Gavshon Brady, a strategist at brand consultancy Wolff Olins. “What the strikes threaten to do is question the reliability. They’re more resilient than others because they’ve never promised anything more than no-frills but deliver on what they promise.“But that also leaves them less margin for error, so when you get problems it threatens to affect your brand.”At one stage last year, it looked as if Ryanair might avert any escalation of tension with its labour force. In a reversal of the airline’s decades-old policy, O’Leary agreed to recognise trade unions, something he has once claimed would be less preferable than cutting off his own hands. It seemed like a watershed moment, albeit one forced by the airline’s staffing bungle.The mistake had left Ryanair desperately short of experienced pilots, giving them the whip hand over a management team keen to limit flight cancellations.O’Leary’s subsequent damascene conversion into a reluctant trade unionist was reminiscent of his 2013 vow to start being nicer to passengers – one made by necessity, through gritted teeth.A little more than six months later and unions representing both pilots and crew say recognitionhas not developed into engagement with their grievances.This time, while pilots in Ireland remain dissatisfied and plan to strike on 12 July, it is cabin crew who are most aggrieved.They have long complained of poor pay and working conditions and meagre employment rights as a result of Ryanair’s model of employing them via third-party agencies.As the  revealed last year, they are also subjected to disciplinary proceedings and public shaming if they do not hit sales targets designed to help Ryanair flog more scratchcards and perfume.Multiple crew unions, assisted by the the International Transport Workers’ Federation, have delivered a list of 34 demands to the company.The implication is that more strikes will follow unless the company comes to the negotiating table. “The onus is now on Ryanair,” said ITF general secretary Stephen Cotton.“Ensure that workers get the treatment they deserve, or more national unions may decide that strikes are the only way to make the company listen.“Ryanair has started to change, but we believe the culture at the top needs to change too in order to deliver on the promises it has made. “The close-knit corporate governance model that has been a feature of the company thus far is no longer appropriate for a major airline. An increase in independent representation on the board would give us greater confidence that Ryanair is serious about a new approach.” But Ryanair’s rapid growth and financial success remain core strengths and not everybody is convinced it will see the need to change.Chris Tarry, founder of aviation consultancy Ctaira, said: “Whilst this changes the rules of engagement at Ryanair the fact is that it starts from a position of the lowest costs and is consistently the most profitable airline.“There are different dynamics and flexing of muscles by labour but it’s all clearly manageable.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8f0418faffae44b3461d79d8a3b137eae700c0c5/431_768_5861_3518/master/5861.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1d9649a8ea24217436b3c9c9e729e676","title":"peter preston guardian hero daily mail paul dacre","story":"I have a confession to make: I cannot claim to have known Peter Preston well. Not one for chitchat myself, our few social encounters invariably left me drowning in the sea of those famous unnerving silences, while my not infrequent mentions in his column were a mix of good, bad and, I suspect, deliberately elliptical.That said, Peter was a hero of mine. I always felt – and here you must forgive my presumption – that in his love of, his obsession with, his addiction to journalism, we were kindred spirits.As a young reporter on the Express when its circulation was about 4m, I would sometimes have a late dinner at the Kolossi Grill, known as the Colostomy, in the hope of catching sight of him. He was, after all, the journalist’s journalist. The editor’s editor.Peter has been described as a private, shy, socially gauche inidual who eschewed the swanky parties and glitzy first nights at which too many of his trade loved to be seen hobnobbing with the powerful and the celebrated.I see a different man. I see a slightly lonely figure – one who was all too acutely aware that an editor who operates without fear or favour can’t really have friends. And then again, good editors need to be outsiders because, let’s be honest, most people only befriend journalists to get something into a paper or – more pertinently – to keep it out.I also see a man who, even after the first edition had gone, was glued to the backbench, a microwaved pizza and plastic bottle of plonk on his desk. This was not because he was against gossiping in the pub but because, frankly, even after a 12-hour day, it was a wretched distraction from a job that had to be done. Like sharpening a headline, writing a cleverer intro or cropping a more dramatic picture. Because, let me tell you, when you’re fixated by journalism like Peter was, there’s virtually nothing more important in life than trying to produce the perfect paper. And on the rare occasions that you do, there’s no greater buzz on this Earth.Now, I am not going to provoke my own lynching by suggesting that I’d have made a good fist of editing the . But I am going to risk a collective cardiac arrest in this congregation by offering you the view that – politics apart and actually, with the exception of his passion for Europe, I don’t think Peter was ideological – it’s not fanciful to say the man would have made a great editor of the Daily Mail.After all, he came from the lower middle class. He was instinctively anti-establishment. Politically, he was difficult to define, though on the unions he was almost Thatcherite. He believed, to the deprecation of too many of his colleagues to whom profit is a dirty word, that it was actually rather a good thing for a paper to be financially prudent and commercially successful. He was evangelical about the need for what he called “zing”. His mantra was “serious doesn’t need to be dull”. He initiated great women’s pages. In G2 he created a brilliant tabloid that has been imitated but never equalled.He was fascinated by popular culture, and determined  readers should not be excluded from the national dialogue because some of his staff had an aversion to anything that interested ordinary people. And his philosophy, outlined in his last media column, that readers in a jam should be treated like human beings and that a paper, by identifying with distress, becomes a functioning part of society rather than a commentary on its edges – should be the credo of every editor.Above all, he loved features and beautiful words and brilliant writers, several of whom the Mail poached. Others were rogues whom he tolerated because of the glory of their writing. And the making flesh of those wonderful words, and a manifestation of Peter’s genius for lateral innovation, was G2. Why, he asked, if it effervesced with flair, wit and creativity, should a tabloid be downmarket. Inevitably, there were the quali-pop sneers. Jonathan Miller, in self-condemnatory words, called Pass Notes a pollutant infecting culture. But G2 had it all: jaw-dropping covers, a dizzying range of views and voices, bold pictures, important investigations and profiles. G2 was both serious and salacious, even if there were, for my taste, a tad too many articles intellectualising the female orgasm. And not a week went by when, at its height, the Mail didn’t buy one of its articles.Now, I don’t want to overstate this “zing” factor, because ultimately Peter’s  was a very serious newspaper that broke important stories and pulled off some historic investigations. His specialists, particularly in Westminster, Whitehall, the City and sport, broke an embarrassment of exclusives, as I knew to my cost when news editing the Mail in the 80s.He also, in masterminding the paper’s journey from narrow socialism to broad liberalism, created a unique tone in which writers with many different voices, left and right, coexisted. But then, Peter’s paper had a compassion, a burning desire to confront social wrongs, a reasonableness and a tolerance that eschewed dogma.Others have rightly said that by seeing off the malicious militancy of the unions, and launching those highly profitable classified supplements, Peter saved the  from oblivion.But ultimately, it was G2 and his daring redesign of the main paper – with its emphasis on creative white – that were hugely significant in the transformation of a somewhat austere, highbrow regional paper that haemorrhaged losses into a radical, young, modern, profitable, respected global liberal media brand that saw off the ferocious, predatory price-cutting of the Times, routed the incursions of the Independent and achieved, at its height, a  circulation of 500,000.In April, a\u0026nbspprospectus\u0026nbspannounces a new paper for Manchester.

Whether he was ever reconciled to the digital revolution, though, I doubt. The reason, of course, was that he was, quite simply, a print man. He loved that magical symbiosis of newsprint, pictures, headlines, fonts and beautiful words that at their best can make a paper a functioning part of society rather than a commentary at its edges.Inevitably, sadly, those Fleet Street skills needed for that magic symbiosis are dying in an internet age that seems to have a voracious need for free, somewhat crudely expressed, round-the-clock information and gratification. Yes, of course, journalism will survive and may one day flourish again. But it will be different. Whether it will in future have the creative beauty and sheer power of Peter’s , I don’t know. But I do know – and there’s no presumption here – that, for the sake of our industry’s collective memory, we should salute a very great man of print.• Paul Dacre is editor of the Daily Mail.

Aaron Millar lists his favourite watering holesDenver is known as the “Napa Valley of Beer” for good reason: more hoppy delights are brewed here than anywhere else in the country. Add to that five gold medals at this year’s World Beer Cup Awards (or the Olympics of brewing, as it’s known), more than 100 artisan tap rooms, and the simple fact that beer tastes better looking at the mountains, having climbed mountains or talking about going to the mountains tomorrow. Like a brew with a view? Here are some of Denver’s top hop spots: Tivoli Brewing Company Denver’s oldest brewery has been serving up frothy refreshments since the first settlers arrived in 1859. Check out their historic taproom for a glass of Tivoli Helles Lager, a favourite of the early pioneers, which is still poured to this day.Wynkoop Brewing Company Established in 1988, this is Colorado’s first craft brewpub, and still one of its best and most notorious. Try their Rocky Mountain Oyster Stout, brewed with its namesake (bull’s testicles to you and me the region has no oysters).Ratio Beerworks Set up by a trio of former 90s punk rock touring musicians, this industrial-style taproom in the hip RiNo (River North) Arts District has taken the Denver craft beer scene by storm. Expect slick brews, a sweet patio and one of the coolest live music, arts and event line-ups in the city. Their Dear You French saison is already a classic beer.Denver Beer Trail With four walking routes – each through a different downtown neighbourhood – covering 14 miles and 35 taprooms in total, this is the ultimate craft-brew pub crawl, a half-marathon of beer. Great American Beer Festival Held in Denver each October, this is the largest beer party in the country, with more than 3,500 artisan, classic and rare brews on show. Want a sip of each? Well, good luck: a 1oz sample of every brew on display adds up to 220 pints, or about three bathtubs’ of beer.Telluride Blues \u0026amp Brews The best blues musicians on the planet alongside the best craft beer in the state, all served up in one of the Rockies’ most beautiful towns. It’s every Coloradan’s favourite end-of-summer brews event, and with good reason.If you prefer your glass with a stem, then here’s something to celebrate: with 300 days of sunshine a year, low humidity, and crisp mountain nights, Colorado is overflowing with wine as well as beer.

Could I find my place?On an overcast day in Oxford in 2003, a few weeks into the first year of an English literature degree, I found myself doing something out of character. I broke a rule. Rather than going to my scheduled tutorial, rather than sitting on the ungiving sofa and offering halting analysis of Middlemarch, I slotted a note into my tutor’s pigeonhole and darted out of Wadham College. I hadn’t told anyone I was going I was unsure if I would ever come back.I was unaccustomed to disobedience. I went to a large, fiercely aspirational comprehensive where for years I had been a picture of compliance. I had exceeded predicted grades and been garlanded at prize-givings. It followed that the result of such cheerful tractability and success should be continued tractability and success at the University of Oxford, the very place I was fleeing.As I rushed in my battered Converse, my heart thudded in weird patterns. I kept dropping things, stopping to scoop up my belongings. I couldn’t wait to get back to London, to my own bed, to my schoolfriends who were grownup-ly working in bars and bookshops, saving for gap-year adventures. I flopped on to a seat on the coach, alternating between weeping and snoring all the way down the M40. It was a bloody awful end to a bloody awful few weeks.Before I got to university, I had imagined that the much mythologised pressure of the place would come from on high: disciplinarian, gowned fellows would swoop around making all manner of unrealistic intellectual and organisational demands. But, on arrival, I found it was other students and their attitude to work that was most tricky.In the junior common room, over sweaty brie and cranberry paninis, the writing of essays was exclusively referred to as having an “essay crisis”. At dinner, in the grand dining hall, panicked girls asked how many paragraphs I had managed to write, how many more I intended to write that evening, if I was gearing up for an “all-nighter”. Was I worried about not having enough to say? Wasn’t I concerned that my ideas might be too thin? The whole business of thinking about texts – something I loved – was reframed as a pursuit full of risk and without pleasure.When studying for my A-levels, I had worked in a much more self-contained fashion. I did my homework in peace and quiet at the dining table. I stopped for regular dance breaks, stomping around the front room to MTV Base. But at Oxford the production of work came with an oppressive theatricality. I started to secrete myself away in my room, rather than engage in yet more competitive grandstanding about word counts. But there were other aspects of my fellow freshers’ behaviour that bothered me. I am not now, nor have I ever have been, a particular fan of Eminem’s oeuvre. But throughout that first fortnight the sentiments of the curt line “y’all act like you never seen a white person before” from The Real Slim Shady circled through my mind. The interactions I had with several students made me feel that my blackness was something curious, difficult to handle.At one of the endless icebreaker events, a history student told me that I must be really “into African beats” (what even are African beats?). A girl from another college launched into an expectant monologue about her gap year in Togo, keen to hear of my own “experiences of Africa”. My hair – arrayed in a cloud of messy twists – was the subject of profound speculation and inquiry. When I ventured into other Oxford colleges, the porters who guarded the entrances eyed me quizzically and checked my ID card with suspicion. In all fairness, my blackness was a surprise. As far as I could tell, in 2003 I was the only first-year undergraduate black male student reading English literature in the entire university. In my college, I was one of only two black freshers. (According to the official records, there were 21 British students who identified as black who accepted a place at Oxford that year. The total number of British students admitted was 2,940.)Lots of my closest friends at school were white and middle class, as were most of my teachers. So being in the minority was not unfamiliar. But in my A-level English class, there were people with Jamaican, Spanish, Polish, English, Pakistani, Irish and Nigerian heritages. Whiteness was surrounded by all kinds of racial ersity. So the very particular, ubiquitous whiteness of Oxford – a whiteness so self-confident that it didn’t notice itself, never needed to think critically about itself – struck the 18-year-old me. On many occasions in those first few weeks, it was my blackness that fellow newcomers found worthy of (awkward) conversation. Part of me now thinks about these interactions in an amused way often, it was youthful gaucheness. But I also have to be honest: those encounters – or microaggressions – left me feeling alienated and conflicted. Making these strangers face up to the cheapness of their interest in my heritage seemed unfriendly. So I remained silent, smiling, complicit. I knew that, if I were to launch into an anti-racist challenge, there were very few people of colour to come to my aid. I was fraught and sad, full of complicated anxieties about my sexual as well as my racial identity. How, I wanted to know, do you exist and survive as a black man in Oxford? How do you exist and survive as a black, gay man? I remember going to the welcome drinks for the university’s African and Caribbean students’ society. It was in a little basement bar filled with people drinking sticky shots and fluorescent cocktails. I largely withdrew I remember chatting with a Congolese zoology postgrad who looked as despondent about his surroundings as I did, without allowing the conversation to get very far. I spent the evening skulking by the exit and thinking I should be focusing harder on integrating with my white counterparts, rather than hiding myself away with the black folk. Did this society exist mainly because these young black people felt unwelcome at Oxford? I doubt things are very different for today’s BAME students – a few months ago, the admissions figures revealed that more than a quarter of Oxford colleges failed to admit a single black British student between 2015 and 2017.What I recall most vividly about those first few days, as I walked among sandstone and privilege, was feeling noticed and observed. Trying to shake off that sense of intense surveillance was what made me take the coach home on that grey Monday afternoon.My mother was gentle with me when I turned up without warning on her doorstep. For a few days, she left me to my own devices, letting me mooch around our maisonette. She offered me bowls brimming with her piquant chicken soup. Mum took her time before asking what had happened. I said I wanted to take a year out. She made a small and knowing snort, before calmly and evenly saying: “No. That is not the answer. Not the answer at all.” I needed, according to Mum, to find a way through whatever difficulties had made me run away, rather than dodging and delaying and deferring. I was, as she saw it, more than clever enough to figure it out.My mother can sometimes be a stubborn soul: if she sees one sensible way of doing something, then that is the way it will be done. In my earlier teenage years, such rigidity had sometimes created tension between us, but now, amid all of my unhappiness and fuzzy thinking, my mother’s certainty was useful. And kind. Three days after I ran away, Mum sent me back to Oxford with washed laundry, Tupperware full of delicious jollof and the memory of her keen glare. On the journey back, I thought of a trip we had made to Ghana a few months before I started at Oxford, when my mother and I went to bury my grandmother. Ghanaian funerals are protracted, demanding affairs, but throughout the noisy, painful process my tiny mother was the epitome of grit and poise. When I returned to my desk, I sometimes quietly remembered that, hoping I had inherited some of her resilience.I also thought about how university was a special, singular opportunity to experience things beyond the narrative of adversity young black men sometimes find themselves mired in – or have thrust upon them. I didn’t want to be another black boy crushed by a different kind of system. So I resolved to really, really enjoy myelf. I wrote a couple of shoddy plays. I wrote some outlandish essays – my favourite one argued that John Donne and Tracey Emin were, like, the same? I wore silly costumes to fancy dress parties – a recalcitrant baby one week, a 1950s secretary the next. I had “gatherings” in my room where people stretched condoms over the smoke alarms so we could puff away on our Marlboro Lights. I stood in the middle of a packed, sweaty house party and – doing what felt like the unimaginable at that point – confidently snogged a boy in front of everyone. I certainly don’t think I ever “mastered” being at Oxford. There were many occasions when I shoved my head under my pillow for a pause. But mostly I began to feel more in charge of the kind of time I was having.Not only did I learn about Tennyson and Woolf, I also learned how to articulate my emotions and anxieties. By opening up, I discovered that, beneath the shiny appearance of coping, those who would go on to become some of my closest friends had their own problems: profound homesickness, experiencing misogyny, classism, regionalism, the difficulty of starting a relationship in a strange new world. Sharing these stories was restorative. Talking through some of the absurdity I was presented with – the fragile public school boy who was affronted when I had the gall to say I “wasn’t sure” about the work of a poet he liked, or the girl whom I overheard describing me to someone as “erm, you know, the, erm, one who… erm…wears the scarves?”, rather than calling me black – was liberating. When my parents came to my graduation, we decided to begin the day by taking a quick turn around the college grounds. I walked them through the entrance I had bolted from years before. I pointed out the window of my first-year room now someone else’s bland posters surrounded the large mirror on the back wall.I remembered how, in my first spring term, I had stood in that room and looked in the mirror as I got myself ready to go on a date, with a girl. Two friends knocked on my door. Perhaps they had an inkling that going out with a girl might not, in the long run, be what I was after. But because they understood that I was trying to figure out what I actually wanted, and because it didn’t matter whether I was interested in boys or girls, or both or none, and because they wanted to see me happy, they bundled in, full of enthusiastic questions. They dispensed casual advice and rigorous critiques of my outfit. We whacked on some Beyoncé and danced around the room.The date was a total failure: she brought her friend with her, which I was not expecting the bar was too noisy to hear anyone speak. After extricating myself, I plodded home over the cobbles, overcome with embarrassment.But I tried as hard as I could to think otherwise: I reasoned that, when I got back to college, I would tell my friends what had happened. They would demand that I didn’t skimp on the detail. There would be red wine to ease the storytelling. They would be tickled by the ridiculousness of it all. And they would come up with consoling and clever wisdoms – observations I could never have come up with on my own.• Michael Donkor’s debut novel, Hold, is published on 12 July by Fourth Estate at £12.99.

This prequel to the hugely successful dystopian horror series explains the why and how of the social experiment. Devised by Dr May Updale (Marisa Tomei), who declares her interest as “psychological” rather than “political”, the controlled experiment is quickly co-opted by ruling rightwing political party New Founding Fathers’ chief of staff Arlo Sabian (Patch Darragh) into a chilling evening of sanctioned ethnic cleansing.The experiment is confined to New York’s Staten Island, chosen because of its largely black and Latino “demographic”, with residents offered a stipend of $5,000 to remain on the island, and bonus cash for active participation. Sabian is furious to discover that this socioeconomic group is “not proceeding in the manner we expected” – the locals congregate in community spaces rather than killing each other – and sends death squads in minstrel masks in the name of “social catharsis” and “population control”. Though the other Purge films were similarly interested in government conspiracy theory and class warfare, this timely instalment audaciously, and explicitly, frames the purge as racist. Imagery that evokes Charleston, the Rodney King beating and the Ku Klux Klan isn’t a shorthand but a disturbing literalisation of racially coded violence.Although DeMonaco wrote the script, African American film-maker Gerard McMurray steps in as director, overseeing a mostly black and Latino cast. Among them\u0026nbspare dreadlocked activist Nya (Lex Scott Davis) and her drug-dealing ex-boyfriend D’mitri (Insecure’s Y’lan Noel), who strips down to his\u0026nbspvest and single-handedly takes on a team of tower-block assassins\u0026nbspin the film’s Die Hard-esque finale. The Purge films are B-movies, and so this ultraviolence mostly works, though its social commentary is served a little too rare to stomach easily."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bd9adb670840da35440f02cb2ebec47c2c92c25f/71_269_4135_2481/master/4135.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bb75e4741bb036b7bf89dbaf3d7b2114","title":"eden hazard belgium brazil world cup","story":"There was a moment late in Belgium’s win over Brazil on Friday when Eden Hazard led a break. He charged into the opposition half, turned back inside and, as runners went by him, taking defenders with them, space opened up for a pass out to the left to the substitute Youri Tielemans. There was an overlap, a chance of a third goal that would have finished the game. Hazard saw it. He tried to play it. But his legs, for once, did not obey. The ball set off in the right direction but with nothing like enough pace Marcelo intercepted. Hazard had essentially been too exhausted to pass a ball 40 yards. Like the rest of the team, he was spent.If Brazil had found a late equaliser, there could only have been one winner in extra time. Belgium had given everything, including Hazard, who does not necessarily have a reputation for industry. That, and his slightly diffident personality, lay at the heart of his difficult relationship with José Mourinho at Chelsea. But here he ran until he could run no more.Hazard has said that his model was always Ronaldinho: he wanted to do his tricks and play with a smile on his face. He watched the Brazilian and copied his moves. He works much harder than Ronaldinho ever did and often wears a frown of concentration rather than the broad grin of his idol, but still, the original lurks beneath the surface he jokingly refers to Chelsea’s training ground as “Cobham-cabana”. And against Brazil, Hazard was exceptional, as all of Belgium’s front three were.His job, in a sense, was simple. This was not the inside-forward role he has been occupying for Belgium and that he has played for Chelsea over the past two seasons. In Kazan, he started wide in a 4-3-3 but with a brief to cut infield into the spaces left when Kevin De Bruyne dropped deep from his false 9 position. Hazard was up against the one potential weak link in the Brazil side, the third-choice right‑back, Fagner. Mexico’s Carlos Vela had dominated him early on in the last 16 clash in Samara Hazard treated him like a slightly cumbersome training cone. He succeeded with all of his first five dribbles.After the match, Tite, the Brazil coach, retracted his earlier lament to God about all the injuries his side have suffered, but said this would have been a different game had Dani Alves not been ruled out before the tournament. It might have been a different game even if Danilo had been fit.Fagner was exposed and unable to cope. Brazil’s switch to 4-4-2 at half-time meant Gabriel Jesus offered a measure of cover, but by then Belgium led 2-0. As Romelu Lukaku bullocked down one flank, overwhelming with Marouane Fellaini and Thomas Meunier a Brazilian left that proved too geared to attack, Hazard sliced away on the other side: two different threats, both released by Roberto Martínez’s brave tactical shift, both devastatingly effective.It was a performance that could have long-term consequences. The situation at Chelsea is farcical. Antonio Conte may be sacked next week, or he may still turn up for work, the world’s most implausible George Costanza, to take training when the first wave of players return for pre‑season on Monday.There has been talk for years about Real Madrid possibly making a move for Hazard, and it has grown louder of late, while Hazard notably did not play down talk of a transfer after the FA Cup final in May.Although it is hard ever to be sure what is posturing, Cristiano Ronaldo’s representatives are at least in some sort of negotiations with Juventus. If the vacancy does not open up this summer, it will sooner rather than later. Florentino Pérez, the Madrid president, is often swayed by World Cups. After Mesut Özil in 2010 and James Rodríguez in 2014, could Hazard be his big post-tournament splurge this year?Certainly if this were a head-to-head audition against Neymar – football matches very rarely are these days, except when impressionable presidents are involved – there was only one winner.Neymar increasingly feels a victim of his own celebrity, his need to be the star in the biopic of his own life. His best football came at Barcelona, when the weight of Lionel Messi, Luis Suárez and the entire post-Cruyffian machine forced a measure of submission to the collective.Without that, at Paris Saint-Germain and with Brazil, his solipsism runs unchecked – as it would if you had been told since you were a child that you were the new Pelé. Hours after the final whistle, he wandered alone around the car park outside the Kazan Arena, either unable to find the Brazil bus or reluctant to board it, a poignant figure struggling under the toxic combination of his own ego and his country’s expectations.Hazard is very different, quieter, more introverted, less self-confident. He will not illuminate a room with a smile. He will not send hordes of impressionable teenagers clutching the latest snap of their hero to the hairdressers. He may not relish the circus that Madrid so often becomes.But he will follow a tactical plan, he will not overelaborate and he will devastate a full-back who gives him half a chance. In a post-Ronaldo world, Hazard may be just the non-celebrity Real Madrid need. Whatever else he is, he is a supremely skilful and effective footballer."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/18ad4cf8c543c1c1211971374f1c3668f3de94ac/0_258_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1067c977a462ec67d5560f49ed6a932e","title":"england sweden world cup quarter final match report","story":"At the final whistle, the players in red converged on one another. Gareth Southgate was locked in a bear hug with his staff and a party was already under way behind the goal to their right. England had booked their place in a World Cup semi-final and it has been so long coming – over a quarter of a century since the last occasion – it was probably just inevitable that they would soon be dancing on the pitch as well as in the stands.If we were to be picky, a legitimate argument could be made that, yes, England will need to play with more finesse if they really are to harbour the most serious of ambitions in this tournament. They will have to pass the ball with greater efficiency and maybe, in possession, show a touch more arrogance, in the manner of a side that really believes they can do it. France, for example. Or Belgium.For now, however, Southgate and his players are entitled to cherish these moments bearing in mind the last time it happened Bobby Robson was manager and Spitting Image’s puppet of the England manager was a senile worrier called Rubbisho. Turin, 1990, with the penalties, Gazza’s tears and all that, is written into England’s history. This time maybe there will be a happier ending. England could be forgiven for wondering what glories might lie ahead and, on this evidence, they should not hold any fears about meeting Russia or Croatia in Moscow on Wednesday.Why not be confident, after all, when England have now scored as many goals, 11, as Alf Ramsey’s team did to win the competition in 1966? Eight of them, astonishingly, have come from set-plays, the latest being the header from Harry Maguire to swing this game in England’s favour from a corner on the half-hour mark.Dele Alli soothed any lingering nerves with the second goal just before the hour and, amid all the euphoria, Southgate might at some point need his team to play considerably better than they did in their latest victory. Early on, in particular, it must have been disconcerting for the manager to see the way his team struggled to find any rhythm and in those periods it was tempting to wonder whether the occasion had gotten to a couple of players.In their previous games, England had been so quick to set the tempo, passing the ball incisively and making it clear, from the first minute, that they would be happy to take the game to their opponents. That was not the case here. Everything seemed so laboured and, until the goal, it was difficult to remember a single noteworthy chance other than perhaps when Harry Kane let fly from 20 yards and put the ball past the post.Ultimately, though, that sluggish start can quickly be forgotten given the way England assumed control once they had taken the lead from their first corner of the match. No player in this tournament has won more aerial challenges than Maguire and it was strange, to say the least, that Sweden had designated Emil Forsberg to mark him. Maguire, to put it into context, had a seven-inch advantage. It was a mismatch, and when the ball thudded off Maguire’s forehead England had scored from a corner for the fourth time in this tournament.To be critical for a moment, there is a school of thought that says England are straying close to being too reliant on set-piece goals. A better argument, perhaps, is that Southgate’s players have discovered a useful weapon to help outscore opponents. And besides, it is not as though England are incapable of putting together scoring opportunities through open play. Their second goal here was the case in point, featuring a concerted spell of attack-minded possession, a pass played back by Kieran Trippier, the cross from Jesse Lingard and, finally, Alli with a header at the far post.Sweden will reflect on the saves Jordan Pickford made from Marcus Berg at the start of the second half and, brilliantly again, when Viktor Claesson had the chance, at 2-0, to change the complexion of the match. By then however, England had emerged as the dominant team, controlling the ball and unfortunate perhaps that the best of their chances fell to Raheem Sterling rather than, say, Kane.Sterling’s first one-on-one with Robin Olsen ended in a late offside flag, though England’s No 10 was not to know that. The second would have made it 2-0 at the interval and, though it was largely inconsequential in the end, this is the stage of the competition when Southgate desperately needs his front players to have ice in their veins. For all his many qualities, Sterling turns to slush too often and he will need no reminding that his England record has now stretched to two goals from 41 appearances.No matter. Sterling played his part, always running, looking to create mischief, and England got through the game without any yellow cards for the three players - Kyle Walker, Jordan Henderson and Lingard - who would have missed the semi-final with another booking. Southgate’s team will be at full strength in Moscow. Anything, as he says, is possible."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5af6338a96188144dbde5588b8a8c5eacccc8646/0_0_4717_2831/master/4717.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=282f22b78062616331ab1746fc743b92","title":"six things you may not know about harry kane","story":"The lowdown on England’s captain and World Cup Golden Boot contenderLike Beckham, Kane went to Chingford Foundation School. “Harry was clever, articulate and very humble,” said the English teacher Denis McElligott, who managed one of the school football teams in which Kane starred. “If we were struggling during a game, the tactic would be ‘just give it to Harry’, and he would smash one in from the corner flag.” Also like Beckham he has gone on to captain England and star in ads for men’s fragrances unlike Beckham he is engaged to an old schoolfriend rather than a pop star and has refused to cover himself in tattoos because “my dad always told me I would regret it when I was older”.As a child Kane played for Ridgeway Rovers, where Beckham and Andros Townsend also began their careers, but was rejected by Arsenal and Tottenham and had an unsuccessful trial at Watford. Liam Brady, who was in charge of Arsenal’s academy at the time, said one of the main reasons they let him go was that he was overweight. “He was a bit chubby,” he said. “He wasn’t very athletic, but we made a mistake.” While at Watford he played so well in a game against Tottenham that their coaches decided to re-sign him. “If you’d have said to me at 11 or even 14, would he go on to have the career he’s had? I probably would have said: ‘I doubt it,’” says David Bricknell, who coached him a Ridgeway.The Tottenham striker may be the most deadly marksman at the World Cup, having scored, remarkably, with all six of his shots on target, but 24 players at the tournament have had more than his nine shots. These are not typical Kane statistics, and reflect the limited number of chances England have created: at the European Championship two years ago he had 13 shots and failed to score at all, while in the most recent Premier League season he had 184 goal attempts, 40 more than anyone else and nearly twice the tally of third-place Christian Eriksen (97), 108 of which were off target, and 30 of which went in.Kane and his fiancée, Katie Goodland, have a family home in Essex, complete with swimming pool, cinema-cum-golf-simulator room and temporary World Cup-themed viewing tipi, which they share with their daughter, Ivy, and their two dogs. But last year the Tottenham manager, Mauricio Pochettino, revealed that Kane has a second house near Tottenham’s training ground where he stays during the week, allowing him to spend extra hours honing his skills. His work ethic is infamous, though his golden rule of goalscoring is extremely simple: “When you get a clear sight of goal, aim low and hard across the goalkeeper,” he says. “These are the most difficult shots to save.”Since being introduced to the sport by his fiancee’s brother, Kane has become fascinated by American football. One of his dogs is named after the quarterback Tom Brady, whose story of being underestimated as a youth but through a bit of talent and a lot of graft working his way to fame and glory particularly chimes. “He reminded me of me,” Kane said. “Brady believed in himself so much – and he just kept working and working, almost obsessively, in order to get better.” His dream is to become an NFL placekicker when he hangs up his soccer boots. “It depends on how my career goes and injuries and how I age,” he said, “but I’d love to.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b73815f468d8ee62a41eac670f4846e24c47242a/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4c08c2b07d4461bfc31f898de53abee9","title":"fifa world cup media scrum wait list barney ronay","story":"The Wait List – and the frantic ticket-seeking scrum surrounding it – is a window into the Fifa machine and its ability to wring every last drop from a global passionAnd what did you see my blue eyed son? And what did you see my darling young ones? I saw a Peruvian TV anchor with a sweat-soaked pastel blazer. I saw a Thai radio crew in a state of mild hysteria. I saw the man from the Deccan Herald being elbowed by Spaniards. I saw 200 tired, flustered people with digestive problems carrying Sochi 2016 rucksacks and pleading in 17 languages for an overflow desk.It is generally assumed Bob Dylan’s haunting, visceral lyrics to the song A Hard Rain’s A-Gonna Fall, quoted above, were inspired by a vision of impending apocalypse. Perhaps the terror of the Cuban missile crisis that year or the spectacle of America’s gathering military-industrial complex.Less well known is the fact the song was written shortly after Dylan had made a trip to the 1962 World Cup in Chile where, as an accredited acoustic entertainer, he happened to be present in the Santiago press centre to witness the first ever Wait List media ticket distribution process. This could just be coincidence. Dylan has never specifically denied the connection.A column about the haunting, visceral spectacle of the World Cup media ticket Wait List. Nobody’s going to read that, said every quietly disappointed desk editor ever. But you never know.The Wait List, which will be in swing an hour before each of this weekend’s fixtures, is a glimpse into the Fifa machine. It is also at times a very funny experience, provided your idea of a good joke is having your face pressed into the armpit of a massively stressed 17-stone Argentinian cameraman.There are around 5,000 accredited media at Russia 2018. These are ided into sub-categories of written press, broadcast crews and non-specific well-dressed people who sit around talking and laughing when you’re 10 minutes off deadline.The Wait List is how these various types get match tickets and mixed zone passes when they’ve missed out in the ballot, either because they lack specific A-list entitlement for that game or because of some gruelling logistical balls-up.And so they come as kick-off looms, crammed in with all the other people on the verge of failing to complete the job they travelled thousands of miles to do, having begged their bosses or bank managers for the chance, gathered at the railings of the Fifa desk like refugees staring across the Volga at the last boat out of Stalingrad.Among the sneaky elbows, the Putas and Scheisses and Pizdets, in this place where almost every single person is from a different country, you can find a camaraderie too. There’s the Scandinavian man I pushed in front of in Moscow who said, ah, you reviewed my book six years ago. The Ghanaian woman who finds the food a bit indigestible. The Indian bloke I’ve stood next to in the Wait List at two, maybe three successive tournaments and who nods curtly each time as though this is the local Tesco  or the bus stop.Eventually, the Fifa lady will arrive. The excitement cranks up. The faces become more gaunt with longing. Someone will crack at this stage and start yelling or trying to break through the barriers. Silently, the Fifa helpers glide forward and lead away the man from Peru who has lost his wallet and is sleeping in a cupboard and hasn’t got into a single game yet. He looks remorseful. Respect it. Respect the Wait List.The Fifa lady looks calm. But then she has to. She’s all we’ve got. I’ve come to appreciate the Fifa lady. She’s scrupulously fair. She sticks to the list in strict order of arrival. She has a patient, pitying air, like the head nurse in the bed-wetting terminal loser ward. I trust her. I obey her. I … love her.As the air crackles with event glamour, the names finally start to come. “Mr Zheng, China Daily.” “The Congolese Football Association.” Each one draws a hateful hush. At the last World Cup there was a heady occasion where I was the first name read out off the Wait List (“BIRRRNY!! ROWWWNAY!!”). To my enduring shame I came skipping up like a contestant on a TV game show, waving the ticket above my head like it was a voucher for a brand new fridge freezer.There will be a lot of this kind of thing when England play Sweden in Samara, a massive game in a non-massive stadium in the shirt-soaking heat of the south. As for the semis and the final, well, the scrum will be monster‑scale, a mass three-day wrangle for access.This is just the scale of Big Football now, the ceaseless clamour around an ever-more engorged global beano. The current World Cup has confirmed what we knew, that the planetary obsession has simply intensified, that we cannot get enough of this stuff, cramming down great dripping handfuls, gasping always for more.The TV viewing figures are vertiginous. Fifa announced this week it has had 89m hits on a social media platform I’ve never even heard of and at times football does feel a little overpowering. In the Fifa grasp it can seem atomised, something to be relentlessly wrung out, a commodity dispensed only from behind the VIP rope.Where did all this obsession come from? Can it just keep on happening? Will we ever find ourselves un-hooked? Is enough ever really enough? How many Wait Lists must a man walk down? The answer to all of these, my fellow guests behind the railings, is blowing in the Fifa-partnered wind."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf50745d3df6603f09e5cfd739bea91b3b03c44d/0_0_3936_2624/master/3936.jpg?w=660\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=c321e59afd8c5661cd865c9f0f54300b 1320w","title":"russia v croatia world cup 2018 quarter final live","story":"There are two men in Russia’s XI who could put a little pressure on Golden Boot pacesetter (and World Cup semi-finalist!) Harry Kane. Arten Dzyuba and Denis Cheryshev both have three goals to their name another one or two tonight would see them close the gap on England’s striking sensation. Luka Modric is Croatia’s leading scorer in this tournament with two.Russia and Croatia have played each other in competitive football on two previous occasions. Both times in qualifying for Euro 2008 both matches ended goalless. Nothing to see there. Their only other match was a Rostov friendly the best part of three years ago. Russia led that one at the break, Fedor Smolov scoring, but Nikola Kalinic, Marcelo Brozovic and Mario Mandzukic turned things round in the second half: 3-1 to Croatia.Russia will take solace in the fact that when World Cup hosts reach the quarters, they usually make the semis. Italy (1990), France (1998), South Korea (2002), Germany (2006) and Brazil (2014) all advanced Mexico in 1986 were the last quarter-finalist hosts to stumble, losing on penalties to West Germany. So while the head-to-head doesn’t look too promising for the Sbornaya, history offers a bit of hope elsewhere.A peek inside the changing rooms. Russia will be playing in their first-choice red shirts tonight. They’re lovely tops ... and yet they’re not icons of beauty like the famous old CCCP gear. To be fair, that’s an impossibly high sartorial standard to maintain. Their keeper-captain Igor Akinfeev will be handing over this very lovely pennant before kick-off.Croatia meanwhile will play in second-choice black jerseys, with a dark-blue check on the front. You may notice a hole in the worktop for trash, but no receptacle underneath. Where’s the Japan team when you need them?Both teams make just the one change to their second-round starting XIs. Russia replace the injured Yuri Zhirkov of Zenit with Villarreal’s Denis Cheryshev. Croatia swap Internazionale’s Marcelo Brozovic with Andrej Kramaric of Hoffenheim.If the games already played at the Fisht Stadium during this World Cup are anything to go by, we’re in for a cracker tonight. There have been five matches staged here, and that number includes the spectacular 3-3 draw between Portugal and Spain – which seems like an age ago, doesn’t it? – Germany’s ultimately futile late show against Sweden, and Edinson Cavani’s swashbuckling evisceration of Portugal. More please, Fisht Stadium!It’s the 24th day of the 2018 World Cup, and you’d have got good odds at the start on the hosts outlasting world champions Germany, European champions Portugal, Spain, Argentina, and Brazil. But unlike Thomas Müller, Cristiano Ronaldo, Andrés Iniesta, Lionel Messi and Neymar, Igor Akinfeev and his team-mates are - like Harry Kane, Harry Maguire, Dele Alli et al! - still standing, and here we all are.Russia are bidding to reach the semi-finals for only the second time in their history. Their only previous visit to the last four came in 1966 when, competing as the Soviet Union, they saw off one of the great Hungary sides in the quarters. They smothered and outfought Ferenc Bene, Flórián Albert and János Farkas Igor Chislenko and Valeriy Porkujan scored the goals the legendary Lev Yashin made a couple of decisive saves. The USSR won 2-1, and went on to finish fourth, losing to West Germany in the semis and Portugal in the third-place play-off.Their opponents today, Croatia, are also looking to make the last four for the second time. The first came early in the independent country’s history, at France 98, when they saw off an ageing Germany 3-0 in the quarters. As the World Cup said goodbye to Jürgen Klinsmann and Lothar Matthäus, it also celebrated Croatia’s golden generation: Zvonimir Boban, Davor Šuker, Robert Prosinečki, all that. Šuker gave them the lead in the resulting semi against France, but Lilian Thuram had other ideas. The Croats settled for third spot, beating the Dutch in the play-off.On paper, you’d have to fancy a Croatia team boasting Luka Modrić, Ivan Rakitić and Mario Mandžukić to progress tonight. But then Denis Cheryshev and Aleksandr Golovin haven’t been too shabby themselves, and at this tournament you just never know. Both sides took turns to impress during the group stage, Russia swatting aside Saudi Arabia and Egypt, Croatia seeing off Argentina in style. Both were a bit more functional in the second round, grinding out wins on penalty kicks over Spain and Denmark respectively. Croatia will be hoping to rediscover some of their early sass Russia are expected to set their stall out for another defensive masterclass. So this could be a fascinating battle. And the prize on offer is huge: a Moscow semi-final on Wednesday against Gareth Southgate’s increasingly confident England in this wonderfully open World Cup!

Bye!England are still in the World Cup, it’s matchday, and Sir Bobby Charlton is spending the afternoon at Wimbledon:“I never thought I’d find myself defending “Big Sam”, but these are strange days indeed,” writes Richard Bedwell. “I’m a big fan of how Southgate has approached the England manager’s job and he seems like someone I’d much prefer to share a pint with down the pub but it’s unfair on Allardyce to accuse him of not bringing “intellectual rigour” to the table. He was every bit as responsible as Wenger for dragging English football kicking and screaming into the sports science era and did it on a much tighter budget.”This is certainly true, but as his top-level career progressed I got the impression that Allardyce had developed and honed his methods, and that at some point he ceased changing or even questioning them.John Hadvall tips me off about this Aftonbladet preview to the game, which concludes that England have “got it in the bag” and wishes them “all the best for the semifinal and final”, before introducing the predicted Swedish starting XI, which includes “the most injury prone player in Bundesliga history” and someone who is “literally a sh*t Jamie Vardy”.

Here’s how he saw events unfold.Gareth Southgate speaks: ““We knew we would have the majority of the ball, the question was whether we could break them down,” says England’s manager in an interview with the BBC. “We’d identified a few areas where we might do that and we got the goals from both of them.“We scored from set plays because we got into good areas on the pitch. Sweden are well-organised, they make things tough and over the years we’ve underestimated them. Today, our spirit was as good as theirs but our quality was a little bit better.”Sweden’s manager speaks: “What went wrong?” says Janne Andersson. “I am not sure anything went wrong as such. We didn’t get to our best. We had things under control until they had that corner.”Fabian Delph speaks: In an interview with the BBC’s Gabby Logan, the midfielder has just spoken about the weirdness of being at the World Cup, then going home to attend the home birth of his third daughter, the fans he met on the school run while on his mini-break from the England camp. He ends his interview by saying that he and his wife can’t decide on a name for the new born baby that the whole family agree on and finishes up by describing his other half as “a machine”. Hmmm ...Reward the likes of Jordan Pickford, Raheem Sterling, Kieran Trippier and Harry Maguire for their outstanding performances against Sweden with our handy gizmo.“It’s a great result,” says England’s goalkeeper to the Beeb. “We knew it was going to be difficult against Sweden. We know what they were going to bring to the part and we knew what he had to bring our A-game.”On the atmosphere: “It was quality,” he says. “England fans are different class. We really enjoy playing and when the fans are like that it makes us very relaxed. I think the last time England were in a semi-final was 1990 and I wasn’t born then. We can go and create our own history, but now it’s all about rest and recovery.”“It’s a great achievement for the team,” says the scorer of England’s second goal in an interview with the BBC. “We owed it to the fans back home because we’ve seen how they’re supporting us.” On his goal: “It’s always nice to score, espeically on an occasion like this but personally I didn’t think it was one of my better games. It was a real graft out there. It was important we had belief in our game plan, dominating possession. It was important that we stuck to what we were doing and moved the ball quickly.”He finishes up with a few kind words for England’s goalkeeper Jordan Pickford, who was outstanding today. Here’s our snap report on England’s quarter-final win at the Samara Arena. We’ll have a more detailed report, along with post-match reaction, quotes and comment from the  posse at the Samara Arena shortly.Harry Kane: “Probably not,” says England’s skipper upon being asked if this win has sunk in yet by the BBC. “There was so much preparation for this game. I thought we were fantastic. Sweden made it tough ... long balls from the back ... lots of crosses ... we’re buzzing! We’re buzzing! We know there’s still a big game ahead – the semi-final. We just have to go again. We’re enjoying it. We’ve got to keep doing what we’re doing.”Harry Maguire: “We felt like we could dominate the ball today,” said the scorer of England’s first goal. “We could control the play. It was a bit sloppy towards the end of the second half when it was too open.” Easy for England: Their players embrace each other and salute the travelling England fans as the camera cuts occasionally to assorted Swedes sobbing in the crowd. Jordan Pickford made some excellent saves today, but despite the goalkeeper being called upon on three different occasions, the outcome of this game never looked in any doubt.Sweden were poor abject at times, but created enough chances to win the game nonetheless. If they’d taken those chances, the result going their way would have been a complete travesty. One suspects England had plenty more left in the tank if they’d needed it.Peep! Peep! Peeeeeeep! It’s all over. England are through to the World Cup semi-final, where they will face Russia or Croatia. Harry Maguire and Dele Alli got the goals as they overcame a Sweden side that made life rather easy for their English opponents in Samara.90+3 min: England’s serene procession to the semi-final is almost complete. They’ve had it pretty easy today, against a Sweden side that can be pleased with making it this far in the competition, taking some notably high profile scalps along the way. For all that, they haven’t done themselves justice today.90 min: Ludwig Augustinsson takes the free-kick and sends it screaming high over the bar. That is an awful effort. 89 min: Sweden win a free-kick just outside the England penalty area, right of centre.88 min: Sterling gets in behind Lindelof and tries to get a cross in from the left. It’s blocked and the ball breaks back into the square yard of no-mans land between Delph and Sterling. They both leave it to each other to do something with it and it spins it out of play. This is the kind of telepathy they’ve developed during their time together at Manchester City. 87 min: Harry Maguire gets booked for kicking the ball away in frustration after being penalised for a foul on John Guidetti. The two players exchange unpleasantries and Guidetti is booked too. 86 min: Another free-kick for England wide on the right after a foul on Lingard. Trippier whips in a good delivery, but Sweden clear.85 min: England substitution: Eric Dier on for Jordan Henderson. Sweden substitution: Pontus Jansson on for Emil Krafth.84 min: England win a free-kick wide on the right. Trippier’s delivery is uncharacteristically poor and goes straight out of play.84 min: Lingard tries his luck with a curling effort from distance, but it’s intercepted. 81 min: Jordan Pickford and John Stones both eff and jeff liberally and in the strongest possible terms in the face of Sweden’s Marcus Berg after England’s goalkeeper was forced off his line to pluck a ball towards the Swedish forward from the sky. I am not sure what exactly Berg done to displease them, but they seem very cross with him. Chill out, lads. 80 min: There’s a break in play as Krafth has to receive treatment for an injury. England’s players take the opportunity to get some fluids on board. 77 min: Another wonderful knee-height cross from Trippier that Sterling hopes to poke home at the far post. Krafth makes a crucial interception. 75 min: England substitution: Fabian Delph on for goalscoring’s Dele Alli. Referee Bjorn Kuipers is forced to intervene when Alli turns his back to the technical area and pretends he doesn’t know it’s him who is making way in a bid to waste time. Expect this exhibition of amateur theatrics to be cited as further evidence of the new, more “streetwise” England in the post-match coverage.72 min: Another good save from Pickford, who palms over the bar from Berg’s shot on the turn from 12 yards or so. The Swede should have scored their after being teed up by Guidetti’s pass from the left. A dreadful miss, but Pickford’s playing a goalkeeper who just isn’t going to concede today. 70 min: England win a corner. Trippier sends the ball into the mixer, but Sweden clear.69 min: Raheem Sterling attacks down the inside left, then attempts to pick out Harry Kane with a curling delivery across the face of goal. Granqvist intercepts, but his makes a pig’s ear of his clearance. The ball drops kindly for Dele Alli, whose volley goalwards is blocked by the Sweden captain.67 min: Sweden double-substitution: Martin Olsson and John Guidetti come on for Emil Forsberg and Ola Toivonen.66 min: The ball pinballs around the Sweden penalty area towards the end of another England attack. It breaks for Harry Maguire in a good position, but he balloons the ball high, wide and out of the stadium.63 min: With the game completely open and England in control, Sweden had a wonderful opportunity to pull a goal back there. Claesson was on hand to steer a Berg lay-off towards the bottom left-hand corner. Pickford’s save was sensational, but he steered the ball straight back into the path of Claesson. He had a second bite of the cherry, but Henderson blocked.62 min: Jordan Pickford saves brilliantly again, getting down to his right to save a low Viktor Claesson drive from about 10 yards. Jordan Henderson is on hand to block the follow-up shot when England looked certain to concede.61 min: This is shaping up to be a potential massacre as England look totally rampant against a Swedish side that appear clueless in the face of this imperialistic onslaught. Oh, hold on ...59 min: Completely unmarked at the far post, Dele Alli heads home from about five yards out after leaping to convert a Jesse Lingard cross from the right. In the Samara Arena, It’s Coming Home by Baddiel, Skinner and The Lightning Seeds blares out over the PA System. Well, that was coming. Dele Alli doubles England’s lead. 56 min: England players form a line of six in the Sweden penalty area as they wait for Trippier to send the ball in. His delivery is typically excellent, but Granqvist gets a crucial touch.56 min: England are almost totally dominant and win a corner as they turn the screw. Lingard tries a shot from distance which goes out of Krafth.55 min: Sterling canters down the right flank and sends in a cross. Sweden clear again, but are looking very shaky."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bc0073ae6d89858ae8f28f4082fe9cf63f8314e7/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4823aa293b457f603de5ae7e9c337bd8","title":"golden boot standings top scorers for russia 2018 world cup","story":"The first official Fifa World Cup award for the player to score the most goals in the competition went to Paolo Rossi in 1982.

As we step off the train, both of us are thinking about the casual damage that may await us after leaving the house and its contents in the care of the youngest one and the middle one for 30 hours: appliances broken, leaks sprung, supplies decimated.Outside the pub next to the station, my wife slows her step.“Do you think he’s working today?” she says. She means the youngest one.“I think he said he was,” I say.“Shall we say hello?” my wife says. It would be, of course, the last thing he’d want: an unscheduled parental drop-by at his place of employment. He would be obliged, in the circumstances, to treat us like customers.“Absolutely,” I say.The tables under the umbrellas outside are full, but the pub’s interior is dark, cool and quiet. At the far end of the room, a big-eyed urchin is hard at work behind the bar, answering the drinking needs of the alfresco clientele. “It’s still funny,” I say.“It’s true,” my wife says. “Why is it still funny?”“Because it’s so incongruous,” I say. “It’s like leaving an eagle in charge of a newsagents.”The youngest one is pouring a pint while simultaneously adding soda water to two glasses. As we approach, he looks up. His eyeballs make a brief, world-weary survey of the ceiling, then return to the pint glass in his hand. “You’re back,” he says.“Oh yes,” my wife says, settling on to a bar stool. “Have we got time for a swift half?”“I think we do,” I say. “What sort of ales do you have, barman?”He looks along the range of taps, and then back at me. “These,” he says.“Two, please,” I say.“Is the dog still alive?” my wife says.“The last time I saw the dog, it was alive,” he says, filling one glass, then another. He cocks his head in the direction of the next customer, taking another order.“He looks taller in here,” my wife says.“That’s because the floor behind the bar is six inches higher,” I say.“That’s lucky,” she says. “Otherwise, he’d have to stand on a chair to reach the taps.”“Here you go,” he says, setting down two halves without making eye contact.“This is fun,” I say.A smartly dressed 10-year-old boy approaches the bar with a menu in one hand and £30 in the other. The youngest one leans across the bar to take his order. For a moment, their heads are both bent in grave consultation. The youngest one points to something on the menu and raises his eyebrows. The boy nods sternly and hands over the notes. My wife turns towards me. “Have you seen Bugsy Malone?” she asks.“Uh-huh,” I say.Drinks finished, we head to the nearest shop to stock up on things we’re almost certainly out off: milk, beer, ice-cream. We walk the final leg of our journey home in blistering heat. “You know what?” my wife says. “Good on him.”“Yes,” I say, not quite sure who we’re talking about.“He’s had that job for nearly a year,” she says. “He works hard.”“They all work hard, when they work,” I say.“I suppose,” she says.“It’s possible all our children have discovered some latent sense of responsibility,” I say.“Really?” my wife says.“A discovery that, for obvious reasons, they prefer to conceal from us.” At the corner, I can see that our house is demonstrably not on fire.“Do you have keys?” my wife asks as we reach the step. “Mine are right at the bottom of my bag.”“We won’t be needing them,” I say.When I open the door, the dog crashes into my knees. A minute later, the middle one comes down the stairs. “Yo,” he says.“Are these yours?” I say, holding up a set of keys.“Where were they?” he says.“Sticking out of the front door.”He smiles broadly. “Yeah, that makes sense,” he says."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9bb7de93e391def1bbdbb3ece28cff33234b0be3/0_840_4375_2625/master/4375.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bd878fea102da0ab5e2e39a47bb9f8a8","title":"yotam ottolenghi hummus recipes","story":"Up your game by serving it on aromatic cinnamon and ginger oil, or with roast garlic and mushrooms, or even under marinated grilled quail skewersHummus gets its name from the Arabic word for “chickpea”, and traditionally it contains just chickpeas, tahini, lemon juice and garlic olive oil is used only to finish it off on the plate. Other versions, based mainly on olive oil and containing anything from beetroot to avocado, I’ve always rejected as phoney imposters, but after making today’s three wonderful chickpea spreads with not so much as a gram of tahini among them, I couldn’t help but call them anything other than, well, “hummus”.This yields enough cooked chickpeas to make two of today’s other dishes. I like the idea of having two contrasting hummus dishes in one meal, but not everyone will share that sentiment. Luckily, cooked chickpeas freeze very well just defrost them and bring back up to room temperature before using. I say to cook the chickpeas for 45 minutes, but it can take substantially longer, depending on variety and freshness, so cook them until they’re completely soft.Soak OvernightPrep 5 minCook 45 minMakes 600g250g dried chickpeas1½ tsp bicarbonate of sodaSaltStart the day ahead by soaking the chickpeas overnight in plenty of cold water and a teaspoon of bicarbonate of soda. Drain and refresh, then put in a large pot with 1.8 litres of water and half a teaspoon more of bicarb. Bring to a boil on a medium-high heat, lower the heat to medium and cook for 30 minutes. Add a teaspoon of salt and cook for 15 minutes more, until the chickpeas are very soft when squashed between your fingers, but still hold their shape, then drain.Grab some crusty bread or pitta to mop up the fried aromatic oil with this hummus.

Blitz for about two minutes, until you have a smooth paste (you may need to scrape down the sides of the bowl a couple of times).For the fried aromatics, heat the oil in a medium pan on a medium heat, then gently fry the chilli, garlic, ginger and cinnamon for five minutes, stirring every once in a while, until the garlic is just starting to brown. Add the coriander stalks and fry for a minute or two more, until the garlic is a light golden brown and the chilli aromatic. Transfer the solids to a plate with a slotted spoon (reserve the oil) and sprinkle generously with flaked salt.Spoon the hummus on to a large plate, creating a large well in the centre with the back of a spoon. Spoon the oil into the well and drizzle over the remaining tablespoon of lemon juice. Top with the fried aromatics and fresh coriander, and serve.There’s a bit of work involved here, but this is a glorious dish to delight any hummus lover. Separating the quail into breasts and legs is a little tricky, so ask your butcher to do it if you’re unsure (use the carcasses for stock or gravy). Another option is to use boneless chicken thighs, and adjust the cooking time according to their size. You’ll need four long metal skewers (or wooden skewers soaked in water for 10 minutes).2 tbsp olive oil1½ tsp ground allspice1½ tbsp pomegranate molasses, plus ½ tbsp to serve1½ tbsp soy sauce1 tsp lemon zest2 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed1 tsp maple syrup2 thyme sprigsFlaked sea salt and black pepper4 quail (1kg), breasts taken off the bone, legs and thighs cut off in one pieceFor the parsley salsa10g parsley leaves, finely chopped1 garlic clove, peeled and crushed2 tbsp olive oil1 lemon – zest finely grated, to get ½ tbsp, then juiced, to get 1 tbspFor the hummus300g freshly cooked chickpeas (see introduction to first recipe)½ garlic clove, peeled and crushed1 lemon – zest finely grated, to get 2 tsp, and juiced, to get 1 tbsp1 tbsp olive oil100g Greek-style yoghurtFlaked sea salt and black pepperMix the first eight ingredients in a large container with a teaspoon and a half of flaked salt and plenty of pepper.

Discard the thyme.Mix all the salsa ingredients with a generous pinch of flaked salt and a good grind of pepper.Put two thirds of the chickpeas in a food processor with the garlic, lemon zest, lemon juice, oil, 80g yoghurt and a quarter-teaspoon of flaked salt, and blitz smooth. Transfer to a saucepan and set aside.Heat a griddle pan on a high heat until very hot. Lay in the skewers skin side down and grill for five minutes on each side, until crisp and golden brown, then leave to rest for five minutes.Put the pan of chickpeas on a medium-high heat with the remaining 100g whole chickpeas and gently heat for a few minutes, until warm. Transfer to a platter with a lip and stir in the remaining 20g yoghurt, so you have streaks of yoghurt through the chickpeas.Arrange the quail skewers on top of the hummus. Spoon on the salsa, finish with a drizzle of pomegranate molasses and serve.Grilling and marinating mushrooms really enhances their meatiness, making this a hearty vegetarian option.

The tape has survived in good condition but the way we hear it now has changed significantly in the 55 years spent in limbo (in care of the family of Coltrane’s first wife, Naima, apparently). Back then, what was to come, musically, was only a possibility, partly contained by what\u0026nbspwas already there. Now we also hear what was destined to be left behind. That which had not existed is now dated: literally in the sense that we know the date, but also because it has been made to sound older by virtue of what Coltrane went on to do.There is a wonderful recording of Ben Webster rehearsing Denmark’s Radio Big Band in 1970, coaxing them in his inimitable way (“Scream it! Scream that shit!”) to swing harder. So successful is he that by the end it seems that, on the first takes of each song, they had not swung at all. Coltrane’s quartet, by contrast, come powering out of the blocks. So completely were they living within the process of music-making that they could pick things up at a moment’s notice. Straight after this session they headed off for the last night of a fortnight-long residency at\u0026nbspNew York’s Birdland. The following day they were back in\u0026nbspthe same studio to record an album with\u0026nbspsinger Johnny Hartman. The result is not likely to be high on any list of jazz essentials but it illustrates\u0026nbsphow the forward momentum of creative expression was harnessed, at this point, by a constant desire to maintain and extend the commercial success achieved a couple of years earlier by My Favorite Things.The week’s crowded schedule also highlights how much was happening for Coltrane and, by extension, in jazz generally, at this period. The timescale on which his career as a leader can be charted is painfully concentrated. In tandem with – and right after – his work with Miles Davis in the late 1950s, Coltrane recorded several albums under his own name but he did not settle on a definitive line-up for the quartet until late 1961. A Love Supreme was recorded in December\u0026nbsp1964. Seven months later came Ascension, a clamorous declaration of freedom featuring an extended ensemble that still commands awe even if listening to it is no longer the essential rite of agonised passage it once was.From the autumn of 1965 drummer Rashied Ali and the young saxophonist Pharoah Sanders (who played at Ronnie Scott’s in London last week, aged 77) swelled the regular band to a sextet. By the\u0026nbspend of the year, it had shrunk back to a quintet with the departure of Jones and Tyner (who was replaced by Coltrane’s second wife, Alice). Coltrane died on 17 July 1967 at the age of 40. Half a century later we are still measuring the effect of\u0026nbspthis\u0026nbspcomet streaking through our\u0026nbspworld: its light, its holiness, its kind of love – and the darkness left by its passing.In the liner notes Sonny Rollins likens the discovery of this session to “finding a new room in the great pyramid”. True, but the room turns out to be rather like a few of the surrounding ones, even containing versions of some of the same artefacts (including four stabs at Impressions, one of Coltrane’s most frequently performed compositions). With regard to the new numbers, it’s hard\u0026nbspto imagine the gorgeous melody of Untitled Original 11386 – featuring Coltrane on soprano – being played with more snap. Oh, how that melody longs for a name, to distinguish itself from the opening Untitled Original 11383! The band keep returning to the melody between solos, as if it is calling and tempting\u0026nbspthem back. What’s it saying? It’s saying, delightedly, “Call me by my name!” The more they return to it the more alluring the call becomes. It’s so different to the moment at the Isle of Wight on\u0026nbsp29\u0026nbspAugust 1970 when Miles Davis is asked what music he’d been playing. “Call it anythin’,” he rasps with characteristic indifference.11386 also demonstrates how, in jazz, “pretty” – pretty notes, pretty tunes – has always been compatible with high seriousness. Same with being sentimental: Coltrane recorded In a Sentimental Mood with Duke Ellington, who famously liked “great big ol’ tears”. Of course jazz, in Coltrane’s final phase, became the opposite of pretty (any tears in it scald like molten lead) or at least part of the challenge of listening to it is in finding residual prettiness among the screech of bent metal and cosmological holler. Could there be an intimation of that here? The soprano, as Coltrane scribbles his solos, is sometimes on the brink of being irritating. It is redeemed by the quality we always associate with him: intensity. If, logically, this means that it can be intensely irritating then that might account for how joyously we are returned to the precarious sanctuary\u0026nbspof melody.The surprising highlight turns out not to be an original but a cover of Nature Boy, the song made famous by Cole Porter. It’s also the shortest track: a reminder that the musician famous for his unstoppability could sometimes achieve beauty in brevity. Alabama, a profound and historically important composition, recorded in November 1963, clocked\u0026nbspin at just five minutes. Possessed by a similar mournfulness, Nature Boy is sketched even more briefly. (The quartet will record a longer, very different version in 1965.)The last major archaeological discovery in the ongoing Coltrane dig was Offering, a live performance from 1966 released four years ago which, like much from his\u0026nbspfinal phase, tests the listener’s nerve and loyalty. “It’s all a matter,” as his near contemporary, photographer Garry Winogrand, once said, “of how much freedom you can stand.” To Jones, that freedom began to sound like “a lot of noise”. A repeated pleasure on this\u0026nbspsession is hearing Elvin setting up those complex mid-tempo grooves that he could maintain till the end of time (where,\u0026nbspin a conceptual sense, he and Trane parted company). The best way to visualise this – aside from watching\u0026nbspfootage of Jones, Tyner and Garrison themselves in full flow – is to imagine a tree in summer, moving, if such a thing is possible, in a gale-force breeze: every leaf twitching separately, all of them swaying together.Both Directions at Once: The Lost Album by John Coltrane is out now on Impulse!.

Marcus Fysh replied to May’s announcement on Twitter at 2.48am, saying: “Please see me,” following it five minutes later with: “Moronic”.Rees-Mogg said he was waiting to see the full details of the proposals but added: “This will require legislation and if, when we get the detailed legislation, it turns out that it is a punishment Brexit, that it is keeping us in the European Union in all but name, I will stick to the Conservative party’s manifesto commitments and will not vote for it.”He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme he would wait to see if the red lines had “been turned pink” but warned that the common rulebook proposal could make “trade deals almost impossible” if it meant regulations would have to apply to any goods coming into the UK.He added that “it is possible that this deal is worse” than a “no deal” Brexit.“As with eggs: an egg that is very softly boiled isn’t boiled at all. A very soft Brexit means that we haven’t left, we are simply a rule-taker. That is not something that this country voted for, it is not what the prime minister promised.“The prime minister will, I’m sure, stick to her word – that is crucially important – but I will certainly stick to the Conservatives’ manifesto commitments and will not vote for something that doesn’t deliver Brexit.”Jenkyns complained that “British businesses will continue to be a rule-taker from the EU” and said she would “pray” that the detail was not as bad as she feared. There is no sign yet of how many MPs are unhappy with the common rulebook proposal, and moderate Tories have supported it. Heidi Allen said she was “pleased to report Theresa May has secured cabinet agreement for a sensible, soft Brexit”. The Democratic Unionist party deputy leader, Nigel Dodds, whose party’s votes are crucial to propping up the May government, said he would be meeting ministers to go through the details. The cabinet Brexiter Chris Grayling acknowledged the proposal could lead to issues in negotiating a US trade deal. The transport secretary said: “I didn’t campaign to leave the European Union to have a different specification of motorcar on sale in the UK to the one that’s on sale in France. This is simply saying that we will effectively sell the same products across Europe as we do now – it’s what business does and would do anyway, nobody produces a different product for one country.”Asked what the common rule book with the EU on food products would mean for the proposed US trade deal, Grayling told Today: “There may be inidual issues to address in future trade talks.”The Commons leader, Andrea Leadsom, said: “As a passionate Brexiter with huge optimism about future as a free-trading nation, I agree with the PM that keeping the UK together is vital.”The prime minister released a statement following the critical afternoon session of the long-awaited summit. May said the cabinet had “agreed our collective position for the future of our negotiations with the EU”. That included a proposal to “create a UK-EU free trade area which establishes a common rulebook for industrial goods and agricultural products” after Brexit.Lord Ashcroft said on Saturday afternoon that he believed environment secretary Michael Gove was the first Brexiter to give the prime minister support.On Thursday, when the common rulebook proposal was first leaked, hardline Brexiter cabinet ministers and Conservative MPs had voiced alarm that it could prevent the UK striking a trade deal with the US, which has different standards in goods and foods, such as allowing chickens to be washed in chlorine.But May was able to release the text of a three-page agreed statement before cabinet, following a relatively undramatic day of discussions.Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, appeared to react warmly to the proposals, noting in a tweet that the “Chequers discussion on future to be welcomed. I look forward to white paper. We will assess proposals to see if they are workable and realistic”. The CBI and the Institute of Directors business groups also voiced relief.The former Ukip leader Nigel Farage described it as a sellout. “Theresa May has betrayed us all – and Brexiteer ministers are letting her get away with it,” he said.The shadow Brexit secretary, Sir Keir Starmer, said: “It is farcical that it has taken two years for the cabinet to even attempt to agree a position on the basics of our future relationship with the EU.“On previous form, whatever has apparently been agreed will struggle to survive contact with Tory MPs and members.” The prime minister made clear that she expected ministers would be sacked if they did not remain in line with her soft Brexit blueprint. She wrote to Tory MPs to explain her plans and included a clear warning about discipline: “As we developed our policy on Brexit, I have allowed cabinet colleagues to express their inidual views. Agreement on this proposal marks the point where that is no longer the case and collective responsibility is now fully restored.”Ministers had been told to surrender their phones in line with what was described as “standard practice for cabinet meetings” when they arrived at Chequers at about 10am with none of their advisers present, meaning that they were not able to immediately present their version of events.May had asked everybody with the right to attend cabinet to be present, a total of 29 people, meaning that a greater proportion of those present were expected to be loyal to her. Despite speculation that some ministers could stage a walkout through the Buckinghamshire countryside to the nearest train station, there was no sign of Boris Johnson or any other hard Brexiter leaving before dinner. One minister said that Johnson “was actually very big about it and by dinner spoke passionately in favour of making it work”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cd71bfd9ba0b33666bbd9a1424e0855bc0c3a9fa/0_3_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c6ba7a2fdb6287ffa9523f8f908a6bcf","title":"soft brexit proposal welcomed both sides irish border","story":"Dublin says free trade area plan ‘deserves consideration’ as DUP endorses dealThe Irish government says Theresa May’s proposals for Brexit “deserve consideration” but has warned that much work needs to be done to get to a deal.Echoing the chief EU Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, the country’s deputy prime minister, Simon Coveney, said it needs to see the white paper before it can progress to negotiations. In a statement issued on Saturday, Coveney reiterated the need for a permanent backstop for the Irish border, which would provide what Ireland sees as an “insurance policy” in the event of a change of government or a no-deal scenario.“Ireland’s position is that we want to see the closest possible relationship between the EU and the UK. On the backstop for the border, our position remains clear. “While our preference is still for an overall EU-UK relationship which would resolve all issues, it remains essential that a backstop is agreed which provides certainty that in any circumstances, and no matter what the outcome of the negotiations on the EU-UK future relationship, a hard border will be avoided,” he said. He called on the UK to step up its efforts amid warnings that there were only weeks to the October deadline for a deal.“Time is short. I am in regular contact with Michel Barnier and my officials are working day in and day out with the taskforce team he leads,” he said.The British Irish Chamber of Commerce warned any attempt to strike a Brexit deal for goods only would be resisted by business leaders.The group’s director general, John McGrane, said that it would be a “fudge” and unworkable. “She is working very, very hard, moving millimetre by millimetre, and to say we could end up in some customs arrangement is a good thing.“But the whole point about trade is that it is not just goods. Goods do not exist in isolation. Services include the haulage sector, the creative sector, the tech sector – services simply cannot be left behind,” he said. He also said that a goods-only deal would not remove the need for an Irish border, with the issue of freedom of movement of people across the border impacting EU citizen employees, tourism and communities. The Democratic Unionist party, which threatened to torpedo May’s December deal over the border plan, has welcomed the proposal, describing it as a “reaffirmation of what is an absolute priority for us”, claiming it would be bad news for “republicans” who want to break up the United Kingdom. “It is clear the whole country will leave the EU together. Republicans may be disappointed as they tried their best to seize this as an opportunity to weaken the union,” said the DUP deputy leader, Nigel Dodds. Sinn Féin has argued for a special bespoke deal for Northern Ireland.Scotland’s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, gave the proposal a guarded welcome.She said it showed there was “more realism” and the plan was “hopefully a step forward”.However, she said the plan for a foot in the single market for goods and not for services sounded like the very “cherry-picking” the EU had rejected. But she said the softening of red lines meant it was “game on for those who would prefer to see a full single marketcustoms union outcome”.The statement on Friday night makes it clear that May believes the proposal for a free trade area on goods and agriculture will obviate the need for infrastructure and checks at the Irish border. It said the UK would be “honouring the letter and the spirit of the Belfast agreement” on peace signed 20 years ago and the deal would be so deep and comprehensive the “backstop” agreed in December would “not need to be brought into effect”. Brussels has made it clear from the outset that the backstop is mandatory and without it a withdrawal agreement cannot be struck or a transition period arranged."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b3b09d6b8c42abbbd4d4fd7c6fe468517df8ed84/0_67_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4b1bf0a79531f14ad329b3a0b548100d","title":"alex hales eoin morgan england india ben stokes","story":"• All-rounder fit to face India in Bristol after injury lay-off• Alex Hales’ form ‘makes him a very strong case’, says captainVictory in Cardiff on Friday means a showdown in Bristol to decide the outcome of a T20 series that has been so much more intriguing than those games against Australia. There is more needle and more quality in these matches and consequently they are a much better spectacle.Even the pre-match deliberations of the England set-up are interesting. There is a big selection dilemma to resolve before the match gets under way at 2pm on Sunday. Ben Stokes is fit to play England will be eager to rehabilitate him after another enforced absence but it is unclear how they might to do it.Eoin Morgan was suitably candid in Cardiff when asked whether he knew who would play in Bristol. “No. It’s not clear,” he said. “It’s a difficult decision to make but we will do whatever is right for the betterment of the team.”There was an assumption that Alex Hales would give way yet he was the man who calmly guided England home. “That makes him a very strong case for Bristol,” said Morgan.They could leave Joe Root out for Sunday’s game. They might fudge the issue by replacing Jake Ball with Stokes but the reason why everyone wants Stokes there is to give the captain plenty of options. It would certainly seem perverse to drop Hales just now.Hales understands the situation and does not know whether he will play. “I have no answer,” he said. “I’m doing all I can to score runs and keep putting pressure on the guys who know they’re playing.“We will have to see. If it’s me that’s left out, you look at the guys who are playing ahead of me and what can you do? It’s up to me to keep training hard, being positive and to have a decent mindset.Morgan admitted that England’s batting lineup and order is a work in progress and he hinted that they have not found the ideal solution yet. It does feel that England are not playing to their strengths by having Hales down the order, despite his success in Cardiff.The elevation of Jos Buttler is triggered by performances in the IPL rather than any deficiencies in England’s previous lineup this experiment may not last long, especially since Morgan is keen to be flexible so far from the next World Cup, in 2020.Hales is not in a position to dictate where he bats. He merely points out his eagerness to open if possible. “That’s where I enjoy batting and that’s what I’ve done my whole career. But if I’m at three, four or five it’s a role I’m happy to take on and to learn new things.”At the moment he is happy just to play. “The batting lineup is that strong. You look how well Jos is playing. He’s batting on a different planet. Just to be part of this lineup anywhere is a great effort.”Well, the competition at the moment is healthy and productive and Hales is back in the mix after being tormented by Kuldeep Yadav at Old Trafford. After that game he had a few harsh words with himself and he found a way.“I had never faced him before,” explained Hales‚ “and didn’t know much about him. Maybe I just went out at Manchester without a plan and I couldn’t get going.“I watched a bit more footage, worked with Merlyn and looked to play a bit more off the back foot and waited for him to float one up then I hit a bit straighter.”This plan worked well at Cardiff. The assumption is that he will have another opportunity to put it into practice on Sunday afternoon."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9284fc89d84ed46eb391e718502d25eb66711a9b/340_381_1437_862/master/1437.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=009c439fadae379a77adc628bf320969","title":"lewis hamilton british f1 gp pole sebastian vettel","story":"If ever Lewis Hamilton needed a lift, it was here, in the cauldron of qualifying for the British Grand Prix. Pushed to produce one of his best ever laps to take pole from Ferrari’s Sebastian Vettel, who will start second, the four-times world champion once again found inspiration from the huge crowd at Silverstone. They, in turn, were rewarded with an exceptional run that the Mercedes driver ranked as one of the most testing of his career.Nigel Mansell said the home crowd at the British Grand Prix was worth up to half a second a lap to him. The 1992 champion adored his home grand prix and its fans, as does Hamilton and they were out in force for him again. Basking in glorious sunshine at the old airfield, a world away from the inhospitable cold weather and winds that often sweep across the circuit, their enthusiasm was undimmed even by the tense anticipation of England’s imminent clash with Sweden.Hamilton had gone out to a campsite on Friday night to deliver 2,000 beers and 1,000 snack boxes at his own expense for the volunteer circuit marshals and helpers, a heartfelt gesture whose good intent was returned in spades – and just as well, he needed every possible encouragement to produce his very best.Hamilton took the pole with a track record time of 1min\u0026nbsp25.892sec in a final hot lap that was a tour de force around Silverstone but he was pushed to the limit by Vettel. The German was quickest on his first run in Q3, just five-hundredths of a second in front of Hamilton. Both laps were impressive but Vettel had the edge through the middle sector. But on the final runs Hamilton was extraordinary under immense pressure, threading the needle through Maggots and Becketts with precision, he finished four-hundredths ahead of Vettel, with Kimi Räikkönen in third and Valtteri Bottas in fourth.“It felt like one of the best laps I have been able to produce,” he said. “It felt like the most pressurised lap that I have ever had. I was shaking afterwards through the emotion and the adrenaline rush, way above what I have experienced before. Which is crazy as this is my 76th pole but this 76th is so special.”Mercedes had expected to be strong at the circuit, especially using the thinner-tread tyres that their car favours. They dominated on this Pirelli rubber in both Spain and France but Ferrari came at them with\u0026nbspvenom.Hamilton recognised this, although understandably he could not wait to escape the post qualifying press conference, his excitement visible when he received news of England’s first goal. “It took everything to get it,” he said. “The fans were there I could see them, and I knew they were there, I really wanted to do it and with the pole give a boost to England. Start the wave and let them continue it.” The football team did indeed carry on the day of sporting success.Having been frustrated at the last round with a DNF, his 14-point championship lead over Vettel became a one-point deficit to the German and he will be eager to once more top the table with a win on Sunday but is taking nothing for granted. “It’ll be demanding with the heat, the speed we have through corners, the G-force we are pulling,” he said. “I definitely think it will be physically tougher and more intense, it is not going to be a case of opening a big gap, it is going to be close all the way.”Thus far, however, it is the perfect start. He has matched Ayrton Senna’s record of six poles at his home grand prix and now has the chance to again enter the history books. If he can convert it into a win it will be his fifth consecutive victory at the British Grand Prix, surpassing Jim Clark’s run of four, and he will become only the second driver to have scored five wins in a row at the same track, matching Senna’s run at Monaco between 1989 and 1993. A sixth win at the British Grand Prix would also make him the most successful competitor at the race, with one more that Clark and Alain Prost.These details, though, will not concern him until the serious business is concluded. Hamilton has been enthusiastically following England’s progress in Russia and will go to Moscow should they make the final. Having been able to enjoy watching England’s win, he will now need to refocus on what is likely to be highly competitive race. A challenge awaits but one he can face buoyed by the enthusiasm that will doubtless be once again flowing from the grandstands.For the once-mighty British team Williams, who are enduring a shocking season, there was no respite at their home race with a car that still looks a handful. Lance Stroll went off at Brooklands in Q1, ending his session and he finished in 19th. While Sergey Sirotkin also went off at Stowe and although he continued, managed only 18th place.McLaren, who are also enduring the least successful period in their history, entered their home grand prix having announced a considerable restructuring after the resignation of their sporting director Eric Boullier on Tuesday but for the moment they are mired toward the back of the midfield with Fernando Alonso in 13th and Stoffel Vandoorne in 17th place.The Red Bulls of Max Verstappen and Daniel Ricciardo were fifth and sixth. Haas were once again the best of the rest with Kevin Magnussen and Romain Grosjean in seventh and eighth respectively. Charles Leclerc was once again strong for Sauber, taking ninth place and Esteban Ocon was in 10th for Force India.Renault’s Nico Hülkenberg was 11th in front of the Force India of Sergio Pérez. Toro Rosso’s Pierre Gasly was 14th, Marcus Ericsson in the Sauber 15th and the Renault of Carlos Sainz 16th.Toro Rosso’s Brendon Hartley did not take part in qualifying after he suffered a high-speed accident in the final practice session. A suspension failure caused the New Zealander to go off and he took a major impact into the barriers at turn six. Hartley was unhurt but will start from the back of the grid or potentially the pitlane."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b11bed89e7a068f05c153bfc8124988988e9fb6b/0_0_2240_1344/master/2240.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c35a1bba08e65a03915d70d59b6d82d7","title":"england v new zealand womens first odi live","story":"Amy Jones and Heather Knight both scored 63 as England posted 290 for five, then bowled New Zealand out for 148 in a dominant victory at HeadingleyAnd that’s it from me. Have a great evening celebrating two England wins, both nerveless. And this is something to shout about too - the ECB marching at Pride! Time does indeed move on, and sometimes in a good way.The circus moves next to Derbyshire on Tuesday, with England cock-a-hoop and New Zealand with much to ponder. This time the match doesn’t clash with an England world-cup game. Yorkshire Vikings v Derbyshire Falcons on the other hand...It was the first time England women had ever played a match at Headingley, the first time Katherine Brunt’s dad had seen his daughter on his home ground. And England utterly dominated. Post-match, the admirably honest Suzie Bates criticised herself and Sophie Devine for not turning thirties into something larger, and said she was considering fiddling with batting order, though “I don’t think our batting is order is going to fix 150 runs short.”Heather Knight was visibly pleased “ I thought we played brilliant today. For the girls to get 290 on what was quite a slow wicket, I was delighted. It is always quite hard getting into ODI cricket after T20.... In the field we were a bit off at the start, but it was pretty much a perfect day for us”On Georgia Elwiss “She is very accurate in what she wants to do and makes it easy for me as captain.”On Katie George “ We want her to try and get wickets at the top of the order, She’s still quite raw, still quite young, but a great prospect.”Player of the match: Nat Sciver. Two wickets in her first over and 3-18 in all. Plus a quick 37. Horrah for her, after a tough post-World Cup period. England now lie fourth in the ICC Women’s Championship, and New Zealand slip to second. That was a superb victory by England. Disciplined with ball and bat - if a little sloppy occasionally in the field. But hey, let’s brush over that on this day of all days. A whopping victory for England, against a New Zealand side that were on the slide after losing their muscular top two of Sophie Devine and Suzie Bates.  35.3 overs: New Zealand 148 all out (Ebrahim 16) And that’s it, all over,  England win by a huge 142 runs.A first ODI wicket on debut for Katie George!33rd over: New Zealand 148-9.( Ebrahim 16, Huddleston 1) Happy days for Marsh and England. She has 3 for 24 off her super 7 overs. Well bowled!The ball pitches outside off and turns sharply, through the gate, and the death rattle sounds. 33rd over: New Zealand 145-8.( Ebrahim 15, Tahuhu 5) Tahuhu takes out her frustration on Katie George, with a boundary. A big shout from George against Ebrahim off the last ball of her over, but it doesn’t look out, and the umpire agrees. 32nd over: New Zealand 137-8.( Ebrahim 12, Tahuhu 0) The crowd plumps up at Headingley as those watching the TV file out back to their plastic seats. They won’t have long to wait. A super line from Marsh: the ball bounces and turns, with style! It hits Kasperek firmly on her legs, in line and the umpire raises his finger.32nd over: New Zealand 132-7.(Kasperek 10, Ebrahim 12) A meaty slog from Kasperek sends Ecclestone over the boundary. Then a second, classier, a squarer drive this time. And England are through to the World Cup semi-final! Goals for Harry Maguire and Dele Alli. 31st over: New Zealand 124-7.(Kasperek 2, Ebrahim 12) New Zealand perhaps sensibly saving a lame batting performance for a time when even the crowd is distracted by another game. Ebrahim swings at the last delivery of Marsh’s over, drives with style and flounce through extra-cover for four. 30th over: New Zealand 117-7.(Kasperek 1, Ebrahim 7) More tight bowling from Ecclestone, on a spin-friendly pitch. New Zealand looking short of ideas. Huge turn off the surface from Marsh and Watkin trapped quite high on the pad. 28th over: New Zealand 112-5.(Watkin 0, Ebrahim 5)  A super wicket-maiden for Ecclestone, who is finding some spin from this dry, dry surface. Currently 6 overs 1-24. A whip to midwicket where the catch is well-taken by Sciver, making amends for her earlier drop.27th over: New Zealand 112-5.(Green 21, Ebrahim 5) Superb evasive action from Ebrahim as Green smacks the ball towards long on and she slips slow-motion limbo-stylee out of the way.26th over: New Zealand 109-5.(Green 19, Ebrahim 3) Just a couple of runs off the over, another tight one from Ecclestone.25th over: New Zealand 107-5.(Green 18, Ebrahim 3) A nudge from Ebrahim, a drive from Green. A full toss doesn’t bring any runs. New Zealand rebuilding begins, but slowly.24th over: New Zealand 104-5.(Green 17, Ebrahim 1) Ecclestone, long, smooth pony tail swinging with her action, sunglasses on, keeps Ebrahim and Green on their toes with her loop and accuracy . A misfield by Beaumont means two runs off the over. 23rd over: New Zealand 102-5.(Green 16, Ebrahim 0)  Just one off Laura Marsh’s first over of the day.  22nd over: New Zealand 101-5.(Green 15, Ebrahim 0 ) So it wasn’t to be for Kerr today, she sticks her head in the air in intense frustration with herself. Another wicket for Sciver, who now has 3 for 18 off her four overs. Something of the magic about her bowling today. Kerr takes a step or two down the pitch and chips Sciver to Winfield at mid-wicket21st over: New Zealand 100-4.(Green 15, Kerr 8) And a huge roar through my window and echoing round the Headingley seats. That’s another goal for England 2-0 up against Sweden! Kerr, undaunted, strides down the pitch and drives Elwiss’s last ball down the ground for four. That’s the hundred up.20th over: New Zealand 94-4.(Green 13, Kerr 3) Green heaves Sciver over the top and down the ground for four as the New Zealand required run rate moves close to 7 an over. Then a lovely late cut next ball, turning the ball off the face of the bat and down to the boundary. Just lovely. 19th over: New Zealand 81-4.(Green 4, Kerr 2) Elwiss polishes the ball on her shirt, with just three singles off another tight over. Two youngsters left to do the impossible. 18th over: New Zealand 78-4.(Green 2, Kerr 1) Hmm, rubbing my hands to see what Amelia Kerr can do against Sciver and co. They’ve just shown the inside of pavilion at Headingley, quite a buzz around the TV...17th over: New Zealand 75-4.(Green 1, Kerr 0) Another cracking over from Elwiss brings the wicket of Satterthwaite as New Zealand look in huge trouble, that’s four wickets in 17 balls now. England’s buzz is back. Huge shout from Elwiss who is rewarded for her superb bowling. It looked as if the ball would have hit Satterthwaite’s middle stump. 16th over: New Zealand 71-3 England definitely on top now with Bates Devine and Martin gone. Sciver’s took two wickets in that over and New Zealand have lost 3 for 3 in 12 balls. Oh dear, New Zealand. Martin attacks the ball well but perhaps misjudges the size of the boundary and is well caught by Jones. A great catch by young George, ing to her right and clutching on with both hands, clinging on even when she thumped down on the ground. 15th over: New Zealand 71-1 (Suzie Bates 28,Satterthwaite 0) A wicket maiden for Elwiss with the dangerous Devine back in the pavilion!A superb catch by Ecclestone at mid-off as Devine fails to clear the inner ring. 14th over: New Zealand 70-0 (Suzie Bates 26, Sophie Devine 33) Susie Bates gets down on one knee and sweeps Ecclestone down past midwicket for four. 13th over: New Zealand 62-0 (Suzie Bates 26, Sophie Devine 26) A very disciplined over from Elwiss, who delivers on target, not giving Devine the width she so loves to tuck in to. Only one from the over. 12th over: New Zealand 61-0 (Suzie Bates 25, Sophie Devine 26) Sophie Ecclestone getting some pretty loop on the ball but New Zealand work her for 8 runs in the over. A thumping four from Bates who sends a shorter ball through mid-wicket and whizzing over the boundary. 11th over: New Zealand 53-0 (Suzie Bates 19, Sophie Devine 25) A double bowling change, Elwiss replaces the excellent Brunt who bowled 5 overs for 15. Just three singles from the over. 10th over: New Zealand 50-0 (Suzie Bates 17, Sophie Devine 24) Ecclestone replaces George. And with a cut for four by Devine, that’s the fifty up for New Zealand. 9th over: New Zealand 46-0 (Suzie Bates 17, Sophie Devine 20) Oooh Bates nearly plays on, chopping downwards and missing the stumps by an demi-inch. Her reply is a drive for four between point and cover. Brunt not impressed. And going by the noise, that’s a goal!!!! England 1, Sweden 08th over: New Zealand 41-0 (Suzie Bates 13, Sophie Devine 19) . Two lovely drives from Devine, one through extra cover, another straighter and even better. Two wides too, as George struggles a little with the swing as the clouds gather over Headingley. A huge appeal from the last ball of the over against Devine, a noise but it looks like it came from the pad. Not out.7th over: New Zealand 29-0 (Suzie Bates 12, Sophie Devine 10) Five from Brunt’s over.6th over: New Zealand 24-0 (Suzie Bates 7, Sophie Devine 10) George not lacking in confidence, at all, and now not impressed at all by a drop! Nat Sciver drops Devine at mid-wicket, and in her fury tries to run Bates out. The third-umpires says no. 5th over: New Zealand 23-0 (Suzie Bates 5, Sophie Devine 9)  Brunt is not impressed as the ball swings past an oddly pedestrian Sarah Taylor and down to the boundary for four leg byes. Devine calls for a tight single, home safe thanks to a slight fumble in the field. England lacking a bit of fizz so far. Six from the over. 4th over: New Zealand 17-0 (Suzie Bates 5, Sophie Devine 9) Much better from George, a good line, tight into the stumps. She’s a strong looking lass, left-arm, super action. Just three from the over, nudges and nurdles all.3rd over: New Zealand 14-0 (Suzie Bates 4, Sophie Devine 2) Order resumed, thanks to Katherine Brunt. A maiden of triffic deliveries.2nd over: New Zealand 14-0 (Suzie Bates 4, Sophie Devine 7) And the new ball gets thrown to Katie George, 19 years old and on her ODI debut in place of the injured Anya Shrubsole. It’s a bit of mixed bag - the second delivery moves in very late, the third swings very wide, past Sarah Taylor, and then a huge overthrow from Tammy Beaumont goes for four. Eleven runs from the over.1st over: New Zealand 3-0 (Suzie Bates 2, Sophie Devine 1) Katherine Brunt bowls the first over, gets some early swing with deliveries on the button. As you’d expect.Such a privilege for the crowd at Headingley to watch young Amelia Kerr at the dawn of her international career. Her sense of self and calm is astonishing. Especially as she’s juggling the tour with her schoolworkIncidentally, was very excited to read this. The return of the trading card! My brothers and I collected Texaco Trophy cards way back in ancient history (1984...)Quite a challenge for New Zealand coming up - if they catch England’s 290 it will be the highest successful run-chase in women’s cricket. Fast outfield though, dry pitch, and big-hitting Kiwis in that batting line-up.Thanks Nick! And thanks to anyone reading this on a day when even England and New Zealand fans might have other priorities. I reckon I’ll be able to tell what’s happening in THE OTHER MATCH as the roars and groans filter out of my neighbours’ front rooms and through my open window. So I hope to keep you posted on that too.And with that, I will hand over to Tanya Aldred, who will guide you carefully through the New Zealand run chase. Your thoughts, jokes and words of encouragement to be sent here, please.Quite a task for New Zealand this: primarily, they will need someone other than Suzie Bates and Sophie Devine to score a few runs, ideally. England must be heavy favourites to take this first ODI of the series. So England didn’t exactly pepper the boundary in those closing overs, but they still managed to post an imposing score. Much of the batting was good, but they were helped by some very ropey fielding, three or four dropped catches and a good few more runs given away by misfields. Amelia Kerr was terrific with her leg spin, but she was surrounded by inconsistency. 50th over: England 290-5 (Brunt 30, Winfield 9) Good stuff from Winfield, stepping right across the stumps to sweep Kasperek round the corner for three. Brunt nails one down to long-off which she gets only a single for, Winfield another single to mid-wicket, then Brunt tries to go big but toe-ends it, and in the end Tahuhu does well to stop it as the ball bounces in front of her. Then another drop, as Winfield fires a shot straight back at the bowler, who puts it down. The last ball brings another single, Brunt skewing a shot just past point. 49th over: England 282-5 (Brunt 27, Winfield 4) Brunt goes big over wide mid-on, and it drops just short of the fielder out that way. They take two runs, then another two from a scoop that might have brought more runs had she not fallen over in executing the shot. A pair more with a swat over the covers, that Brunt doesn’t look happy with: boundaries are what she wants. Winfield plays a slightly odd shot that skews between point and cover, skipping over the turf and some smart running gets them three. No boundaries, but still 11 from the over.

Her career began on the stage – she has appeared in five National Theatre productions and most recently performed a monologue by Maxine Peake, inspired by the 100th anniversary of women’s suffrage, at London’s Old Vic. Her role as the caustic nun Sister Michael was a standout in Derry Girls, Channel 4’s comedy about teenage girls set during the Troubles. Ahead of shooting season two, McSweeney returns to the stage in Rory Mullarkey’s surreal comedy Pity, which is at the Royal Court, London from Thursday.What drew you to the role of Sister Michael in Derry Girls?I’d already worked with the writer, Lisa McGee, on a previous show of hers in 2013 called London Irish. That script was the funniest thing I’d ever read so I’d do anything with Lisa. A lot of scripts pretend to be funny or are made funny by good actors or the laughter track, but she’s the real deal.Growing up, had you always wanted to be an actor?I always wanted to but it wasn’t something I thought I could do. When I was smaller I was sent to drama classes and there the idea of standing up in front of people and shouting at them started to take shape. I’m a weird anomaly in my family they all thought I’d settle down and become a teacher or something but so far I seem to be getting away with it.Was Derry Girls’ success a surprise?It was, not because I didn’t think it would be a success but because there’s no meritocracy in this industry. There’s so many reasons why Derry Girls is a success, though, and one of them is because it filled a vacuum – the lack of realistic women on TV. We’re not seeing women being heroes in their own lives or being protagonists enough. Also the north of Ireland isn’t represented enough, and the girls themselves are brilliant.What appeals to you about comedy?There’s a common misconception that comedy is trivial but when you’re laughing in a group, you feel a sense of commonality and humanity, you feel alive.Who are your tips for comics to watch?I’ve just been tipped off about the US comedian Nore Davis who’s amazing. I recently went to a recording of the Guilty Feminist podcast which is hosted by Deborah Frances-White. Listening to it, I’ve been introduced to so many new female voices. In terms of theatre, there’s the company All In, which is run by Steve Sobal and Amalia Vitale I met Steve while studying clowning and they do very funny and heartbreaking physical work.Will the passing of the abortion referendum in the Republic now put a spotlight on Northern Ireland?There’s a lot to shift in the north because it’s been neglected for a long time. There’s not only the issue of abortion but also marriage equality and the outrage at May’s pairing up with the DUP. It makes me really angry because this is part of the UK – you wanted it, you got it – so people should know what’s going on there and at the moment there’s no government. Your average person in the north just wants to carry on with their lives, like in Derry Girls. It’s not everybody crying out of windows, it’s people trying to get their kids to school, get food on the table and have a laugh, and they have been truly neglected."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d2057ebaf6b28e4c535dfc7158fe1ffc2fac17a5/190_313_2522_1513/master/2522.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9e445b72e2e5845c8472eecb0f786239","title":"meet the makers behind some of londons top market stalls","story":"From pork loins to concrete planters – traders at the capital’s fourth Urban Village Fete in Greenwich share their passions and productsThe Greenwich peninsula is undergoing a transformation from concrete jungle to a buzzing design and creative space. To celebrate this, each year the peninsula springs to life with music, colour and dancing, as creators from all over London come together for the Urban Village Fete. Curated by Wayne Hemingway, co-founder of Hemingway Design, the event delivers his vision of recreating the type of free festival that once attracted some of the brightest creative minds to Camden and Kensington markets.“Free festivals were the way we communicated,” he says. “There were loads of young designers who went on to become pretty famous. We want to recreate that in Greenwich: getting young creatives in front of tens of thousands of people at a price they can afford.”The fete is now in its fourth year and stretches through an area that is becoming a hub for design. Hemingway hopes that with 15,000 new homes, plus spaces designated for work and play, a sense of creativity and community will blossom on the peninsula, with creatives sharing the area with families. “The event feels generous, and generosity should be a part of urban life,” he says.Hemingway’s company produces dozens of festivals around the UK each year – from Liverpool’s Fine Tuned event to the National Festival of Making in Blackburn. One challenge facing market traders and craftspeople across these events is that shoppers are carrying less cash than ever. Hemingway Design and payments platform Square partnered to equip cash-only traders with Square Readers so they could take cards, many of them for the first time. Here, we meet some of the dozens of makers and creators who brought the Greenwich fete to life. Emily Griffin lives and breathes east London’s creative scene. A Hackney local for 20 years, during the past three she’s built her homewares and accessories business Mahala from the ground up. But while she makes and designs most of what can be found inside her store, the brand is also a family affair. “My husband joined Mahala a year ago and designs the clothes, which we have made in Bow,” says Griffin. “His aunt has a small orchard, so she makes all the lovely oils for us.” Mahala’s clothes and accessories are made to endure, reflecting the family’s thrifty past. Griffin uses military canvas and saddlery to create her bags, and her designs are centred around slow fashion. “I want people to have them for a really long time. I always repair stuff – I’d rather repair than replace,” she says.Building relationships with her customers at events such as the Urban Village Fete is key. “It means we’re not relying on footfall on our street, which is really quiet. Plus, we get to meet people from all over London and farther afield,” she says. The concrete planters found at From the Land (formerly Conpot) are far from the rigid grey slabs the material usually brings to mind. Architect Alastair Mitchell and textile designer Kezia Regan began experimenting in their home with planters made from concrete, before expanding to homewares and surfaces. “Each one uses a different stone source from around the country – Shropshire, Lancashire, Derbyshire – so we’re trying to show that concrete can have all these regional dialects,” says Mitchell.As the business grows, he says the aim is to move away from third-party retailers and sell more through his online store and specialist ceramic fairs, and at events like the Urban Village Fete. To do this, and to make the most of footfall, he has started using cashless payment platform Square. “If you only take cash, most people go away and never come back,” he says. “Just the other day we had someone come to our house who wanted to buy a planter. We were able to take a card payment in our living room.”Sarah Harvey, UK lead for Square, says: “None of us want to have to walk away from a unique item on a market stall just because that trader won’t accept cards, and with our partnership we wanted to make it as easy as possible for shoppers to support independent and creative businesses.” Ayse Özden loves creating with paper. She is one of the founders of WeAct, a London-based stationery store and brand agency with its roots in Turkey. “Greeting cards are a very big thing in Europe, whereas in Istanbul they’re not,” she says. Her family made the move to bring their collections to London two years ago. Her stall at the Urban Village Fete was filled with quirky designs from dictionary clippings underlying colourful illustrations designed by her husband to comical faces splashed across greeting cards and notebook covers. “There’s been a really nice response to the face collection,” she says. “Lots of people are laughing and that was our aim – to help people have fun.” Before making bespoke, one-of-a-kind bags to sell exclusively at markets, Anna P was designing 250-piece collections twice a year for high-street stores. Now she works for herself, and has spent three years collecting vintage textiles that she uses to design and make leather and cloth bags by hand. The designer prefers to sell to people direct, and doesn’t have an online store. Because of the nomadic nature of her stall, she makes sure she has a cashless payment system whenever she’s selling at markets. “I use Square and it’s so quick to take payments – if you have a lot of people and they all want to buy at the same time, just tap it on there and it’s done,” she says.  The bright pops of colour coming from the Keeler \u0026amp Sidaway stall captured the Urban Village Fete’s sunny, holiday vibes. Joe Keeler began his print and stationery company two years ago, as a way of combining his loves of illustration, photography and travelling – the latter of which inspires his art, which often features Californian poolsides and graphic beaches.“I’m an avid photographer, so I’ll take loads of photos and come back and draw from them, or sketch scenes while I’m on location and then work it all together from there,” he says.With a studio based in Bermondsey, Keeler sells his prints through his online store, but makes an exception when it comes to the urban village fete. “This one is the best summery festival things to do in London,” he says. “There are lots of people here.” Visitors to Imogen Johnson-Gilbert’s stall could try on her first collection, made at a Fairtrade factory in Bangalore, a new milestone for her business. Previously, Johnson-Gilbert made all of the Gillian June clothes herself, but the business’s popularity has made that tricky. “We’ve grown to a point where I’ve stopped being able to make it all,” she says.  Isabelle Laight really loves hip-hop, and at the Urban Village Fete she found she was in good company. “You can see everyone being really surprised when they walk past. It’s one of those things you don’t see that often,” she says of her illustrated designs of hip-hop and R\u0026ampB greats on the sides of mugs, plates, and stationery. “Kanye is the most popular. I don’t want him to be, but he is,” says Laight. “My favourite at the moment is Tupac – I’m going through a bit of a phase.” Using Square for payments at the fete, Laight says: “It’s really easy, I just keep it in my pocket, and there’s been no need to troubleshoot because I haven’t had any problems.” Sheffield native Alastair Mason knows a thing or two about pork. “It’s always been a family tradition that we have our pork brined or dipped by the butcher,” he says of his favourite snack. Mason started the Salty Loins food truck in 2015 through sheer frustration: he was unable to get a “decent” pork sandwich in London. “After raving to my friends about not being able to find this kind of pork, I decided to take it upon myself to experiment and came up with my own brine recipe.”Since then, the trained graphic designer has been a staple at London markets such as Maltby Street and Borough, as well as on the Bermondsey “beer mile”. Mason’s menu has expanded to incorporate one of his hometown’s favourite dishes – chips and gravy – plus baby back salt ribs, which he cooks up in front of hungry punters. “It’s good theatre when you’ve got a street food stall, obviously. That and the smell is key to people coming in and trying something new,” he says.Cathryn Quail’s stall on the peninsula looked straight out of the pages of a trendy interiors magazine – but she wants plants to be a part of a sustainable lifestyle rather than feeding an expensive trend. She opened The Botanical Workshop last September to sell plants and teach people how to arrange and take care of them. “It should be something that is affordable, that brings you joy and helps with mindfulness,” she says. “When you buy plants and they stay alive, it’s way more sustainable.”To curb the frustration generated by his bureaucratic job, where he was stuck at a desk each day, Ross Mitchell started curing food. Over three years, his hobby grew to become a business, now called Smoke and Cure. This was his first gig at the Urban Village Fete. “It is always good to meet a new bunch of customers. We were sitting right next to the music stage and among other peer businesses, so we were in good company,” he says.Mitchell has also learned that catering for card payments is now a necessity. “A year ago I wasn’t too fussed about using them, but what I found is it absolutely opens up a whole new line of business,” he says. “With Square you’re allowed to take payment over the phone, which is becoming increasingly important for our particular business.”Learn more about Square"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2ac9c72b6f6f47b7ddc23f05d4f40b47907d5b9e/256_63_1576_946/master/1576.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=16c4009d6c05b7c79d6a61dabebb3613","title":"james martin american adventure fiona sturges","story":"‘His final dish is barbecued rib-eye steak and corn on the cob, fully basted in sweat and despair’“Howdy guys and girls, welcome to Texas,” says the TV chef James Martin, entirely without conviction, from behind the wheel of a massive pick-up truck. It’s the third week of James Martin’s American Adventure (Friday, 8pm, ITV), which sees our host engaged in an uphill battle to convince viewers he’s enjoying himself. So far, there have been sunbaked sojourns around Napa Valley and Santa Monica, bringing with them alfresco cookery, flash wheels, too-tight trousers and a nasty case of sunburn. Next stop is San Antonio, Texas, where, says our hatchet-faced host, “the bustling Mexican vibe brings the place alive”. Martin, though, is dead inside. While the background music is pure mariachi fiesta, his expression screams: “Someone call my agent. When will this nightmare be over?”We shouldn’t be surprised. There’s nothing that’s not awkward about Martin. He spent 10 years intermittently setting fire to stuff on Saturday Kitchen – which, in retrospect, looks less like a series of culinary cock-ups than a cry for help. Had he lifted a saucepan lid one day to reveal his producer’s head bubbling away with a bouquet garni, few would have been surprised.But, having recently hightailed it to ITV, Martin has now landed what many would see as the ultimate prize – a cooking show-cum-travelogue that allows him to eat his way across entire countries and hobnob with some of the best chefs in the world. It’s a typical reward for long-serving TV chefs and foodies as they slide inexorably towards midlife crisis (see also The Hairy Bikers’ Mediterranean Adventure, Jamie’s Great Escape, and every Rick Stein show ever made). But away from the demands of live television, and thousands of miles from home, Martin is struggling to work up an appetite.“We’re not built for extreme heat in Yorkshire,” he says plaintively from behind his workstation in San Antonio’s Market Square, damp patches spreading across his shirt. It’s hotter than Satan’s bum crack here, though producers have nonetheless seen fit to park him in front of a giant\u0026nbspbarbecue in order to work his magic on a slab of salmon. Rather than being offered something useful like an electric fan, he’s given a fresh shirt and a miniature bottle of tequila and left to sweat it out in front of the nation.Elsewhere, along with a cursory two-minute history of the city, we get shots of Martin driving down a highway in his pick-up, Martin rocking a sombrero, and Martin, by now resembling a belligerent radish, scouring San Antonio for some\u0026nbspair-con. For penetrating insight into Tex-Mex culture, this is up there with Looney Tunes’ Speedy Gonzalez. His final dish, once again cooked out in the square, is barbecued rib-eye steak and corn on the cob. Fully basted in sweat and despair, Martin can barely string a sentence together. After accidentally setting fire to the corn husks and splattering his already soaked shirt in fat, he whacks the steak on a plate, glowers at the camera, turns on his heels and walks away. Martin may know about food, but lighting up the\u0026nbspscreen with his wit and charisma apparently isn’t in his job description. Someone get the man a beer and a ticket home."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/298c567711beca95b679ffdade52e49a9034f545/0_153_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c067ae7991e407c71753d8bf4878fc16","title":"tell queer eye guys everything","story":"I believe these men can fix me, and that is not something I’ve thought about anyone from reality TV, everArticles about the joyousness of Netflix’s reboot, in which five gay men with different specialisms give a life and style makeover to someone in dire need, are so numerous they have become a journalistic genre unto themselves. When the first series came out earlier this year, I myself made lofty claims about how the show is “what our era needs”. I probably even suggested it was the anti-Trump show, knowing me. But as I sit in my darkened room, curtains closed against the sun, bent over my iPad, waiting for another hit – just one! – of Tan convincing some pot-bellied American dad to swap his baggy sweatshirt for a fitted polo in a colour “that pops”, I’ve had to accept that my obsession has nothing to do with the world and everything to do with me.The normal stream of consciousness that forms the muzak in my head (“Don’t forget the dry-cleaning oh God let there be a seat on the bus should I know more about North Korea mmm quite fancy some cheese”) has been entirely replaced with imaginary conversations with the men from Queer Eye. On some deeply buried, unexpected and extremely needy level, I believe these men can fix me, and that is not something I’ve thought about anyone from reality TV, ever. And this is because the men from Queer Eye seem (unusually) genuinely talented, and come across (uniquely for reality TV) as funny and wise and lovely. (The obvious exception to this is Antoni, the nominal chef of the show, who is lovely to look at but I strongly suspect doesn’t even know how to turn on a stove.) This is what we talk about:Tan (fashion)Tan is the easiest-going eye, which is why I suspect he is the most liked within the group. (Go on, ask me who on the show is really friends with who. I have opinions!) I talk to Tan about how sometimes I buy clothes not because I like them, but because I think they’re the sort of thing people expect me to wear, even though I know everyone is too busy thinking about their own lives to worry about my dresses. So do I think my defining feature is my wardrobe because I lack confidence in the actual me? Tan and I talk about this a lot on the bus.Bobby (interior design)I am currently doing up my living room, so Bobby and I have been in constant contact this summer. He reminds me that a room has to be practical and can’t just be about fun wallpaper, and that there is a fine line between a room that says, “This woman makes bold, stylish statements!” and “This woman probably keeps dried pampas grass in a giant Chinese urn.” I tell Bobby that, even though he is the least charismatic cast member, I know he works the hardest, and while all Karamo has to do is give pep talks in a car, Bobby has to carry literal roofs on his literal back. He looks down, touched, and tells me he appreciates that.Jonathan (grooming)Jonathan and I talk a lot about politics. I tell him how righteous it was when he shot Antoni down in a recent interview, after Antoni suggested it might be helpful for them to give a makeover to an all-out homophobe. Jonathan replied, in essence, “This is 2018, Antoni, and we don’t have time for your kumbaya politics, so stop breaking your back to accommodate haters, and fight for your truth instead.” As Jonathan would say, Yasss queen.But I also talk to Jonathan about my hair. I tell him that most of it fell out as a teenager, due to anorexia, and never grew back properly, and while most online comments don’t bother me, when people snark about my hair I have – piling shame upon shame – cried. Jonathan tells me I’m fabulous and those people are the literal worst, and he is right.Karamo (culture, whatever that means)I think of Karamo as a constant, messianic, ridiculously handsome presence in my life, who gazes upon the choices I make and occasionally calls me out on them. A little like God, yes, but I think of him more like the Patrick Swayze to my Whoopi Goldberg. He’s proud of me when I go to yoga. He benignly rolls his eyes when I drunkenly eat an entire birthday cake in front of an episode of Frasier I’ve seen four times at 2am.Antoni (food)I never talk to Antoni.

Employers and investors have poured into the midwestern city since the recession. At least $1bn has gone into its sparkling new downtown, revitalized arts district and shiny new condos. So why is Sly James, its highly regarded outgoing mayor, so unhappy?James, who steps down in July 2019, is leaving office with a sense of disappointment that despite Kansas City’s obvious accomplishments, the city’s recovery has left one large section of society behind: African Americans.But national numbers in a country as big as the US can be misleading. For many African Americans in the Kansas City area, the spoils of a roaring recovery have passed them by.As with the rest of the United States’ recovery from the 2008 recession, Kansas City’s comeback still carries the scars of the structural and intentional racism of its not-so-distant past.Carl, who did not want his last name published, is 57 years old and has big dreams: “I want to save up, put something aside for a proper burial, pay off my house, keep up with my car payments and pay that off. Typical American dream stuff,” he says. But his access to the American dream had to be deferred.Carl has been unemployed for nearly a year, collecting social security insurance after a hip replacement following an incident on his full-time construction job. Carl may be unemployed but he still works hard. The white blotches of his graying hair nearly match the white of his tightly starched button-down shirt and well-shined, tuxedo shoes. Most telling are the smoothed calluses on his fingertips one of his many jobs is playing the bass guitar for his local church.“One Sunday an announcement was made at the church about job workshops,” he says. He hustled, calling the numbers listed on the pamphlets left on the back of church tables. “After doing that program, I heard about the financial opportunity centers.”These financial opportunity centers (FOCs) are a pillar program of the Local Initiatives Support Corporation (LISC), where, according to Trese Booze, who heads these FOCs in Kansas City, coaches help “overlooked talent to prepare them for quality, living-wage jobs, while becoming resilient to financial shock”.Maurice Jones, LISC’s national CEO, says the goal was for participants to become “net cash positive”, culminating in a life plan that is “inspiring to them”. People just like Carl make their way into FOCs at a variety of points on their employment trajectory. For Carl, a felony conviction has made getting a job trickier than usual. He says he was pressured into a plea deal after brandishing an unregistered firearm in self-defense, in response to being threatened several times by gang members in his apartment complex.Like many with criminal records around the country, Carl must jump the hurdles of the “collateral consequences of convictions” if he is to get a job. According to the National Inventory of Collateral Consequences of Convictions (NICCC) compiled by the Council of State Governments, Carl could face up to 185 legally sanctioned barriers in Kansas to different kinds of employment and job certifications because of his conviction. In Missouri, that number increases to 313 – and that is before any consideration of the intangible effects of perception of being a black man with a felony conviction. Carl’s criminal record and the hip replacement that lost him both his “side-hustle” as a home-health provider and his full-time construction gig haven’t stopped his penchant for hustling.If you’re in Kansas City, he might be your beautician or barber. He might be your bass guitarist in a wedding or church band. And in Carl’s words: “I’ve dug ditches and I’d do it again to keep up with the payments if it wasn’t for my injury.”Shellie, an unemployed, 46-year-old mother, says that for her, bad things come in pairs.“First my car that I used to get to work was stolen,” she says, as her hair hides her tears. She recounts that days later, her “apartment building was shut down because the landlord had so many code violations”. The landlord, whose activities she says were tantamount to being a slumlord, never updated his tenants and gave them only 24 hours to move out.While the loss of the car might not be a stumbling block for some in major metropolitan areas, residents can’t expect much help from Kansas City’s Area Transportation Authority. KCATA’s director of business development, Frank White, says the jobs with livable wages aren’t easily accessible because “transit hasn’t been at the table when economic development conversations happen”. If the group that transports “the poor people” isn’t at the table when major decisions are made, those “poor people” won’t be guaranteed a voice.Walled off by Troost Avenue, black people were historically restricted to the east side of the city by carefully constructed covenants that prevented them from moving into Kansas City’s Country Club district. The homes of a burgeoning African American community were demolished to make room for Highway 71 over the course of decades, further impeding travel from black neighborhoods to the rest of the city. The predominantly white Country Club district remains one of the wealthiest neighborhoods in the United States, abutting one of the poorest areas of Kansas City.None of this, as James notes, took place “strictly by happenstance”.The net result is that jobs deemed geographically close to black communities are are actually far if traveling by public transit. Shellie, who lives in the urban core, is about an 18-20 minute drive from Lenexa, Kansas, host of a new Amazon fulfillment center. Without a car, the the 18-20 minute drive becomes two hours and 12 minutes of bus-riding and walking, often without sidewalks.Shellie, like Carl, finds odd jobs and public benefit programs that she can use to feed her child, and she leverages programs like LISC’s financial opportunity center to get her “financial house in order”. “Everybody falls and hopefully everybody gets back,” she says. “But when a person falls, you need a little cushion so you can get yourself back up. But nowadays with a president that wants to cut the programs that help me get up, I live in fear every day that I can’t get up any more.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/735b6baab21ebebb46514e92cb299d2f6e4348d0/0_37_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=88944b2729ea80508fafac144ce4cb7d","title":"easy does it the slow travel guide to the peloponnese greece","story":"The majestic peninsula is home to local tavernas, picturesque villages, ancient sites and stunning stretches of coast. Best of all, it’s delightfully unhurried and free of overhyped hotspotsThe Peloponnese, southern Greece’s much-mythologised peninsula, has something of a reputation for philoxenia – the tradition of giving a warm welcome and showing generous hospitality to visitors. It’s also a region that embodies the very ideal of slow travel: local food and drink, plenty of walking, zero stress, tapping ancient rhythms and community spirit.Of course, this comes from the people. But it may also have to do with vital statistics. The peninsula is about the size of Wales, yet receives only a small percentage of tourists in comparison to the big beasts of Corfu, Crete, Rhodes, Halkidiki and others. This means there’s no need to jostle among crowds.A topography of indented coasts, river valleys, steep mountain ranges and small coastal peninsulas encourages rural integrity over road-building. In hundreds of small villages, local ties are strong, there are festivals aplenty, and life revolves around farming and fishing, family and friends – and, naturally, local tavernas.Even the staples are sybaritic, from the famous Kalamata olives and green-gold oil to purple-hued tsakoniki aubergines to barrel-aged feta cheese. Wine grapes have been grown across the sun-baked slopes for centuries.For all its old-world charm, the Peloponnese is also a land of almost unlimited scope for exploration. It’s home to some of the most famous archaeological sites in the world, including Olympia and Ancient Messini, as well as many others lesser-known but no less enthralling. Much of Greece’s mythology originated here, including the main players of the Trojan wars.If you want relaxation, this unique part of Greece delivers in spades. Get the inside track on the must-visit villages, beaches and beauty spots, for the ultimate go-slow break in the Peloponnese ...Mani, the second finger at the southern tip of the Peloponnese and, by extension, mainland Greece itself, is one of the most beautiful regions in the country, with a mountainous spine running down to what were – until relatively recently – some very remote spots. The sun rises late on the coast because of the high Taygetos mountain range. Mornings tend to be lazy affairs where locals and visitors mingle to enjoy leisurely coffees and late breakfasts.It is also home to the pretty town of Kardamili. This laid-back little place is wonderful for walkers planning to hike the Viros gorge ditto for birdwatchers, artists and writers – little wonder that Patrick Leigh Fermor chose this village to be his home. The small beach resort of Stoupa is just a few miles to the south.Eat and drinkAll the local eateries are traditional family-run tavernas – as authentic a Greek culinary experience as you’ll find anywhere.  Kiki’s Taverna, up a side street from the town square, does dishes of the day rather than a set menu – favourites include sea bream and goat’s meat – ensuring produce is fresh and seasonal. It’s really traditional and popular with locals. If you want a stunning view with your meal, try Dioskouri Taverna, which overlooks the little harbour of Kardamili, for a fresh fish and sunset combination. It also sells local sea salt, olive soap and honey.StayThe Liakoto and Anniska hotels are on the sea front with the Taygetos range behind – Kardamili is blessed by both sea and mountain scenery. Anniska has a more traditional look and feel, with a stunning terrace where breakfast is served and drinks flow all day. Liakoto has sea-view rooms with private balconies overlooking the magnificent Messinian Bay. Both hotels have a very high number of repeat guests.This away-from-it-all haven is at the start of a string of fine, sandy beaches, culminating in the fantastic lagoon-like curve of Voidokilia in the heart of the nature reserve here – with wetlands excellent for birding. Close by is the historic town of Pylos, where the naval battle of Navarino was fought in 1827, during the Greek war of independence.Eat and drinkThere is an extensive choice of tavernas and cafes, which are really only busy at weekends and in peak season, when the locals from Pylos come for a swim and a fish lunch. Elia does superb salads, aromatic grilled sardines, and octopus with capers.StayZoe Resort’s 20 attractive studios and apartments have a large swimming pool and gardens leading down to the beach. Or you could opt to stay in the older – but no less charming – 24-room Zoe hotel.This historic town is known for the imposing walls of its Venetian fortress, which stretch out towards the sea. It’s very sleepy spot, with a wide sandy beach shelving very gently into shallow waters.Eat and drinkThe Klimataria restaurant is very well regarded, and eating out in the garden courtyard is a reason to visit in itself. Chicken in mustard sauce is delicious, as are the grilled veggies.StayThe Ulysses hotel, a small and friendly lodging with just nine rooms, is great for the beach. Breakfast is excellent and the hotel makes its own fresh lemonade – perfect for kicking off the morning. The Markopouloses, who own the Ulysses, are a mine of information and treat their guests as one of the family.The stunning, rugged hamlet of Gerolimenas, at the head of a fjord-like inlet, was once a busy trading post now it’s a nostalgic post-boom village, and comprises a mere handful of stone houses, a couple of tavernas and a beach.Eat and drinkThe fish – guaranteed fresh – is excellent here. Head for the harbour and you won’t go wrong.StayIf you want remote coupled with contemporary boutique-style comfort, a stay at the Kyrimai hotel should suit. Converted from a 19th-century warehouse, with sea to three sides, the hotel has a standout restaurant, and you can plunge directly from its jetty into the clearest of seas. Recommended for couples more than families, this is definitely one for romantic getaways.Find last-minute summer holiday deals at sunviloffers.

The crowd gathered around a big screen as downtown Rio buzzed with anticipation. And then came the own goal from Fernandinho, and Kevin De Bruyne’s follow-up – and the crowd fell into a horrible silence. Was this going to go horribly wrong again? Brazil always wants to win the World Cup. But today’s Brazil – politically polarized, ground down by recession, with its most popular leader in recent decades in jail, and an extreme rightwinger leading polls for October’s presidential election – yearned for victory despite – or because of its many problems.And yet after Friday’s 2-1 defeat, there was less of the wailing, gnashing of teeth and black humour that followed Brazil’s shock 7-1 defeat to Germany in 2014’s semi-final. Just a sense that people were taking stock.“Brazil eliminated from the cup with an own goal is very representative of the current national crisis,” Maurício Santoro, a professor of international relations at Rio de Janeiro State University, posted on his Facebook.“It is a really bad feeling. Brazil did not play as well as they could,” said Marcos Cordolino, 50, a civil servant watching the match on Benjamin Constant Street in Rio. “Our stars failed to shine,” he said.Brazil has won the World Cup five times, but its relationship with the tournament has grown cooler in recent years.The country hosted the 2014 tournament just a year after huge street demonstrations targeting graft and spending on stadiums. The economy had stopped growing, and the cracks were appearing in the success story of a country once heralded for combining economic growth and social progress.After that, everything seemed to go wrong: a multibillion-dollar graft scandal a zika epidemic rising violent crime and an army takeover of crumbling security services in Rio de Janeiro the impeachment of the leftist president Dilma Rousseff, and her replacement by her even less popular vice-president, the rightwinger Michel Temer.This time interest built up even more slowly than four years ago, with some Brazilians even supporting archrivals Argentina. But the team gave some reason for hope under coach Adenor Bacchi, known as “Tite”, who appeared to provide the managerial expertise his country’s notoriously corrupt and widely despised political leaders lack. “We always expect to win the cup,” said Tadeu Prieto, 32, an IT technician. Even so, the crowd spilling down the steps in front of the big screen on Benjamin Constant Street was about half the size of four years ago, when games were also shown here.Brazil’s deepening political ides were on show too. Engineer Camila Leonçio, 33, was wearing a blue Brazil shirt because the iconic yellow team shirts were adopted by rightwing demonstrators calling for Rousseff’s exit, and the country’s flag was waved by those calling for military intervention during May’s national truck strike. Regina Horge, 32, a kitchen assistant, had – like many leftists – gone one step further and wore a red Brazil shirt with a lapel flag. “People are not excited. The 7-1 was wrong and the social issue is very bad,” she said.At half-time, with Brazil 2-0 down, the crowd held on to expectations. “I am very hopeful,” said Joelma Saldanha, 38, a lab technician wearing a T-shirt whose slogan, loosely translated, read: “It’s just a game, your ass.” She explained: “It’s not just a game. It’s Brazil, playing for a better world.”And yet, things kept going wrong. During national anthems before kick-off, the big screen failed, forcing people to crowd around a small television set balanced on a nearby speaker - an emblematic moment for a broken country trying to work out how to fix itself. It did not start working again until the second half, just as Brazil started playing properly.After the final whistle, people milled around the streets. Yet there was no sense of the desperation some Brazilians remember from past failures, like 1982 – when Brazil’s most creative team was eliminated by Italy. Julia Mayer, 32, sat on a stool scrolling through her cellphone messages. “Now Brazil has to worry about other things like health and education. The struggle continues,” she said.On a nearby street music was already booming from a house party and four women discussed the game as they walked by. “For Brazil to have won this cup would have been an embarrassment. The last cup destroyed our country,” said Estella Resende, 42, a kitchen assistant. And then – like Brazil – the women moved on."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb2700488f1062a153df4813f112b33da49b51cd/0_206_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=596790cd1215a698db89c4ac54114ac7","title":"north korea calls us denuclearisation talks regrettable","story":"Pyongyang says its resolve to give up its nuclear programmes may falterNorth Korea has said that high-level talks with a US delegation led by Mike Pompeo were regrettable and accused Washington of trying to unilaterally pressurise the country into abandoning its nuclear weapons.The North’s statement came on Saturday, hours after the US secretary of state wrapped up two days of talks with senior North Korean officials without meeting Kim Jong-un but with commitments for new discussions on denuclearisation and the repatriation of the remains of American soldiers killed during the Korean war.Before leaving Pyongyang, Pompeo told reporters that his conversations with senior North Korean official Kim Yong-chol had been productive, conducted in good faith and that a great deal of progress had been made in some areas. He stressed there was still more work to be done in other areas, much of which would be done by working groups that the two sides had set up to deal with specific issues.The North provided a much harsher assessment of the talks. In a statement released by an unnamed foreign ministry spokesman, Pyongyang accused the US of betraying the spirit of last month’s summit between Donald Trump and Kim by making “one-sided and robber-like” demands on “CVID” – the complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearisation of North Korea.It said the outcome of the follow-up talks was very concerning because it had led to a “dangerous phase that might rattle our willingness for denuclearisation that had been firm”.“We had expected that the US side would offer constructive measures that would help build trust based on the spirit of the leaders’ summit ... we were also thinking about providing reciprocal measures,” said the statement, carried by the North’s official Korean Central News Agency.According to the spokesman, during the talks with Pompeo, North Korea raised the issue of a possible declaration to formally end the 1950-53 Korean war, which concluded with an armistice and not a peace treaty. It also offered to discuss the closure of a missile engine test site that would “physically affirm” a move to halt the production of intercontinental range ballistic missiles and setting up working-level discussions for the return of US war remains.However, the spokesman said the US had come up with a variety of “conditions and excuses” to delay a declaration on ending the war. The spokesman also downplayed the significance of the US suspending its military exercises with South Korea, saying the North had made a larger concession by blowing up the tunnels at its nuclear test site.In criticising the talks with Pompeo, however, North Korea carefully avoided attacking Trump, saying “we wholly maintain our trust toward President Trump,” but also that Washington must not allow “headwinds” against the “wills of the leaders”.Pompeo said a Pentagon team would be meeting North Korean officials on or about 12 July at the border between North and South Korea to discuss the repatriation of remains and that working-level talks would be held soon on the destruction of North Korea’s missile engine testing facility.In the days following his historic 12 June summit with Kim Jong-un in Singapore, Trump had announced that the return of the remains and the destruction of the missile facility had been completed or were in progress. Pompeo, however, said more talks were needed on both.Earlier, Pompeo and Kim Yong-chol both said they needed clarity on the parameters of an agreement to denuclearise the Korean peninsula that Trump and the North Korean leader had agreed to in Singapore. The trip was Pompeo’s third to Pyongyang since April and his first since the summit.Unlike his previous visits, which have been one-day affairs during which he has met Kim Jong-un, Pompeo spent the night at a government guesthouse in Pyongyang and did not see the North Korean leader, although US officials had suggested such a meeting was expected. State department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said no meeting with Kim had been planned."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d5c98b292d29fa22d629cf8a5ec70435c8f65a06/0_269_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4c4ff0fc8dd375c6b1362e3e86b1dd6c","title":"taliban rejects afghan government peace talks","story":"Resumption of fighting dashes hopes that Eid ceasefire would bring about extended peaceThe Taliban have rejected the Afghan government’s offer of peace talks, another blow to hopes that an unprecedented Eid ceasefire could be a step towards more lasting peace.Fighting has resumed with full intensity around the country after a brief halt during June. The latest casualties are three children from eastern Ghazni province who were killed by roadside mines at the weekend.With two rounds of high-stakes elections due within the next year, political tensions are adding to concerns about rising insecurity. Parliamentary elections are due to take place in October. Next spring there will be a presidential vote, with the current leader, Ashraf Ghani, expected to run for re-election.Power brokers and the many ethnic strongmen who carved out a constituency over decades of war are now manoeuvring to bolster their position before the polls. One of the biggest question marks hangs over the exiled vice-president, Abdul Rashid Dostum. He fled to Turkey last year after allegations he ordered the torture and sexual assault of a political opponent. An ethnic Uzbek, Dostum still holds huge sway among his community in Afghanistan, and there are regular rumours he will return. His supporters took to the streets this week in northern Faryab province, for sometimes violent protests over the government’s arrest of a prominent militia commander who is one of Dostum’s allies.“Until the last drop of our blood we will try and fight to get justice, which is the releasing of our commander and the returning of our general,” said one supporter who had travelled from an outlying district.This year has been a particularly bloody one in Afghanistan, especially in the cities where one of the worst waves of violence in decades killed hundreds. The dead included nine journalists, killed along with at least seven other people by a suicide bomber posing as one of the press corps.There was a respite at the end of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, when Ghani offered the Taliban a unilateral ceasefire as a precursor to possible talks. For three days over Eid the militant group responded by putting down their weapons.The rare days without conflict sparked celebrations and a sense of possibility, alongside a sense of hope that many Afghans had all but abandoned. Taliban soldiers wandered into towns they had attacked for years, where they took grinning selfies with the army and officials who are normally their targets.“I am 24, and in these years the only thing that I can remember is war and war and war, but during Eid days I saw some moments of joy that I did not see in my entire life,” said Firooz Osmani, a resident of Gozara district in western Herat province. “I cried when I saw Taliban and government officials are hugging and taking selfies, I could not stop my tears. I was really disappointed when I understand that the truce is over.”Pro-government Afghans who had felt confined to those cities are returning to home villages after long absences. But Taliban commanders were reportedly furious about the impromptu socialising, and worried that the success of the ceasefire could undermine morale.Although the government stuck to its own ceasefire for 18 days, the Taliban went back to fighting after three days. There were also attacks by the regional branch of Islamic State, which never agreed to put down their weapons.Among the areas where officials now say they feel under siege is eastern Ghazni province. “The province is facing very bad days. If the central government do not send extra forces for help, we will witness a catastrophe in the entire province,” said Nasir Ahmad Faghiri, a member of the provincial council in Ghazni."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/74c494f3b9de620a4f3046ce9be6c063b75652a0/0_367_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=24f37f5604d1e3f3e644a3325cadb83f","title":"pride in london in pictures","story":"Huge crowds enjoy the sun and the parade at the city’s annual LGBT Pride celebration."},{"url":null,"title":"urgent recall of frozen vegetables from irish supermarkets","story":"The Food Safety Authority of Ireland\u0026nbsp(FSAI) has issued an urgent recall of frozen vegetables from a number of Irish supermarkets over listeria fears.The authority has recalled 18 products from Tesco, Lidl, Iceland and Brakes stories nationwide.

By the time it ended, the three-month heatwave had caused the worst drought in 150 years, while the temperature recorded in Boora on July 29th marked the fifth day in a row when the mercury had breached 32 degrees.The summer drought was heightened by the lack of rainfall during the previous two winters, which placed extraordinary demands on supplies and led to restrictions being put in place a year later to rebuild stocks.Reporting on the heatwave, The  noted the changes in people’s habits that began to be noticed throughout June, as people grew more accustomed to the new Mediterranean climate. In Ireland, on June 29th, people mulled buying shutters for windows to let the air in, and keep the sun out as temperatures hit 27.5 degrees in the Midlands and 26 degrees at Armagh Observatory – the warmest June day there since 1870. Despite the endless sunshine, RTÉ’s Colm Connolly reported the concerns on July 2nd of a consultant dermatologist about people who were taking photo-sensitising drugs to boost tanning speeds.Meanwhile, drought-sensitive beech trees suffered badly, and the growth of many of them in Ireland and the UK still showed after-effects three decades later, though ones in the UK suffered worst.Sales on electric fans continued to rise while some families opted to stay indoors completely and cool off in “tepid baths”, though the authorities urged people to keep levels below five inches.Meanwhile, The  pondered about the effects of the heatwave on men’s sexual interest, fearing that the high temperatures were causing “a love drought”. “It seems the spirit is willing but the flesh is weak when temperatures soar into the 80 and 90s,” the newspaper reported, before interviewing a clinical psychologist who explained that men still felt “sexually aroused but don’t feel inclined to initiate any activity”."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Teenager leaves other patients cut from flying glass as he smashes up bathroom\u0026lsquoForest fire tourists\u0026rsquo asked to stay away as firefighting continues on large swathes of landTaoiseach says he looks forward to seeing detailed proposals for future future EU-UK relationshipGovernment opens scheme to adjoining institutions after Ombudsman\u0026rsquos interventionWater sources are diminishing as Met \u0026Eacuteireann says drought could last for 15 more daysMan (59) pronounced dead at scene despite efforts by paramedics to resuscitate himThe Food Safety Authority of Ireland also recalls pestos over salmonella concernsCar in which dead man was a passenger left the road at Gibbstown early on SaturdayIncident took place at junction of John Street and The Manor at early on SaturdayAs they close in on a World Cup final, English expats expect colourful \u0026lsquosupport\u0026rsquo from the nativesData brings together sales prices, rents, locations, social housing and private rented levelsNew interactive resource shows the city\u0026rsquos social and economic isions in stark detailGalway woman Lorraine Walsh says cancer testing saved her life but let her down deeplyPatient representatives in Government review of cancer screening call for actionGsoc process not as advanced by time of Sgt Michael Galvin\u0026rsquos death as previously thoughtCardinal Kevin Farrell says priests have no credibility when it comes to training people for marriageLaw enforcement and safety groups have set September 19th as \u0026ldquoEuropean day without a road deathAdam Marlowe convicted on DNA found at scene after robbery and assault of farmer (81)Dublin Bus mechanic tried to sell boat on Adverts.ie to cover fraudulent injury claim costsZones of 100m-150m intended to stop women being harassed while accessing services"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3557850.1530961377!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"heatwave irish water looking at options for new restrictions","story":"\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                                            Vartry Reservoir water treatment works in Co Wicklow.

Photograph: Reuters With Ireland’s exceptional warm spell showing no sign of abating and no significant let up in the drought expected for at least 15 days, Irish Water is examining options for more extensive water restrictions if required.According to Met Éireann, mainly dry, warm weather will continue this weekend and until Thursday at least, while forecaster Evelyn Cusack said predictions are for the dry spell to continue for another ten days - and possibly up to 15 days.Temperatures this weekend will range up to 26 degrees on Saturday and 28 degrees on Sunday. Ireland offically entered a drought on Thursday following 15 days without rain.Given the low-moisture content in soil following weeks without rain forecasters predict at least one week of sustained rainfall is necessary before water levels in lakes, rivers and reservoirs start to recover.An Irish Water spokeswoman said the possibility of no rain falling in the near future could lead to restrictions, which include a national hosepipe ban and night-time pressure reductions,\u0026nbspbeing extended to the commercial sector with bans on washing down premises.If these measures also proved insufficient then Irish Water would have to consider wider reductions in water pressure.The utility could theoretically ban all non essential usage, including watering can usage, window washing and watering of sports pitches.Irish Water’s helpline has received less than 40 reports of people defying the domestic hosepipe by Thursday last, the evening before the Dublin based ban was extended to all areas. The spokeswoman said further analysis of the reports would be available over coming days.Defying the ban can attract a fine of up to €125, but the spokeswoman said the majority of calls have been from people seeking clarification or advice on restrictions and outages. She said people could see the effects of the water shortage in the burnt grass and most people were behaving responsibly.Speaking on RTÉ’s Prime Time during the week Met Éireann’s Ms Cusack said: “Our predictions are certainly another ten days which is the medium range of our forecast but we’re currently using an experimental 15 day forecast and that is indicating a lot of dry weather.“It’s been exceptionally dry. It’s been the driest June in Leinster since 1941. “These conditions will remain for another week to two weeks. It’s not only been exceptionally dry but also exceptionally sunny and that’s because the weather has been coming down from the north.”Meanwhile Irish Water has been notified of a number of ongoing leaks in Dublin City Centre in which water is flowing down the road.On Friday as the State-wide hosepipe ban came into effect water could be seen flowing down the road in front of Leinster House on Kildare Street.Irish Water has also acknowledged a report of a leak at Glover’s Lane, beside the entrance to St Stephen’s Green Car Park which has been pouring water into the street since mid June.It is understood that Irish water would have to close the road to fix the leak, leading to access issues for the centre and local business."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3557877.1530971951!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"varadkar and may speak after pm secures approval for soft brexit","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach Leo Varadkar meeting with British prime minister Theresa May in June. Photograph: Yves HermanPoolAPTaoiseach Leo Varadkar spoke with British prime minister Theresa May about\u0026nbspthe outcome of the Chequers cabinet by phone on Saturday afternoon.The leaders were speaking after Ms May persuaded her cabinet to back a\u0026nbspsoft Brexit.Ms May briefed the Taoiseach on the outcome of her cabinet meeting on Friday.A statement issued on Friday at the end of a day-long meeting at Chequers suggested that Britain was\u0026nbspready to reach an early agreement on the so-called backstop to guarantee that the Border remains open.This would maintain full regulatory alignment with Europe for goods and agricultural products, and treating Britain and the EU as a single customs territory.The Taoiseach welcomed the fact that the UK Government had reached a position where it would put forward detailed proposals for the future EU-UK relationship post-Brexit.He said he looked forward to seeing greater detail on those proposals over the coming days and hoped they would be a helpful input to the negotiation process.He noted that time was running out and the Government would engage constructively with the Barnier Task Force and the other Member States over the coming weeks.The Taoiseach made clear that the Government was open to proposals, which met our aims of avoiding a hard border and maintaining free trade with the UK, while respecting the EU single market and customs union.Mr Varadkar and Ms May agreed that they, and their offices, would maintain close contact in the period ahead.Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney is calling Brexit negotiations to be intensified as “time is short”.Mr Coveney said he too welcomed the UK government was finalising specific proposals for the future EU-UK relationship.“Ireland’s position is that we want to see the closest possible relationship between the EU and the UK,” he said.“On the backstop for the border, our position remains clear. While our preference is still for an overall EU-UK relationship which would resolve all issues, it remains essential that a backstop is agreed which provides certainty that in any circumstances, and no matter what the outcome of the negotiations on the EU-UK future relationship, a hard border will be avoided.Mr Coveney said talks needed to be intensified.“Time is short. I am in regular contact with Michel Barnier and my officials are working day-in and day-out with the Task Force team he leads. Our entire focus now is on ensuring a Withdrawal Agreement, including the Irish backstop, is agreed. This will give businesses across our islands certainty in terms of planning for a status-quo transition when the UK leaves the Union in March 2019,” he said.Mr Coveney said the UK statement needed “detailed consideration” and looked forward to the additional details the White Paper would give.Negotiations on Britain’s withdrawal agreement with the EU have been deadlocked on the issue of the Border backstop, with Brussels saying it must apply only to the North and London calling for a UK-wide solution to avoid creating barriers within the UK.In a statement issued late on Friday, the Irish Government said that EU ministers would consider the UK proposals at a meeting in Brussels on July 20th.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

But the EIB, which is independent, told The  “it cannot support projects in Iran under the current circumstances.”The president’s decision to pull out of the Iran deal was greeted with almost universal outcry among world leaders, and particularly by the EU.The bloc views the deal, 12 years in the making, as its flagship foreign policy achievement that brought some security to an unstable region and a flurry of investment from European SMEs and multinationals.The Commission, with Britain’s support, moved to prop up the nuclear deal as best it could in a bid to convince Iran not to pull out of the deal as well.As well as announcing measures to legally protect European companies active in Iran and ban them from complying with US sanctions, the commission said it would change the rules governing the EIB so it could de-risk EU investment in the country.The EIB de-risks investment to convince the private sector to back projects, which support EU policy objectives, in sectors investors would otherwise find hard to finance. It is able to do this thanks to its AAA credit rating, which would come under threat were it to default.“This enabling measure does not however commit the EIB to actually support projects in Iran. Any activity of the EIB in Iran would require a decision of the governing bodies of the EIB before it could be considered,” an EIB spokesman said.Hassan Rouhani, the Iranian president, has been in Europe trying to shore up the deal A European Commission spokesperson also confirmed that the change to the rules it has called for would not force the EIB to support investment in Iran.Asked if the move was symbolic, one well-placed EU source said “Yes”. But, the source added, it would allow de-risking in the future if the US-EU stand-off deescalated.Nigel Farage, Ukip\u0027s former leader and an ally of Mr Trump, said it was “beyond comprehension that the EU was considering opening up lending in Iran. The Trump administration will take a very dim view of this,” he told The .But the deal looked in further doubt yesterday as its remaining signatories failed to persuade Tehran in a summit in Vienna that they would be able to fully compensate for economic losses caused by the US exit.Hassan Rouhani, Iran’s president, told French President Emmanuel Macron in a phone call before the meeting that the package as it stood fell short of their demands.Federica Mogherini, the EU foreign policy chief who is chairing the summit, said the world powers and Iran had agreed to continue talking, including on economic measures.European diplomats, however, privately questioned whether they could do enough to keep Tehran onboard.We\u0027ve made some progress, including on safeguarding some crude (oil) sales, but it\u0027s unlikely to meet Iranian expectations, said one senior official.Please review our commenting policySouth Korean women turn out in their thousands to protest against widespread spycam porn crimesLetters from Thai cave: Football coach apologises while boys request birthday party and fried chickenUS asks for more time to reunite migrant families because some parents have already been deported Warning over Chinese lanterns after star horse set on fireAt least 38 dead as record Japan rains prompt mass evacuationsWhite storks to breed in Britain for the first time in 600 yearsNorth Korea says talks with Mike Pompeo were \u0026#39regrettable\u0026#39India should repeal laws that discriminate against leprosy patients, says supreme courtFrance struggles with tourist numbers as it attracts record number of holidaymakersSeparated Koreans denounce North-South family reunion plan as \u0026#39cruel\u0026#39Police search for farmer who disappeared after reporting arson attackLabour \u0026#39cash for access\u0026#39 scandal: The 8 MPs who gave Commons passes to union officials who bankrolled their election campaignsJordanians throw aid across border to Syrians fleeing bombardment as government refuses to let them inNantes rioting enters fourth day as policeman charged over shooting of young black manWhat\u0026#39s it like to be LGBT and Conservative?Jacob Rees-Mogg says Theresa May\u0026#39s plan \u0026#39worse\u0026#39 than no-deal BrexitVW owners left needing up to nine repairs and without their cars for months after emissions scandal \u0026#39fix\u0026#39 failsSchool bans \u0026#39flossing\u0026#39 dance because Fortnite moves are intimidating children on playgroundReshuffle threats and fake taxi firms: How the stage was set for Theresa May\u0026#39s coup de théâtre at ChequersWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/07/07/TELEMMGLPICT000168471549_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqaRL1kC4G7DT9ZsZm6Pe3PehAFAI_f6ud569StXyOKH0.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"letters thai cave football coach apologises boys request birthday","story":"digitalservices@telegraphA mother of one of the 12 boys displays an image of her son and his football coach digitalservices@telegraphPhiphat Photi’s message to his family from the depths of Thailand’s Tham Luang cave was short and hopeful. If I get out, please can you bring me some grilled pork and vegetables?” the 15-year-old wrote. He and the other 11 trapped boys wrote the letters in the darkness of the cave, which were then delivered to their parents by Thai Navy Seal ers. The short notes, written on scraps of paper, were the first communication the anxious parents have had from their children since they disappeared on June 23.  I am so happy to see his letter, his handwriting. I\u0027m almost crying, said Supaluk Sompiengjai, the mother of one of the boys.It doesn\u0027t matter how long I wait as long as he is safe.Thai authorities said Saturday that conditions for a rescue were “perfect” over the next to three to four days, before fresh rainfall or shrinking oxygen supplies endanger the mission. Combination of photos shows handwritten messages written by boys and football coach trapped in Tham Luang cave in Chiang Rai“In the next three or four days, the conditions are perfect in terms of the water, the weather and the boys\u0027 health,” said Narongsak Osottanakorn, the governor of Chiang Rai Province.We have to make a clear decision on what we can do… We’re still at war with water and time.”Rescue crews have been working around the clock to pump water out the 2.5-mile tunnel between that separates the boys and their football coach from the entrance to the cave. While water levels have fallen significantly, the tunnel still contains treacherous pools and jagged rocks that would be a challenge for even professional ers, let alone a dozen exhausted teenagers. By Saturday evening, pouring rain began to once again pound the area around the cave\u0027s entrance, raising fears that the tunnel would flood once again. Rising water levels could delay a rescue effort - or force authorities to launch it sooner than they had planned to try to get in before the tunnel floods. There were chaotic scenes at the rescue camp yesterday (SAT) as a car fell off a cliff at Pha Mee hill, causing minor injuries to three people.Mr Osottanakorn said he was also worried that oxygen levels inside the cave would fall and carbon dioxide levels would rise, making the boys drowsy and eventually unconscious. The most direct method of rescue would be for the boys to swim out of the cave wearing scuba gear and accompanied by navy ers. The boys are already being given instructions in ing techniques.But the journey could take more than ten hours. The death of a Thai Navy Seal in the tunnel this week highlights how dangerous it is. More than 100 “chimneys” have also been drilled into the the mountainside, in the hope that rescuers can penetrate the cave and lift the boys out to safety. Mr Osottanakorn said the boys were 600 metres below the surface and digging crews “still cannot find their location yet”. The deepest chimney so far has reached 400 metres.Elon Musk, the billionaire entrepreneur, said Saturday that he was in discussions about an “escape pod design that might be safe enough to try” to bring the boys out of the tunnel.  Diving cylinders are prepared at a makeshift camp at the entrance of Tham Luang Nang Non cavesEkapol Chanthawong, the 25-year-old coach of the Wild Boars soccer team, wrote his own letter from the cave in which he apologised to the parents. “I promise I will care for the kids as best as possible. I want to say thanks for all the support and I want to apologise to the parents,” he wrote. His note was written in response to a joint letter from the parents of the 12 boys.  Thailand cave rescue, in pictures“Please take care of all the children. Don\u0027t blame yourself, their letter to him read. We are not mad at you at all. We understand and are rooting for you.

talks mike pompeo regrettable","story":"digitalservices@telegraphNorth Korea said the talks with Mr Pompeo were \u0026#34regrettable\u0026#34digitalservices@telegraphNorth Korea said Saturday that high-level talks with a US delegation led by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo were regrettable and accused Washington of trying to unilaterally pressure the country into abandoning its nukes.The North\u0027s statement came hours after Mr Pompeo wrapped up two days of talks with senior North Korean officials without meeting North Korean leader Kim Jong-un but with commitments for new discussions on denuclearisation and the repatriation of the remains of American soldiers killed during the Korean War.Before departing Pyongyang, Mr Pompeo told reporters that his conversations with senior North Korean official Kim Yong Chol had been productive, conducted in good faith and that a great deal of progress had been made in some areas.He stressed that there\u0027s still more work to be done in other areas, much of which would be done by working groups that the two sides have set up to deal with specific issues.The North provided a much harsher assessment of the talks, saying that the United States betrayed the spirit of last month\u0027s summit between President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim by making one-sided and robber-like demands on CVID, or the complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearisation of North Korea.It said the outcome of the follow-up talks was very concerning because it has led to a dangerous phase that might rattle our willingness for denuclearisation that had been firm.North Korea’s fiery relationship with the USWe had expected that the US side would offer constructive measures that would help build trust based on the spirit of the leaders\u0027 summit ... we were also thinking about providing reciprocal measures, an unnamed spokesman of Pyongyang\u0027s Foreign Ministry said in a statement carried by the North\u0027s official Korean Central News Agency.However, the attitude and stance the United States showed in the first high-level meeting (between the countries) was no doubt regrettable, the spokesman said.Mr Pompeo said that a Pentagon team would be meeting with North Korean officials on or about July 12 at the border between North and South Korea to discuss the repatriation of remains and that working level talks would be held soon on the destruction of North Korea\u0027s missile engine testing facility.In the days following his historic June 12 summit with Kim Jong Un in Singapore, President Donald Trump had announced that the return of the remains and the destruction of the missile facility had been completed or were in progress.Mr Pompeo, however, said that more talks were needed on both.We now have a meeting set up for July 12 - it could move by one day or two - where there will be discussions between the folks responsible for the repatriation of remains. (It) will take place at the border and that process will begin to develop over the days that follow, he said as he boarded his plane for Tokyo.On the destruction of the missile engine plant, Mr Pompeo said: We talked about what the modalities would look like for the destruction of that facility as well, and some progress there as well, and then we have laid out a path for further negotiation at the working level so the two teams can get together and continue these discussions.Earlier, Mr Pompeo and Kim Yong Chol both said they needed clarity on the parameters of an agreement to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula that Mr Trump and Kim Jong-un agreed to in Singapore.The trip was Mr Pompeo\u0027s third to Pyongyang since April and his first since the summit.Unlike his previous visits, which have been one-day affairs during which he has met with Kim Jong-un, Mr Pompeo spent the night at a government guesthouse in Pyongyang and did not see the North Korean leader, although US officials had suggested such a meeting was expected.State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said no meeting with Kim had been planned.As they began their talks on Saturday, Kim Yong Chol alluded to the fact that Pompeo and his delegation had stayed overnight in Pyongyang.We did have very serious discussions on very important matters yesterday, Mr Kim said. So, thinking about those discussions you might have not slept well last night.Donald Trump shakes hands with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in Singapore Mr Pompeo, who spoke with Mr Trump, national security adviser John Bolton and White House chief of staff John Kelly by secure phone before starting Saturday\u0027s session, replied that he slept just fine.He added that the Trump administration was committed to reaching a deal under which North Korea would denuclearise and realise economic benefits in return.Mr Kim later said that there are things that I have to clarify to which Mr Pompeo responded that there are things that I have to clarify as well.There was no immediate explanation of what needed to be clarified, but the two sides have been struggling to specify what exactly denuclearisation would entail and how it could be verified to the satisfaction of the United States.Mr Pompeo and Mr Kim met for nearly three hours Friday and then had dinner amid growing skepticism over how serious the North Korean leader is about giving up his nuclear arsenal and translating the upbeat rhetoric following his summit with Mr Trump into concrete action.Please review our commenting policySouth Korean women turn out in their thousands to protest against widespread spycam porn crimesLetters from Thai cave: Football coach apologises while boys request birthday party and fried chickenUS asks for more time to reunite migrant families because some parents have already been deported Warning over Chinese lanterns after star horse set on fireAt least 38 dead as record Japan rains prompt mass evacuationsWhite storks to breed in Britain for the first time in 600 yearsIndia should repeal laws that discriminate against leprosy patients, says supreme courtEU gambit to use European Investment Bank funds to shore up Iran deal is \u0026#39purely symbolic\u0026#39France struggles with tourist numbers as it attracts record number of holidaymakersSeparated Koreans denounce North-South family reunion plan as \u0026#39cruel\u0026#39Police search for farmer who disappeared after reporting arson attackLabour \u0026#39cash for access\u0026#39 scandal: The 8 MPs who gave Commons passes to union officials who bankrolled their election campaignsJordanians throw aid across border to Syrians fleeing bombardment as government refuses to let them inNantes rioting enters fourth day as policeman charged over shooting of young black manWhat\u0026#39s it like to be LGBT and Conservative?Jacob Rees-Mogg says Theresa May\u0026#39s plan \u0026#39worse\u0026#39 than no-deal BrexitVW owners left needing up to nine repairs and without their cars for months after emissions scandal \u0026#39fix\u0026#39 failsSchool bans \u0026#39flossing\u0026#39 dance because Fortnite moves are intimidating children on playgroundReshuffle threats and fake taxi firms: How the stage was set for Theresa May\u0026#39s coup de théâtre at ChequersWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/07/06/TELEMMGLPICT000168637656_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqhZJ9vnP3TZj6dX4F0Tnhrvz0WKBCYLnq8Q1zj3C0ras.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"school bans flossing fortnite dance moves intimidating children","story":"digitalservices@telegraphTottenham and England star Dele Alli \u0026#34flossing\u0026#34 after scoring against Man Utd in the FA Cup semi-finaldigitalservices@telegraphA school has banned the dance craze flossing from the hit video game Fortnite because the moves are intimidating children on the playground.Catherine Cox, headteacher at Ilfracombe Junior School in Devon, wrote to parents outlining her concerns but faced a furious backlash from parents.She told them: We want our school to be one in which human beings treat each other with kindness and appreciation.Fortnite is for 12 years pluss.

France is the world’s most popular tourist destination, despite a dip after a string of attacks in 2015 and 2016. Tourism represents nearly 10 per cent of its GDP and supports about three million jobs.There are fears of Venice-style “over-tourism,” with France expected to receive more than 90 million foreign visitors this year, rising to 100 million by 2020.Tourists are being urged to make online bookings up to three months in advanceChristian Mantel, head of Atout France, the national tourism development agency, said: “If nothing is done, in five years time it will be necessary to regulate the number of first-time foreign visitors to France. In Paris, 80 per cent of sites that tourists absolutely want to see are along the banks of the Seine and they are close to saturation.”France offers a unique combination of historic châteaux, beautiful beaches and countryside, picturesque villages, glamorous Riviera nightlife and a renowned gastronomic tradition that draws tourists from across the world. The Chinese are among the highest spenders, and Parisians have grown accustomed to the sight of Chinese couples posing for wedding photographs on the banks of the Seine.So far relations between tourists and locals are generally amiable. France has not had to contend with the stag-dos, anti-tourist protests or graffiti that have hit Venice, Amsterdam and Barcelona, but officials fear resentment is building.Last year Dubrovnik announced drastic limits on entry to its Old Town. Venetians have protested against visiting cruise ships, and sightseeing buses have been attacked in Barcelona.  The growing number of visitors to France reflects the phenomenal expansion of tourism worldwide.“For now, France hasn’t reached crisis point, but we’re close to it,” Mr Mantel said. “Above a certain number of visitors, sites will be forced to turn people away.”“Tourism is great, but at a certain point you have to stop saying you want to attract ever greater numbers of tourists,” said Pierre-Frédéric Roulot of the Louvre Hotels Group. “If not, you run into a brick wall.” Mr Roulot called for a focus on high-end tourism. “You need a business plan for tourism, to increase tourist spending rather than the number of tourists.”The growing number of visitors to France reflects the phenomenal expansion of tourism worldwide. The global number of tourists has more than doubled in the past 15 years to exceed 1.3 billion last year, and is forecast to rise to nearly two billion by 2030.Letters from Thai cave: Football coach apologises while boys request birthday party and fried chickenUS asks for more time to reunite migrant families because some parents have already been deported Warning over Chinese lanterns after star horse set on fireAt least 38 dead as record Japan rains prompt mass evacuationsWhite storks to breed in Britain for the first time in 600 yearsNorth Korea says talks with Mike Pompeo were \u0026#39regrettable\u0026#39India should repeal laws that discriminate against leprosy patients, says supreme courtEU gambit to use European Investment Bank funds to shore up Iran deal is \u0026#39purely symbolic\u0026#39Separated Koreans denounce North-South family reunion plan as \u0026#39cruel\u0026#39Police search for farmer who disappeared after reporting arson attackLabour \u0026#39cash for access\u0026#39 scandal: The 8 MPs who gave Commons passes to union officials who bankrolled their election campaignsJordanians throw aid across border to Syrians fleeing bombardment as government refuses to let them inNantes rioting enters fourth day as policeman charged over shooting of young black manWhat\u0026#39s it like to be LGBT and Conservative?Jacob Rees-Mogg says Theresa May\u0026#39s plan \u0026#39worse\u0026#39 than no-deal BrexitVW owners left needing up to nine repairs and without their cars for months after emissions scandal \u0026#39fix\u0026#39 failsSchool bans \u0026#39flossing\u0026#39 dance because Fortnite moves are intimidating children on playgroundReshuffle threats and fake taxi firms: How the stage was set for Theresa May\u0026#39s coup de théâtre at ChequersFake vaccine video goes viral in Pakistan putting the global drive to eradicate polio at risk at the 11th hour We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/06/28/10/deep-purple-1.jpg","title":"deep purple montreux jazz festival lake geneva 1971","story":"Created with Sketch.After a fire burned\u0026nbspdown a casino, the band were forced to hole up in a near derelict hotel to record a song inspired by the incident that became one of their best hits.\u0026nbspAhead of their return to where it all happened at the\u0026nbspMontreux\u0026nbspJazz Festival, William Cook finds out how it acquired legendary statusClick to followThe Independent OnlineHow did a fool with roman candles help inspire one of the most recognised rock and roll songs?For 50\u0026nbspweeks of every year, Montreux is a sleepy place. The setting is spectacular, at the eastern end of Lake Geneva, on the edge of the Swiss Alps. Palm trees line the promenade, there are snowcapped peaks above. You can sit and look at it all day, but when the sun goes down the town shuts down. The vistas here are heavenly, but there’s not a lot to do.Yet for a fortnight each summer, this torpid paradise is transformed. Lighting rigs and big amp stacks spring up along the lakeside. Grizzled musos replace prosperous OAPs. A tax haven for wealthy pensioners becomes the centre of the world music scene, as the Montreux Jazz Festival comes to town.The Montreux Jazz Festival has always been a bit of a misnomer. It started as a jazz festival in 1967, the brainchild of Swiss impresario Claude Nobs. Keith Jarrett played the first festival, Nina Simone played the second, but it’s always doubled as a rock fest, ever since Ten Years After played here in 1969.Since then, Montreux Jazz Festival has become increasingly eclectic. During the 1970s, there were shows by Bo Diddley, Chuck Berry, Carlos Santana, Muddy Waters, John Lee Hooker, Ella Fitzgerald, Aretha Franklin and Roberta Flack. James Brown came here in the 1980s. Miles Davis played here 11 times between 1973 and 1991. In the Noughties, Montreux hosted Stevie Wonder, David Bowie, Leonard Cohen, Run-DMC and Radiohead.This year’s line-up is similarly erse: Rag ‘n’ Bone Man, Nine Inch Nails, Jamiroquai, Massive Attack, Jamie Cullum, John Cale, Iggy Pop, Nick Cave, Steve Winwood, Van Morrison… and the band that put Montreux on the hard-rock roadmap, heavy metal veterans Deep Purple.Even at their headbanging peak, Deep Purple were never really fashionable. They lacked the mystique of other hard rock bands like Led Zeppelin or The Doors. However, in Ritchie Blackmore they had a lead guitarist to rival Led Zep’s Jimmy Page, and in Jon Lord they boasted a keyboard virtuoso the equal of The Doors’ Ray Manzarek.Montreux started as a jazz festival in 1967, but has doubled as a rock event since 1969 (Claude Nobs Archives)Blackmore left the band long ago, and Lord died in 2012, but the three other core members are still going strong: vocalist Ian Gillan, bassist Roger Glover and drummer Ian Paice (the only ever-present since the band started out, 50 years ago). Along with Lord and Blackmore, this trio recorded Deep Purple’s most famous track, in Montreux in 1971, with one of the most familiar riffs in rock history – “Smoke on the Water”.Blackmore’s immortal riff would have been enough to ensure the song’s longevity, but like all the best rock songs it also tells a story. Thankfully, unlike a lot of heavy metal anthems, there’s nothing mystical about it. Instead, it’s a straightforward account, almost journalistic in its brevity, of how Deep Purple recorded their finest album, Machine Head, in Montreux.Formed in 1968 in Hertford, Deep Purple enjoyed some success with their first two albums, but it was when founder members Ritchie Blackmore, Jon Lord and Ian Paice brought in Ian Gillan and Roger Glover that the band took off. Their Concerto for Group and Orchestra (recorded with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra at the Royal Albert Hall) attracted heaps of publicity, and their fourth LP, Deep Purple in Rock (with its iconic Mount Rushmore cover, featuring the anthemic “Child in Time”) made their name.Cale and Nick Cave (Emilien Itim)Yet for Deep Purple, like so many bands before and since, this breakthrough album brought a different set of problems. Recording sessions for their fifth album, Fireball, had to be fitted in around a busy schedule of live dates, from the autumn of 1970 until the summer of 1971. The album wasn’t as successful as its predecessor, and was widely regarded as a sideways step.Consequently, the band resolved to record their sixth album without any interruptions or distractions. Montreux Casino would be empty for three weeks that winter, and Nobs had offered them the use of it. All the recording equipment they needed they could take with them, in a mobile recording studio (borrowed from The Rolling Stones).With Swiss punctuality, Deep Purple arrived in Montreux, ready to start recording. Frank Zappa and his band, The Mothers of Invention, were playing the Casino that afternoon, and then the venue would be theirs. It couldn’t have been any simpler. What could possibly go wrong?Great music documentaries to watch nowGlastonbury is taking a fallow year but if you’re still craving your Pilton fix, look no further.

Part two takes a closer look at the Seventies - from Zandra Rhodes’ Queen costumes to the DIY punk explosion.Ian Gillan went to see the show with his girlfriend. He saw a man in the crowd behind him wielding a couple of roman candles. Gillan wasn’t too perturbed – compared to most fireworks, roman candles are usually fairly harmless – but then the bloke chucked them into the air, and they lodged in the rafters. In no time at all, the building was ablaze. “There’s a fire, please stay calm and make your way out,”\u0026nbspannounced Zappa from the stage.The band retreated to their hotel, and watched the fire from the bar. At first, it looked like the blaze might spread to the surrounding buildings, and set the entire town alight, but thankfully the wind blew the flames towards the lake, sending smoke billowing out across the water. It was like a special effects scene from a movie. They sat up late, watching the Casino burn to the ground.The title came to Glover the next morning, as he woke up in his hotel bedroom, but the other band members laughed it down – they said it sounded too druggy. But then Blackmore came up with a riff, that riff, on the spur of the moment, and they had the beginnings of a song.However, right now, their most pressing problem was finding somewhere – anywhere – to record. Mercifully, no one had been hurt, but the Casino was a smoking ruin. Nobs found a vacant theatre called The Pavillon, which seemed fine, but the sound-proofing was useless. They’d just started playing “Smoke on the Water” when the police arrived to shut them down. Luckily, the roadies kept them out, as the policemen hammered on the doors.There was only one thing wrong. There wasn’t quite enough material. They’d recorded six classic tracks, including “Lazy”, “Highway Star”, “Pictures of Home” and “Space Truckin’”, but it still came up a bit short for a full LP. Then they remembered the demo they’d recorded at The Pavillon, just before the Swiss police threw them out. And so belatedly, “Smoke on the Water” ended up on the LP, almost by accident. Today, it’s not only the most celebrated song on the album, but the most celebrated song they’ve ever played.Léon Francioli played Montreux in 1971 (Claude Nobs Archives)Yet even after it scraped onto the LP, “Smoke on the Water” still took a while to become a classic. The main single from the album was “Never Before”, which only reached number 35 in the UK singles chart and never became a live staple. Only in 1973, when “Smoke on the Water” was released as a single in the US and started getting airplay on American radio stations, did it finally begin to break through.But although “Smoke on the Water” has now acquired legendary stand-alone status, it still sits best amid the album for which it was intended, as track five (if you’re listening to it on a CD or some other rubbish modern format) or – far better – as the first track on side two, if you’re listening to the proper vinyl LP. It tells the story of the album, and that’s where it ought to stay.Deep purple: There are hellebores- and then there are Rodney Davey’sDeep Purple looks ready to rock old star DenmanDeep Purple made some fine LPs before and some fine LPs thereafter, but they never made anything quite as good as Machine Head. So what made it click? The tight timeframe was one factor – adversity was another. Far from home in the dead of winter, in a quiet resort in low season, there was an element of “all hands to the pump”\u0026nbspas everyone mucked in together.This no-nonsense attitude was reflected in the production. Sound engineer Martin Birch did a brilliant job. The sound he created was clean and sparse, never overly ornate or fussy. He gave each instrument room to breathe. There was very little overdubbing. It was such a palaver getting out of the hotel and into the mobile studio that they often didn’t bother listening to the playback. By modern standards, this was virtually a live album.Nobs died in 2013, after a skiing accident, aged 76. The Jazz Festival is his enduring testament (he also gets a shout-out as “Funky Claude”\u0026nbspin “Smoke on the Water”). The Casino was rebuilt on the same spot, but sadly they didn’t recreate the Belle Époque splendour of the original structure. The modern replacement is a Seventies eyesore. Just think: if it hadn’t been for that idiot with the roman candles, that beautiful building would still be there. But, then again, we’d have never heard “Smoke on the Water”.Montreux Jazz Festival runs\u0026nbspuntil 14 July and Deep Purple play on 4 July (mjf.ch)Smoke on the waterEnter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

She is having a conversation they’re gorgeous, often very funny and sarcastic.”\u0026nbspIt never hurts if you can make ’em smile. Swift does it for her fans in the same way that a cutting rhyme from rapper Chuck D does it for me. Hey, whatever floats your boat.\u0026nbspFrom beef to BFFs to beef again: Kanye West and Taylor SwiftNEW YORK - SEPTEMBER 13:   Kanye West (L) jumps onstage after Taylor Swift (C) won the Best Female Video award during the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards at Radio City Music Hall on September 13, 2009 in New York City.

Right now, it’s them against us. This shit is ugly to the core. When it comes to the poor, no lives matter!” Now that’s the sort of the conversation I want to have.\u0026nbspFeeling suitably purged and, yes, a little self-righteous, I felt able to spend an afternoon in the company of Taylor. But after the first half hour I almost felt like saying “look what you made me do”\u0026nbspto Rheya. And my editors, because I didn’t find listening to her latest missive any easier than her fans might find sampling Slayer.\u0026nbspIt’s not that I can’t recognise a good pop song. Everyone has their guilty pleasures. But reputation’s hooks seemed swamped in a sea of expensive production. Here a backing singer trills, there a rapper rhymes, as the vocals tail off into electronic distortion. Meanwhile\u0026nbspSwift reflects on the trials and tribulations not so much of being a teenager, but of being an uber-famous member of the 1 per cent, a bona fide mega star, with the requisite stable of hip hop style feuds.\u0026nbsp1989, her first “official”\u0026nbsppop record, I found more approachable, and memorable. I confess, I already had some familiarity with that album on account of indie troubadour Ryan Adams covering the whole thing. He somehow managed to put a wistful and melancholy sheen on an upbeat and feisty pop record, widely recognised as the highpoint of her career to date. Moving further back, Nashville becomes progressively more noticeable, and Swift’s stories more innocent and easier to hear.\u0026nbspBut what about the show designed to showcase it all? If not the hottest ticket in town, it was certainly the priciest, part of an effort, it has been argued, to neutralise the scalpers who would have profited handsomely through gouging fans had Swift left money on the table.\u0026nbspI have to admit: a part of me was intrigued. I’ve been going to gigs for more than 30 years now (it makes me shudder to have to say that) and I’ve seen almost everything. Metal, indie, jazz, rap, soul, punk and more besides. I’ve been to decaying fleapit clubs, massive arenas, festivals and, yes, even great big stadia.\u0026nbspBut what I’d never experienced before my evening with Swift was one those bona fide pop mega tours the sort of thing featuring a cast of thousands, that takes several planes, and a fleet of trucks to move the thing from to venue to venue, and turns over the GDP of a small country.It was a world apart from the stadium shows I’ve previously been to. The Stone Roses, for example, needed only their songs, together with the odd inflatable ball bouncing up and down in the crowd, to make for a thoroughly memorable occasion last summer, one worth the price of tickets that weren’t exactly cheap themselves.\u0026nbspA Swift show, by contrast, majors as much on spectacle as it does on music. There were, at Wembley, enough huge snakes to send an ophidiophobic fan running for a\u0026nbsptherapist. Apparently their presence stems from an insult the Kardashian married to Kanye West lobbed at her, and they’ve since become something of a trademark. One’s probably pending.\u0026nbspThere was fire, and fireworks, and films. There was the obligatory army of dancers. Everyone was given a light bracelet on their way in, which seemed to change colours at the command of someone armed with an iPad backstage. The effect was actually rather pretty, if not exactly environmentally friendly.\u0026nbspThere was even a sort of floating cage of lights to ferry Swift between the three (count ’em) stages and, at the end, a bloke whom I’m reliably informed was once in One Direction, came on to perform a duet. Neither me nor my daughter were quite sure who he was, although his presence seemed to delight the crowd. \u0026nbspAs for Swift herself? Well, I’ll give her this. She is a star. The moment she strode on to the stage in a pair of sparkly hot pants, the first of about 300 different costumes, you could see that. The audience was in raptures.\u0026nbsp“Thank you for joining us on the reputation stadium tour,” she said. It was a line she repeated several times. I could almost hear the business manager whispering in her ear: “Don’t say anything that could be considered controversial, but make sure you reference the brand at least once every 15 minutes or so. It’s good for T-shirt sales.”In the middle of this assault on the senses I was again left wondering whether Swift isn’t in danger of losing that connection she has forged. But then, about halfway through, with her occupying stage number two, she produced an acoustic guitar and just sang. She did the same with a piano later on. It worked too. Whatever Swift is, she is no manufactured talent, incapable of surviving without studio trickery, and solely reliant on others to play the instruments. It made me wonder if all the extra stuff was really necessary.\u0026nbspThe reputation\u0026nbspalbum may not have done the business 1989 did, and Swift may have strained her connection with some, but her still loyal fans lapped up everything she did.\u0026nbspCrucially, so did my daughter. All my criticisms started to pale before her sheer unabashed joy. It would have made any parent melt, and the zone of protection I thought I’d established by wearing my Metallica tour T-shirt, with a suitably gruesome design, was breached. In a world that seems to grow grimmer by the day, I couldn’t help but be uplifted at my child’s innocent delight. I even found myself enjoying myself, if vicariously.\u0026nbspAttwood says part of Swift’s appeal, as a parent, is that “among all the hyper sexualised pop stars she is a fantastic role model for my daughter”.\u0026nbspTaylor Swift brings Robbie Williams on stage to sing ‘Angels’ Taylor Swift launches UK ‘reputation’ tour in ManchesterTaylor Swift marks Pride Month with heartfelt speech in ChicagoIs Taylor Swift off-loading her Beverly Hills property portfolio?And I get that. Even though with all that branding it sometimes seems as if she’s as much CEO as she is musician, she is, to quote Janet Jackson, in control.I don’t think Taylor will be troubling my speakers in future, but this Metallica Dad was able to make an accommodation with her.There is a postscript that may amuse you. Since getting one of those Amazon Echo Dots, my chip-off-the-old-block son has been constantly playing what he tells me are Geometry Dash composers. They play electronic video game music that leaves me cold.My daughter, meanwhile, has developed an obsession with Metallica’s Master of Puppets, to the extent that sometimes she’s even had me saying “can’t we have something else on?”.\u0026nbspIt means I might have to enjoy our next live experience vicariously. Next time they tour she’s made it clear she doesn’t want to be left out.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

but what is the difference between a soft and hard Brexit?As six senior Conservatives argued for closer links between Britain and the EU they also said Labour and other parties should have a say in the final deal.The Tory manifesto vowed to withdraw Britain from the single market and the customs union, so that we can end free immigration and quit the EU court.But Labour has not signed up to that approach, raising the prospect that cross-party talks could lead to a softer form of Brexit which might anger many Leave voters.A soft Brexit would see the UK have a similar membership of the European Economic Area to that of Norway.This would mean the country would still have access to the single market, while being able to make deals without the rest of the EU.It would also see the UK stay within the EU customs union - meaning exports would not be subject to border checks or tariffs.And a softer Brexit could see the UK making payments into EU budgets and accepting the four freedoms of movement of goods, services, capital and people.Free access for European nationals to work and settle in the UK would also continue.A hard Brexit would take Britain out of Europes single market.It could also see Britain leave the trade agreement completely, allowing us to strike up deals with other nations around the globe.Anti-EU voices insist a hard Brexit must be met to satisfy the wishes of the Brexit referendum vote.That would mean Britain severs all formal free trade ties with the continent, leaving it free to negotiate new trade links with countries including the USA, China, India and Commonwealth states.Mrs May had also said no deal would be better than a bad deal, when planning to carve out a hard Brexit.After a marathon session of talks at Chequers on July 6, Theresa May managed to secure a Brexit plan which will be assessed by the EU.Her Brexit plan will see the UK remains closely tied to the Brussels.Scottish Tories leader Ruth Davidson – one of the party’s biggest stars after swiping 12 seats from the SNP – led the charge against a hard Brexit as she spoke alongside her MPs in the days following the election.She said: “I want to ensure that we can look again at issues like Brexit which we know we are now going to have to get cross-party support for.Former minister Anna Soubry, who is fiercely pro-EU, insisted the PM must “absolutely” water down her Brexit plans.Nicky Morgan said the Government must “build a consensus across the Commons” – and said the PM should “compromise” on the Brexit plans she has already laid out.And former leader and PM David Cameron made a rare intervention, telling a business conference in Poland: I think there will be pressure for a softer Brexit.Mrs May has already offered EU citizens in the UK the right to remain in the country in exchange for a similar guarantee for Brits in Europe.Theresa May - wants a two-year transition deal before we fully leave the EU, says Brexit means BrexitPhilip Hammond - the key voice for a soft Brexit, wants to stick closely to EU rules, even after any transition periodAmber Rudd - has backed May and wants close alignment with the EUBoris Johnson - a key figure in the pro-Brexit campaign. He wants Britain to have freedom to decide its own regulations and laws, in order to do things in a distinctive way in the future.David Davis - a Brexit supporter who wants the UK to move away from EU regulations after the exit, but is said to favour a more pragmatic path than some of his fellow Leave-supporting ministers.Jeremy Hunt - initially a remain supporter but now says he has changed his mind and would vote Leave if given the choice again, blaming the European Commissions arrogant behaviour for his switch in attitude.Michael Gove - another key Brexit campaigner and wants to break from EU rules.Leader Jeremy Corbyn set out the partys position on Brexit in a key speech back in February 2018.He said: Labour would seek a final deal that gives full access to European markets and maintains the benefits of the single market and the customs union... to negotiate a new comprehensive UK-EU customs union to ensure that there are no tariffs with Europe and to help avoid any need whatsoever for a hard border in Northern Ireland.Labour want to remain closely tied to the EU after Brexit.But any deal would remain dependent on the UK being able to negotiate future trade deals with countries outside the customs union.European Council President Donald Tusk has said time is running out and issued a last call.He said June 2018 the most difficult issues remained unresolved and called for quick progress to be made if an agreement was to be reached in October.Theresa Mays Cabinet is due to meet in early July at Chequers for a crunch meeting.May has said the UK will then publish a White Paper setting out in more detail what strong partnership the United Kingdom wants to see with the European Union in the future.Jean-Claude Juncker, the European Commission President, said at the EUs June summit: “We are preparing for different scenarios - on the proper withdrawal agreement but, in parallel, we are working on the non-deal.“We have to do it.”When quizzed on the Irish border, Mr Juncker said: “As far as Ireland is concerned, I was there the other week. I would like us to give a final definite response to the Irish problem, which is not an Irish problem but a problem in tern by the decision of the British.“I wouldn’t like us to be in a situation where the last remaining point would be the Irish problem.

We reveal all...According to the New Scientist, plants need a period of cold then warm weather before they can flower.But because of the long winter, plants that couldnt flower earlier in the spring are more likely to do so all at once.The term is known as a condensed spring because it is far shorter than normal.This causes more pollen to be produced - causing misery for hayfever sufferers.Tree pollen is likely to be worse, which affects one in four Brits.Sadly it does, with the Met Office issuing a warning on June 6 for high levels of pollen across Mid and South England, and all of Wales.This wave of pollen bombs is set to last for three weeks.There is a high tree pollen count, with grass and weed becoming higher later in the year.Sufferers will experience cold-like symptoms - such as itchy eyes and a runny nose - but the threat could be more serious.Half of Brits plagued by hay fever could experience deadly asthma attacks triggered by the pollen.Hay fever and asthma are closely linked, with around 80 per cent of people with asthma finding their symptoms are made worse when pollen counts are high.You can check pollen levels on the Met Office website.Sonia Munde, nurse manager at Asthma UK, said anyone who has both asthma and hay fever should ensure they are taking antihistamines and nasal steroid sprays, and ensure they take their preventer inhaler as prescribed to ward off an attack.She added: Pollen is a top trigger for asthma attacks at this time of the year, affecting an estimated 3.3million people with asthma in the UK.People with asthma who also have a pollen allergy not only experience classic hay fever symptoms such as itchy eyes and a running nose, but are also at an increased risk of a life-threatening asthma attack.Holly Shaw, nurse adviser at Allergy UK, urged people to stock up on antihistamines to help manage their symptoms.Typically the hay fever season starts in mid-March, with tree pollen blooming until May.But this year, the Beast From The East blasted the country with icy weather, delaying spring.And because winter was longer and spring came in late, more pollen is produced.Allergy expert Max Wiseberg warned: “When the tree pollen season is delayed, more trees are likely to release their pollen at the same time, creating a time bomb waiting to explode.“Peaks of tree pollen could be higher than normal.The recent cold wintry weather provided the optimum conditions for this to happen.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He added: “We are still encouraging our customers to voluntarily use water efficiently, by avoiding the use of water hungry devices, particularly outside in the garden.However, if demand does not reduce in the next few days we’ll have no choice but to introduce enforced restrictions.Any usage ban is likely to be staggered, hitting households first before commercial outlets.Other water companies are expected to announce similar plans imminently.It comes after one of the hottest and driest Junes on record — with the current heatwave which started last Monday now the longest since 1976.Average rainfall for the UK last month was just 35.4mm, less than half the normal amount, according to the Met Office.The South East and central southern areas were the worst hit with just 3mm of rain falling throughout June - six per cent of its 50mm average.Parts of the country have dried up, including sections of the River Tyne (before and now, above).The Met Office said it will continue this weekend, with highs of 91F (33C).But Andy White, from industry body Consumer Council for Water, said: “We expect United Utilities to exhaust every opportunity to avoid restrictions.”Britains record-breaking 33C heatwave hasnt just left Brits sweltering, with the roads also feeling the heat as a bin lorry sank into melted tarmac .Stunned locals in Newbury, Berks, found the stuck truck blocking a street after its wheels became lodged in the liquid tarmac in 30C heat yesterday.Weather forecaster Emma Salter said: Theres no let up in sight in terms of the dry weather and high temperatures through the week.She added: Its pretty much dry across the board and no sign of rain.Temperatures will reach a still blazing 32C today with sunshine for most sending Brits flocking to beer gardens across the country.Pub industry insiders predict an extra 8million pints will be sold on Saturday — netting landlords £24million more in revenue than a typical day.Storms had been predicted for Friday earlier in the week but Ms Salter said these were now looking very unlikely and had been removed from the forecast.Scotland might see some rain in the coming days, she said, but the rest of the country could expect it to stay dry until the middle of July.She added: From Monday or Tuesday the really high temperatures will start to gradually come down, but it will still be in the high 20s so it will be less hot rather than cooler.On Thursday there were flash floods in Kent following a sudden downpour after a long stretch of scorching weather and uninterrupted sunshine left the ground unable to absorb the deluge.The thunderstorm in Tunbridge Wells led to train and bus delays.Video posted online showed fast-moving water gushing through streets in the town after around 20 minutes of rainfall between 4pm and 5pm on Thursday, the Met Office said.And in Herefordshire dramatic photos showed the River Teme all but disappeared after evaporating in the parched conditions.Environment Agency workers desperately rushed to rescue more than 500 salmon and trout trapped in isolated pockets of water before they vanished in the heat.There are fears that continuous dry weather expected over the coming days — expected to beat the record hot spell of 1976 — could cause similar problems with the Upper River Wye also currently at a low level.The government has asked for the public to conserve more water and take no longer than four minutes in the shower.A hosepipe ban has also been enforced in Northern Ireland amid record temperatures, with Belfast recording 29.5C this week.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

A total, humiliating capitulation.”But Europhile business groups hailed the PMs plans as a genuine confidence boost.The pro-Brussels Confederation of British Industry said it was proof the Government was listening to warnings from big firms.Vote Leave chief and Environment Secretary Michael Gove played a key role in winning the peace for the PM by siding with her in order to isolate the hardline Brexiteers.A plan may have been cooked up but it still needs to get past the EU — and the continent’s leaders are showing no sign of compromise.Angela Merkel is already rubbishing our proposal.The Napoleonic Emmanuel Macron thinks he’s a political messiah, and he’d rather see us punished than give up on his federalist promised land.And Michel Barnier’s dangled “concessions” amount to a demand for total UK capitulation.With that level of zeal and stubbornness, it’s no wonder we voted in our millions to leave.We must now go to Brussels with an offer that guarantees control of our borders and sign our own trade deals.But we mustn’t for a second think that they’ll just say yes to it, nor can the PM let them fatally weaken it.It is galling that ministers have spent more time fighting between themselves than preparing for a “no deal” exit.But it isn’t too late.New technology can ensure that Whitehall and our borders are ready for a clean break, which considering the strength of our economy and our companies is nothing to be scared of.The PM has dumped many of her earlier Brexit slogans. But she should remember one in particular now.No deal really is better than a bad deal, and we must still prepare for it.Mrs May will now publish a White Paper and address MPs on Monday - setting up a long summer of negotiations with Brussels on the offer.The PM said she was hopeful of the details being well received by EU leaders, adding: “Now we want to get on at pace, negotiate this with the EU and bring prosperity and security to people.”Despite bitter divisions within her top team, Mrs May was able to convince a majority of her 29 ministers around to the climbdown plan during four hours of debate in the her sweltering 16th county mansion in Buckinghamshire.Sources claimed that Environment Secretary Michael Gove, Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson and Home Secretary Sajid Javid were instrumental in backing the PM’s plan to tip the balance in favour of the PM and leaving the Brexiteers like Boris Johnson and David Davis isolated.Another source said the talks went on for “four hours” with lunch and dinner served in the grand house, insisting: “There was plenty of good humour and it was low on tension”.But another insider added there were “obviously fraught moments”.As news of the deal filtered across Whitehall insiders expressed their shock at “the scale of the climbdown”, expressing surprise that no Brexit minister had quit over the deal.SALADSWheat, beetroot, squash

details of the terms of the deal hours before critical ministers at the summit were given back their mobile phones.And MPs cautioned that the fact Brussels Brexit boss Michel Barnier was “welcoming this White Paper as just a start” meant they were already publicly expecting the UK to slide further towards the EU.Earlier in the day Mr Barnier had opened the EU’s door to compromises by repeatedly refusing to criticise the PM.He said: “I have real respect for Theresa May and I know that her duty, her daily work is not so easy.”But a document setting out Britain’s plan for a future relationship with Brussels set out plans for a “mobility framework” that would allow UK and EU citizens “to travel to each other’s territories and apply for study and work”.The document added this would be “similar to what the UK may offer other close trading partners in the future.”Home Secrertary Sajid Javid is only expected to set out Britain’s post Brexit immigration plans AFTER a provision deal with the EU is agreed this October.During a conciliatory speech at the Irish embassy in Brussels, the Frenchman also called on both sides to “de-dramatise” the Northern Irish border issue.And he hinted that the EU is waiting to kickstart the negotiations on renewed terms if Mrs May softens her red lines.But one MP said: “I need to see the detail but I’m extremely wary.“It sounds to me like we’re going to be rule taker rather than the a rule maker.“It’s feels we are danger of total capitulation to Brussels.”And Brexiteer critics were giving an unlikely boost from arch-remainer Sir Nick Clegg who said they were right to reject Mrs May’s third way custom fudge that would lead to “vast red tape” while “smugglers would boom” and “Parliament left humiliated” as a simple rubber stamper.Tempers had already reached boiling point in the run up to the summit after Downing Street publicly warned one in Government who quit could watch her soft-Brexit march continue from the sidelines.No10 insiders revealed emergency reshuffle plans were already in place incase of Ministerial walkouts from her crunch Brexit summit.The day was broken into three sections with the first seeing Brexit guru Olly Robbins brief ministers on the “Available Outcomes in Light of the EU’s Current Position”.But the testy exchanges were seen in the afternoon’s session titled The UK’s Proposed Approach”.Before the ministers had even sat down around the table Downing Street infuriated them by warning that they would have to get a taxi home as they would be stripped of their limos immediately if they walked out in protest.A senior Government source said: “Taxi cards for Aston’s taxis the local cab firm are in the foyer for those who decide they can’t face making the right decision for the country but it will still be a long walk as it is a mile long driveway.The official raged: “A select number of narcissistic, leadership dominated cabinet ministers need to support the PM in the best interests of the UK or their spots will be taken by a talented new generation of MPs who will sweep them away.”And The Sun revealed that the whips had summoned dozens of junior ministers for a series of meetings to sound them out over the PM’s plans as possible future cabinet replacements in the case of a mass walkout.Housing minister Dominic Raab, Crime minister Victoria Atkins and Local Government minister Kit Malthouse were touted as possible replacements.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They are on an isolation ward with police and security on guard around the clock.“The doctor said that although they are not yet getting any better, they’re not getting worse either.“They’re being kept alive by their ventilators.”GOT a story?

Signalling that the UK might stay in a Customs Union was another enormous error.Downing Street has consistently left unchallenged the scare tactics of professional Remainers — big businesses seeking ongoing EU protection, Brussels-funded think tanks and member states wanting UK cash.The Irish land border, for instance, already copes with different currencies, duties and other tax rates.Outside the Customs Union there is no need for physical hard border posts that might inflame sectarian sensitivities — as confirmed by the head of HMRC, his Irish equivalent and a study published by the European Parliament.Instead of explaining these realities, and arguing Britain’s corner, Mrs May has allowed Irish border falsehoods to warp her entire Brexit strategy.Roberto Azevedo insisted trading with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules was “perfectly manageable”.She has similarly failed to counter claims it would be disastrous to leave the EU with no free trade agreement, using World Trade Organisation rules instead.Again, this is nonsense. Britain already conducts most of its trade outside the EU, largely under WTO rules.“It is not the end of the world if UK-EU trade is on the basis of WTO rules”, WTO director general Roberto Azevedo told me. “It’s ­perfectly manageable.”That’s a vital insight because, unless no deal is seen as a viable option, the UK’s negotiating hand is seriously undermined — with Britain then forced to accept whatever trade deal the EU offers as March 2019 nears.The Government should have been making determined and very visible preparations for no deal.The irony is that, behind the scenes, there has been considerable work.Last week the National Audit Office concluded that an HMRC upgrade that was happening anyway means ­Britain’s customs service should be ready to cope with no deal from January 2019.Instead of pursuing such rational strategies, Mrs May now wants the UK, in effect, to stay in the Single Market for goods, while facing greater restrictions on trade in services.This is totally lopsided — Britain is far better at exporting services (we run a £14billion annual surplus with the EU) than goods (which show a £96billion EU deficit).And proposals to solve the Irish border by tracking goods and collecting the EU’s tariff revenues have already been rejected by Brussels.Mrs May should just leave the Single Market and the Customs Union, with no deal if necessary.By presenting absurd ideas, our Mad Hatter Prime Minister appears to hope her people will conclude Brexit is too hard and should be abandoned.If so, she doesn’t understand the country she purports to govern.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Youre partying with them! But when we come, its an issue.”Following an internal investigation, the Trilogy Real Estate Group confirmed that they felt Walker had acted inappropriately and had fired her.In a statement, the company said: “After assessing statements from Ms. Porter and determining that this former employees actions violate our companys policies \u0026amp beliefs, she is no longer employed by Riverset Apartments.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT000418577086.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"jacob rees mogg brexit theresa may chequers summit","story":"The influential backbencher said the EU could still hamper our ability to strike trade deals with the rest of the world — likening the Governments position to an egg that is very softly boiled.“A very soft Brexit means that we haven’t left, we are simply a rule-taker, he told the Today programme on BBC Radio 4.“That is not something that this country voted for, it is not what the Prime Minister promised.He also threatened he would instruct his 60-strong group of Brexit-backing MPs to vote down the proposals.Mr Rees-Mogg said: “This will require legislation and if, when we get the detailed legislation, it turns out that it is a punishment Brexit, that it is keeping us in the European Union in all but name, I will stick to the Conservative Party’s manifesto commitments and will not vote for it.”His comments come after Theresa May claimed a crushing victory over her Brexiteer ministers as she forced her Cabinet to back her vision of a soft Brexit during a crunch summit at her Chequers country retreat.After a marathon all day summit yesterday, the Prime Minister hailed a “collective agreement” for a controversial 12 point plan that will tie Britain to Brussels rules for goods and mirror EU judges diktats.A proposed new “UK-EU Free Trade Area” will see a “combined customs territory” set up in a bid to solve the Northern Irish border headache.Under these plans Britain will be forced to collect tariffs on goods on behalf of Brussels - despite firm objections to this from David Davis and Boris Johnson.But there were no immediate walk outs from the government despite criticism from the Leave supporting ministers - to the relief of Downing Street.However one senior Brexiteer said: “This looks to me as though we have reneged on the Referendum.”And critics warned the agreement was a “recipe for total capitulation to Brussels” after a tentative welcoming of the new deal from EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier.Pro-Brexit groups were scathing of the PMs Brexit blueprint.In a withering assessment Leave Means Leave boss John Longworth said the PM had totally misled 17.4million voters and branded her plans a fake Brexit.He added: We will be controlling neither laws, nor trade, nor borders. A total, humiliating capitulation.”But Europhile business groups hailed the PMs plans as a genuine confidence boost.The pro-Brussels Confederation of British Industry said it was proof the Government was listening to warnings from big firms.Vote Leave chief and Environment Secretary Michael Gove played a key role in winning the peace for the PM by siding with her in order to isolate the hardline Brexiteers.A plan may have been cooked up but it still needs to get past the EU — and the continent’s leaders are showing no sign of compromise.Angela Merkel is already rubbishing our proposal.The Napoleonic Emmanuel Macron thinks he’s a political messiah, and he’d rather see us punished than give up on his federalist promised land.And Michel Barnier’s dangled “concessions” amount to a demand for total UK capitulation.With that level of zeal and stubbornness, it’s no wonder we voted in our millions to leave.We must now go to Brussels with an offer that guarantees control of our borders and sign our own trade deals.But we mustn’t for a second think that they’ll just say yes to it, nor can the PM let them fatally weaken it.It is galling that ministers have spent more time fighting between themselves than preparing for a “no deal” exit.But it isn’t too late.New technology can ensure that Whitehall and our borders are ready for a clean break, which considering the strength of our economy and our companies is nothing to be scared of.The PM has dumped many of her earlier Brexit slogans. But she should remember one in particular now.No deal really is better than a bad deal, and we must still prepare for it.Mrs May will now publish a White Paper and address MPs on Monday - setting up a long summer of negotiations with Brussels on the offer.The PM said she was hopeful of the details being well received by EU leaders, adding: “Now we want to get on at pace, negotiate this with the EU and bring prosperity and security to people.”Despite bitter divisions within her top team, Mrs May was able to convince a majority of her 29 ministers around to the climbdown plan during four hours of debate in the her sweltering 16th county mansion in Buckinghamshire.Sources claimed that Environment Secretary Michael Gove, Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson and Home Secretary Sajid Javid were instrumental in backing the PM’s plan to tip the balance in favour of the PM and leaving the Brexiteers like Boris Johnson and David Davis isolated.Another source said the talks went on for “four hours” with lunch and dinner served in the grand house, insisting: “There was plenty of good humour and it was low on tension”.But another insider added there were “obviously fraught moments”.As news of the deal filtered across Whitehall insiders expressed their shock at “the scale of the climbdown”, expressing surprise that no Brexit minister had quit over the deal.SALADSWheat, beetroot, squash

details of the terms of the deal hours before critical ministers at the summit were given back their mobile phones.And MPs cautioned that the fact Brussels Brexit boss Michel Barnier was “welcoming this White Paper as just a start” meant they were already publicly expecting the UK to slide further towards the EU.Earlier in the day Mr Barnier had opened the EU’s door to compromises by repeatedly refusing to criticise the PM.He said: “I have real respect for Theresa May and I know that her duty, her daily work is not so easy.”But a document setting out Britain’s plan for a future relationship with Brussels set out plans for a “mobility framework” that would allow UK and EU citizens “to travel to each other’s territories and apply for study and work”.The document added this would be “similar to what the UK may offer other close trading partners in the future.”Home Secrertary Sajid Javid is only expected to set out Britain’s post Brexit immigration plans AFTER a provision deal with the EU is agreed this October.During a conciliatory speech at the Irish embassy in Brussels, the Frenchman also called on both sides to “de-dramatise” the Northern Irish border issue.And he hinted that the EU is waiting to kickstart the negotiations on renewed terms if Mrs May softens her red lines.But one MP said: “I need to see the detail but I’m extremely wary.“It sounds to me like we’re going to be rule taker rather than the a rule maker.“It’s feels we are danger of total capitulation to Brussels.”And Brexiteer critics were giving an unlikely boost from arch-remainer Sir Nick Clegg who said they were right to reject Mrs May’s third way custom fudge that would lead to “vast red tape” while “smugglers would boom” and “Parliament left humiliated” as a simple rubber stamper.Tempers had already reached boiling point in the run up to the summit after Downing Street publicly warned one in Government who quit could watch her soft-Brexit march continue from the sidelines.No10 insiders revealed emergency reshuffle plans were already in place incase of Ministerial walkouts from her crunch Brexit summit.The day was broken into three sections with the first seeing Brexit guru Olly Robbins brief ministers on the “Available Outcomes in Light of the EU’s Current Position”.But the testy exchanges were seen in the afternoon’s session titled The UK’s Proposed Approach”.Before the ministers had even sat down around the table Downing Street infuriated them by warning that they would have to get a taxi home as they would be stripped of their limos immediately if they walked out in protest.A senior Government source said: “Taxi cards for Aston’s taxis the local cab firm are in the foyer for those who decide they can’t face making the right decision for the country but it will still be a long walk as it is a mile long driveway.The official raged: “A select number of narcissistic, leadership dominated cabinet ministers need to support the PM in the best interests of the UK or their spots will be taken by a talented new generation of MPs who will sweep them away.”And The Sun revealed that the whips had summoned dozens of junior ministers for a series of meetings to sound them out over the PM’s plans as possible future cabinet replacements in the case of a mass walkout.Housing minister Dominic Raab, Crime minister Victoria Atkins and Local Government minister Kit Malthouse were touted as possible replacements.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Any minister freelancing with long personal manifestos or private recorded statements will be fired.Other delighted cabinet ministers included Business Secretary Greg Clark, defender of Airbus and Jaguar Land Rover, who said it was a \"very positive conclusion\" which meant \"zero friction\" for trade between UK and EU countries and Justice Secretary David Gauke, who praised the \"positive support from cabinet for Theresa May and her Brexit plan\".Not much from the Brexiteers just yet.:: \u0027Sell out\u0027 free trade area plans torn apart by BrexiteersThe statement of agreement was emailed to the press as dinner began, without cabinet ministers having contact with their advisers, giving two hours for newspapers to conjure \"PM wrestles Brexit triumph\" style headlines, on a day when most of the country will want to return to the World Cup, rather than squabbling political parties.The European Union will not accept this plan, and that much has been made clear.But that was easy for them while there was no plan and no unified position even to have to consider.Now there is something for them to bite into. A conversation to be started. Their initial response to actually having a negotiation partner was warmish. But they were careful not to sound too dismissive about the wider attempt to enjoy existing economic terms with the single market where the UK feels it is in its interest, without the payments or adherence to freedom of movement.The most significant piece of the agreement is that the government has changed its position on what it wants from ongoing trade with the European Union.No longer is it \"as frictionless as possible\", which was always fairly meaningless but actually \"frictionless\".The PM has been persuaded by the arguments of business, the car industry and Airbus in particular, that any border checks would fundamentally imperil the business strategies that have led them to thrive in the UK and in particular their supply chains.The answer is a \"free trade area for goods\" with a common rule book which is in essence participation in a goods customs union and single market, with some eventual flexibility to conduct independent trade externally, when tariff tracking technology is developed.:: Behind the scenes of crunch Brexit talksIt is not membership of these structures however.The UK becomes rule-taker of the EU interpretation of these rules for globalised industries.The theory, however, is that the UK will have had strong influence in the setting of the global standards in the first place, so not a total rule-taker.It is a position that envisages the development in coming decades of global standards in advanced manufacturing and trade. The inclusion of agriculture in this system is to keep borders open both in Northern Ireland and at Dover, Holyhead and the Channel Tunnel.The gravitational pull on any future government not to change tariffs will be strong, but the UK parliament will have the power to change them.Britain will have taken back some control, but in other senses (directly influencing the EU rules) have lost it.Brexiteer backbenchers were restrained immediately, but anger is brewing. \"As bad as I feared,\" said one.A despondent Brexiteer MP said he was \"deeply disappointed, this is associate membership of the EU, we haven\u0027t worked so hard all these years for this\".One very pro-Brexit junior minister told me: \"If this was the final deal, then I could probably live with it as a necessary compromise. But EU will never accept it (cherry picking, four freedoms indivisible etc), so what happens next?\" Indeed why you would choose to lay out such tough red lines if you thought things might end up here is a bit of a mystery.How Brexiteer cabinet ministers have signed up to this having argued so publicly for \"a clean Brexit\" is another.\"I can\u0027t see how they can accept this and not look a laughing stock,\" one former senior minister said.It is early days yet. One ministerial aide suggested the analogy of a budget that unravels after a time delay of two days, would be the correct analogy.The most evident possible method for that is the section on a \"labour mobility partnership\" which suggests maintaining mutual freedom to move and then apply for study and jobs [presumably not benefits] between UK and EU. This will help lubricate any single market deal. It will also inflame internal political opposition.There is also a section on \"no deal\" preparations, meant as a stick for the EU and a carrot for Brexiteers.If the PM cannot stomach a Canada-style trade deal because of the negative impact on advanced manufacturers, it seems that \"no deal\" is inconceivable.So we are left in an extraordinary position.The hard Brexiteers need the EU to reject this out of hand now.The EU will have noted the shift in Government position, the actual adoption of one, and see a landing point at least for many years that is close to the European Economic Area (EEA) plus customs union solution they anticipate and prefer.We are probably three quarters of the way there already.Do they split the difference and pay lip service to a magical Europe-wide tariff refund IT system in a few years? Or do they undo the PM\u0027s impressive manoeuvres with outright rejection?The devil will be in the detail, to be released in the white paper."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/07/2048x1152/skynews-thailand-cave-boys_4351503.jpg?20180703153714 ","title":"elon musk ramps up efforts to help save boys trapped in thailand cave","story":"\"Also building an inflatable tube with airlocks.\"Less likely to work, given tricky contours, but great if it does.\":: \u0027Take me for grilled pork\u0027: Notes written by boys trapped in cave in fullMusk\u0027s company, Boring Co, which digs tunnels for transport systems and has advanced ground-penetrating radar, is being utilised to help rescue the team. \"Will do my best to help the team,\" he tweeted, before adding: \"The team will dig deep and will help at the best of ability.\"Among his tweets about the rescue, he also said: \"But let\u0027s not submit to the bad mood entirely.

Visitors must leave by 25 July. To order one you must hold a match ticket, even if you don\u0027t actually intend on attending the game.The UK Foreign Office told Sky News that the process of applying for a Fan ID once a match ticket has been purchased is quick and an electronic version is suitable to travel on.

It is around half that by car - on a good day.If you\u0027re travelling from London, the latest you could leave is probably the 10.40am departure from Heathrow, which arrives in Moscow at 4.25pm.

The English flag has become associated with the national front, the EDL and other far right groups– it frustrates me. It frustrates me because we have allowed this to happen.  Collectively, we hesitate to fly the English flag with pride during major sporting events because we are worried about the connotations behind the way it has been hijacked. When our sporting men and women represent us across the world, we should all be able to fly the flag with pride. No more should this be the case than right now, especially given the fantastic chance England have. I am proud to be born and raised in England and enjoy supporting my national team, England. With millions of other fans across the country, I am not alone.  I want the England flag to be associated with English sporting successes and I don\u0027t want us to hesitate flying it. It should be associated with Freddie Flintoff and the team winning the ashes, Bobby Moore lifting the World Cup, with Anthony Joshua beating Wilder – not far-right extremists fighting police down Whitehall.

The panicking Prime Minister had feared mass resignations and was even drawing up an emergency reshuffle. But despite weeks of threats to quit, Brexiteer Tories appeared to bottle it at a 12-hour Chequers showdown - which had been dubbed The Body Bag Summit. Mrs May announced a big shift to a \u0027softer\u0027 Brexit after treating ministers to whisky-cured salmon and whisky barrel chips at her country retreat. But within minutes of the announcement tonight, The Times reported that Mrs May told senior allies she would sack Boris Johnson if he seeks to undermine the Brexit negotiating position agreed by her cabinet.  Brexiteers Boris, Michael Gove and David Davis had previously hinted they were ready to walk. They were even warned they\u0027d have to swap their ministerial cars for a local taxi for the 40-mile trip back to London if they quit. But tonight - while they were still at Chequers, without their phones - Mrs May announced her Cabinet had agreed a collective position for future UK negotiations with Brussels.   Speaking after the meeting, the EU\u0027s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier said the Chequers plan would be assessed to see if it is workable and realistic. A round of UK-EU negotiations will take place in the week beginning July 16, he added.  The new plan explained - and why the EU could still reject it The vulnerable PM broke the deadlock by coming up with a peace offering for both the Remain and Leave camps. In a bid to solve the Northern Ireland issue, she now wants to keep the UK closely aligned with the EU in a new free trade area for goods. This will include sharing a common rulebook for all goods including agricultural and food products - which critics had feared would make it harder to get a US trade deal. The PM claimed this will help the UK avoid friction in trade - protecting jobs and businesses. But in a desperate bid to prevent Brexiteers resigning, she also said Parliament would keep the right to block future changes to the trading rules. The olive branch to the Brexiteers means Mrs May remains vulnerable - because there is no guarantee the EU will accept her new plan. In a sign of nerves across government, the Cabinet also agreed to step up backup plans for a No Deal Brexit.  More details of the plan The deal also proposes a common rulebook with the EU on state aid rules, which left-wing critics - including Jeremy Corbyn - say prevent the government intervening to help crisis-hit industry. On the other hand, Tory Brexiteers could be angry at how courts will intervene in disputes. UK courts, not the European Court of Justice, would rule on disputes in the UK - but would have to pay due regard to EU case law in areas with a common rulebook.  What happens next The Prime Minister now plans to publish a more detailed White Paper next week as she mounts a tour of EU capitals - to persuade leaders to accept it. Speaking tonight after a marathon day of talks at the 16th-century manor house, Mrs May said: Today in detailed discussions the Cabinet has agreed our collective position for the future of our negotiations with the EU. Our proposal will create a UK - EU free trade area which establishes a common rule book for industrial goods and agricultural products. This maintains high standards in these areas, but we will also ensure that no new changes in the future take place without the approval of our Parliament. She claimed this would meet our commitments in Northern Ireland. The PM added: Next week we will be publishing a white paper which will set out more details of how we will be taking back control of our money, laws and borders. Now we must all move at pace to negotiate our proposal with the EU to deliver the prosperous and secure future all our people deserve.

Matthew Wilcox and Amy Roberts lived in Llanrug in North Wales until February, but lost their home when their landlord put it up for sale and were housed in Caernarfon.  Their baby Lili, who was born in April and has Down\u0027s Syndrome, needs to have open heart surgery, and the couple have asked to be moved back to Llanrug so they can be close to the relatives they rely on.  Despite support from doctors, the Down\u0027s Syndrome Association and the school of their older daughter, Gwynedd Council has refused to move them out of Caernarfon.   In a letter to the couple, housing chiefs said by the time another property becomes available in Llanrug, their daughter will have had her heart surgery (and will) hopefully be less likely to need emergency intervention.  Matthew told the Daily Post the council\u0027s suggestion that Amy, a lab worker who suffers from anxiety, should travel four miles on the bus every day to see family is not viable.  The 33-year-old public sector worker also questioned how the council could know better than the experts about Lili\u0027s future health. He said: Not even the doctors can say whether Lili will be okay after surgery, so how does the council know? And how do they expect Amy to get a bus if Lili\u0027s feeding tube comes out, for example, and she needs to take her to hospital? She would need to drop our two-year-old off at her dad\u0027s first and then jump on a bus to the hospital. The service from Caernarfon to Llanrug has also been reduced to one every hour - and that\u0027s if it turns up. And what if Amy has an anxiety attack on the way? They\u0027re not recognising mental health as a disability. It\u0027s been a very difficult time for us.  However, the council has said the case will not be reopened unless their circumstances change or significant new information was submitted. In a letter to the couple on June 22, the council said: Having carefully considered the submissions made I am satisfied that the property is suitable for your needs, and your household, and reasonable for you to accept. Matthew added: I have provided them with everything I can, and they have ignored everything. They are supposed to take all this evidence into account and they\u0027re not. We fail to see how a letter from the Downs Association cannot be classed as substantial new evidence. What would be classed as substantial new evidence? We have already provided supporting doctors letters.

The team played with some swagger and confidence, looking dangerous when they attacked. But they needed two good saves from goalkeeper Jordan Pickford, the hero of Tuesday\u0027s dramatic penalty shootout win, to keep their lead. Now either Russia or Croatia stand in the way of England making the all-important final and officially bringing football home. Spurs fan Darren Hurst, 54, of Derby summed up the feelings of millions when he said: I\u0027m in heaven.  Pubs around the country were full of tears and cheers as people raised a glass to the boys in red. Shirts were ripped off and swung around, while beers were sent flying as fans exploded with joy when the final whistle was blown. Even actress Reese Witherspoon sent her support and said: What a win!! Congrats England soccer. Legendary ex-footballer turned TV pundit Ian Wright tweeted: Enjoy these moments!!!!!!! And actor Danny Dyer kept it short and sweet and wrote Beautiful. While BBC presenter Dan Walker said: I’m going to have a chat with my children to explain to them that this just isn’t normal. After the easiest of strolls... England are in the last 4 of the World Cup... the actual World Cup!  After the game player Kyle Walker also tweeted: When you can’t get “it’s coming home” theme tune out your head along with a picture of himself. Hours earlier shops and roads across the country were deserted as the UK came to a standstill to watch the game. Long queues snaked along pavements as fans waited to be let inside pubs. A record 30 million viewers were expected to watch the clash on TV, along with 5,000 fans at the Cosmos Arena in red-hot Samara Tonight, Brits are set to continue the celebrations in the sizzling sunshine. And the match has given retailers a \u0026pound6.5billion boost as supporters buoyed by England’s fantastic run in the competition flock to buy replica kits, booze and food. That is better then last year’s Boxing Day sales record of \u0026pound4.3billion.  The WAGs were also out in force to cheer on their fellas. Among the crowd was Rebekah Vardy , wife of Jamie, who sat checking her phone before kick off, Jack Butland\u0027s fianc\u0026eacutee Annabel Peyton, Lucia Loi, girlfriend of Marcus Rashford, and Ruby Mae, girlfriend of Dele Alli. Harry Kane\u0027s pregnant partner Katie Goodland was also watching from the UK and posted a picture of Harry on TV with a love heart around it after the team\u0027s win. Fern Hawkins, partner of Harry Maguire, also proudly cheered on as her man scored.  This week Harry\u0027s former deputy headteacher, Sue Cain, described him as a \u0027remarkable\u0027 pupil who always worked \u0027very hard\u0027. He was never in any trouble and he had such a good attitude, she recalls. I taught all three Maguire brothers, they all absolutely loved their sport. Laurence Maguire, 21, who plays for Chesterfield, was seen in the stands of the Volgograd Arena wiping the tears from his eyes as Harry took on Tunisia in the opening 2-1 victory, with their brother Joe, 22, who plays for Fleetwood Town, at his side.  Harry was such a modest lad, added Ms Cain. He had his head screwed on even at that age. He did everything you asked him to do and he never questioned why. He was popular, and he was huge. Even at a young age he was very tall but he has filled out since then too. He towered over the other teams. He got A* and A grades in his GCSEs. Meanwhile, Dele Alli has become the second youngster player to score a World Cup goal for England, behind only Michael Owen in 1998. Rio Ferdinand said: It’s official... Football’s Coming Home Again!! Big respect to the England team \u0026amp Gareth! Wanna see the scenes back home.

And he is set to follow scores of royals before him by wearing the family\u0027s formal christening gown on the big day. Louis will wear a replica of the silk and lace christening gown worn by royal babies since 1841. The original was commissioned by Queen Victoria for her daughter Victoria, and made by Scottish dressmaker Janet Sutherland.  It was based on Queen Victoria\u0027s own wedding dress, and was made of Spitalfields silk and Honiton lace. The original was worn by 62 royal babies, including then-Princess Elizabeth - now the Queen - for her christening at Buckingham Palace in 1926. But after the christening of Prince Edward\u0027s daughter Louise in 2004 it was decided that the original gown was too delicate to be worn.

But as nice as it is to have stolen the Australian summer, us Brits just aren\u0027t used to coping with sudden rises in temperature. Still, all it really takes is a bit of preparation. Here are our tips for keeping comfortable and safe in this glorious weather. Now get out there and enjoy! Hydrate early, hydrate often    Your body is two-thirds water and you need to keep it topped up. If you don\u0027t you\u0027ll get headaches and may also be more tired than usual. Hydration is, as most things are, even more important for little ones. According to the British Nutrition Foundation children are less heat tolerant than adults and have a higher percentage of water in their bodies. They\u0027re also tricky little monkeys who rarely remember to drink unless reminded. The key then, is going to be making it fun to grab a drink. If you have an outdoor power socket in your garden then connect up the Halfords 40 Litre Coolbox, \u0026pound85 (was \u0026pound110, save \u0026pound25) and fill it with drinks. That way your kids can get their own chilled drink - they\u0027ll love this. You can just as easily put the coolbox inside if you don\u0027t have an outdoor power outlet. Alternatively, if you If you are planning to be out and about, you can also charge the cooler from your car\u0027s 12v power outlet. Make staying hydrated even more fun for the kids with a set of plastic Rainbow Tumblers, \u0026pound3 (half price).  Be skin-savvy Being outside in the sunshine is enjoyable, but its UV rays can do lasting damage to your skin. Applying a high SPF sun cream is vital - but it\u0027s also best to avoid exposing your skin to direct sun for prolonged periods, especially between midday and 3pm, when the sun is strongest. This is especially important for kids. So with a cloudless, beautiful summer sky you\u0027re going to need to create some shade. If you\u0027re at the beach, then a dedicated shelter will help. Halfords\u0027 Beach Shelter offers a 30+ UV protection. If you\u0027re spending most of the day out in the garden and the kids are in and out of the paddling pool, you may need more protection. The Halfords 300 Gazebo costs just \u0026pound69 ( was \u0026pound90, save \u0026pound21) and has a UV 50+ rating.  When choosing a gazebo or shelter for the sunny weather it\u0027s worth understanding those UV protection numbers. With a 50+ rating the gazebo should stop around 97 to 98 per cent of the UV radiation from the sun. This, combined with sun cream will help keep you all much safer. With any gazebo you might also want to consider some weights to go along with it. Just because it\u0027s sunny, doesn\u0027t mean it can\u0027t also be a bit blowy out! Baby, it\u0027s hot outside The hot weather can feel uncomfortable for adults, but it\u0027s particularly important to keep babies in the shade - as they are less able to sweat to cool down and their skin is very sensitive. So it\u0027s worth investing in a stroller or pram with a decent sun visor if you are taking your little one out and about in the sun.  The Joie Mirus Scenic Stroller, \u0026pound120, is an affordable modern stroller which comes with a SPF 50+ sun canopy. (It can also be paired with either the Joie Gemm or Joie Juva Infant Car Seat, to create a travel system, with no adapter needed.)  For playing in the garden or trips to the beach, grab the Halfords Infant Playshade, \u0026pound25. It pops up and down in less than 10 seconds and is made from specially tested material that provides a 50+ UV protection factor. Stay cool in the car  It\u0027s fair to say we love most things about summer, but getting into a hot car on a sweltering day isn\u0027t one of them. Did you know your air conditioning loses charge every year, making it less efficient and making your car warmer? Halfords now offers a FREE Air Con Check, to check your refrigerant levels and see if they need to be topped up for optimal performance. If they do need topping up, you can purchase air con essentials from store to recharge at home or, you can book in for an air con recharge service and Halfords can take care of it for you. You can also keep out the worst of the heat by investing in a windscreen shield to reflect the sun\u0027s glare. The Halfords All Weather Windscreen Shield is just \u0026pound7.99 - and when winter eventually does roll around, you can also use it to protect against the build up of snow and frost.

The driver then tried to drag her inside the car before his passenger joined in - and they were only thwarted when another cyclist intervened.

This is quite an achievement. Becoming a duchess isn\u0027t just about wearing expensive designer threads and accepting flowers from cute kids (though that is a large part).  There\u0027s all the rules she must now follow as the Duchess of Sussex, and it\u0027s a big leap from Hollywood to one of the most famous and traditional families in the world. So you can\u0027t hold it against her for wanting to fit in.  Recently it even seemed as if the Suits actor had adopted an English accent .  It\u0027s not the first time Meghan\u0027s accent has come under scrutinty.   Earlier this year she was accused of putting on British accent after saying the word \u0027scone\u0027 .  A new clip which recently emerged from her visit to Cheshire with the Queen, has convinced royal fans that they can hear a change in her voice. Meghan is speaking with well-wishers and shaking their hands, when one woman says: Welcome to Chester. She replies Thank you, I really appreciate that with the \u0027thank you\u0027 in particular sounding very British. But that\u0027s apparently not the case.  If we do think Meghan sounds more English, then that\u0027s down to us - not her. Professor of linguistics at Oklahoma State University, Dennis Preston, reveals that any perceived change is in fact down to our brain playing tricks on us.  She married an Englishman, she lives in England, she\u0027s hanging with the Queen, and people think, \u0027Gosh, she must be doing something with her language,\u0027 he told Yahoo .     Essentially, our brain gets in the way of our ear. So we hear what we expect to hear, rather than what we actually do. He went on: I did a very careful listen, paying specific attention to her vowels, a big giveaway with British accents, as well as the intonation. I just didn’t find anything resembling a British accent. There’s nothing there.

Margaret \u0027Mags\u0027 Murphy from Dublin, Ireland had grown concerned about lesions on her forehead - which doctors initially claimed was psoriasis. But further inspection showed that this was skin cancer, and that she would need treatment. The mum explained that she had lesions on her forehead that had been there for years but wouldn\u0027t go away. She told Dublin Live : Seven years before I was diagnosed, one dermatologist told me it was psoriasis. But then the lesions started to blister, I could feel them tingle all the time. Mags then went to her doctor in Dublin, who referred her to St James\u0027 Hospital but was told she wouldn\u0027t hear back from them for 18 months to two years.  The Dubliner wasn\u0027t in a rush about getting her lesions checked because they were hidden by her hair, so she waited the two years before going back to her doctor in 2016. Mags continued: She sent in an urgent referral and I heard back in a couple of weeks. After she finally got an appointment made with the hospital, Mags was diagnosed with pre-cancerous cells. The 47-year-old was then given a treatment called efudex, which is a type of chemotherapy you can do from home. She wasn\u0027t scared by what happened after living 13 years in Greece, adding that she wasn\u0027t surprised. Mags said: I liked the sun and my mother had been through the same treatment.  I knew it could be treated. I was able to have the cancerous cells frozen off but because of my history, they said there could be more that haven\u0027t shown up yet so they treated my whole face. Mags explained that even though the lesions on her face looked the worst, it was actually her chin that was worst affected despite having no visible signs.  Her whole body was given the treatment and she shared her journey on her blogs, Mags Murphy\u0027s Journey. She set up the blog so she could help others understand what the process was. She said: A lot of doctors can\u0027t really advice you because they haven\u0027t done the treatment I went through, so people have come to me and said the blog has helped them know that they\u0027re going through the same steps. Speaking about the appearance of her cancer, she said that they weren\u0027t moles but dry patches.

Aptamil has changed its First Infant milk powder in recent weeks, but parents have flooded the product\u0027s Facebook page with complaints. They say youngsters are being sick and suffering from diarrhoea after drinking the new milk, the Manchester Evening News reported. Some mums have shared photos of the feeds, saying the milk is curdling and the powder doesn\u0027t dissolve.  And they say Danone, which makes Aptamil and insists the new recipe is safe to drink, has given different explanations to concerned families. Sarah Foster said her eight-week-old son Tobi had been fine on the old milk since birth, but became ill after trying the new tub. She told the paper: He was sick straight away when feeding him the first feed of it. As soon as it hit his tummy it was back up. It was then I noticed it didn’t mix the same. I’ve since stockpiled the old formula but it will only last a week or two. We have no choice but to use the new one as everywhere has sold out or no longer stocks the old one.  Sarah, 35, also mum to seven-year-old Joshua, says the company is giving various responses to customers who have complained. She added: I’m so annoyed and upset about this as Aptamil are giving different answers to different people, from blaming how mums are making up the formula and then backtracking. I’ve got my replies from them through Facebook messenger and you can tell they\u0027re generic responses despite coming from a person. Parents have also complained the company has reduced the size of its packs from 900g to 800g while keeping the tubs at the same price.  Bel Garner shared a Facebook post about the new formula earlier this week and has since received more than 200 messages from people having similar issues. The experienced mum-of-three, said she was offended by the suggestion mums could be making the feeds up wrong and has criticised the new guidance to make the milk using water that\u0027s cooled for half an hour. She said: Aptamil please tell me what magical skill I have to tell my 4 1/2 old month baby that she has to wait 30 minutes for her bottle (more so if you have a baby that’s not in a routine or feeds on demand) as we are advised as parents NOT to pre-make bottles and to make each feed up as we need it and to cool down with cold water for immediate use.  Mum Susan Johnston, whose daughter was being very sick, refusing feeds and suffering with diarrhoea, posted a photo of one bottle made up with the old formula and one with the new to show the company the difference between the two. She said: The pictures I took were of Aptamil old and new formula. Why is there such a difference between the two when they were both made at same time in the same way? And another mum Amanda Higson, urged the company to take action over the number of complaints. She said: I don’t think it’s a coincidence a lot of babies are getting poorly on the new First Infant milk. Why change the formula when it was fine? I think this should be looked into as a priority, either bring the old milk back or look into why babies are reacting so badly to the new one. In the heat/weather at the moment it’s even more of a priority when babies are either not taking to the milk or being sick/upset tummy and losing fluids. Sort it Aptamil, very disappointing.

The government is believed to be drawing up a new list of items that must be put in the hold. It comes after Australia, the US and New Zealand introduced similar bans last month. They adopted the new rules after Australian officials were rocked by a foiled plot to blow up an Ethiad flight from Sydney to Abu Dhabi last year. Islamic State sent the sophisticated device from Syria to a terror cell in Sydney hidden in a meat mincer.  A major terror attack may only have been averted when the suitcase was abandoned at check-in, possibly because it was too heavy.  The Times reports that the new rules could bring powders under the same restrictions as liquids.  All powders would be restricted to 12 ounces or 56 grams and would have to go through further security checks. The rule on liquids were introduced in the wake of 9/11. However, there are fears the new rules could mean even longer lines at airport security. It comes amid worries that the new UK passports, which are blue in colour, will increase queues at border control. The Department of Transport did not comment on The Times\u0027 report.

A colossal \u0026pound10 billion worth of badly performing SIPPs - Self Invested Personal Pensions - are believed to have been mis-sold to hundreds of thousands of Brits by unscrupulous financial advisors. Now potential victims are being urged to check if they can reclaim huge portions of their lost cash and the government has set up a special \u0026pound120 million fund to compensate losers so far. A maximum \u0026pound50,000 compensation sum is currently available from the large fund managed by The Financial Service Compensation Scheme and the figure is set to rise by 75 per cent to a \u0026pound85,000 maximum in the next nine months as claims grow. However industry figures such as pension expert Zoe Pearson warn that the true cost of mis-sold pensions is closer to \u0026pound10 billion and will sweep the country like the current phenomenon of PPI claims that has gripped the nation over the past few years.  Read more: Taxed to death: The astonishing amount of income tax people pay decades after leaving work for the last time Miss Pearson, who heads the country’s all female team of claim specialists Pension Claim Consulting Ltd , told : “Thousands upon thousands of people are unaware they’ve been mis-sold SIPPS. Unless you know what to look for it’s difficult to know what a mis-sale is although quite often when people realise they’ve been mis-sold to, they’re too embarrassed to take action. “However, the financial services industry has firm rules, so any mis-sale should be pursued. “Even basic calculations give you an idea of the true scale of this scandal. Average compensation for mis-sales sit at around \u0026pound25,000 for private pensions and \u0026pound50,000 for final salary pensions so the total figure for the mis-sales of SIPPs is going to be around the \u0026pound10bn mark. “In fact if this was brought to the forefront and the government advised people to check the status of their pensions that might even be an underestimation. The government needs to launch an investigation to unearth the true amount.” Labour MP Frank Field has hit out at the SIPP conmen and vowed to bring the industry into line whilst industry experts reveal the true figure of mis-selling is growing at an unprecedented rate and the true loss of mis-selling will run into billions as the number of victims rocket.  Shocking 30.4million Brits face disappointment when they finally get to stop working - the plan to fix it The Financial Ombudsman however are allowed to raise their compensation ceiling and can award up to a further maximum of \u0026pound150,000 for many cases. The SIPP scams involved unscrupulous Financial Advisors preying on savers who were promised massive returns of up to 20 per cent a year only for their savings to be squandered on get rich quick schemes including investing in airport parking, holiday properties and green energy projects. The Financial Conduct Authority revealed one in eight savers think an advisor has mis-sold them a financial product such as a pension. The FCA advise people who think they have been mis-sold a pension to raise a complaint as soon as possible as there are time-limits in place which could affect the outcome of your claim. Their report called the Financial Lives Survey was widely praised by industry experts who believe that the government have underestimated the scale of mis-sold pensions such as SIPPs however the Commons Work and Pensions Committee have demanded tighter safeguards to protect savers. Committee Chairman Frank Field MP said: “I am concerned about the role of SIPPs as platforms that help funnel unwitting clients’ pension savings into dodgy and inappropriate investments. SIPPs are happy to skim off their fee on the way but there are serious questions about their commitment to due diligence and consumer protection. “When an unscrupulous financial advisor channels a victim’s money through a SIPP into an investment that then collapses, it is not enough for the SIPP provider to shrug their shoulders and say ‘caveat emptor’. “I will be writing to the FCA to ask what they are doing to ensure SIPPS are not acting as handmaidens to the pension-snatchers.” "},{"url":null,"title":"pippa middleton reveals one thing","story":"NewsPippa Middleton reveals the one thing she\u0027s refusing to give up during her pregnancyPippa Middleton is expecting her first child with husband James Matthews\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByZoe ForseyAudience Writer17:36, 6 JUL 2018NewsPippa is pregnant with her first child (Image: Rex)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailWhen women find out they\u0027re pregnant, their lives change forever. Even though they\u0027re still months away from meeting their baby, the changes to their day-to-day life start immediately. There\u0027s a whole host of foods they can no longer eat, they can\u0027t drink and they will sometimes have to give up the hobbies they love. But there\u0027s one thing Pippa Middleton, who is expecting her first child with husband James Matthews, is refusing to give up despite that growing baby bump.   Writing in her column for Waitrose Weekend , the Duchess of Cambridge\u0027s little sister, 34, explains why she is still playing tennis.  She said: I\u0027ve been a tennis fan since childhood, as player and spectator, and have been keen to continue playing safely throughout pregnancy. Take Serena Williams – she famously proved that women can play a high level of tennis from two months (when she won the 2017 Australian Open) up to eight months. Few of us can relate to this elite excellence, but if you\u0027re a healthy, well-trained player with an uncomplicated pregnancy there\u0027s no reason why you can\u0027t continue a good level of tennis.

Pride raises awareness and support for the LGBT+ community , and is frequently celebrated as one of the most inclusive events in the world. The theme for London Pride 2018 - its 46th year - is #PrideMatters. There are 30,000 people and 472 organisations taking part in the annual parade itself, which is one of the world\u0027s biggest LGBT+ celebrations.  Countless spectators took to the streets along the parade route from Regeant Street to Picadilly Circus and Trafalgar Square.  The world famous parade will wind through London and include performances from Sophie Ellis-Bextor , George Shelly, Sue Rie, Sinitta, Alyssa Edwards and Courtney Act. There will also be a pop-up silent disco in Trafalgar Square, courtesy of Pride\u0027s official music partner Amazon Music, and a special celebration at John Lewis\u0027 Summer of Sound Rooftop. Pride in London has also launched a new app for this year\u0027s event which shows the updated schedule . The Mirror has changed its logo to a rainbow in honour of the celebration, with the slogan \u0027Proud to support Pride\u0027.  Temperatures in London are expected to reach 31C today, and those attending the parade have been encouraged to take water and suncream with them. The parade was opened by mayor of London Sadiq Khan and women and equalities minister Penny Mourdant. It kicked off at 12pm from Portland Place, and will travel through Oxford Circus, Regent Street, Piccadilly Circus, Pall Mall and Trafalgar Square before finishing on Whitehall. Groups taking part in the parade include Mosaic LGBT Youth Centre, Educate and Celebrate, which aims to make schools LGBT-friendly places.  Groups from the NHS also took part in the parade to mark its 70th anniversary.  Pride director Christopher Joell-Deshields said this year\u0027s parade was the most diverse to date.   He said: “It\u0027s just a day to be proud of really - people are able to just come and be who they are and celebrate whatever they want. Trafalgar Square Stage performances began at 11.50am, with an introduction by host Michael Twaits at 11.45am. The Women’s Stage in Leicester Square and the Cabaret Stage on Dean Street kicked off at 12.30pm. The Golden Square Family Stage in Golden Square will begin at 1pm. People will be able to take part in activities in the Community Village in Soho Square from 12pm It\u0027s recommended that people avoid busy locations like Trafalgar Square and Piccadilly Circus. The parade comes to an end at 5pm after which Sophie Ellis-Bextor and Alexandra Burke will entertain crowds in Trafalgar Square.   London\u0027s Met Police issued an open letter asking people to remain vigilant during the celebartions. “Pride is renowned internationally for being one of the safest and friendliest events in London, and this year we are working as hard as ever to prepare,” said Commander David Musker. There was some controversy surrounding the event as some criticised the decision to allow only 30,000 people participate in the parade.  A further 20,000 applied to take part but London Pride said it wasn\u0027t \u0027practical\u0027 to allow everyone to take part as the parade would then take around nine hours.  Veteran LGBT campaigner Peter Tatchell said limiting numbers felt like discrimination.  It has been reported that more than 100 groups had their applications denied when they were lodged after the cut-off date.  “The limit on the size of Pride feels like anti-LGBT+ discrimination,” Mr Tatchell said.

Four-year-old Celyn Jones\u0027 hair has been washed every day since it went green on Monday, but the colour still remains.  Her parents Stephen and Lowri Jones from Llangefni in Anglesey, North Wales , are warning others to be careful about using the \u0026pound1 hair ties from the fashion store, which is now investigating what happened.  The couple say they have tried everything to remove the dye, and although the colour is fading it is still clearly visible in little Celyn\u0027s bright blonde hair.  Strangely, the hair bobble in question was not even green, but dark coloured.  Lowri told the Daily Post : On Monday, I put Celyn\u0027s swimming costume on her after smothering her in sun cream.  I tied her hair up with one of the bobbles we\u0027d bought from Primark to keep her hair out of her face. About 20 minutes later, I started to notice her hair was turning green. I took the bobble out and the green dye just spread throughout her hair. I didn\u0027t think much about it at first, thinking the water in the paddling pool would wash it out, but it didn\u0027t. The mum-of-five said she has tried all kinds of different shampoos and even resorted to using Fairy Liquid on her daughter\u0027s hair. The 33-year-old added: Celyn\u0027s hair is very light so you can see there\u0027s still quite a lot of green in it. Her hair does look a mess and she\u0027s having to go to school like that. I\u0027ve explained to the teachers but Celyn is loving it.

Catherine Purcell, 68, died while being eaten alive and lying in a “cesspit of her own faeces and bodily fluid” at the home she shared with her daughter in Kirkby, Liverpool .  This week, her husband John Purcell, 72, and 35-year-old daughter Catherine Purcell junior, 35, were given suspended jail sentences for neglecting the disabled great-grandmother.  Prosecutors said the great-grandmother\u0027s bed was so soiled it had been chemically destroyed by her own bodily fluids, the Liverpool Echo reported.   David McLachlan, QC, prosecuting, said this reaction burned the skeletal victim’s skin and her infected body was then fed on by maggots. He argued during that the pair knew she was dying, but failed to seek medical aid, which three weeks beforehand would have saved her life. During the harrowing trial into the death of Mrs Purcell, Mr McLachlan read out messages exchanged between Purcell junior and her sister Kellie, who had not visited the house for six months and was not charged with any offences. The messages were sent days before the pensioner died on July 11, 2016, and included Purcell junior likening her mum to a pig lying in s***.  One message read: Ye girl co dad said fore to just ignore her for a bit and let her do with put cuppa tea and biffs let’s see if she’ll give in that way but every time one of us walk in she gets worse surly she can smell it in her f***ing hands when she smoking Oh I jus don’t know what to do coz she can’t walk so I can’t even get her to the bath room to giv her a bath and no matter what way we look at her were gona end up with this all over use as well even if she could walk she’s gonna have us plasted in s*** as well she’s just not assed to say the least girl either she isn’t a bit bothered that she’s like that she licks off if we tell he to at least wash her hands to eat her tea etc. She f***ing flipped on dad av few times now coz she’s had to get wash she like pig lying in her Own s*** descusting I feel like f***ing dragging her by the head and f***ing throwing her in the f***ing bath tats how bad she is girl.  In one text, Kellie Purcell asked: Have u sorted little room yet girl I got bedding for single and double here just finishing sorting curtain now sweat p***ing out of me like tap carnt breath \u0026amp I stink. Her sister replied: No have I f*** girl I can’t be assed what’s the point am going to jail any how so dads keeps telling me. The f***ing point is it needs doing oh I be round in morning, came the reply. Other messages appeared to show Kellie Purcell offering to help out but being repeatedly ignored by her sister.  And she lashed out at her sibling in another message, accusing her of pure laziness for not helping their mum. She wrote: I agree about mum if use would of let Carers in u would have been better but the state the house is in cath and me mum got f*** all to do with not being able to cope it pure laziness. A post-mortem examination found Mrs Purcell died from pneumonia, dehydration and skin ulcers, including a hip ulcer penetrating to the bone.  The victim, who weighed just five and a half stone, also had undiagnosed cancer of the tongue, which would have made swallowing painful. Mr Purcell claimed he didn’t realise his wife was “severely malnourished”, or her stained legs covered in sores, despite changing her clothes. He accepted her bedroom was “disgraceful”, but said he didn’t know it was that filthy until she died, because the bed was covered by a duvet.

England will take on Sweden at 3pm today in a crucial quarter-final clash, but shops and two streets in Ashby, Leicestershire, will be shut down for the duration.  The controversial move comes after police were called in when large numbers of chanting England supporters marched down a street on Tuesday night after Gareth Southgate\u0027s side beat Colombia on penalties.    Video showed some people clambering on top of a lorry amid rowdy scenes in the town, LeicestershireLive reported.  And Leicestershire County Council says Market Street and Brook Street in the town centre will now be closed between 2pm and 6.30pm today for public safety. It is not thought that any damage was caused during Tuesday\u0027s high-spirited celebrations, but businesses are not taking any chances. Ashby town councillor and business owner John Coxon said that celebrations around the games could sometimes be intimidating. He said: I think some of the business owners are fearful of what might happen. Our neighbours have said they’re going to close early rather than risk any aggravation. People like to celebrate and it’s understandable, but for some it can be a bit intimidating. Like most market towns, businesses in Ashby can’t afford to lose 25 per cent of their trade on a Saturday.

Today is expected to top the previous hottest day record of 32C - and temperatures are going to stay high this weekend as England take on Sweden in the World Cup. Tourists and workers in London suffered through boiling conditions as they travelled home tonight as they faced temperatures of up to 35C on packed tube carriages. A signal failure at White City in west London brought chaos to the central line - with one station announcer saying he wasn\u0027t sure if the train would be waiting at the station for five minutes, five hours, or five years.  The central line consistently breaks records with temperatures peaking at 35.5C last summer - this exceeds the EU limit of 30C at which it is legal to transport cows, sheep and pigs. Trains from Paddington were also delayed due to an electricity failure and trains from Liverpool Street disrupted thanks to a points failure - causing thousands of people to wait in stations in the unberable hear. As the heatwave has raged on for nearly two weeks passengers travelling through Essex said people have fainted on trains as they travel home in 28C to 30C heat.  Some have hit out at rail firms by comparing the conditions on packed trains to a sauna with no air conditioning and barely any room to move. As the temperatures remain above average for the 12th day in the row Wimbledon fans were seen struggling as they watched on day five of the championships. Fans were seen fanning themselves and trying to cover their skin to avoid getting burnt as they tried to focus on the game. And this morning \u0027official pigeon scarer\u0027 Rufus the Hawk had to begin his daily shift at 5am on Centre Court to avoid the heat. Yesterday a West Berkshire Council bin lorry got stuck in Newbury yesterday after the road melted beneath it.  Thames Valley Police said the street had to be closed overnight to enable the damage to be assessed causing travel chaos through the town centre. Drivers have also been warned about driving in extreme temperatures over fears driving in the intense heat is almost like driving with a blood-alcohol reading. SEAT have published new information on driving in extreme temperatures, warning that people who make mistakes with their air conditioning during the intense heatwave risk lowering their driving ability.    A koi carp called \u0027Big White Fish\u0027 has even been rushed to hospital this week after getting burnt in the ongoing hot weather. Owner Pat Smythe, 70, from Burton-on-Trent noticed a big patch of red scales on his back and rushed him to the vet. Pet owners have been urged to take measures to stop their animals getting sunburn - with dogs , rabbits, cats, cows and even goldfish at risk - as the country is in the midst of its longest heatwave since 1976. Derby vet Paul Revell said: Believe it or not, fish can get sunburnt if they spend too long at the surface of a pond or lake.  There could be some relief from the heat for a brief period this weekend as some scattered showers will develop over Britain but most areas will remain dry and warm. An amber level heatwave alert has been issued for western parts of England with temperatures soaring over the next few days. London and the South East will bear the brunt of the sweltering conditions and high pressure will dominate the weather with prolonged periods of sunshine and more scorching air from the continent blocking any periods of cooler, unsettled Atlantic conditions. This has created an area of clear air above the UK, where cloud is suppressed and winds have been low to allow maximum heat to come through from the sun.  Hot conditions are expected to continue into next week. It may be sporadically cloudy and slightly fresher in the northwest at times with a little more rain or drizzle . However, for those wanting a respite from the heat, there is some hope on the horizon. More unsettled weather may start to develop later this month with occasional spells of more changeable conditions edging across the UK, particularly in the north and northwest.

And in a sense they are – although that loved one is their former home, now a heap of rubble piled next to the devastated al-Nuri mosque in Mosul’s once-beautiful old town. They weep when they see it and they are not alone. Down the road, another man cries beside his wrecked house. The Yosifs’ explanation for coming is simple: “Because there is nothing better than home.”  We meet them in Iraq’s second-biggest city a year on from its liberation from Is\u0026shy\u0026shylamic State’s three-year occupation. This was the brutal jihadis’ last bastion – the place where their leader proclaimed his caliphate in the mosque. IS clung on bitterly as Iraqi and Kurdish forces and coalition air strikes blasted Mosul to powdery oblivion. An estimated 40,000 lives were lost 70% of the city was destroyed.  In the old town, skeletal remains of homes sag above our heads, their once-hidden innards twisted and exposed like those of the corpses that still rot within. Endless piles of stone are churned with rem\u0026shy\u0026shynants of family life – a rug, a basket, a child’s shoe perhaps lost mid-flight. As the battle raged for three months, the Yosifs hid with 53 others in an ancient cave. There was no light they ate only wheat with water snatched perilously from the mosque’s well. There was no space to lie down, no toilet.  Mum Hiam, 43, was pregnant. Her beautiful daughters Ahlaa, nine, and Masra, eight, were terrified of the dark. She recalls: “We lost weight, our skin was scaly and itchy. It smelt terrible. The bombs fell and finally we could not breathe for dust. IS wanted the cave but we refused. They threatened to burn us. But we had no hope anyway.” Finally forced out into the bombs and bullets days before liberation, they wept with relief when they saw Iraqi soldiers. In a refugee camp weeks later, Hiam gave birth to daughter Ellen. She weighed just 1kg.  Her face terribly aged, she says: “She was fighting for life.” Incredibly, Ellen won that battle. The family now rent a half-built house in the east of the city. Their only surviving possession, discovered in the rubble, is a wardrobe. Hiam smiles: “There is no money to rebuild yet we have faith we will return. We have hope now.” It is because of this fierce determination that the old town is starting to breathe again. There is no plumb\u0026shy\u0026shying, no electricity, but 130,000 have returned. In Mosul overall, 830,000 of a million displaced have come home.  Shops and cafes are reope\u0026shyning battered sofas laid out for coffee, fashion dummies and footballs for sale amid the debris. Washing lines snake between bullet-pocked walls, clothes gathering the white dust that shrouds buildings and fills your mouth. Sharmem Mohammed, 50, says: “We have no roof but we can’t afford rent elsewhere.” Grandmother Batool Khamees says the only thing that survived in her home was her bed. “Now I sleep on it even though the sun comes through the roof,” she smiles. But the area is littered with tens of thousands of IEDs. We are shown a newly discovered one and beat a hasty retreat. Water is helping people return. Oxfam repairs have brought supplies to 35,000. Children playfully suck clean water from hose pipes.  Hospitals, too, are being slowly rebuilt. Many were devastated by air strikes or IS arson. Three serve the whole city – there were once seven.

And 90% of respondents said they were happy with the overall housing service in Dundee, seven percentage points higher than the national average.Councillor Kevin Cordell, convener of Dundee City Council’s neighbourhood services committee, said: “It is essential that we know exactly how our tenants feel about the service they get and the quality of the homes they live in so that we can ensure that we meet their expectations.“When 90% of people we asked tell us that they are either very or fairly satisfied with the service they get, it is an overwhelming thumbs-up.“But that doesn’t mean we are in any way complacent. There is still room for us to improve, and that will be the focus going forward.”A total of 500 tenants from across the city were interviewed in their homes by independent market research company Knowledge Partnership.As well as asking tenants about their home and services such as repairs, the survey also explored how effective the council’s information and involvement programmes are and whether the services provided offer value for money.Jim Cochrane, chairman of Dundee Federation of Tenants’ Associations, said: “We are delighted to endorse the results of the recent tenant satisfaction survey and welcome the sustained positive trend in key areas of service provision.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b3f331ac10f0-940x549.jpg ","title":"a tale of seven cities dundee goes global in time for va

Dundee paid the price for that gamble by failing to get out of a group they had been expected to win comfortably and, ultimately, it was a factor in Hartley losing his job.Under McCann, the policy has been that the Betfred is an important event and it’s first game, not the league kick-off next month, marks the start of the season proper. That’s fine by his vice-captain.“I personally came back feeling really fit and I think as you’ve seen the rest of the boys look really fit as well,” he said.“You can kind of gauge first day back when we do a lot of testing. Everyone is a bit anxious because eyes are on you but this has been the fittest group of boys I’ve seen.“Everyone has a sharpness about them. I don’t know if it’s the modern game and the demands there are on you but everyone has been bang at it.“For me the Betfred two years ago gave me a shock. I remember speaking about it. That season we were straight into the competitive games and you are expected to win them but it doesn’t go that way because that’s football and you have to be ready.“That’s why to get the couple of games we’ve had has been massive and to get away (to Portugal), do some training and have another couple of games is massive as well.”Dundee are now in the Algarve where they’ll do more work and face SC Farense on Tuesday. Kerr’s sure that’ll have them ready for the Betfred tie at Stirling Albion Saturday week.“I enjoy being away. I’ve been to Hungary twice and Austria during pre-season and it’s good for the team.“You get to know the new boys who’ve come because you are together all the time and that’s important. We’re doing two sessions a day, eating meals together and spending time together at night as well.“That’s important because when you have new team-mates you can’t just go out on a pitch and gel right away. It takes work and time.”With the cup games looming large, Kerr feels the time away is also a chance to prepare properly.“We’re back in the middle of next week and then right into the first tie on the Saturday, so we can do a bit of work for that as well as the general stuff we’ve been doing.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"creators of famous viking centre in york to open new exhibit in tayside","story":"\t\t\t\t\tVikings will invade the local area this summer with an exhibition featuring a 15ft boat, a skeleton and a replica ancient Nordic house being staged at Perth Museum.Vikings: Fearsome Craftsmen explores the day-to-day lives of the formidable Norse warriors and the interactive event will introduce visitors to the Viking way of life, including their craft skills.Those who attend the exhibition, which is being run by the creators of the famous Jorvik Viking Centre in York, can also enjoy seeing a 15ft replica Viking fishing boat and an ancient excavated Viking skeleton.Helen Smout, chief executive of Culture Perth and Kinross, urged residents and visitors to “seize the opportunity” to experience what she feels will be a “hit” summer event.She said: “The team at Perth Museum and Art Gallery and across Culture Perth and Kinross have braced ourselves for a very welcome Viking invasion.“The Jorvik Viking Centre is a fantastic step into another time and we are delighted to be hosting an interactive exhibit from the same team, right here in the heart of Scotland.“We look forward to welcoming visitors who have an interest in these incredibly intelligent and creative Norse warriors, and those who are curious to learn more about them in a fun family-friendly environment.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b3f32d41f02e.jpg ","title":"dad of three luke 34 cured of diabetes after 22 years thanks to double transplant","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA dad-of-three says he feels like a “different person” after receiving a double transplant.Luke Chapman, 34, was given a new kidney and pancreas, having suffered from type 1 diabetes for 22 years and then developed kidney disease.He said that since the operation, he has been cured of the condition – and paid tribute to the staff who treated him for more than two decades.Pancreas and kidney transplants are carried out on patients with kidney disease. In Luke’s case, the new kidney has taken over from his own, which hadn’t worked properly since he was diagnosed.In type 1 diabetes, the pancreas does not make enough insulin, a hormone that controls the blood sugar level in your body. The transplanted pancreas can make insulin and correct this type of diabetes.Luke, an electrician from Montrose, said: “I was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes at the age of 12. I took insulin to control that since I was diagnosed.“Unfortunately, my kidney function dropped quite badly and in 2014 I was diagnosed with kidney disease, and started dialysis in 2016.“I was put on dialysis three days a week, which was quite gruelling. The last two years, on the dialysis, it was a struggle, and started to disrupt my life.“I was still managing to work but I was tired all the time. I was limited to one litre of fluid a day, which is hard, and your diet is restricted as well. There was a large build-up of fluid in my body which is bad for your heart and puts you at risk of a heart attack.\u0026#8220I was on the waiting list for a kidney and pancreas transplant, but was taken off a couple of times, because there is strict criteria that you remain in good health.”Then, on June 2, Luke got a call at 3am telling him to get to Edinburgh Royal Infirmary as medics had found a donor – much to the relief of wife Vicky and children Luiza, 18, Finlay, six and three-year-old Frankie.He said: “In about 90% of cases with transplant, something goes wrong for some reason and the transplant doesn’t go ahead. But at 5.50pm, the doctor came and said, ‘that’s your pancreas here’.“They had harvested it first, before the kidney, but from the same donor. It’s strange because you never know if the day will come or not. It was surreal.“I’ve had diabetes for 22 years and now I’m cured. I feel like a different person. I was at the beach yesterday with my kids running around – I couldn’t have done that five weeks ago.“With keeping my full-time job I was going home and just feeling rotten and sleeping a lot. But my employer, WM Mustard \u0026amp Son Ltd has been fantastic with me.“I lost almost 10kg in three days after the operation. The new kidney needs time to be regulated by the body, so it was in overdrive, removing everything from my body.“I’m now starting to put weight back on.“I’m on about 22 tablets in the morning for various things. That will continue, but the dosage will drop after three and then six months.“But the prognosis is I can eat, drink or do what I want.“The treatment I have had from the NHS has been impeccable and the staff have been brilliant.”Luke has been told the age and sex of his donor, and will shortly be told how they died. He plans in due course to write to their family, thanking them.He added: “If anyone is thinking of signing up to be a donor, please do it. You could be saving the lives of six or seven people in the process.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b335b8da880a.jpg ","title":"donkey joins in celebrations as dundee woman sandra turns 50","story":"\t\t\t\t\tBirthday girl Sandra McIntosh had an unusual visitor on her special day in the shape of Donkey Bond, a miniature donkey.Sandra, from Downfield, turned 50 and was delighted by the visit from the cute donkey who lives with owner Alison Wiseman at Balnuith Farm, Tealing.The surprise was arranged by Sandra’s fiance Scott Findlay and their friend Nicky Millen.Shocked Sandra said: \u0026#8220You don’t expect to open your door and a donkey to be there, do you?“Maybe flowers or chocolates but I would never have imagined Donkey Bond would be there.“He was so cute.

Before heading west, the young centre-half turned out for his parent club in the friendly draw at Brechin last Friday.And watching on was a scout from an English Premier League outfit who had headed north to specifically have a look at him.While that’s unlikely to lead to an immediate move to take him south, his first few appearances at Morton are likely to be monitored.Should Waddell impress, there’s still the possibility an offer for him could be forthcoming before the transfer window closes at the end of next month.It would take a substantial offer to persuade Dundee to part with him.

He knows the best place to show United’s intent won’t be in interviews but out on the pitch and by getting results.And as Csaba Laszlo’s new-look side gels, he’s confident that will be the case.“We need to do our talking on the pitch,” he added.“Hopefully, all the pieces will come together during the season and the goal is to get to the Premiership.“It is going to take time but the pre-season games and the Betfred Cup games before the league season starts are all preparation for the first game against Dunfermline.“And the Betfred Cup gives us competitive games before the season starts but at the end of the day it is part of our preparation for the start of the league.“It’s a lot better playing games than training all the time but we do want to go on a nice cup run as well.”The early signs up at Glebe Park were encouraging and Aird admits he was pleased with how things went for both himself and his new team-mates.“Obviously, I was delighted to get a run out and get the goal. It was my first game for Dundee United and it was great to get started.“It was a pre-season game and the big thing was to get minutes on the pitch and that was good.“And the goal was good for the confidence going forward.“It was the first time all the boys had played together and gave the manager the chance to have a look at us in a game rather than training.”While it goes without saying United have taken something of a gamble by making so many signings in one summer.There have already been nine new arrivals and the manager has revealed he’d like as many as another four before the Betfred Cup kicks off against Arbroath next week.Rather than being daunted by that, though, Aird is relishing the challenge of being part of what could be a completely new team.“It was a position when they signed nine new players that it was the rebuilding of a club.“The number of signings excited me. Obviously, the manager has a vision of the way he wants the team to play and the direction he wants to go.“It’s an exciting time ahead for the football club and I am glad to be part of it.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"hannah nets dream job at overgate gift shop after chance meeting on way to another interview","story":"\t\t\t\t\t“I absolutely love my job so was more than happy when I got asked to be store manager.”Hannah Murdoch, 24, began working at the Little Thistle Gift shop a week after it opened its doors in October 2015.After working in retail since she was at school, Hannah got the job after a chance encounter with the shop’s owner.She said: “I was actually on my way to another job interview when I noticed the shop had opened in the Overgate.“Little gift shops like this are my favourite kind of store so I always have to go in when I see one.“After chatting to one of the owners, Kevin, he told me to hand in a CV since I was looking for a job.“I got a call from him asking me to come in for an interview and they offered me a job there and then.“I absolutely love my job and after working here for a year, I was asked to become store manager, I was so shocked but more than happy to take on the role.”The Little Thistle Gift Shop’s secret is definitely it’s superb range of gifts – and Hannah says she loves being able to talk to customers about the products.“We have a lot of suppliers that we sell in store but it is very important to that the shop stocks local, independent products.“The owners Kevin and Tracey also make some of their own products which we sell. I love being able to tell the customer that the owners actually made the gift they are buying.”When it comes to working in retail Hannah says the most important thing is how you communicate with customers.She said: “The whole concept of the shop is to give customers that personal touch.“The most important part of that is how we interact with our customers.“The first thing you learn when you start work in the shop is everything else stops when a customer comes in and they become the most important thing.“We always say the staff in here love a chat but there is nothing better than a customer saying they have had a great experience in your store.“I really enjoying being able to serve someone well as that is what they will go and tell friends and family about and recommend the store to them.“You have to be approachable when working in retail and confident and comfortable speaking to people.“Confidence is something I have had to work on throughout my career, but it is something I would urge anyone interested in retail to work on too.”Although Hannah climbed up the retail ladder through working in several shops, there are many courses on offer in Dundee.Dundee and Angus College offer several in both retail and retail management.These include Introduction to Fashion Retailing where students get hands-on experience working within the college’s gift shop.HNC Retail sees students gaining a broad knowledge of the retail industry and the skills and qualities required for a diverse range of careers.The college also offers HND Retail Management where students have the opportunity to gain work experience managing and promoting the colleges pop-up shop, Tempus.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b3f32bb3dac0-846x564.jpg ","title":"its just amazing joy as 95k raised to send dundee boy garvie for life saving leukaemia treatment","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA fundraiser to help send a seven-year-old Dundee boy to Italy for life-saving cancer treatment has reached its target.Garvie Winter, from Downfield, was diagnosed with leukaemia last November.Since then, the Fintry Primary pupil has undergone numerous rounds of chemotherapy, which mum Haley, 32, says have been unsuccessful.Haley also recently made an unsuccessful appeal for a bone marrow donor who could be a potential match for Garvie.After his fifth round of chemotherapy didn’t work, doctors said his only hope was to undergo groundbreaking Car T-cell therapy in Italy.The treatment involves a patient’s T cells — a type of immune system cell — being changed in the laboratory so they will attack cancer cells.Haley launched a fundraising campaign in a bid to fund the trip for the treatment, which has now surpassed its £95,000 target.She said that it was “really exciting” news for Garvie, as preparations start for the trip.Haley said: “I wasn’t up to date with everything because we had been away.“When I saw it I couldn’t believe it – it’s just amazing. The fundraisers have all been brilliant and I can’t thank them enough.“I don’t even know what to say – it gives me goosebumps.”Haley said that Garvie is set to undergo more chemotherapy treatment next week and is waiting for marrow test results coming back, before plans can start for him to go to Italy for the treatment.Lisa Vannart, one of the people behind the campaign, broke the news late yesterday – saying “best week ever”.Laura Colligan also posted online, hailing the “amazing” fundraising efforts of locals. She said: “How amazing and outstanding the effort everyone has made to make this happen for Haley and Garvie.“The target has been smashed – the way I’m feeling, I can’t even begin to imagine how Haley is feeling. Feel like I am away to sob. #Teamgarvie – he’s going on that plane.”In an online group dedicated to the fundraising activities for Garvie, locals wished the youngster good luck for his upcoming trip and praised the work of fundraisers across the city.Angie Richardson said: “You should all be so proud of yourselves for making this happen for Garvie.”Kelly Percy added: “Brilliant news. So happy for you all – good luck wee one.”The achievement comes after more than £101,000 was raised in just over six weeks to send 30-year-old Tracey Burke for the treatment that could save her life.Tracey, from Ardler, was diagnosed with cervical cancer three years ago.Her husband Greg set up a fundraising drive on May 13 in a bid to raise cash to send her to the continent for immunotherapy, at a cost of £90,000.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"james keatings return is like a new signing for dundee united boss","story":"\t\t\t\t\tCsaba Laszlo admits having James Keatings fit again has left him feeling like he’s made 10, not nine, summer signings.A long-term groin problem meant only six of his 21 appearances in an injury-hit first year as a Tangerine were made after Csaba took over as manager in November.The 26-year-old is back fit and has been training with the rest of the squad since pre-season started a fortnight ago.And the attacker made a big impression when he came on for the final 15 minutes or so of Tuesday night’s friendly win over Brechin City at Glebe Park.It was his shot that came back off the bar and hit home defender Euan Spark before bouncing over the line for United’s second goal.Keatings went close again with another effort shortly after and Csaba has revealed he was impressed with his cameo performance.“I was very pleased with James Keatings’ performance, he showed he is a good player and can play football,” he said.“He needs more time but he is more or less a new player and I know he can be part of the squad this year.”With Craig Curran and Nicky Clark joining up, having battled back to fitness the former Hibs and Hearts faces another fight to hold down a place in the team in the coming months.And Csaba has also been pleased with the way his new front men have been fitting in.“Nicky Clark and Craig Curran and even (winger) Fraser Aird, they know where the goal is.“With Craig Curran we have a fighter up front.

That’s why we want to sort that out and have some positive dialogue with them soon.”The King’s Theatre was built in 1908 and was converted into a cinema in 1928.

Likewise, young Scott Allardice slotted in comfortably alongside Frans in central defence.Originally a midfielder, he’s now impressed a few times in that deeper role and would certainly be worth another look there when the Betfred Cup group matches kick-off in under a fortnight.Returning to the new faces, a clue who will be handed the goalkeeper’s jersey when the competitive action starts was perhaps given when Swiss Benjamin Siegrist was preferred to Slovakian Matej Rakovan in goal.Siegrist was almost caught out when he was slow to field a pass back in the first half but, generally, looked sound.Rakovan did come on for the second half and did nothing wrong but right now it appears he has work to do to be in the side when Arbroath are faced in that first Betfred tie on Saturday week.While the game did fizzle out a bit in the second half, another boost for United was the appearance of James Keatings for the final 15 minutes or so.The attacker’s first season at Tannadice was ruined by injuries but, if he can stay fit, he’s a player who can play a significant part in what lies ahead.It was his shot with ten minutes left that struck the bar and went in off home defender Euan Spark for the second.Keatings then struck the post with a clever curling effort from 16 yards out.Had that gone in, the score would have provided a fairer reflection of United’s good work.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"sleeperz boss says new dundee hotel is our best yet","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee\u0026#8217s new landmark hotel is gearing up to open on Monday – and the Tele has been given a sneak peek inside.Sleeperz at the railway station will welcome its first guests next week – to coincide with the official opening of the station itself – and workers are putting the final touches to the building’s 120 rooms today and across the weekend.Already looking to be fully booked for The Open, rooms at the hotel cost from £59 a night."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7486028.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie Sly s film wins at the Oscars","story":"                          Swindon\u0027 own Maisie Sly has topped off her trip to Hollywood in style, after the film she starred in, The Silent Child, was announced as the winner Best Live Action Short Film at the 90th\u0026nbspAcademy Awards."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7590066.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"11 things you d only hear in Glasgow","story":"                          There are some things you will only ever hear in Glasgow or Glesga, as us locals call it,\u0026nbspand this is our definitive list of the best."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7608211.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"orange-walk-glasgow-dozens-of-city-roads-closed-today-for-annual-boyne-parade","story":"                          A number of roads will be closed this weekend as part of the annual Orange Walk."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/8023698.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"pet-collar-melts-into-cats-neck-in-heatwave","story":"                          A WOMAN has issued a stark warning to other cat owners after her furry friend\u0027s newly-bought collar melted into its neck -

It also aims to guarantee that all commitments to suppliers are fulfilled.The Inverness franchise has been held for about the last two years by American Jack Alldredge who is understood to be from Florida.The company\u0027 managing director Mike Williams said Mr Alldredge had hoped to settle in the UK after visiting the country.\"He loved the idea of living here and fell in love with Inverness,\" Mr Williams said.\"But he has had immigration issues. Sometimes we make it difficult for people to invest in this country. It is a shame.\"For the past 18 months, Mr Alldredge has tried to manage the store from America but the shattering of a glass panel in the building \u0026ndash understood to be leased \u0026ndash was the final straw at the beginning of June.\"Fortunately, no one was hurt,\" Mr Williams said.\u0026nbsp\"In our 18-year history, we have never closed a store apart from relocation so it is sad that after the roof \u0026lsquoexploded\u0026rsquo \u0026ndash which was a glass entrance, leaving a very dangerous situation with other panels \u0026ndash Jack decided to call it a day.\"\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspMr Williams said he was disappointed for Mr Alldredge as well as the store\u0027 three employees including a manager.As the store was operated as a franchise, Ableworld is not obliged to step in but it is aiming to honour commitments to suppliers and customers.\"Although saddened by the situation, Ableworld will ensure that all suppliers of stock to the company will not lose out and either Highland Mobility (Ableworld Inverness) will settle all accounts or Ableworld UK will satisfy all the suppliers,\" Mr Williams said.\"Also no customer will lose out on their present deposits or product delivery of orders.\"Ableworld will be setting up support networks for past customers of products and writing to customers explaining the situation.\"Too many businesses in our industry and others pull the plug and leave their customers and suppliers high and dry which is something we will not do.\"He also revealed the company was actively looking to open another franchise in the Inverness area.Inverness MP Drew Hendry said the store\u0027 closure would be a great loss to many disabled people. Citing the high-profile case of city guesthouse owners Russell and Ellen Felber who are fighting deportation to America, Mr Hendry said this was another example of how immigration policies were not working.\u0026nbsp\"I am already working with countless other local families facing a similar fate, including the Felbers whose ongoing battle to stay in Inverness is utterly heart-breaking,\" Mr Hendry said.Inverness disability rights campaigner David Sansum said there were few mobility aid suppliers in the city while the next nearest store was about 40 miles away in Forres.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\"I\u0026rsquom sure the closure of Ableworld will leave a big gap,\" he said. \"It is shame.\"\u0026nbspIn recent months, there have been a spate of incidents at Inverness retail parks where glass panels have fallen from overhead canopies.In March, Highland Council urged building owners with glazed canopies to check adequate inspection and maintenance arrangements were in place while Inverness South councillor Ken Gowans called for glass panels to be removed from canopies at all the city\u0027 retail parks.Saturday 7 Jul 2018 6:40 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/01828000/01828031.jpg","title":"Druim Ba wind farm rejected","story":"Plans for 10 turbines at Druim Ba between Kiltarlity and Abriachan have been rejected today by the Scottish Government after a second public inquiry.\u0026nbspGeneral wind farm campaigner Lyndsey Ward was \"delighted\"She said: \"The community has had seven years of wind farm developers trying to get a wind farm in that area.

He also said more needed to be done if city drivers were going to notice any significant difference.\"The fact the council is now looking to repair roads within the city is a start, but there are a lot of routes \u0026ndash particularly in areas such as Hilton and Lochardil \u0026ndash which are still very bad,\" he told the Courier.\"The roads budget is woefully inadequate.

first team.All of that money will be channelled back into manager Derek McInnes’ bid to bring success to Pittodrie both domestically and in Europe.AberDNA was launched in March this year and almost 5,500 fans have signed up to the initiative.The Evening Express can reveal the cash raised – with more than £1m gross taken in.Aberdeen have had a bid of around £500,000 turned down for Doncaster Rovers striker John Marquis.The Dons will have to shell out more than half-a-million to land Marquis even though Peterborough, who also had a bid rejected, are understood to be out of the race for the 26-year-old.The Reds have already splashed out £200,000 to land midfield playmaker Chris Forrester from Posh.On AberDNA, Milne, said: “Gross we have raised just over £1 million.“But there are obviously costs associated with that.“We lose 20% in VAT straight away.“There is the cost of running the team that is doing the selling job.“Then there is the cost of the products that are part of the DNA.“However, it will leave a sizeable chunk of money that will be fed into the football operation.“It will be in excess of half a million.“We would hope it would be on the right side of £600,000.”The entirely voluntary AberDNA scheme will continue to raise money to be funnelled into strengthening the team every season as the packages require monthly payments.There are four packages that come with various benefits – Premium (£18), Standard (£12), International (£18) and Under-12 (£8).Hearts run a similar scheme. Foundation of Hearts has more than 8,000 members and has raised more than £6.5 million.Hibs Supporters’ Limited has contributed £525,000 to the football budget.Milne said: “It has been a fantastic response from the fans and it just shows you the commitment out there from them.“Lots of them are buying season tickets and signing up for DNA.“It is a great initiative and will help strengthen that bond between the club and the fans.“It will enable the fans to feel that they are much more part of the club.“As time goes past that is something that can be developed even further.”Dons boss McInnes aims to strengthen his squad further before the Europa League second qualifying round first leg clash with Burnley on Thursday July 26.Doncaster’s stance is that Marquis is not for sale as he is the club’s leading scorer with40 goals in two seasons.He has two years left on his contract and sources indicate it would take a bid of close to £1m to test Doncaster’s resolve.That is likely to be far too rich for Aberdeen.McInnes has already introduced three new signings for the new campaign with Forrester, Republic of Ireland international Stephen Gleeson and teenage midfielder Lewis Ferguson.A training compensation fee has yet to be agreed between Aberdeen and Ferguson’s former club Hamilton.The Reds have offered in excess of £100,000 while Accies are understood to value the 18-year-old at around £900,000.The matter is set to go to an SPFL tribunal with a date still to be set.Aberdeen are confident the final figure will be close to their valuation.McInnes is also in the hunt for defensive cover before the start of the season that kicks off with the Euro clash with Burnley.Aberdeen then face Rangers in a Premiership opener on August 5 that will mark the domestic debut of new Ibrox boss Steven Gerrard.Milne said: “We know it is going to be a very challenging league this year.“Rangers are upping their game, Hearts have brought in a lot of new players and I have no doubt once Hibs get going there will be plenty of new players coming in there.“I do think it will be a very competitive league.“We have never had a period since Fergie left where we have effectively delivered so many second-placed finishes.“That is how close we have been for the last five years which is great testament to Derek and his backroom team and the players.“We still have the core of the players that will be part of that this coming season.“It is going to be a big challenge.”With such a competitive Premiership expected will there be recognition of that in McInnes’ budget?“Very much so,” said Milne. “Since Derek joined the club it has been part of growing the budget every year.“We have done various things over the years to help us generate additional cash.“Last year we got the Granite Club operating and this year we have the DNA membership scheme up and running.“The bulk of that additional cash we are trying to feed into the football budget.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"aberdeen for all","story":"\t\t\t\t\tFor defender Andy Considine the Dons are a team for the working class and every supporter, regardless of financial situation, should be able to see them in action.Although it’s the Oil Capital of Europe, the 30-year-old acknowledges there are many within the Granite City who are struggling with poverty.The economic downturn has hit the city hard and for some watching the Dons at Pittodrie is not a possibility.Which is why Considine is fully behind the club’s innovative Aberdeen for All scheme, which provides the use of season tickets to the most deserving in the community.Working alongside parent charity Aberdeen FC Community Trust, the Dons will identify families and individuals who will benefit most from the initiative.More than 500 season tickets were issued through Aberdeen for All last season and that is set to rise in the upcoming campaign following the donation of sponsors.Considine, who is set to face St Johnstone in a friendly in Perth tomorrow, said: “Aberdeen is a working-class city and football is a working-class game.“It has always been that way.Regardless of your situation you should be able to come and watch football.“This is a fantastic gesture from everyone involved.“Aberdeen has the oil but that has taken a huge hit over the last couple of years.“This can make a difference for many kids as it offers them the chance to come to a game on a Saturday.”Following Aberdeen’s 2-1 European Cup Winners’ Cup final win over Real Madrid in 1983, Bernabeu legend Alfredo Di Stefano, then Real manager, said “Aberdeen have what money can’t buy – a soul, a team spirit built in a family tradition.”For Considine that philosophy remains at the heart of the club which is why social inclusion for all is so fundamental to the Reds.A product of the Pittodrie youth system, he said: “Aberdeen have always had that family tradition.“This keeps everyone even closer as a community.“To see the smiles on young kids’ faces when they come to watch the football and watch potentially their idols, it is priceless.“It is a great experience for them and it might spur some of them on to become footballers like ourselves.“For a club like Aberdeen that relies on young people coming through the youth system to break into the first team, regardless of whether you have a bit of money or not, you should still be able to have that chance. You should still be able to have that opportunity to make it in football or any sport regardless of your situation.“This type of scheme is potentially getting people on that right track.”Following sponsorship from Aberdeen-based companies, the Dons will be able to reach more deserving families and local community groups via the scheme. The companies are Swire Oilfield Services, Burness \u0026amp Paull, Aberdeen Standard Investments and Simmons \u0026amp Co International.The initiative is also supported by Stewart Milne Group and the Cormack Foundations.Aberdeen FC Community Trust (AFCCT) already work with many charities and organisations throughout the city to provide support and opportunities.Considine believes there is a social responsibility for the Reds above and beyond what they do on the pitch.Asked if this expanded as far as donating to food banks he said: “There is one out at Banchory my wife and I have donated at a couple of times. I am sure there are plenty of others who have as well at Aberdeen.“People should be supporting these things.”Aberdeen For All is aimed at individuals in the local community who are in need due to a number of reasons such as social exclusion, financial hardship or other disadvantages.Ally Prockter, chief executive of AFC Community Trust said: “AFCCT is delighted to be working closely with Aberdeen FC in relation to their Aberdeen For All initiative.“Social inclusion is a serious challenge which can be overcome in many ways, and for many people it is important they feel as if they are part of something bigger.“Providing AFC match tickets to those who otherwise cannot attend home games is an important step towards making people feel included in our local community.“We work closely with the club and its sponsors to identify individuals and organisations who can benefit from becoming part of the Aberdeen FC family.’Barry Douglas, Seaton Community Church pastor, is delighted to see a scheme supporting those most in need in the local community.Douglas said: “The people this scheme is helping out are from under-privileged backgrounds and who would not normally have access to football.“You really get to see the joy being brought out in them when they receive their tickets.“The tickets I have distributed so far have gone to families who will get a huge uplift from them.“There are more out there who could benefit from this scheme, so I hope it’s a great success.’\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"action over terrifying speed of motorists near to school","story":"\t\t\t\t\tNew measures are to be introduced outside a north-east school after residents complained about motorists driving at “terrifying” speeds.Kintore and District Community Council raised the issue of speeding on the 20mph School Road next to Kintore School at its recent meeting.Now, Aberdeenshire Council says it has taken notice of the community council’s concerns and will take action in the coming weeks.Community council chairwoman Fiona Cooper said: “Some of the drivers on that road are going at a terrifying speed.“Often, it is parents who are going at these speeds, which is a huge concern for us. It’s something that we are absolutely looking into and taking very seriously.“Although the schools are out for summer, we will be picking up this issue when they are back.”Fellow community council member Ken McEwan said: “The community is very disappointed that this is an issue we are facing. By speeding, you are putting the lives of children in danger.”Residents are looking at a number of ways in which the issue of speeding can be addressed.Mr McEwan said: “Various suggestions were mentioned as to how to deter speeding drivers. One is that the current zebra crossing on the road is not clear enough.“It still uses the old Belisha beacons, which are not particularly bright.”Local PC Steven Middleton said: “We work closely with people living in our local communities to make the areas they live in safer places to live and work, so when concerns are raised they are taken seriously.”An Aberdeenshire Council spokesman said: “We have considered the issues raised by the community council and are planning a number of improvements as a result. We will install LED lights at the zebra crossing near Kintore School to make it more visible and hope to do this over the coming weeks.“We will also check the automatic speed limit sign and are also looking to carry out speed monitoring of the area.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/07/5b40a0329f41b-938x564.jpg ","title":"community joins together to say goodbye to popular city school","story":"\t\t\t\t\tStaff have bid a fond farewell to a beloved city school as it closed its doors for the last time after more than 90 years.In an emotional address, Torry Academy head teacher Jenny Cranna brought the community together for the closure of the historic school.With some tears, cheers and a twist of the key, Jenny locked the doors for the final time.The school, which opened in 1927, closed to pupils on Wednesday, but was open to staff for the remainder of the week.After 30 years at Torry Academy, Jenny said: “It’s been a very emotional week especially for the build-up of when the doors would close for the final time.“I think today has proved that we’re just one Torry family and that we all support each other through the happy times and the sad times.“We just encourage and support the unity of Torry.“The numbers are fantastic of those who turned out and people of all ages.“There is something very special about Torry and the community that gets under your skin.“The school and community has been so much a part of my life, it holds a special place in my heart. Even once the school closes, the feelings that I have will continue for the rest of my days.”And former pupil Rhonda Scott was in the crowd.The 54-year-old alumni said: “I started Torry in 1976 and the first thing I remember about Torry is the music and the happiness.“It’s more than a school – it’s a family.“The staff and the way they are with the children and the support that they get.“I’m a teacher and I’ve taught at lots of schools and I also taught here.“This is the best school I have ever taught at – never mind being a pupil.“There’s nothing like that and you don’t understand until you come here.”The school commissioned a commemorative tree sculpture to recognise its role in the Torry community over the last 10 decades.The site will also retain its educational purpose with the construction of a new primary school which will include early learning and childcare facilities and a community hub.John Wheeler, education operational delivery convener, said: “I am delighted to see so many people turn up and it speaks volumes of the impact the school has had on the local community.“I hope that sense of community has a positive future in the new Lochside Academy and carries over.”Kincorth Academy, which closed on Wednesday, marked its closure with an open day for former pupils and staff.Pupils and staff from Torry and Kincorth will start at the new £47 million Lochside Academy on August 23.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"crew deals with blaze at aberdeen golf course","story":"\t\t\t\t\tFour firefighters have dealt with a blaze at an Aberdeen golf course.The alarm was raised shortly before midnight last night at the Kings Links Golf Course near Aberdeen beach.One unit was sent from the central station to deal with the incident.A spokeswoman for the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service said: \u0026#8220We received the call at 11.53pm about a small fire at the Kings Links Golf Course.\u0026#8220We had one appliance in attendance with four firefighters in total.\u0026#8220It was a small fire around 15 metres by 10 metres.\u0026#8220The stop message was received at 12.15am.\u0026#8221\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dean meets up with old friend prince harry and has a ball","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA record-breaking cyclist from the city has spoken of his pride after his pal Prince Harry attended a ball held in his honour.Former special forces soldier Dean Stott grabbed headlines around the world in May when he became the fastest man to cycle the length of the Americas – the equivalent of cycling from Aberdeen to Bangkok and back in just 99 days.Dean, 41, of Peterculter, was the guest of honour at the glitzy Wheels Down Ball at St James’s Place.Before the black-tie dinner, world record breaker Dean had raised more than £500,000 for eight mental health charities – and the success of the ball has taken the total past the £700,000 mark.The showpiece of the ball was a round table chat hosted by TV presenter Martin Bayfield, in which Dean and the Duke of Sussex – pals from when they were in the Armed Forces – chatted about their friendship and Dean’s achievement.\u0026mdash Alison Baum OBE (@AlisonBaum) July 4, 2018Dean said: “It was a very proud moment for me, to have the support of so many people.“I’ve known Harry for 11 years and we speak often – the last time I’d seen him was his wedding and he had other things to be preoccupied with on that day.”Father-of-two Dean said the Duke of Sussex had commented on the amount of weight he had lost during the 13,670-mile cycle ride along the Pan American Highway from Argentina to Alaska.He added: “It was a fun night and all the better because the setting was so intimate. It was also a pleasure to have Martin there.“It’s important that we keep the conversations about mental health going, and I am pleased with how the evening went.”Among the guests were representatives of NXg Drilling Services and asset management firm Infinity Partners, both of which are based in Aberdeen.Dean, who met Prince Harry when they were partnered during military training, had to leave the military when a parachuting injury left him unable to run.Afterwards, Dean took up cycling and it was a chat with Harry that inspired him to take on the Pan American Highway challenge.The quest began in February at the southern tip of South America, in Ushuaia, Argentina, and took in 13 countries. Along the way, Dean battled harsh winds, multiple collisions, bouts of food poisoning and even a run-in with a polar bear.Dean’s wife, Alana, said: “It was a fitting night at the Wheels Down Ball in many ways because the challenge was two years in the making and we’ve been in it as a family.“Our youngest child, Tommy, is now two and when we began planning the challenge he was still in my belly, and he got the chance to go up on the stage on the night.“We are both pleased that people are feeling more comfortable having conversations about mental health and the superb work the eight charities do in supporting that is to be commended.”The eight charities, which come under the Heads Together umbrella, are: Anna Freud National Centre for Children and Families, Best Beginnings, Calm, Contact, Mind, Place2Be, the Mix and Young Minds.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"government backed loan helped city shop","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThe owner of a popular Aberdeen eatery told how a government-backed programme helped her start her career.The business is one of the 3,100 in Scotland that has received a loan from the government-backed Start Up Loans Company.Mechelle Clark, founder of Melt Aberdeen on Holburn Street, received a low-interest loan of £20,000 to set up her own business.After being made redundant twice in the same year from the oil and gas industry, Mechelle now generates a £130,000 turnover and has plans to open a second store this year.She said: “I’ve always had a passion for cooking, and after being made redundant and attending up to 60 job interviews, I decided enough was enough and it was time to set up my open business doing what I love.“There have been challenges along the way, such as the collapse of the local economy hit by the struggling oil and gas industry, but the financial backing I received from the Start Up Loans Company has helped my business grow.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"joy and relief as six mile part of bypass gets ready to open","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThe imminent opening of a six-mile stretch of the Aberdeen bypass has been greeted with joy and relief.A new temporary road order has been published which will allow for the Balmedie to Tipperty section of the Aberdeen Western Peripheral Route (AWPR) to open in the coming weeks.The order allows contractor Aberdeen Roads Limited (ARL) to apply for a reduced speed on slip roads at nearby junctions and allow for final preparation works.Six miles of dual carriageway will be opened between Balmedie and Bridgend, as well as improvements made to the existing route between Balmedie and Blackdog.Douglas Laird, Transport Scotland project manager, said: “We said we would work with ARL to open new sections of road to bring the benefits of the project to people as soon as possible and practicable.“The publication of the road order is a significant step towards opening the upgraded section of A90 between Balmedie and Tipperty.“While we will only know the exact date when final works and safety inspections are fully complete, this milestone allows the contractor to start the necessary finishing works and certainly signals we’re in the home stretch.“We expect to announce more details in due course.“As always, we thank local communities, road users and businesses from across the north-east for their patience during these works.”The opening has been welcomed by local politicians.Richard Thomson, who represents Ellon and District at Aberdeenshire Council, said: “This is very good news and a real step forward for the project.

Instead, she was taken by medical taxi last Saturday to Stavanger Airport and boarded a private medical aircraft – staffed by a doctor and nurse.She was then taken from Aberdeen International Airport to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary before being allowed to return to her Sheddocksley home on Tuesday after undergoing surgery to correct a problem in a device that regulates her heartbeat.Mrs Kirkton said: “I’m chuffed to be home and that the doctors have done such a good job in Aberdeen.“It was quite an adventure to have my own private plane to get home – that’s another thing ticked off the bucket list.”She added: “I’m grateful to the Evening Express for getting involved and helping to sort it all out.

Now scientists from the University of Aberdeen have added a third species to the mix \u0026#8211 the European pine marten. These native squirrel predators are recolonising Britain after years of persecution, and so the scientists set out to uncover the impact of this on red and grey squirrel populations.Three study sites in Scotland were in the Highlands (marten recolonisation for over 45 years, no grey squirrels), Central Scotland (marten recolonisation for 8-14 years, grey squirrels since 1945) and the Borders (early stages of marten recolonization, grey squirrels since 1980).Populations were monitored for five months using cameras and multi-species feeders \u0026#8211 the latter with glue strips on the underside of the lid to obtain visitor hair samples. This material provided DNA to determine visitor species and identify individual martens.The results showed that while red squirrels avoided feeders used by martens, greys were equally likely to use feeders whether frequented by martens or not. So grey squirrel numbers were reduced where exposure to pine martens was high, whereas numbers of red squirrels increased – unequivocal evidence that recovering marten numbers affect competition between red and grey squirrels.This finding is likely explained by the fact that reds, having co-evolved with martens, instinctively avoid areas used by martens but invasive greys, having no such instincts, showed no avoidance behaviour at all.Since pine martens’ range is increasing and extending southwards, scientists are optimistic that this will control the invasive grey squirrel species.As they say in the title to their report, in this case ‘the enemy of my enemy is my friend’.PIC:The native grey squirrel may have an unlikely ally.

We simply don\u0026#8217t have enough children playing shinty in each school to make up separate clubs.Surely, in 2018, this shouldn\u0026#8217t be allowed to happen?It is only three clubs that are being affected by this, and they\u0026#8217re all in the south of Scotland,  half way through a season, leaving all our kids devastated at the though of losing their chosen sport.My son has been playing shinty since Primary One. He is now heading into Primary Four and is even more passionate about the sport. He enjoys quality team time, striving to be the best he can and just loving playing the game.It\u0026#8217s very difficult to explain something like this to an eight-year-old child, never mind the Primary One children we have in our club.One quote from a child was: \u0026#8216Everyone is going to be so sad if we don\u0026#8217t have shinty. Why would shinty people do this to us?\u0026#8217It\u0026#8217s a very sad day indeed for the children of Argyll and Bute who are simply being punished for what school they go to and where they live. We have to stand together and fight for our club and our children.The Camanachd Association needs to step up and find a solution to allow all children to compete nationally and stand as one united shinty community.Ailsa and Alastair Crawford, LochgilpheadSir,The Camanachd Association has put politics before the needs of the children and the development of the sport in Argyll.The kids are disappointed and the coaches who have worked tirelessly to set the club up are deflated. Surely the association knows this is a mistake that needs rectified immediately.Personally, Kilmory and Dunadd children\u0026#8217s club has inspired our son and daughter to get involved with the sport and to grow in confidence amongst other like-minded children.Stuart and Simone Charnock, LochgilpheadSir,My son has trained with Kilmory/Dunadd shinty club since he was in Primary One. The club has always treated the kids equally and welcomed all kids to participate.After years of hard work, the team was progressing well and was worthy of competing at national level.In his last year before high school, to be told he is no longer allowed to play is not only devastating to my son but greatly confusing and he is left wondering what he has done wrong.I fail to see how this can be classed as progress by the Camanachd Association. This needs to be readdressed to allow kids to compete in the game they love.Susan Jackson, LochgilpheadI was very angry to hear from local residents in Portnahaven that their recycling bins have been used by numerous motorhomes for disposing of general waste, including food waste.I have visited the recycling bins site in Portnahaven and spoken to my constituents in person about this and I can confirm that unfortunately Portnahaven\u0026#8217s recycling bins are full of general waste.This is as unacceptable as it is disrespectful. I have contacted the appropriate department with the council and asked for an investigation to be done. I also asked for some addition signage for the bins area.I made it very clear that my constituents should not lose their recycling facilities as a result of their bins being misused by someone else.I will continue to monitor this situation and provide an update as soon as I have more information.Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,It is fitting to mark this Diabetes Week (June 11-17) for Scotland’s 30,000 adults and children living with type one diabetes by noting that life-changing monitors are now available on the NHS.A child diagnosed with type one diabetes at five faces 50,000 finger prick blood glucose tests by the time they are 18.Each painful finger prick is part of a daily routine which also includes calculating carbohydrate intake and frequent insulin injections, all to prevent life-threatening hypoglycaemia and long term complications.But since November last year, a \u0026#8216flash glucose monitoring\u0026#8217 system called the Freestyle Libre can be prescribed by local GPs, offering an alternative to such intensive finger-pricking.The roll out of flash glucose monitoring, which gives a reading via a simple sensor, however, is not consistent across all local health boards. So, our message for Diabetes Week is to call for health boards in Scotland to speed up prescription policies and step up much needed prescriptions.As someone who has lived with type one diabetes for 21 years, new technology, such as the FreeStyle Libre, makes a world of difference.Type one diabetes cannot be prevented and until we find the cure for it, research and technology are vital.Holly Davies, development manager, Aberdeen\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"a poignant prizegiving for tarbert afc","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 20/06/18, 6:08 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowTarbert AFC’s annual football dance was held on Saturday June 16 in the Islay Frigate Hotel.Players and their partners were joined by the wider circle of people who are involved with the club.This annual dinner dance is also the end of season awards presentation.Nikki MacDougall took home awards for Top Goal Scorer and Referees\u0026#8217 Player of the Year.

This could threaten future trade deals, environmental standards and food safety.The Tories think they can do whatever they want to Scotland and get away with it.The SNP tabled amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill to safeguard the Scottish Parliament from the threat of constraints on existing powers.This is something which Holyrood refused consent for last month by an overwhelming majority including all parties, except the Scottish Conservatives.It would simply be a democratic outrage and it would fly in the face of the fundamental principles of devolution. This Conservative government seems determined to destroy the founding principles of devolution and Labour and the Lib Dems must join us in defending it.Brendan O’Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.Sir,It seems that almost every day I\u0026#8217m contacted by farmers in my constituency with concerns about their future.This is hardly surprising as farmers are borrowing more and having to pay staff less, according to figures released by the Scottish Government.According to ‘Agricultural Facts and Figures’ published recently, agricultural borrowing has doubled in the last 10 years, capital investment has stayed the same and agricultural workers are earning £1,560 less on average compared to last year.The figures show farm borrowing has almost doubled from £1.38 billion to £2.28 billion between 2007 to 2017, while capital investment has stayed the same at £210 million.This demonstrates that farmers are investing much less in their machinery and equipment while still having to borrow ever-increasing sums to remain viable.This is on top of the fact farmers are still struggling with debts they incurred as a result the CAP payment fiasco caused by the SNP Government several years ago.Time and time again the separatists have shown complete disregard to the plight that our hard pressed farmers are facing. It seems our agricultural industry is just one more sector that is ignored by the separatists in their relentless push for a second independence referendum.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Claims by Theresa May that a so-called ‘Brexit dividend’ will help pay for a boost to NHS spending in England worth £20 billion a year within five years are highly disingenuous.The UK will continue to pay into the EU through the transition until the end of 2020 and will pay £20 billion of the \u0026#8216divorce bill\u0026#8217 through to 2028. In addition, the UK Government has committed to keep EU funding for agricultural subsidies, research and development and other key areas at the same level in the short-term.These are set figures so it will be at least 10 years before any so-called ‘Brexit dividend’, if it were ever to materialise, is to be realised. Add to that, if the Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts are accurate, public finances are set to be £15 billion a year worse off by 2021, equivalent to £300 million a week.Interestingly, if taxes are set to rise, which they will clearly have to, it is staggering hypocrisy for the Tories to have attacked the Scottish Government’s boosting of the NHS in Scotland through progressive tax changes and then look to hike taxes themselves.Alex Orr, Edinburgh.Sir,Local government spending cuts have left councils in Scotland unable to meet the needs of local communities and, in some cases, are putting the public at risk.A survey of more than 2,000 local government employees working across all services reveals almost eight in 10 council workers have no confidence in the future of local services and half are thinking of leaving their jobs for less stressful work elsewhere.While local authorities have protected spending on statutory service areas such as adult and children’s social care, the amount they spend on other areas including parks and libraries has fallen sharply.Local authorities have had to cut so many vital services that they have now reached a point where vulnerable children and the elderly struggle to get the help that they need, entire communities are suffering and the public is being put at risk.There have been cuts to road and bridge maintenance, potholes in roads are left unfilled and bridges are at risk of crumbling. Crematoriums are not maintained, streetlights stay broken and parks are in disrepair as councils don’t have the equipment or the staff to adequately maintain them.There are now more than one million people with an unmet need for social care because councils do not have the resources to support them. Now is the time to reverse these cuts and invest in local government once more or the fabric of our society will come unstuck.Mark Ferguson, chairman, UNISON Scotland local government committee.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 24/06/18, 3:39 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.There is no denying Lochgilphead could benefit from a wash and brush up.

However, the away team were really up against it from the start. The Ardnamurchan ladies were clearly also up for the game and had a full squad to choose from. With some key players out and one new player making her debut, the nine player squad from Dunadd started strongly. They had several early chances but just couldn\u0026#8217t find the back of the net.There were some crunching tackles and tasty challenges in the first half the Ardnamurchan ladies were keen to neutralise the strength of Dunadd defender Iona McCulloch, often doubling up on her. Referee Beth MacDonald had her work cut out trying to contain tempers as tensions ran high both on and off the pitch.The first half ended 0-0 and Dunadd left the field feeling like they hadn\u0026#8217t performed to their usual high standards. After a rousing half time team talk, Dunadd were keen to get an early goal in the second half to help settle them and to perhaps go on and build from there.And that is exactly what they did. Straight from the throw up, Grace Drummond caught the ball cleanly, sending it sailing over the defence\u0026#8217s heads. Leone Airlie ran on to it and struck it smoothly, low beyond the keeper.However, the home team responded positively and had Dunadd pinned back in their own half for the next five minutes. On 40 minutes, a fortunate strike from wide left bounced past a few players and found it\u0026#8217s way into the corner of the Dunadd net, 1-1.Dunadd were not despondent and regrouped to press again. However, minutes later Ardnamurchan broke and finished well making it 2-1.Again the referee had to step in to break up some fierce challenges as Ardnamurchan continued to goad McCulloch. However, the young Dunadd defender answered the contentious tackles in the best possible way. In the 51st minute she collected a loose ball and broke away from her marker. After dodging past three players she shot high and scored a certain goal of the season contender, pinging it sweetly into the top corner.The remainder of the game saw both teams coming close to winners. Ellie Hetherington making some crucial blocks and tackles, clearing the ball to safety time and time again. Dunadd held on to grind out the result and retain their unbeaten record and hold on to top spot in south division two.After a summer break, Dunadd will travel to third placed GMA on Sunday August 5 in another crucial game as they search to get back to winning ways.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"its gonna be a close shave gavin","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 29/06/18, 7:01 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowIt\u0026#8217s been eight months in the making, but it\u0026#8217s getting hairy now.The razors, however, will soon sort that out for Gavin Allan.He has been growing his flowing locks and bushy beard since October last year, but Gavin will be shorn for charity on Saturday June 30.Gavin\u0026#8217s head and beard shave is being carried out in aid of Motor Neurone Disease (MND) research and the Doddie Weir Foundation.Former Scottish rugby international lock forward Doddie Weir revealed in June 2017 he was suffering from MND, a degenerative condition affecting the nerves in the brain and spinal cord that tell your muscles what to do.

The A team finished only half a second ahead of the B team in the 4 x 100 metres relay. The B team consisted of Maisie Gilmour and Jodie Allan from Ardrishaig, Sophie Balkeen from Lochgair and Erin Naisby from Furnace.The girls contest was won by Law and District.This national competition was a great experience, not just for the young athletes competing in the big arena, but also for the supportive parents who provided transport on the day.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dust flies in cracking argyll rally","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 05/07/18, 12:07 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.The Dunoon Presents Rally on June 23 saw the Scottish Rally Championship roll into town and 58 top-spec cars and crews take to the stages.Dust flew in dry conditions up in the hills of Cowal as drivers tested their skills among forestry roads in what turned out to be an excellent rally.The route this year was slightly different, with two new stages added to a schedule which saw the cars cover each of the four stages twice through the day with two service stops at Dunoon Stadium along the way.There were a few well known Argyll faces out there, with mixed fortunes on the day.Douglas Watt from Furnace managed to rebuild his Escort after its small excursion on the Scottish Rally in May and he was out again, hoping for better luck and a finish for he and his co-driver, Mark Grierson. The pair were steady, neat and quick all day and broke the timing beam on stage eight, Bishop\u0026#8217s Glen, to complete the rally in 23rd overall and third in class four.Everything finally came together and the car and crew got the result they deserve. The collective sigh of relief could be heard in body shops and garages all across the land, with annual leave in  most of them on hold until Douglas\u0026#8217s result came in.Duncan MacLean and Ian Parker were out in the mighty Peugeot 106 once more and were having a decent day, with a few hairy moments when the intercom wasn\u0026#8217t working (or so Duncan tells it) and unfortunately breaking a gearbox mount which, though fixed between stages, saw them over their time limit and out of the rally.Mull ace Ally Currie and his Oban co-driver Grant MacNiven continued to chase the bigger more powerful machinery in his 150bhp Fiesta and was sitting third in the 2WD section when a problem that they had been experiencing for most of the day became worse \u0026#8211 and the passenger side front wheel decided to part company on the approach to the start line of stage seven.The family duo of Cara and Donald MacNeill made a welcome return to the stages, in new machinery this time, debuting their Subaru Impreza and bringing it home in one piece in 31st overall and second in class nine.Mull\u0026#8217s James Campbell and Claire Tilley also got their Mitsubishi Evo to the finish and will be happy with the result.The event was won by Kilmarnock\u0026#8217s Andrew Gallagher with Jane Nicol on the notes in the CobbleShop Ford Focus WRC.The next rally action for Argyll is the Mach 1 Stages on the weekend of July 14/15 at Machrihanish.\u0026nbspPICS:Photographs by West Coast PhotosAlly Currie and Grant MacNiven blasted it while their Fiesta was still on four wheels. no_a27ArgyllRally01no_a27ArgyllRally02Overall Winners Andrew Gallagher and Jane Nicol in their Ford Focus. no_a27ArgyllRally03Donald MacNeill from Furnace and Cara MacNeill, Glasgow, make light work of the hairpin in their Subaru.  no_a27ArgyllRally04James Campbell and Claire Tilley from Mull in their Mitsubishi. no_a27ArgyllRally05Kicking up dust in their Peogeot 106 are Lochgilphead team Duncan MacLean and Ian Parker. no_a27ArgyllRally06\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"tarbert expects no sewage running down streets","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 05/07/18, 2:18 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe reason for raw sewage running down Tarbert’s streets is under investigation.On Thursday June 28,  sewage was seen bubbling up through drain covers and running along the kerbsides on Harbour  Street.The cause of the discharge is as yet unknown, but investigations are under way.A Scottish Water spokesman said: \u0026#8216Our sewer response team carried out an investigation after reports of a discharge at a surface water pipe at this location.‘This involved using CCTV cameras to try and ascertain what caused this discharge.

I am still receiving many justifiable complaints about the terrible condition of Mansefield Road in Port Ellen and the hospital road in Bowmore. With long overdue road works going on across Islay and the rest of the Kintyre and Islands ward, it\u0026#8217s only fair these roads are not ignored.The poor condition of the Bruichladdich toilets continues to be raised by local residents.Since contacting the appropriate department I have been informed repairs and maintenance are planned for them.While checking on the progress of pothole repairs I had previously requested, I noticed some of the recent street light repairs leave a lot to be desired. While a quick fix is better than nothing, many of these short-term fixes need to be looked at again.I have been speaking to the BT Openreach staff across Islay who are expanding our island\u0026#8217s internet capabilities. I have contacted BT to make sure recent issues with phone lines in some local households are not a result of the broadband upgrades.There has been progress with local housing associations after pointing out many of their tenants are having trouble with mould in their housing. Measures are now being implemented to to rectify the problem. I was happy to hear Argyll Community Housing Association has fixed gate latches on four of its houses at Cnoc Na Faire in Port Ellen after I raised this with them a few weeks ago.I met with environment, development and infrastructure committee member councillor Gary Mulvaney about Kintyre and Islands\u0026#8217 crumbling infrastructure, alongside our growing industrial output with the success of distilleries on Islay and Jura.Later that day I spoke directly to my constituents in Tarbert after a number of locals \u0026#8211 some business owners \u0026#8211 contacted me about the recent flood of sewage on Harbour Street as a result of blocked drains. Scottish Water were coming under fire from locals because of its slow progress on the matter.I made my anger about the poor conditions in Tarbert very clear when I contacted Scottish Water. A long-term solution to needs to be put in place.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Scottish Water is asking customers to use water wisely in their daily activities to help maintain supplies during the current hot summer weather.Following a sustained dry period without any significant rainfall, customer use has increased significantly.In some areas, there has been a 30 per cent increase in demand for water and an additional 140 million litres are currently being produced and pushed through the system every day.The situation is being monitored closely to manage supplies across the country.This includes deploying additional resources to move water between distribution areas and tankering water to supplement local networks.Average reservoir levels are generally normal for this time of year but the current level of use and continuing dry weather means stocks of stored water available for use are reducing.Try to reduce use wherever possible.Businesses are also being asked to consider their use and how they can use water more efficiently.Simple, practical steps include: taking shorter showers, using a watering can rather than a hose to water plants, using a bucket rather than a hose to wash vehicles only washing windscreens/lights instead of the whole vehicle, turning off taps whenever possible and use washing machines and dishwashers fully loaded.More advice on using water wisely is online at www.scottishwater/savewaterscotland or call 0800 0778778.Peter Farrer, Chief Operating Officer, Scottish Water.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"riverside fun day sparkles in the sun","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 06/07/18, 9:44 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe sun shone on the Riverside in Lochgilphead for a day of fun.Mid Argyll Community Pool and Riverside Rascals nursery hosted the family day on Sunday July 1, featuring a variety of colourful craft and charity stalls.The unmistakeable aroma of barbecue wafted across the car park from Riverside Rascals nursery, which opened its doors to the public for the occasion, complete with children\u0026#8217s activities.MACPool lifeguards were on hand to keep an eye on the youngsters in the pedal boats while the sunshine glistened across the splashing fun.PICS:Four-year-old Kaiden Abel from Lochgilphead has fun splashing in the inflatable outdoor pool. 06_a27RiversideFun01Kyra Robertson, aged 11, from Cairnbaan, tries to hook a duck on the MS centre stand \u0026#8211 and it\u0026#8217s not as easy as it looks. 06_a27RiversideFun04On the MS Centre Mid Argyll stall were Maggie Dodd and centre manager Karen McCurry. 06_a27RiversideFun07Mary Stewart of the Loch Awe Pottery helps sisters Abby and Chloe McCallum, from Glasgow, to decorate their pottery. 06_a27RiversideFun08Cathleen MacDonald was there with her Woolly Bobbins textile-base crafts. 06_a27RiversideFun09Alongside Cathleen was her mum Margaret Davidson, who creates soft toys under the name Twisted Yarn.

Isabelle Cairns, of Ayr, has hit out at the amount of rubbish being left on the beach. And the Financial Adviser feels that the council could do more. Isabelle said: “There are two beaches here, one part gets cleaned and one doesn’t. “Between Doonfoot side and the Pavillion is generally clean. “But the rest is neglected. “There was a petition signed about this and the fact the council have stopped cleaning parts of the beach. “There are plastic bottles all over the place, I even saw dirty nappies lying. “I get that it costs a lot of money to get staff out, but there are other options for the council.  “They could get community workers in, the ones who are serving community payback orders.” Isabelle claims that Ayr has little to offer outside the beach these days. She said: “What’s in Ayr now? It’s a ghost town. “There is not a lot about, but the beach is an attraction that brings in people from all over the country. “Walking along the beach seeing this mess was nothing short of disgusting. “It gets to me as it’s such a beautiful beach. “What you also have to think about is that all kinds of rubbish is going to be washed out to sea when the tide comes in.  “It’s just going to get even worse going forward as the schools are now off. “More people will be going to the beach and it’s just going to become an absolute travesty. “People have no respect for the beach, but the council should have someone cleaning up when it’s like that.” A council spokesman said: “We monitor our beaches closely and work within the national guidance and with available resources to keep our beaches looking their best, so they can be enjoyed by local people and visitors alike. “We clean and litter-pick the full stretch of Ayr Beach and ask people to dispose of their waste in our bins rather than abandoning rubbish on the sand. “The section from Cromwell Road to the Pier is not routinely mechanically cleaned as it’s classed as an amenity beach rather than a recreational beach, but the stretch is still managed on a regular basis.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12863891.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/8898834.jpg","title":"full time ayr united can","story":"NewsFull-time Ayr United can make their Mark in Ladbrokes ChampionshipThe Honest Men were relegated at the first time of asking in the second tier in the 2016/17 season when they finished bottom with 33 points.\u0026nbspShareByLochlin Highet12:31, 6 JUL 2018NewsMark Roberts (Image: SNS Group)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMark Roberts insists that being full-time could make all the difference for Ayr United this time round in the Championship. The Honest Men were relegated at the first time of asking in the second tier in the 2016/17 season when they finished bottom with 33 points. But former Ayr hitman and manager, Roberts, reckons being part-time was what held them back. Marko, who played second tier football with Ayr under Brian Reid, said: “I think Ayr will be fine, I really do. “Being full-time in that league is a massive thing. “The last few times Ayr have been in that league it has been very difficult to compete with the full-time teams. “But the fact they have got that now will make a big difference and I don’t think they will have any issues staying in the league. “When I was there under Brian Reid, being part-time was what held us back. “You didn’t have enough time to go and work on things on a daily basis but Ayr will have that now.  “You can beat any team in a one-off game but over the course of a season of 36 games it’s difficult to compete. “But the fans should be excited this time as there should be no problem – Ayr can even start looking up rather than looking down.” Roberts, who hit the net 43 times for Ayr, was more than impressed with Ayr’s impressive goal-scoring form last season as they topped League One, pipping Raith on the final game of the season. He said: “I thought they were really good to watch. “You always thought they were going to score every game they played. “And I don’t mean just scoring one, you always thought they’d grab three or four. “Sometimes they were left open all over the park – but they had too much quality up front and that’s the reason they went up. “Fair play to them as they had three really good strikers in Shankland, Moore and Moffat.” Roberts added: “The way the league was won was certainly a bit of a way to win it.  “I’ve been in teams that have won titles and been promoted with five or six games to go, which gives you a great feeling of accomplishment, but there’s nothing more exciting than winning the title in the last 10 minutes of the season. “Both teams had the chance to run away with it but kept faltering.” Roberts managed Ayr for three years before getting sacked, He then had a player/coach role at Clyde for a season. He has now gone back to playing at Junior Cup finalists Hurlford United. But he insists that his managing days aren’t over.  He said: “I won’t give up on it, I just wanted to play again for now. The best days of your life are when you’re kicking a ball and I am still fit enough.  “Any manager who tells you they prefer coaching is talking rubbish. When you’re out there playing it’s  just great.  “I do want to get back to managing eventually though, but it’s all about finding the right club and what suits my life at the minute.” "},{"url":null,"title":"lane closure inspection station hotel","story":"NewsLane closure as inspection at Station HotelGable end of the building to be investigated\u0026nbspShareByGary Fanning17:58, 6 JUL 2018Updated18:03, 6 JUL 2018NewsFront entrance to Ayr railway station is blocked off (Image: Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailOne lane of the A70 will be shut off to allow for an inspecton of the gable wall of the Station Hotel just off Burns Statute Square. In order to carry out the inspection, one lane of the A70 which runs over the railway bridge towards Holmston Road and Station Road will be closed temporarily from tomorrow (7th July 2018). The section of the pavement which runs adjacent to the road will also be closed on a temporary basis. The inspection to assess the gable end will form part of the overall structural survey which the Council is undertaking to obtain a detailed report on the condition of the building. Trains are expected to run as normal, however the temporary pavement closure may affect passengers making their way to and from platform 4. Since the closure of the main entrance, some passengers have been using the pavement next to the A70 as an alternative route.

closed, listening to the soothing sounds of tranquil music, gently guided by their teacher as they breathe deeply, exhaling all worries away and their minds drift off\u0026hellip\nNow, I know you must be wondering, what on earth are they teaching at Peebles High School? What about prelims, exams, studying, grades?\nBut what do all these pressures bring to the fragile mind of a young person, and how do they process the stress to ensure their mental wellbeing?\nIn steps Suzi Gibson, who has been running mindful meditation sessions with Peebles High pupils as part of Health Week for the past five years.\nAnd so a group of pupils dropped their pencils, calculators and chemistry tools and walked through the doors of a more unique classroom setting, kicking off their school shoes and leaving their cares behind them as the lay in the comfort of Space 108 in Peebles.\nCan mindfulness meditation really help pupils concentrate amid the distractions of 21st century living?\nI decided to experience for myself the sessions offered freely to the pupils by Suzi, who guided sessions at the high school before opening her studio at Greenside, Peebles, in January 2016.\nAdmittedly I had always been a bit sceptical about meditation. I mean seriously, how can sitting on a floor in the lotus position, inhaling the pleasant oil aroma while the ambient sounds of dolphins singing and ocean waves crash, bring me peace of mind?\nI\u0026rsquom a wife, mother, writer, and like most people, my life is busy and my head is bursting with thoughts from which there\u0026rsquos no escape.\nBut I entered the beautiful airy studio with an open-mind and intrigued about the experiences of the pupils.\nOn this particular afternoon, I feel like I\u0026rsquove got the weight of the world on my shoulders. Thoughts are racing through my head like a train out of control. But immediately I feel a sense of calmness speaking to Suzi, as she explains the techniques she is using and gently guides me through the smooth ride to a quiet mind\u0026hellipand I am, going, going, gone\u0026hellip\nI am in a state of deep peace and the mind is calm, so much so, when I hear Suzi\u0026rsquos soft instruction to open my eyes \u0026ndash I don\u0026rsquot want to. I love it here.\nSo now I can see why meditation could potentially tackle a myriad of problems suffered by young students, including mental health. This is a growing problem in the Scottish Borders, with evidence suggesting almost 2,000 children and young people in the region will experience mental ill health at some point in their lives.\nThe sessions are offered to groups of pupils from S1 to S3, who arrive at the studio giggling with excitement and anticipation for their new experience.\nSuzi explained: \"There are some nerves and awareness of peers, especially if there is a mix of ages. The great thing is, once they close their eyes, it becomes completely about their own experience. Fidgeting and chatting stops, there is a sense of calm, and some sleep which is great because they perhaps need it.\"\nEach group is given an insight into the benefits of meditation, as well as exploring how stress becomes unhealthy, warning signs, and how to build resilience through practical techniques that can help reduce anxiety.\nThe meditation guru shared skills with the pupils which, if put into practice daily, can be life-changing.\nSuzi said: \"They are all very relaxed and quite amazed at the experience. I hope they leave with the knowledge that they have the ability to create calmness within themselves using some of the techniques they have learned, leading to greater concentration, focus, creativity and well rested teens.\"\nThe visible difference in the pupils during the session at Space 108 has astounded school staff. \"Some of the teachers and staff who have attended over the years can\u0026rsquot quite believe the quiet and calm that begins to settle in the room. I\u0026rsquove had a few parents afterwards tell me how much their kids enjoyed it,\" said Suzi.\n\"There is a lot of anxiety and tension in our kids today, sometimes a feeling of being relaxed is a little alien to them, then they experience it. That\u0026rsquos the important bit, they have an experience of relaxation and calm, not an intellectual understanding that it is good for them, but an actual experience.\"\nResearch has proven that mindfulness and meditation is very beneficial to a person\u0026rsquos mental health, and many schools are incorporating it into their classrooms, teaching philosophies, and disciplinary programs.\nIn fact, some schools are choosing to replace detention with meditation with it even being used as behavioural therapy in classrooms.\nWhether this trend will catch on remains to be seen, as there are many parents who still prefer traditional discipline, with youngsters being given their marching orders to the principal\u0026rsquos office for unruly behaviour.\nBut one thing is certain, the pupils of Peebles High School reaped the benefits of their mindful meditation sessions with Suzi during Health Week last month.\nPrincipal teacher of pastoral care Kirsteen Robertson, said: \"The studio is beautiful, the students immediately notice how soothing the space is, the lovely smell and lighting. The sessions give our students strategies to relax, think calmly, reducing stress and anxiety and improve sleep. It\u0026rsquos just amazing to see how some of them react.\"\nHaving embraced meditation and its healing benefits, I leave the studio feeling renewed, carefree and a little lighter on my feet.

campaign","story":"The school summer holidays are here and it’s easy for health routines to go out of the window as children relax, enjoy the outdoors and get stuck into their favourite hobbies.Asthma UK is launching a campaign urging parents of children with asthma to make sure they take their usual preventer medicine and keep up a routine over the school break.The medicine builds up over time so will help to protect their child from an asthma attack during the summer holiday and once they return to school.Every 10 seconds someone has a potentially life-threatening asthma attack in the UK and three people die from an asthma attack every day.In September, children are nearly three times more likely to be admitted to hospital because of an asthma attack than in August, partly due to seasonal triggers such as cold and flu viruses.If a child hasn’t kept up their preventer medicine routine over the school holidays, they will be at greater risk of reacting to these triggers.The good news is that by taking a few simple steps, parents can help their child to avoid asthma attacks and enjoy the summer as much as anyone else:Keep up your child’s usual preventer medicine routine, usually a brown inhaler.Make sure your child has an up-to-date written asthma action plan, which you can download from Asthma UK’s website, and share this with anyone who will be looking after them as using one means they’re less likely to end up in hospital for their asthma.Track your child’s asthma symptoms using a diary or a symptom calendar.Prepare for going back to school by arranging for your child to have an asthma review with their GP or asthma nurse to check your child’s medicines and make sure your child has spare, in-date reliever inhalers to take into school.Parents whose children have asthma can access support through our nurse helpline.Last year we helped nearly 1,000 parents who called on behalf of their child with asthma.For information and support on how to manage your child’s asthma during the summer or to download a written asthma action plan visit www.asthma.org.uk/safersummerDr Andy Whittamore, Practicing GP, Clinical Lead at Asthma UK.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"2012s

All road users need to know what they are in the interest of safety.\u0026#8217Mark Sutherland: \u0026#8216I have on several occasions crossed the road near the Co-op, and due to the speed of some inconsiderate drivers have had narrow misses. As for reporting to the police, this is ridiculous as the police would not really be interested as they have enough to do.\u0026#8216It is obvious if you stand there long enough that several people try to cross and give up or take a chance.\u0026#8216A crossing is required, especially for the elderly and infirm, as they can not make it across as quickly.\u0026#8216Common sense needs to be implemented by the right authorities to ensure that pedestrians can cross safely.\u0026#8217\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"pedestrian crossings","story":"There are also no traditional pedestrian pelican crossings.

supplies during the current period of hot summer weather.Following a sustained dry period without any significant rainfall, customer usage has increased significantly.With the current weather conditions forecast to continue people should take simple but important steps to conserve public water supplies.In some areas there has been a 30 per cent increase in demand for water during the summer and an additional 140 million litres are currently being produced and pushed through the system every day.The situation is being monitored closely and  to manage supplies across the country.This includes deploying additional resources to move water between distribution areas and tankering water to supplement local networks.Some water treatment works and distribution networks are working at near capacity to meet demand.Average reservoir levels are generally normal for this time of year but the current level of usage and continuing dry weather means stocks of stored water available for use are reducing.Try to reduce usage wherever possible.Businesses are also being asked to consider their usage and how they can use water more efficiently.Simple, practical steps include: taking shorter showers, using a watering can rather than a hose to water plants, using a bucket rather than a hose to wash vehicles only washing windscreens/lights instead of the whole vehicle, turning off taps whenever possible, use washing machines and dishwashers fully loaded.Scotland’s public water supply is the lifeblood of the country, for household and business customers and more than 1.3 billion litres is used per day.There is a strong and resilient water distribution network but everyone will need to play their part as Scotland enjoys its hottest and driest summer in

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.

She has had both her feet amputated after they suffered tissue damage due to sepsis \u0026ndash a serious complication of an infection.\u0026nbsp It was also feared that Ruth, who taught art at Knox Academy in Haddington and Preston Lodge High School, Prestonpans, might also lose her hands.  She is recovering at the Astley Ainslie Hospital in Edinburgh, where she is getting used to her newly-fitted prosthetic legs with the aid of physiotherapists.  The health of her hands improved and she is keeping them busy by resuming her love of creative activities such as drawing, weaving and needlework.  Ruth is now looking forward to getting out of hospital to rejoin her family: husband Mark, 47, and their daughters, seven-year-old Lucia and Isabella, five.    But she can\u0026rsquot return to her New Street home in Musselburgh as it has an outdoor staircase and is no longer suitable, so the search for a new home is under way.  Now her friend Jacqueline Campbell has launched a crowdfunding campaign to raise \u0026pound20,000 to help fund a mobility scooter and adapt a new property.  In March, Ruth suddenly started to have breathing problems along with vomiting and diarrhoea.  Mark, a nurse at the Western General Hospital in Edinburgh, said she was rushed to the accident and emergency unit at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh by paramedics who assessed that she was suffering from sepsis, which can be triggered by an infection and affected her immune system.  He said: \u0026ldquoHer health deteriorated more and more and she was taken to the high dependency unit. They said they needed to ventilate Ruth and that was the last time I spoke to her for two-and-a-half weeks. She went into a medicalised coma.  Mark said it was still unknown what was causing the infection, so Ruth received multiple antibiotics.  \u0026ldquoThe consultant told me to prepare myself because we were losing Ruth, he said.  The medical team decided to take Ruth into theatre to connect an ECMO (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) circuit to help her breathing.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoThey managed to stabilise her but her vital organs were failing. Her respiratory had already failed and her kidneys had failed.  \u0026ldquoThere was no one as ill as Ruth in the whole of the UK at that time, receiving that amount of support to keep her alive.  Ruth was then transferred to a specialist ECMO unit at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoHer liver was failing and her heart was beginning to fail.  \u0026ldquoThey said again that they were losing Ruth and she wouldn\u0026rsquot last the in-patient stay.  \u0026ldquoThey made the decision to fit a second ECMO circuit to support her heart and this stabilised her.  \u0026ldquoI was told several times I might be potentially losing Ruth. Then things started improving and they were able to withdraw some of the support and her blood tests were showing very small improvements.  \u0026ldquoRuth was infected with group \u0026lsquoA\u0026rsquo streptococcal, a very aggressive bacteria which is around us all the time.  \u0026ldquoRuth\u0026rsquos immune system was already affected, so it was able to take over very quickly, causing failure to the vital organs. She was diagnosed with sepsis and pneumonia.  Ruth began to make progress with her breathing, her heart started to stabilise and her kidneys started to improve. Doctors felt they could remove the ECMO circuit for the heart and rescind the \u0026lsquodo not resuscitate\u0026rsquo notice.  As doctors brought Ruth out of sedation, she faced the risk of haemorrhaging throughout the body because of blood thinning and medications.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoI remember her opening her eyes and looking at me.  \u0026ldquoWe put our foreheads together and looked into each others\u0026rsquo eyes. I knew that Ruth was back.  \u0026ldquoHow close she was to dying on several occasions is still difficult to comprehend.  A special moment for Ruth was a visit by her daughters for her birthday when they took her cuddly toys and held her hand. Her mum and dad were also at her bedside.  Ruth was moved back to the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, where her ventilator was removed and she was able to start to speak.  But as she got better, she was to face a huge decision as a result of the tissue damage, caused by the lack of blood flow, which had turned her feet black.  She was told she would have to lose her right foot and possibly half of her left foot, with surgery carried out at St John\u0026rsquos Hospital in Livingston.  But Ruth, determined to get the best quality of life, made the decision to lose both feet below the knee, which would give her more choices in terms of prosthetics and improve her recovery.    Mark paid tribute to the \u0026ldquowonderful hospital staff who had \u0026ldquogiven everything for Ruth.  He highlighted the help he had received from friends and family over the past few months, including the network of \u0026lsquoSupermums\u0026rsquo who looked after Lucia and Isabella, friends, neighbours and colleagues at the Western General.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe kindness of people has been overwhelming. They want to help so much.

Margaret and Keith Morris moved from a Dunedin Canmore property in Bathgate last September into the phase two of Mill House \u0026ndash an amenity housing development for residents aged 55 and over.  Mrs Morris said: \u0026ldquoThere is no privacy whatsoever.  \u0026ldquoPeople who park in the car park have been waving in.  \u0026ldquoThere were two young guys in a van and I was hanging out my washing and one was nudging the other.

Sculptor Michael Johnson\u0026rsquos work, called \u0026lsquoMemory and Reflection\u0026rsquo, is 12ft high and 6ft feet wide.  The stainless steel sculpture depicts aspects of Musselburgh\u0026rsquos history with images of agriculture, people, connections to the sea, the river and the Romans. The face of the sculpture is mirror polished and reflects whatever stands before it.  Mr Johnson, from Nottinghamshire, sees these two aspects of the shell, the memory and reflection, as metaphors for a work which interprets the history of the town and offers a reflection of how the town is viewed now.  A working group made up of community representatives selected the mussel shell for the commission. Mr Johnson undertook activities with local groups and schoolchildren to create designs for bronze inserts incorporated onto the main sculpture.  The fisherfolk stone sculpture at Murdoch Green will be moved to a seating area in front of the Shell petrol station, also off Edinburgh Road.  The mussel shell is one of two works of art funded by Tesco at a cost of \u0026pound76,000 as part of the council\u0026rsquos Percent for Art policy, which was a condition of planning consent for the company\u0026rsquos present store.

Fears were raised back in 2016 that the day centre might be forced to relocate or even cease to exist in its present form because a new day centre facility could not be accommodated within the current building.  East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership needed to provide at least 18 places of registered day care for people with complex care needs in Musselburgh given that it was the largest town in East Lothian. This was in line with need identified as part of a wider review of older people\u0026rsquos day centres.  This led to the partnership and the Hollies exploring the options available, which ranged from potentially adapting the current building to accommodate 18 people through to looking at possible other buildings if the Hollies couldn\u0026rsquot be adapted.  After nearly two years of talks, and Care Inspectorate and architects\u0026rsquo input, it was found that, in order to adapt the Hollies premises, the lunch club and public cafe would be lost at the expense of more than 100 users.  A joint decision remains to be made about the eight day care places already in existence at the Hollies current premises but, at present, there is agreement that these places will continue.  The health and social care partnership is now looking for somewhere else in Musselburgh to accommodate the other 10 places.  Following a meeting this month, the Hollies trustees have confirmed that agreement has been reached with the health and social care partnership that the status quo will remain at the day centre.  In a joint statement, the trustees said: \u0026ldquoThe Hollies distributed a consultation paper to service users and had 271 responses completed in two weeks. The overwhelming consensus of the people consulted is for the Hollies to continue providing the service it does now for the people of Musselburgh and surrounding areas. We have also received positive feedback on our proposed expansion of activities in the hall in the afternoons.  \u0026ldquoWe have agreed with the health and social care partnership that the Hollies should remain as it is. We are looking forward to continuing to work as before and to embark on exciting new projects to meet the wishes of all those who attend the Hollies.  Liz Shannon, centre manager, said: \u0026ldquoFunding is a constant battle for us all at the Hollies and we have been in limbo whilst these talks were taking place and have been unable to approach funders as we were unclear what funding we were asking for.  \u0026ldquoThe health and social care partnership has assured us they will continue to give funding at the current level for this financial year which is \u0026pound82,000 to continue to fund the eight registered places which we are grateful for in this transition period. However, that is less than a third of what it costs to run all our services and maintain the building.  \u0026ldquoThings are going to be very tight for the near future while we submit funding applications to funders like the lottery however, we are very excited at the prospect of moving forward and very grateful for the support from the people of Musselburgh and beyond.  Councillor Fiona O\u0026rsquoDonnell, health and social care spokesperson, said: \u0026ldquoI am pleased that the Hollies will continue to provide a wide range of services in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoThis was a really positive meeting and the plans to provide more activities in the Hollies are good news for local people.  \u0026ldquoThe health and social care partnership will continue its work to increase the amount of day support in Musselburgh for older people with complex care needs."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7972409.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"cement-plant-says-sorry-for-cars-being-coated-in-dust","story":"  Numerous complaints were made on social media regarding cars and, in particular, car windscreens being covered in dust late last month.

Among the issues highlighted at the public meeting were long waits to get through to the surgery by telephone failure of repeat prescriptions poor communication with patients very long waiting times to see a named GP lack of continuity of care and treatment difficulties with NHS 24 and test results not being given out by doctors.  Concerns were also raised about GP training and recruitment, the area\u0026rsquos growing population causing additional pressures on local health services, the cost of calling the surgery and the idea of an online booking system.  Last Wednesday, Ms Dugdale asked the Scottish Government what discussions it has had with NHS Lothian regarding general practitioner services in Musselburgh.  Shona Robison, who was Cabinet Secretary for Health and Sport at the time, said: \u0026ldquoNHS 24 is delivering a pilot at the Riverside GP practice in Musselburgh whereby it is triaging patients who have requested same-day GP appointments. Where appropriate, NHS 24 will signpost patients to areas of the primary care system that are better placed to meet their needs, often more swiftly. \u0026ldquoIndications are that the pilot is working well, with a number of patients signposted to more appropriate support, freeing up GPs to deal with patients with more complex needs. A full evaluation is underway with a report due in the coming weeks, which will be shared with health boards and integration authorities.  Ms Dugdale commented: \u0026ldquoEarlier this month, 200 angry Musselburgh residents turned out at a public meeting because they have had real and persistent difficulties in accessing GPs locally. They do not think that the pilot is working that well. Many of the problems are caused by a GP shortage - a point that the practice and the British Medical Association have acknowledged. Can the cabinet secretary explain to my constituents why they have to phone NHS 24 to see their GP and when she expects Scotland\u0026rsquos GP shortage to be resolved?  Ms Robison said: \u0026ldquoThe pilot that NHS 24 is running is a system that has worked well elsewhere and that has had strong evaluation, so I urge Kezia Dugdale to wait for the formal evaluation of the pilot. I am happy for her to be furnished with the evaluation if she would be interested in that.  \u0026ldquoWith regard to the way forward for general practice, she will be aware of the new contract that has been put in place with substantial resources to back it up. In this financial year, we will invest \u0026pound100 million to support the new contract, and we also have the ambition to increase the number of GPs by at least 800 over the next 10 years. In addition, the multidisciplinary team will make sure that we can reduce the workload of GPs.  Mr Whitfield told the Courier: \u0026ldquoAt the recent GP public meeting, Kezia and I agreed to take the concerns raised back to the practice, but also to NHS Lothian and the Scottish Government. Kezia has acted swiftly to challenge the Health Secretary on the issue and demand she does more to alleviate the problems experienced in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoWe have also passed on the issues and questions highlighted at the meeting to the practice. Once we receive a response we will share it with those who attended. We will also keep up the pressure locally and nationally for further action to help patients here receive the service they need.  Mr Dugdale later said the appropriate steps needed to be taken to support \u0026ldquostruggling GP practices and prevent further closures.  Miles Briggs, Lothian Conservative MSP, who also took part in the Holyrood debate, later said: \u0026ldquoThe Health Secretary\u0026rsquos assurance that the pilot is working well in Musselburgh is totally at odds with the experience of many local patients who have expressed very real concerns about delays in getting through and arranging a routine GP appointment.  \u0026ldquoMinisters and NHS Lothian need to respond to what are genuine issues being experienced by local residents and to take urgent action to address these."},{"url":null,"title":"harry-potter-stars-are-heading-to-musselburgh-this-summer","story":"  Stars of the movies will be taking part in the summer event which is being held at Loretto School and raising funds for Children\u0026rsquos Hospices Across Scotland (CHAS).

Searching for frog spawn and wee tadpoles is often a key childhood memory. But there are things we know about without really knowing about them.  This thought came to me as I searched for tadpoles and wee frogs in a pond last weekend with a group of parents and their children.  I love nature and believe it is a powerful part of all of us, which is why going to the woods or the beach, or just the general \u0026lsquocountryside\u0026rsquo, is an antidote for the stress of life.  But the truth is we don\u0026rsquot really have to go far to reach nature it\u0026rsquos all around us.  The spider\u0026rsquos web on the hedge, the birds on the roof that wake us in the mornings, the self-seeded flowers which grow in places all around our towns, the trees which blossom then turn our streets green, the wee beasties in our garden soil, the list goes on and on.  Yet it is so easy to rush past all the magic which is just on our doorstep.  And as I watched the wee frogs swimming in the pond last week, I discovered just how much I don\u0026rsquot know and have missed.  That\u0026rsquos the joy of having young children, I think: they are a passport for you as a \u0026lsquogrown-up\u0026rsquo to explore the world with a sense of fascination that we all once had, and can be rekindled.  You see, I\u0026rsquod never actually thought about how a tadpole changes into a frog.  In the day-to-day living of life I suppose it\u0026rsquos understandable it is not an issue we will spend too much time thinking about.  But as I watched the wee frogs come up from the mud to the surface to breathe, then swim down again, I realised we were looking down on a simple but fascinating miracle of nature.  Then a wee frog literally jumped from a stone onto my son\u0026rsquos hand.  He could have squashed it or even been frightened by it, but instead he said \u0026ldquowow.  The wee creature jumped from his hand onto mine, obviously looking for a way back to the safety of the water.  Carefully, and a bit reluctantly, he helped the wee \u0026lsquobaby frog\u0026rsquo back into the water where it swam back down to the mud.  That\u0026rsquos when I realised I knew about the process without knowing about it.  There were some frogs which looked like late developers compared to their cousins, for they seemed to be more tadpole than frog, still swimming about with a tail between their developing frog legs.  The whole spectacle was, honestly, fascinating. I found myself being in awe at the process that we all know about but don\u0026rsquot really know about.  And so as summer has reached us, I am determined to make it a Safari of Discovery on our doorstep.  I will share this journey with you the places, stories and folklore attached to them. And while I cannot claim to be an expert on nature, I know its spiritual importance and I think that is a good beginning.  My first port of call will be the wood of what my kids call the \u0026ldquoserpent trees.  Where is that? You\u0026rsquoll find out next week!  In the meantime, I will have to keep this week\u0026rsquos page short as it is my daughter Manja\u0026rsquos ninth birthday and I have mermaid tails to connect. . ."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7697530.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"council-calls-for-rejection-of-substation-plans","story":"  East Lothian Council will submit its formal objection to the proposals to a Scottish Government reporter after officials were given the unanimous support of elected councillors at a meeting of the local authority on Tuesday.  A planning application for the substation by Inch Cape Offshore Limited (ICOL) was called in by Scottish Ministers in a controversial move in April and will now be decided by the reporter instead of the council.  ICOL wants to bring offshore energy from a planned windfarm off the Angus coast onto land at Cockenzie by building the substation on the footprint of the former power station.  A previous planning application siting the substation further inland had been given planning permission but that permission lapsed instead of renewing it, ICOL decided to pursue a new site.  In its argument to Scottish Ministers, the council will state that the substation is \u0026ldquonot the best use of the land and point out that planning permission had been given at another site.  Councillor Norman Hampshire said: \u0026ldquoBecause of the location, we have to recommend it should be refused. We have done a lot of work to move this proposal forward and this action jeopardises that.  \u0026ldquoI think if everybody had worked together we could have got a development on a site the council, developers and communities could have supported.  Earlier this month, representatives of ICOL were challenged by Prestonpans Community Council to name any independent party that support the planned location of the substation.  Brian Weddell, community council chairman, told the ICOL representatives that there had been no public consultation about the new site.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe are against it, Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council are against it, East Lothian Council and Scottish Natural Heritage are against it.  \u0026ldquoShow us anyone, apart from Inch Cape, who think it is a good site.  Ian Johnson, ICOL project manager, said: \u0026ldquoWe are naturally disappointed that East Lothian Council officers have recommended refusal to the application on the grounds that it could prejudice future development of the area. ICOL have been and will continue to work with the council to look at options to reduce the footprint of the site and ensure that other potential future developments can co-exist next to the substation.  However, he made it clear there were no plans to consider an alternative site, telling the Courier: \u0026ldquoWe have no intention of moving the proposed site of the onshore transmission works again.  The reporter is due to visit Cockenzie on Monday as part of her investigation into the application."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7994954.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"glory-days-of-golf-remembered","story":"  Musselburgh Museum on High Street is hosting an exhibition called \u0026lsquoMusselburgh \u0026ndash Cradle of Golf\u0026rsquo which is aimed at reasserting the Honest Toun\u0026rsquos importance in the sport\u0026rsquos rich heritage.  Boasting one of the oldest golf courses in the world \u0026ndash Musselburgh Links, The Old Course \u0026ndash the town was once home to the Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers, who now play at Muirfield, near Gullane.  The Honourable Company brought other Edinburgh clubs to the town such as Royal Burgess, Bruntsfield and the Warrender.  The exhibition celebrates the days from 1836 to the early 20th century when Musselburgh was at the forefront of the game\u0026rsquos development.  It not only celebrates the golf clubs which played in the town over the years but also the many golf club and ball makers, and professional players, who made their living in the town between 1836 and 1900 \u0026ndash a period of dramatic growth in the game.  The display has been organised by Musselburgh Museum and Heritage Group in partnership with Mungo Park, whose great-grandfather Willie Park Senior, from Wallyford, won the first Open Championship at Prestwick in 1860 and went on to be a four-time Open champion.  Willie\u0026rsquos brother Mungo and son Willie Junior were also Open champions at Musselburgh Links.  Two other local men \u0026ndash Bob Ferguson, who won a hat-trick of Open Championships, and David Brown \u0026ndash complete the town\u0026rsquos five Open champions, with 11 wins between them.  Support for the exhibition has also been received from East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos economic development and strategic investment department and Musselburgh Common Good Fund.  The exhibition, which runs from July 6 to September 1, is to be officially opened by Lord Wemyss, whose family has been involved with golf since the early 18th century.  On display are a large number of golf items and memorabilia donated by golf clubs that were formerly located at Musselburgh Links. Artefacts from the British Golf Museum and private collections can also be viewed.  The exhibition includes significant artefacts that have not been seen publicly in Scotland for decades, among them Charles Lees\u0026rsquo famous painting A Summer Evening on the Musselburgh Links: Golfers, which recently sold at Bonhams.

The land had previously been owned by Sainsbury\u0026rsquos who had permission for a new supermarket there but their long-stalled plans were finally ditched when they sold the land earlier this year.  A public exhibition took place at the town\u0026rsquos John Gray Centre last Tuesday where those behind the plans were on hand to answer local residents\u0026rsquo questions.  Alex Mitchell, director of Zander Planning, admitted there had been a \u0026ldquomixed reaction from the people who turned up.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe have had a great turnout \u0026ndash some people have been supportive and think that it will be of benefit to the town but others are worried about what it will do to the town centre.  Alastair Dickie, development director at Ediston Real Estate, which are behind the plans, added: \u0026ldquoI think there have been a lot of valid comments.  The names of the businesses looking to move into the site have not yet been revealed but it is hoped that their identities will become public by the time a planning application is submitted to East Lothian Council.  Mr Mitchell hopes a detailed planning application will be lodged before the end of the summer. He said: \u0026ldquoIf we can get an application in by about September then we\u0026rsquore probably looking at six months for planning [approval]. If we get [that] we could be on-site in spring 2019.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom sure retailers would want to be open before Christmas but that is probably a bit tight so we\u0026rsquod be looking at early 2020.  Mr Mitchell also attempted to allay fears over the volume of traffic on the road by adding: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore looking to create a filter lane so people coming in [to the new retail park] would not cause queues for people getting into the town.  Paul Darling, one of the planning liaison officers at the town\u0026rsquos community council, attended the exhibition.  He said the buildings proposed were \u0026ldquougly but added: \u0026ldquoI am not against the plans, I just think the buildings have to be more in-keeping with the rest of the town.  \u0026ldquoI think that it could actually bring people to the town but it is a bit of a worry what could happen to the shops in the town centre.

Among those representing the Dundee university is Emily Peterson, from Dunbar.

The team, who make up Blacklight Games, created Firepoint \u0026ndash a first-person mixed reality simulator which aims to bring a new level of realism to firefighter training.  Using HoloLens and Windows Mixed Reality technology, the game allows trainees to see through the eyes of a firefighter as they make their way through a multi-storey training ground tackling a variety of different issues.  It is hoped the simulator can eventually be used at open days or recruitment fairs.  The former Dunbar Grammar School pupil told the Courier the idea had evolved over time before resulting in the final product.  Originally, proposals looked at creating a game involving a maze.  However, a discussion with a firefighter saw the focus of the project, which is the work of eight third year students, change.  Emily said: \u0026ldquoMatthew McAuley, from our team, had a friend who worked for the fire service.  \u0026ldquoI think he got the initial from there and said why don\u0026rsquot we come up with that.  \u0026ldquoWe had been making the initial concept like a maze and it is something you can still see in the final build of the game.

A team from Manchester University was crowned the overall UK winner with Abertay finishing as the runner-up.  Now, both universities will send teams to the final.

Mrs Paul said that, while she was not against giving young people a place of their own, she felt the shelter \u0026ndash which sits to the rear of the home the couple have lived in for 18 years \u0026ndash was not the right location.

Fiona Brown from the charity was delighted to receive the cheque and said the proceeds would go to help raise awareness of pancreatic cancer, which is the fifth most common cause of cancer death in the UK as the majority of patients are diagnosed too late for potentially curative surgery.  Walter, who lived in Prestonpans with Janet, was just 60 when he died. He had been diagnosed with the disease only 29 days earlier.  Wife Janet has vowed to continue campaigning to raise funds and awareness in her husband\u0026rsquos memory.  She said: \u0026ldquoI cannot thank everyone enough for the support they have given me and my family over the past 18 months.  \u0026ldquoRaising awareness of pancreatic cancer is just as important as the fundraising and I would urge everyone to learn and understand the symptoms of this \u0026lsquosilent cancer\u0026rsquo.

They also found five secondary tumours at the top of his spine.  By the age of 13, the brave teenager had completed a high dose of radiotherapy to his brain and spinal cord following a biopsy.  Despite his health challenges, Paul, who is now 30, received a Bachelor of Engineering with Honours in Computer Systems and Networks degree at a graduation ceremony at the Usher Hall last week.  His family, including mum Angela, 52, and sisters Laura, 34, and Aleigh, 21, were filled with pride to see him receive his degree.  He was also awarded the Rob Kemmer Prize, receiving \u0026pound100 in recognition of his \u0026ldquooutstanding achievements on his individual programme of study.  Paul, of Burns Wynd, is now planning to return to Napier after the summer to complete his Master\u0026rsquos Degree.  Angela, who has been Paul\u0026rsquos full-time carer, said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom incredibly proud of Paul.  \u0026ldquoDespite his challenges he just gets on with things and has achieved his degree.  \u0026ldquoHe has had a tough life but he does not give up and is an incredibly caring young man.  \u0026ldquoNothing is going to stop Paul.  Angela revealed that Paul was a pupil at Musselburgh Grammar School when his condition was first diagnosed.  She said: \u0026ldquoPaul was having trouble with his eyesight and the school contacted me to say they thought it was getting worse.  \u0026ldquoIt was when he was referred to the Eye Pavilion in Edinburgh they discovered the tumours were the cause of it.  \u0026ldquoHe had multifocal germinoma tumours and secondary cancer caused the spinal lesions.  Although the radiotherapy cured his tumour, it had other detrimental effects.  Paul is registered blind as a result of the radiotherapy to his visual nerves and also has a curvature of the spine.  The pituitary gland in his brain has failed completely, so he needs to take hormone replacements and he also finds it difficult to open his jaw, which is thought to be due to scar tissue following radiotherapy.  It was when he was working as a volunteer at Musselburgh Citizens Advice Bureau that Paul first became interested in developing his computer skills, attending both Edinburgh College and Napier for four years.  Angela said: \u0026ldquoPaul doesn\u0026rsquot have an assistant at Napier and he travels there independently.  \u0026ldquoHe has some vision out of the side of one eye and the centre of the other.  \u0026ldquoThe university helped with extra large screens for him and giving him more time his teachers are all delighted for him.  Paul hopes that his achievement will inspire others with illness and disabilities to follow their dreams and aspirations.  He said: \u0026ldquoTo graduate with a degree is massive. It took a while to get here from secondary school.  \u0026ldquoI am looking forward to returning to Napier for a year to do my Master\u0026rsquos Degree. They have given huge support.  Paul is hoping to get a job based in computer security once he finishes his studies."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8024055.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"couple-get-permission-to-turn-old-bar-back-into-pub","story":"  Michael and Wendy Peters took over the Gardeners Arms in Haddington in 2011 when its licence had come under review because of problems experienced by previous management.  A meeting of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos licensing board last Thursday heard that since the Peters took charge of the pub there had not been a single complaint about it.  Now the couple have applied for permission to turn the building next door \u0026ndash which currently operates as Jo\u0026rsquos Kitchen \u0026ndash into a pub which they plan to name the New Pheasant.  The name is a reference to the building\u0026rsquos previous history as The Pheasant pub before it shut in 2009.  Mr and Mrs Peters\u0026rsquo agent highlighted articles in the Courier to the licensing board that showed the problems at the Gardeners Arms before the couple took it over.  He said: \u0026ldquoBefore they took over there were some interesting Courier articles which described the pub as a disgrace.  \u0026ldquoSince they took over, the Courier articles were about a disgraced pub being turned around.  Applying for a major variation to the current licence held by Jo\u0026rsquos Kitchen, the agent said that the Peters\u0026rsquo current role managing the Gardeners Arms was coming to an end next month and they were keen to move on to their own establishment.  The board heard two objections had been received, along with two letters of support, all from neighbouring residents.  Both objections raised concerns about noise, as well as pointing out that there were already three pubs in the town with \u0026lsquoto let\u0026rsquo signs up. But the board was told the fact other pubs were available to let was not relevant.  Rudy Fruzynski, East Lothian licensing standards officer, told the board he was happy to support the application, confirming that there had been no complaints about the operation of the Gardeners Arms since the Peters took over.  He added: \u0026ldquoIn recent times, the anti-social behaviour team has received a substantial complaint made by a resident in the area complaining about late-evening noise with persons congregating on Market Street and using nearby Cross Lane as a thoroughfare from High Street.  \u0026ldquoThis problem cannot be directly attributed to licensed premises on Market Street. It is more likely to be related to the make-up of the area as a whole, being a focal point for persons seeking the services of many different types of business that are open in the evenings, particularly at weekends.  The board unanimously approved the application, with a request from Police Scotland agreed for children under the age of 15 to vacate the new premises by 8pm and 16 and 17-year-olds to leave by 10pm.  A request from Police Scotland for outdoor drinking hours to be reduced from 9pm to 8pm was not supported by the licensing board as it conflicted with the current hours for the Gardeners Arms."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/6802523.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"earwigs-eat-into-coastal-car-park-profits","story":"  Calls have been made for a detailed review of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos parking charges policy at the county\u0026rsquos coastal car parks amid claims by opponents that once the costs had been taken away the entire scheme only made a profit of about \u0026pound6,000 in its second year.  And council official admitted that while the income from the charges was increasing year on year, it was not expected to come close to the \u0026pound300,000 included in the administration\u0026rsquos budget for this financial year, with an estimated gross income of \u0026pound238,000 predicted.  It was also revealed at a meeting of the council\u0026rsquos policy and performance review committee that the council pays the Earl of Wemyss one third of the income from Longniddry Bents car parks No 1, No 2 and No 3, on top of a \u0026pound10,000 lease, as the car parks are part of the Wemyss and March Estate.  Since the introduction of the charges in 2015, those three car parks have brought in just under \u0026pound75,000 in income.  In total, the money collected from the 10 coastal car park sites which charge since it was introduced has been \u0026pound343,212.45.  However, the cost of the scheme was questioned at the meeting.  East Lothian Council introduced a \u0026pound2-a-day charge for using the three Longniddry Bents car parks and those at Barn Ness, Gullane Bents, John Muir Country Park, Shore Road at Belhaven, Tyninghame Links, Whitesands and Yellowcraig in 2015.  The initial cost of introducing the scheme, which included ticketing machines, signs and introducing double yellow lines at various locations, was about \u0026pound900,000.  A further \u0026pound425,000 is earmarked to be invested this year in improving toilet facilities at the Longniddry car parks.  Season passes are available for \u0026pound40 a year and just under 3,000 are currently being used.  A report on the income from the car parks revealed that in its first year the scheme brought in \u0026pound98,795 with costs of \u0026pound4,977.  However, it said in its second year the gross income was just over \u0026pound169,000 while costs rose substantially to nearly \u0026pound94,000.  In the last financial year, gross income grew to \u0026pound188,000 while the costs were at about \u0026pound83,000.  Among the reasons given for the rise in costs were \u0026pound55,000 which is paid towards East Lothian\u0026rsquos private parking attendants and the cost of replacing machines which had been vandalised by people trying to break into them, as well as rental fees for the Longniddry car parks and payment to a private company which collects the money from the machines and provides IT access so they can be monitored.  Peter Forsyth, service manager with the council, said the cost of replacing four machines last year had been \u0026pound25,000 and he revealed there was an unusual bug problem.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe have been affected by equipment failure due to bugs, earwigs and such, who like to nest in the equipment. They are not covered by our warranty.  Councillor Paul McLennan, who is part of the SNP Group which has opposed the car park fees from the start, said he estimated that, between costs of the scheme and interest generated from the initial loans, in its second year it would have made just \u0026pound6,000 profit.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe business case is not stacking up.  However, Jim Lamond, the council\u0026rsquos head of finance, said the scheme was never intended to make profits.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt is not in the budget as an income-generating activity. It is in there for improving the coastal car parks and ultimately that has been done.  Councillor Jeremy Findlay (Con) said people in his ward in Gullane did not feel they were seeing improvement in facilities at their car park. He said: \u0026ldquoIt was sold to people as a way to invest in facilities and they are not seeing it.  However, Councillor John McMillan (Lab), cabinet spokesperson for economic development, said a review would have to take in the bigger picture.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt needs to look at the impact on economic development and benefits it is bringing into East Lothian as well.  The committee agreed to ask for a detailed review of the scheme."},{"url":null,"title":"delve-into-haddingtons-history-this-summer","story":"  An exhibition of the history of Haddington opened its doors at the John Gray Centre last week in the town as it celebrates 700 years since King Robert The Bruce awarded it a Royal Charter.  The collection looks at seven centuries of life in the town and was officially opened by Provost John McMillan who brought along a portrait of his grandfather, who shared his name and joined the army in 1918 as one of many underage young men keen to defend their country.  Mr McMillan said he hoped the exhibition would encourage people to explore their own family history and look into their ancestry.  The Bruce Charter, which is the oldest document held in the John Gray archives, is not on display during the exhibition because it has to be kept in conservation conditions, but people can view it during the archive\u0027s opening hours.  Some of the less ancient items were on display at the Haddington Show at the weekend when archivists from the centre set up a stall in the crafts tent.  There they displayed some old images from shows gone by and a book of the show\u0027s records from 1820.  Interestingly some of the family names in the nearly 200-year-old records were still well know in the communities.  Exploring themes such as royalty, religion, health, education, wartime and crime and punishment, the exhibition aims to bring stories from the archives to life.  Haddington was one of the most important towns in medieval Scotland, and even had a royal palace, the birthplace of King Alexander II.  One of the items on display is a sick note from Mary Queen of Scots \u0026ndash the Queen asks the burgh to excuse Philip Gibson from military service because he was too corpulent to ride his horse!  Other characters featured include Agnes Blaik and Elizabeth Golight, two ladies of ill repute who were accused of entertaining dragoons. Both were convicted \u0026ndash Elizabeth Golight in particular was named a \u0026lsquovicious strumpet\u0026rsquo by the court. They were sentenced to stand at the market cross with a paper announcing their crime attached to their clothes, and thereafter they were to be drummed out of the town.  In medieval Haddington crime certainly did not pay and punishments were harsh. Criminals could be sentenced to death and the burgh account books include costs for building the gallows and the purchase of ropes for executions.  Gallows Green (where Bellevue House stands) gets its name from being the place the gallows were situated, and there is evidence that hangings also took place from the Nungate bridge.  Punishments for lesser crimes were harsh and cruel \u0026ndash those caught stealing could be sentenced to a whipping by the hangman, banished from the burgh, branded with the town key, or have an ear nailed to the pillory post!  While much of the exhibition concentrates on the medieval period more modern topics including the Glasgow Overspill are featured.  In 1958 Haddington signed the first Overspill Agreement in Scotland with Glasgow which was bursting at the seams with a post war housing crisis while other parts of the country were sparse. Haddington Town Council agreed to provide 250 houses for Glasgow families, increasing the town\u0027s population by 20 per cent.  which would result in a 20% increase in population. The original Overspill Agreement is on display in the exhibition.  This exhibition offers a glimpse into the lives of the townspeople of the past, and tries to demonstrate the central role Haddington played in events of national significance. Seven Centuries of Haddington is on display until the end of September and is well worth a visit."},{"url":null,"title":"new-life-coming-for-pub","story":"  Officers were called to the Masons Arms on Belhaven High Street at 6.50am on March 31 following an undisclosed incident.

In April, Police Scotland asked East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos licensing board to review the pub\u0026rsquos licence and that of its manager Christopher Darling.  However, at a meeting last week, the board was told that Mr Darling had parted company with the pub owners and the premises was currently closed.  James Hughes, who currently runs Dunbar Golf Club, asked the board to consider transferring the licence to him as he revealed ambitious plans to invest \u0026pound50,000 in the business with a view to eventually taking ownership of the property.  Mr Hughes told the board that he was preparing to sign a five-year-lease of the pub with its current owner in a deal which would allow him to buy it at the end of the lease.  He said that there were plans to renovate the building to open it up more and make it a family-friendly site.  Mr Hughes told the meeting: \u0026ldquoWe plan to make it a good country food and beer premises.  \u0026ldquoIt is in an area steeped in history with [Belhaven] Brewery and a popular tourism area, and we want to turn it into a good welcoming family pub.  Mr Hughes, who has been at Dunbar Golf Club for several years, told the board he had more than 23 years of experience in the licensed trade and had worked in Edinburgh before moving to East Lothian.

Assembly host Bryden McKinnie, told the Courier, he received news from the Food Assembly UK operators on Friday afternoon that they were no longer operating in the UK.  The assemblies, which started in France, have been operating across the UK for five years.  They provide local hosts with the support to set up a website where local producers can offer their goods for sale and customers can browse online filling a \"shopping basket\" with products from a number of different companies.  They then collect all their shopping at one place on a set evening of the week.  The Haddington Assembly has held weekly collections at the Maitlandfield House Hotel since it began, with a wide range of local suppliers.  More than 1250 people have become members of the assembly in East Lothian but host Bryden said one of the issues to faced was building regular customers to make it sustainable.  He said of the 100 plus members only around 50 shop with any regularity and if the assembly was to continue in another form it was important to understand what stopped the other members from using it.  He said: \"It is difficult to sustain when you do not have a lot of regular shoppers, and this is a common thread among all the UK food assemblies.  \"We are talking to each other and looking at whether we can come up with a new way of operating, the announcement from the Food Assembly came as a shock and has really rocked everyone, but we are looking to the future.\"  The Haddington Food Assembly will stop at the end of this month.

It really is a case of \"use it or lose it\".\"  A spokesperson for the Food Assembly said no public statement on the withdrawal was being made before the end of August.

However, since all junior doctors at that time lived together in a residency at the hospital - a practice phased out from the 1970s - half his salary was automatically deducted to pay for laundry, meals and lodgings.    Nonetheless, Dr Boyd, now 91, said he \"very much regrets\" the loss of this practice. He said: \"It was a great thing. Camaraderie is the word. We stayed there and we all met for meals, we all were in the common room in the evening, and we learned from each other.  \"Weekends usually started at lunchtime on the Saturday. We didn\u0027t think about \u0027contractual hours\u0027 - I don\u0027t remember ever signing a contract. We just did what needed to be done.\"  Speaking at his home in Morningside, Edinburgh, the retired physician said the NHS he joined in 1949 was a very different place to the NHS of 2018.  \"The spectrum of disease then was entirely different to what it is now,\" he said. \"When I was a student, tuberculosis was rife and for example if a child came in with a diagnosis of meningitis-tuberculosis, it was a death sentence.  \"Then at the beginning of being a house officer, streptomycin came in - and it was a miracle. They survived.\"  Read more NHS 70: The transformation of maternity care - and the return of home births?\u0026nbsp  Dr Boyd said the levels of poverty he encountered as a young medic in Edinburgh are also long gone. As a student, he spent a period assisting at home births in the Leith area with midwives.  \"That was an occasion where I was first confronted with real poverty. Some of the worst slums in Scotland were in Leith. Often there would be nowhere to put the baby except in an empty drawer, and sometimes there wasn\u0027t very much food.  \"I remember one occasion where the delivery was quite prolonged. The men vanished, of course - off to the pub or wherever - and it was either a neighbour or a female relative who was around. They\u0027d be offered a cup of tea and that was it.  \"Anyway, it was going on and on and the student midwife said \u0027I\u0027m getting really hungry\u0027. So we pooled our resources - the midwife and myself - and I went out and got fish suppers.  \"And we all - the poor mother-to-be, the attendants, myself - we all ate fish suppers. It was probably the best meal she had had in a long time.  \"I didn\u0027t come from a posh family, but I\u0027d never encountered poverty like that.  \"I shared with a very good friend of mine, another medical student, and when we came back from these places the drill was that we went straight back to our bedroom, put a newspaper down, stripped and started to look for the \u0027wildlife\u0027. There was everything: fleas, lice, bedbugs. That\u0027s something not seen nowadays.\"  Read more NHS 70: Has psychiatry gone from overcrowded asylums to a shortage of beds?\u0026nbsp  However, Dr Boyd laments the rise of a \"culture of blame\" in the NHS over the decades.  He said: \"There were difficulties then when I was younger, but there is a difference in attitude. Things went wrong in those days as well, of course, but they didn\u0027t have the climate of blame and fear of doing something wrong and being blamed and sued for it. That didn\u0027t exist.  \"Another disease you don\u0027t see now is polio myelitis. Now I can remember as a house physician admitting a young male psychiatrist from the local psychiatric hospital at Larbert, with acute polio myelitis. He progressed very rapidly to the extent that his respiratory muscles were affected.  \"Now in the 1930s Lord Nuffield - the \u0027Morris\u0027 of the Morris cars, and at that time a millionaire - he had gone round the hospitals in the UK presenting what was known as an \u0027iron lung\u0027. These were the old negative pressure respirators. It was like getting into a coffin - you were enclosed in there with a seal round the neck, and just your head exposed.  \"Well, Falkirk Royal had an iron lung. I had never had training in using it and I don\u0027t think any of the other staff had either. It was just there, ready for use, but it never had been used.  \"I remember that being a very traumatic experience, and the poor chap died afterwards. I had never seen a team of nurses cry before but we were all very distressed. That\u0027s one of the bad things I remember.  \"But nobody said \u0027why did this man die?\u0027. The attitude was from relatives \u0027thank you doctor for doing all you did\u0027. It was different.\"  Following his National Service in Nigeria, Dr Boyd worked at various hospitals including the Eastern General Hospital in Edinburgh, where he was based in the department of respiratory disease alongside Sir John Crofton, the famous pioneer of the \u0027Edinburgh Method\u0027 which helped eradicate tuberculosis.  \"He was a fantastic man,\" said Dr Boyd. \"He was not only a brilliant physician and researcher, but he was a very humane man.\"  Later, seeking a consultant post, Dr Boyd became the first ever consultant physician employed by the NHS in Caithness and Sutherland when he took up a post at Caithness Central Hospital in 1964.  He was tasked with setting up the region\u0027s first acute medical unit, which served a population of around 35,000-40,000 people. Besides Dr Boyd and his senior house officer, the staff consisted of one consultant surgeon, a consultant obstetrician, an anaesthetist and a GP.  Dr Boyd said: \"It was fine, but I found the isolation as a consultant hospital doctor something which worried me. I\u0027d always been in the situation where if there was problems you always had somebody to spark off - but there was nobody.  \"I began to think \u0027I\u0027m going to develop a God Almighty syndrome here\u0027, that everything I say is correct. I missed that contact, so I came back to Edinburgh in 1970.\"  The remainder of his career, until he retired from clinical work in 1988, was spent in the capital.  More recently, he has experienced the NHS as a patient - having coronary stents and a pacemaker fitted - but also through his granddaughter, who is a GP.  \"Her stories of pressure on beds - I don\u0027t remember that quite so much,\" said Dr Boyd. \"We were certainly busy and we worked long hours, but we enjoyed them. We didn\u0027t have the problem of the elderly so much though. Being 75 back then - you were really old. Being 91, as I am, that was unheard of.\""},{"url":null,"title":"uk-government-urged-to-reconsider-rejection-of-glasgow-safe-injection-room","story":"  Council leader Susan Aitken and city convener for health and social care, Mhairi Hunter, responded to the Home Office following its refusal of the policy.  It only just preceded the announcement that Scotland has the highest drug-related death rates in Europe \u0026ndash around 30 per cent are in Glasgow.  A safer drugs consumption facility (SDCF) would help tackle the problem that killed more than 200 in the city last year, its proponents believe.  The letter to Victoria Atkins MP, Under Secretary of State for Crime, stated: \u0026ldquoWe note that other countries have successfully introduced DCRs within strict legislative frameworks similar to those that operate in the UK.  The UK Government had referred to addicts travelling from Sweden to Jutland, Denmark, to use a similar clinic.  But the councillors told how the chance of people travelling to Glasgow for the facility was unlikely due to the low income and homeless demographic that would use it.  No change to the current laws concerning supply of heroin is being sought by the council.  Special training and strict protocols will be in place for staff working in the centre.  Given the rise in drug deaths, all parties in the council are supportive of the plan.  In 2017, 934 drug-related deaths were recorded in Scotland, an eight per cent increase on 2016.  The figure is going up and up every year on average since 1997, when just 200 deaths were recorded.  The overwhelming majority are related to heroin, according to the National Records of Scotland.  Ms Hunter and Ms Aitken\u0026rsquos letter added: \u0026ldquoIn terms of day to day ethical dilemmas, clinicians employed in such a service will have considerable experience of working with drug users and will operate within their existing codes of professional practice.  \u0026ldquoWe have around 30 years of experience within Glasgow of running needle exchanges, opiate replacement therapy and outreach services to drug users, and therefore a significant body of existing knowledge, experience and transferrable skills.  At a recent council meeting, Ms Hunter said: \u0026ldquo[The letter] from the Home Office was actually a lot more positive than it might have first appeared... I think the first time we\u0026rsquove seen the Home Office acknowledge the benefits of the facility."},{"url":null,"title":"chequers-talks-cabinet-agrees-to-uk-european-union-free-trade-area-for-goods","story":"  Plans have been thrashed out by ministers and Theresa May after meeting for the day at Chequers.  The Prime Minister had summoned senior ministers to decide on the UK\u0027s future relationship with Brussels.  The entire Cabinet, including ministers who are not full members but attend meetings, arrived one by one by car at Chequers on Friday morning in time for discussions to start at 10am.  In a three-page document released this evening, the agreed plans state that the ministers had \"agreed to a more developed\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspcomprehensive proposal for\u0026nbspthe \u0026nbspeconomic partnership. \u0026nbsp  At \u0026nbspthe\u0026nbspcore of\u0026nbspthis\u0026nbspproposal is\u0026nbspthe establishment \u0026nbspby\u0026nbspthe\u0026nbspUK\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspthe\u0026nbspEU\u0026nbspof\u0026nbspa\u0026nbspfree\u0026nbsptrade\u0026nbsparea\u0026nbspfor\u0026nbspgoods,\" it read.  Under the Government\u0027s plans the UK would be free to diverge from EU rules over services, a major part of the British economy, with ministers acknowledging this will reduce the levels of access available to European markets.  Brussels will be reluctant to consider any plan which would risk splitting the single market, and ministers appeared to acknowledge this by agreeing to step up preparations for a \"no deal\" Brexit.  Mrs May said she hoped the proposals would enable talks with the EU to move forward.  Going into Chequers the Prime Minister was under pressure as the Cabinet was split, with Brexit Secretary David Davis understood to have major reservations about both the plan and whether Brussels would even consider it seriously.  But it is understood that all members of the Cabinet have signed up to the proposals and none of them have decided to quit rather than back the plan.  The \"common rulebook\" for goods could reduce the UK\u0027s flexibility to strike trade deals with other countries, particularly the US which would want an agreement allowing its farm products, produced to different standards, into the British market.  It would also involve the UK paying \"due regard\" to European Court of Justice rulings relating to the rules Britain will share with Brussels, potentially softening the Prime Minister\u0027s red line on the jurisdiction of judges in Luxembourg.  But the Prime Minister said the Cabinet had agreed a \"collective position\" on the future of the negotiations with the EU.  \"Our proposal will create a UK-EU free trade area which establishes a common rule book for industrial goods and agricultural products,\" she said.  \"This maintains high standards in these areas, but we will also ensure that no new changes in the future take place without the approval of our Parliament.  \"As a result, we avoid friction in terms of trade, which protects jobs and livelihoods, as well as meeting our commitments in Northern Ireland.  \"We have also agreed a new business-friendly customs model with freedom to strike new trade deals around the world. \"  Elements of the plan, which will be formally presented in a White Paper next week, were revealed in a three-page summary.  They include:  - The UK committing to \"ongoing harmonisation\" with EU rules on goods to ensure frictionless trade at ports and the border with Ireland  - A \"joint institutional framework\" would provide for the consistent interpretation and application of UK-EU agreements, with British courts ruling on cases in Britain and EU courts in the EU but a joint committee and independent arbitration settling disputes  - A new \"facilitated customs arrangement\" would remove the need for checks and controls by treating the UK and EU as if they were a \"combined customs territory\"  - The UK would effectively impose EU tariffs at the border for goods intended for the bloc but would \"control its own tariffs for trade with the rest of the world\"  - Free movement of people will end, but a \"mobility framework\" will ensure UK and EU citizens can continue to travel to each other\u0027s territories and apply to study or work  Mrs May said: \"Next week we will be publishing a White Paper which will set out more details of how we will be taking back control of our money, laws and borders.  \"Now we must all move at pace to negotiate our proposal with the EU to deliver the prosperous and secure future all our people deserve.\"  Ahead of the formal announcement of the deal, Tory Brexiteers warned that Mrs May\u0027s position could be under threat if she watered down her red lines.  Leading Brexiteer David Jones, a former minister at Mr Davis\u0027s Department for Exiting the EU, said the proposed deal breached all three of Mrs May\u0027s red lines of leaving the single market, customs union and jurisdiction of the ECJ.  Describing the plan as \"not very good at all\", Mr Jones told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today that it would deliver \"something less than the full Brexit we have had repeated promises of by the PM and Cabinet members\".  Andrea Jenkyns, who quite as a ministerial aide in order to speak more freely about Brexit, said she would be willing to help trigger a leadership contest if the deal left the UK \"one foot in, one foot out\" of the EU.  \"I am not a hypocrite,\" the Morley and Outwood MP said in an interview recorded for the BBC\u0027s Sunday Politics in Yorkshire and Lincolnshire.  \"I am standing up for the 17.4 million people who wanted these red lines and who wanted to ensure we did not have a half in-half out Brexit.\"  And Stewart Jackson, a former MP now the senior aide to the Brexit Secretary, tweeted a link to a story about a poll warning that \"Tories will lose votes if they cross Brexit red lines\"."},{"url":null,"title":"theresa-may-defies-odds-and-secures-cabinet-deal-on-brexit-strategy","story":"  Amid talk of mass resignations, the Prime Minister performed a political high-wire act to finally agree a deal to align Britain\u0026rsquos rules with the rest of Europe on goods, including agricultural produce a move set to confound her critics and infuriate hard Brexiteers, who claimed this would make the UK a \u0026ldquovassal state of the EU.  After almost 12 hours of thrashing out the pros and cons of her proposed customs plan during a Cabinet away-day in her country retreat at Chequers, Mrs May issued a dramatic statement.  She said: \u0026ldquoToday in detailed discussions, the Cabinet has agreed our collective position for the future of our negotiations with the EU.  \u0026ldquoOur proposal will create a UK-EU free trade area, which establishes a common rule-book for industrial goods and agricultural products. This maintains high standards in these areas but we will also ensure that no new changes in the future take place without the approval of our Parliament.  \u0026ldquoAs a result, we avoid friction in terms of trade, which protects jobs and livelihoods, as well as meeting our commitments in Northern Ireland.  She went on: \u0026ldquoWe have also agreed a new business-friendly customs model with freedom to strike new trade deals around the world.  \u0026ldquoNext week we will be publishing a White Paper, which will set out more details of how we will be taking back control of our money, laws and borders.  \u0026ldquoNow we must all move at pace to negotiate our proposal with the EU to deliver the prosperous and secure future all our people deserve, added Mrs May, who is expected to make a Commons statement on Monday to set out in detail to MPs her proposed way forward on Brexit.  Despite talk of possible resignations by the likes of Boris Johnson, the Foreign Secretary, and David Davis, the Brexit Secretary, none had materialised.  Earlier, Nicola Sturgeon suggested how the best outcome of the Chequers summit would have been the resignation of the Cabinet\u0026rsquos \u0026ldquohard Brexiteers as this might have signalled a \u0026ldquoglimmer of hope that common sense starts to prevail.  The First Minister warned the worst outcome would be if Mrs May\u0026rsquos colleagues emerged \u0026ldquoarm in arm, saying they\u0027ve agreed, because that means there\u0027s another helping of fudge being served up.  She added if the outcome of the Cabinet\u0026rsquos marathon session was simply an agreement that satisfied the apparently irreconcilable wings of the Tory government, then the \u0026ldquodanger is\u0026hellipthat it will be dead on arrival in Brussels and we will be no further forward in reaching agreement\" with the EU27.  Over a dinner of whiskey and treacle-cured Scottish salmon, Mrs May and her senior colleagues put the finishing touches to their Cabinet deal, which some colleagues and pundits believed impossible. Talk among Brexiteers beforehand had claimed that the PM\u0026rsquos facilitated customs arrangement \u0026ndash a hybrid of the two previous options \u0026ndash was \u0026ldquonot full Brexit and that regulatory alignment with the EU on goods would prevent the UK from striking its own future trade deals.  However, perhaps in a key sign of the agreement to come, Liam Fox, the International Trade Secretary, broke off from a meeting of Brexiteers on Thursday night, organised by Mr Johnson at the Foreign Office, to have private talks with the PM, who sought to reassure him that under her compromise plan future trade deals would be possible.

Organised by the British Council in partnership with several leading media companies, Future News Worldwide aims to identify, connect and train the next generation of journalists by giving them rare access to respected international editors, broadcasters and reporters.    Last month, the BBC issued a public apology to Ms Gracie after admitting she had been told she would be paid in line with North America editor Jon Sopel, whose salary is in the \u0026pound200,000-\u0026pound250,000 range.  When she took up the job of China editor she was paid \u0026pound135,000.  Mark Wood, former editor-in-chief of Reuters and chairman of the Future News Advisory Board, said it was a privilege to have journalists of Ms Gracie\u0026rsquos calibre at the three-day conference, which ended yesterday.  \u0026ldquoFuture News Worldwide 2018 is a unique event that gives young journalists from around the world the opportunity to meet and learn from some of the most outstanding media figures of our time, he added.  \u0026ldquoAs well as focussing on high-quality, reliable journalism, they will take part in workshops that equip them to deal with all forms of digital communication.  \u0026ldquoAt a time when the demand for trustworthy news has never been greater, this conference will help plant the roots of dependable, quality journalism in countries around the world.

The plans, which still have to be assessed by the 27 other nations of the EU, would result in the creation of a UK-EU free trade area for goods, with a \"common rulebook\".  Meanwhile a new \"facilitated customs arrangement\" would remove the need for checks and controls by treating the UK and EU as if they were a \"combined customs territory\".  Ms Sturgeon, who has been vocal in calling for the UK to remain part of both the European customs union and single market, said the plan had \"more realism in it than we\u0027ve seen before from UK government\" - although she added \"that\u0027s not saying much\".  But she raised concerns about its \"sheer complexities\", and said there could still be \"massive unresolved questions about acceptability to EU\", adding that the plan \"still reads like cherry picking\".  However, she stressed: \"Perhaps key point is this - if this becomes the UK starting point in negotiations, it is surely game on for those who would prefer to see a full single market/customs union outcome.\"  The First Minister made the points in a series of tweets, also noting that it \"still remains to be seen if PM can hold her dysfunctional party together on it\".  Leading Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg has already warned he will have to wait to see \"have the red lines been turned pink\", as he claimed the proposals could be worse than a no-deal Brexit.  Speaking on BBC Radio 4 he said: \"As with eggs: An egg that is very softly boiled isn\u0027t boiled at all. A very soft Brexit means that we haven\u0027t left, we are simply a rule-taker. That is not something that this country voted for, it is not what the Prime Minister promised.\"  However, Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson said the newly outlined Brexit plan would deliver for Scotland in three key areas.  She said: \"The proposals agreed at Chequers are welcome and provide clarity as the UK government moves to the next round of negotiations with the EU.  \"For Scotland, they deliver in three key areas - providing Scottish business with frictionless access to the EU market withdrawing the Scottish fishing industry from the hated Common Fisheries Policy and, by ensuring no border in the Irish Sea, bolstering Scotland\u0027s biggest and most important market, the UK internal market.\"  Ms Davidson added: \"There are further commitments to upholding shared high standards in goods, agriculture and the environment, which are to be welcomed.\"  The Tory hit out at Ms Sturgeon\u0027s SNP, claiming Scottish nationalists had \"used the Brexit referendum as a pretext for pulling our country apart\".  Ms Davidson insisted: \"Now is the time to put differences aside. The UK is leaving the EU. On the table is a pragmatic set of proposals that go a long way to addressing the concerns of those worried about the economic impacts of a \u0027hard\u0027 Brexit.  \"An admission from the SNP that such fears have been largely addressed would help reassure Scotland\u0027s business, agri-foods and fishing communities.\""},{"url":null,"title":"corbyn-pm-must-get-agreement-on-brexit-plan-or-call-general-election","story":"  The Labour leader\u0026rsquos comments came after his shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer said the party was not ruling out a second referendum on the terms of the UK\u0026rsquos exit from the European Union.

It will provide on-board workshops, spare parts storage, crane and office facilities but will get supplies from another large vessel. By contrast the BOWL project will use smaller crew transfer vessels on a daily basis to provide crew and supplies.\u0026ldquoIt is just a different strategy being used at MORL and we could not accommodate that size of vessel at Wick as we do not have the shelter and water depth required, he said. \u0026ldquoIf we had our new quay at Shaltigoe we would have been able to accommodate it.But Mr Watt is confident the harbour will still play a part in servicing the MORL project and in other renewable projects in the Moray Firth basin.

Hopes were high this project could come to Wick. There have been a lot of improvements going on at the harbour which has the potential for a positive future.\u0026ldquoI hope other projects can come to Wick and I look forward to seeing improvements on the platform the BOWL project creates for the town and the community in general.

Its total value was said to be between \u0026pound150 million and \u0026pound300m.Work on that contract is expected to get under way in September with three launches due to be completed by November next year.The orders will see the company\u0026rsquos local workforce increase from around 30, at present, to up to 160.\u0026ldquoThis will give us continual work in Caithness until 2020, although there will be peaks and troughs along the way \u0026ndash but this is great news all round, Mr Watt added.Jonathan Tame, company vice president for the UK and Canada, said: \u0026ldquoWe are pleased to have the opportunity to bring our extensive expertise to a project of this importance.\u0026ldquoIn doing so it demonstrates Shell\u0026rsquos confidence in our value-adding solutions, and continues a successful North Sea collaboration that has been in place since 1984.The Penguins field was discovered in 1974 and first developed in 2002.The three pipeline bundles for Statoil will involve the largest diameter pipe assembled in the far north.The bulk of the fabrication will be done in Caithness, with design and project management work due to be undertaken at Subsea7\u0026rsquos premises in Aberdeen and at Stavanger in Norway.At the time that order was announced in December last year, Mr Watt said: \u0026ldquoIt is good to have Statoil back. The last bundle we did for them was in 2003.\u0026ldquoIt is an important project and shows pipeline bundles are the preference for developing the North Sea sector. It is the right product at the right time.The Statoil order will include pipeline bundles and control umbilicals required for the development.The Snorre field is sited within the Tampen area of the Norwegian North Sea.Since the last pipeline was launched in Caithness in March last year, the company has refurbished the rail track which is used to transport the bundles to the sea and on to the tugs before being taken to their destination.Saturday 7 Jul 2018 6:42 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116401.jpg","title":"Sunny conditions set to continue all week in Caithness","story":"\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCAITHNESS and other parts of the north are set to enjoy more dry and settled conditions under gin-blue skies coupled with virtually unbroken sunshine for the remainder of the week and beyond.On Sunday afternoon the air temperature in Wick peaked at 21.6C (70.9F).\u0026nbspLast Thursday morning the town witnessed a high of 22.5C (72.5F), making it the warmest day in the burgh for any day in June since 2011.The highest temperature recorded in Wick since 1910 is currently 26.7C (80.1F), witnessed on June 6, 1939.

The move would save \u0026pound300,000.Five of the proposed closures were in Caithness and included Thurso harbour, the Camps at Wick, Halkirk, Keiss and Lybster.The council hoped nearby local businesses would adopt the Highland Comfort Scheme and provide public toilets at their premises in exchange for a monthly fee.But there was widespread opposition throughout the north to the closure plan which was seen as damaging to the area and its tourism industry.Caithness civic leader Willie Mackay backs the reprieve.\u0026ldquoI absolutely welcome this, he said. \u0026ldquoThis review will give us the opportunity to look at local needs and those of the tourists. It may also give us an incentive to reintroduce the comfort scheme and think about other ways of running the public toilets.\u0026ldquoIf we could get a fixed rate for things like electricity and get development trusts or local communities to look after the toilets that would be a great help. I am pretty confident we could get people throughout the county to help out.\u0026ldquoElectricity companies make huge amounts of money and a little consideration from them would go a long way.Highland Council announced the review after it listened to feedback from communities across the north.Councillor Allan Henderson, the chairman of environment, development and infrastructure, said there is \u0026ldquono quick fix to the problem.But he added: \u0026ldquoThis is about working with communities and potential Highland Comfort Scheme providers to enable a different public toilet delivery model that is sustainable and affordable in local communities.The decision means the toilets under threat of closure will now remain open until the end of October.The controversy over the proposed toilet closure plan has led to local MP Jamie Stone writing to First Minister Nicola Sturgeon.In his letter he stresses the contribution tourism makes to the local economyHe describes the plan as \u0026ldquoa backward step which will lead to \u0026ldquogreat inconvenience for locals and visitors alike and said it is being driven by the need to make budget savings.The Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross MP asked the First Minister if additional financial support could be provided to keep the toilets open.\u0026ldquoAny help that can be afforded by the Scottish Government would be very gratefully received by the Highland Council and the people of my constituency, he said.Meanwhile, Highland Council has agreed to review its car-parking policy.The local authority\u0026rsquos redesign board has recommended a new \u0026ldquovision for parking that will addresses traffic management, integrated transport and local economic growth and tourism. It will be \u0026ldquoapplied consistently and fairly across Highland, a council spokeswoman said.Under the plan, the budget and decisions on parking would be devolved to local committees with revenue reinvested locally.Saturday 7 Jul 2018 6:42 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116272.jpg","title":"Wick High School pupils light up UK Apps for Good finals with bike success","story":"\u0026nbspThey won the Emerging Technology award at the UK Apps for Good finals in London on Wednesday night after wowing the competition judges with their Light Bike \u0026ndash which deploys smart lights to help cyclists safe and visible.The pupils \u0026ndash Nicholas Mann (13), from Ulbster, Caleb James (14), from Kirk, Lewis Buchan (14), Russell Mackenzie (13) and Steven Gunn (16), all Wick \u0026ndash were led by their computing science teacher Chris Aitken.Speaking after the finals at London\u0026rsquos Rich Mix venue, Mr Aitken said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore absolutely delighted to have won the Emerging Technology award at the UK Apps for Good finals.

This follows a wave of criticism towards bus services in the county, which saw members of the public brand Stagecoach \u0026#8220a disgrace.\u0026#8221The hearing was called to consider failings in relation to the provision of contracted school services and local bus services, many of which were caused by vehicle breakdowns. The traffic commissioner was concerned about the standard of vehicle roadworthiness and presentation.In particular she heard evidence from the Stagecoach Managing Director in Scotland, Mr Robert Andrew, who took the opportunity to apologise in public to OIC officials for the company’s failures. The inquiry also saw representatives from the council give evidence.After hearing this evidence, as well as making a visit to the bus operator’s Kirkwall depot, Miss Aitken also made an order to reduce the number of vehicles authorised on licence held by Highland Country Buses Ltd — the subsidiary of Stagecoach which serves the Highlands and Islands. Of the 210 vehicles which had been licensed, 30 will  now be unlicensed until Miss Aitken is satisfied with the compliance of the company to its licenses and contracts.In response to this, Stagecoach North Scotland managing director, David Liston, said: \u0026#8220We understand the importance of reliable and high-quality bus services to local communities in the Highlands and Islands.\u0026#8220Since these issues arose, we have taken steps to ensure that there are robust maintenance and operational processes in place across our business in the north of Scotland, and we are continuing to focus in particular on fleet reliability and presentation.\u0026#8220We understand the frustrations local people have at times expressed and we would like to reassure our customers that we are working hard to deliver better bus services. In her decision, the Traffic Commissioner has asked that we make a contribution totalling £20,500 to the schools in Orkney, and we are happy to do so.\u0026#8220We are currently arranging for this sum to be paid to Orkney Islands Council for onward payment to the schools.\u0026#8221The Traffic commissioner has clarified that this payment of  £20,500 is not compensatory in nature and does not affect any contractual obligations between the Council and Stagecoach. It is, rather, an ex gratia payment. The Traffic Commissioner decided on this course of action rather than ordering a payment to be made to Scottish Government.This sum is to be split between schools in the county:Orkney Islands Council has responded positively to this decision by the traffic commissioner.\u0026#8220We welcome the outcome of the public inquiry called by the Traffic Commissioner held in Kirkwall on June 5, particularly the decision to distribute the payment locally to our schools,\u0026#8221 a council spokeswoman said.\u0026#8220We’ll continue to work closely with the Traffic Commissioner and Stagecoach on service improvements.”\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Each of the three winding barrels will have a small motor fitted, and a sensor, which will automatically detect when the clock has wound down to a certain level. In addition, the clock will also be fitted with a pendulum regulator, which will ensure the clock time is more accurate.Cathedral custodian Fran Hollinrake said: \u0026#8220It is the end of an era. It was always a great workout climbing the tower stairs and manually winding the clock, but it was just becoming too impractical with all our other duties. The clock will still be the clock, it will just have a couple of new bits added on.\u0026#8221The previous clock on St Magnus Cathedral dated from 1761, and was made by Hugh Gordon, a clockmaker in Aberdeen. But during the early 20th century, as part of the Sheriff Thoms bequest, a new timepiece was commissioned that would see the cathedral through the 20th century and beyond. The present clock was made when the world was at war, in 1915, although it was not actually installed until 1919, the same week that the Treaty of Versailles was signed that ended the First World War.James Ritchie and Son (Clockmakers) was founded in 1809, and the company specialised in large steeple and public clocks, both making and restoring. If you are familiar with Princes Street Gardens in Edinburgh, you will know the world-famous Floral Clock, not far from Waverley Station. It was made in 1903 by Ritchie\u0026#8217s, and was the first of its kind in the world.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Her husband passed away in January 2012.Asked the secret of her long life, she said: \"I\u0026rsquove been asked this before and I always say \u0026lsquopure living\u0026rsquo, but of course it\u0026rsquos not!

What you’ll need:              • 500g Canadian strong white bread flour (or a flour with a high gluten content, i.e. at least 14 per cent) • 30g lard or vegetable shortening • 10g sugar • 10g salt • 5g fast action yeast             • 400ml cold water For the Coating • 50g plain flour • 50g rice cones/flourView our STEP BY STEP GALLERY HERE            Method: 1 Rub the fat into the flour in a large mixing bowl. Stir in the sugar, salt and yeast. 2 Now pour in the water and mix until it is all incorporated. This is a wet dough but when you are using bread flour with such a high gluten content it can easily take that much water without becoming sloppy. 3 Remove the dough from the bowl and knead it for 1 minute until the dough has just become smooth with all the ingredients thoroughly combined. 4 With such a long ferment you don’t need to knead it too much. Put the dough back into the bowl and cover loosely with cling film. Put the bowl in the refrigerator to leave it to ferment for 12 – 16 hours.             5 The next morning combine the rice cones and plain flour for the coating. Take a large baking sheet and dust it liberally with the coating mixture (make sure to leave enough to coat the rolls). 6 Empty the dough on to a work surface which has been liberally dusted with the rice/flour coating mixture. This is where a large silicone spatula or scraper is useful. 7 Now using a dough scraper divide the dough into 8 pieces. Don’t worry if it is sticky or messy as these rolls aren’t supposed to look perfect. 8 Dust your fingers with the coating mixture and take each piece of dough, one at a time, and dip it into the coating mixture and place it on the baking sheet. They don’t need to be in the shape of a roll but try to keep in the air that is inside the dough. 9 Do this with each piece, placing them near to each other so that when they rise they will bake together. Despite the stickiness of this dough the coating mixture works wonders for stopping the dough from sticking to everything. Leave them to rise for 1 – 2 hours or until doubled in size. 10 Bake in a 250˚C preheated oven on a high shelf for 15 – 20 minutes or until the tops are dark. The rolls should be well fired for the right flavour.• Recipe submitted by Fraser Wright Read more: The history of morning rolls, including a recipe for making your ownRead more: A history of the square sausage, including a recipe for making your own"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4765629.1530965023!/image/image.jpg","title":"nicola sturgeon it s game on for keeping uk in single market","story":"        Nicola Sturgeon has declared it is \u0026#8220game on\u0026#8221 for campaigners hoping to keep the UK in the single market and the customs union after Brexit, after the Cabinet signed up to plans which could keep the UK closely tied to Brussels.

The plans, which still have to be assessed by the 27 other nations of the EU, would result in the creation of a UK-EU free trade area for goods, with a “common rulebook”.Meanwhile a new “facilitated customs arrangement” would remove the need for checks and controls by treating the UK and EU as if they were a “combined customs territory”.Ms Sturgeon, who has been vocal in calling for the UK to remain part of both the European customs union and single market, said the plan had “more realism in it than we’ve seen before from UK government” - although she added “that’s not saying much”.But she raised concerns about its “sheer complexities”, and said there could still be “massive unresolved questions about acceptability to EU”, adding that the plan “still reads like cherry picking”.However, she stressed: “Perhaps key point is this - if this becomes the UK starting point in negotiations, it is surely game on for those who would prefer to see a full single market/customs union outcome.”            The First Minister made the points in a series of tweets, also noting that it “still remains to be seen if PM can hold her dysfunctional party together on it”.Leading Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg has already warned he will have to wait to see “have the red lines been turned pink”, as he claimed the proposals could be worse than a no-deal Brexit.Speaking on BBC Radio 4 he said: “As with eggs: An egg that is very softly boiled isn’t boiled at all. A very soft Brexit means that we haven’t left, we are simply a rule-taker. That is not something that this country voted for, it is not what the Prime Minister promised.”However, Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson said the newly outlined Brexit plan would deliver for Scotland in three key areas.            She said: “The proposals agreed at Chequers are welcome and provide clarity as the UK government moves to the next round of negotiations with the EU.“For Scotland, they deliver in three key areas - providing Scottish business with frictionless access to the EU market withdrawing the Scottish fishing industry from the hated Common Fisheries Policy and, by ensuring no border in the Irish Sea, bolstering Scotland’s biggest and most important market, the UK internal market.”Ms Davidson added: “There are further commitments to upholding shared high standards in goods, agriculture and the environment, which are to be welcomed.”The Tory hit out at Ms Sturgeon’s SNP, claiming Scottish nationalists had “used the Brexit referendum as a pretext for pulling our country apart”.Ms Davidson insisted: “Now is the time to put differences aside. The UK is leaving the EU. On the table is a pragmatic set of proposals that go a long way to addressing the concerns of those worried about the economic impacts of a ‘hard’ Brexit.            “An admission from the SNP that such fears have been largely addressed would help reassure Scotland’s business, agri-foods and fishing communities.”READ MORE - Nicola Sturgeon snubbed by Donald Trump in plans for UK trip"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4765532.1530903746!/image/image.jpg","title":"john mclellan closing private schools makes inequality worse","story":"        Pricing out middle-class will create ever-more exclusive institutions, writes John McLellan.                Class warriors of the nation rejoice: one bourgeois institution down, just 69 to go. That bastion of inequality and privilege in Central Scotland, Beaconhurst School, is no more. Cliftonhall, Lomond, St Columba’s ... we’re coming for you next.            In the face of increasing pressure on costs and fees, and the prospect of the loss of charitable rates relief in 2020-21, Beaconhurst announced a merger with Morrison’s Academy, 20 miles away in Crieff, with the hope that its Bridge of Allan campus could be maintained for its junior school pupils in a satellite operation.            But by Wednesday the game was up. The school conceded the exodus of families making their own arrangements – many would have been put off by the prospect of a 40-mile round-trip to the senior school and Dollar Academy is nearer – meant the deal was no longer viable. Beaconhurst will cease to exist and the buildings will probably be sold for development, almost certainly houses, given how quickly a nearby Cala estate sold out. Regular trains to Glasgow and Edinburgh mean Bridge of Allan and Dunblane properties go for Edinburgh prices.Beaconhurst joins Westbourne, Laurel Bank, St Denis and Cranley and, eight years ago, St Margaret’s in Edinburgh, on the list of defunct private schools and it won’t be the last if the rate of fee increases continues to outstrip earnings and closes off the option for more families. Not that independent schools ever expect much sympathy from the Scottish political establishment, but in the last academic year the sector has been subjected to sustained pressure, particularly the confirmation in December of the Scottish Government’s plan to end charitable rates relief.READ MORE: Beaconhurst school in Bridge of Allan ‘likely to close’ following mergerThe argument that the tax change only addressed an anomaly – whereby state schools did not receive rates relief and paid the full amount – was a red herring because the payment was just an accounting device in which councils effectively paid themselves from one part of their books to another.            With a bill totalling about £5m a year for the sector, the impact on fees has been estimated at between £200-£300 a year on day fees of £12,000, or about two per cent. With fee increases now running well ahead of inflation, such as the five per cent just announced at George Watson’s, by the time charitable relief disappears senior school day fees could easily be hitting £14,000. For families with two children at senior school, finding £28,000 represents a net weekly income of £538 which is just £56 below the average UK household income, according to the latest “Living Standards, Poverty and Inequality” report from the Institute of Fiscal Studies. On the reasonable presumption that the average UK family does not have two kids at private school, it’s a fair guess that to meet school fees on top of all other living costs will require a net weekly income of just over £1,000, which is into the top five percent of earnings and a gross income in the region of £70,000. Even in a wealthy city like Edinburgh where a quarter of the total school population, over 11,000 children, are privately educated, that’s a lot of families who have to be right at the top of the wages league over a long period of time for this to be sustainable.Private school critics, like Labour’s Lord George Foulkes and Green MSP Andy Wightman, will shed few tears at the prospect of more parents rejecting the private option because of cost, but far from tackling inequality it will only make it worse as the offspring of the ultra-affluent are concentrated in fewer, more exclusive institutions bankrolled by international elites.Deliberately squeezing private education through punitive taxes is also a disincentive for the schools to increase their work with the state sector, calling into question collaborative projects like the Swire Chinese Language Centre Edinburgh at George Watson’s, a joint venture with James Gillespie’s and Boroughmuir. It’s now being extended to other schools. At the same time, Edinburgh council couldn’t even build the new Boroughmuir big enough to meet its basic needs in the coming years. The list of joint projects between private and state is lengthy and benefits both, but the unfortunate lesson of last year for the independent sector is why go to the trouble when the reward is a political kicking?             READ MORE: John McLellan: A strange obsession with expensive tramsA bursary to inspireA former contributor to The Scotsman’s sports pages, the teacher, ex-Hutchesons’ Grammar depute rector, and latterly popular after-dinner-speaker, Sandy Strang died after a very short illness last year and the school has just announced the establishment of the Sandy Strang Bursary Project thanks to a donation of £100,000 from his estate.The school needs to raise a minimum of a further £300,000 to build a sustainable fund, which will be used to widen access to more pupils from less well-off backgrounds and hopes Strang’s mantra that “much is expected from those to whom much is given” will inspire the hundreds of people he influenced as a teacher to donate. I‘m in.Booty-licious route to a job            If there was one thing Sandy Strang understood, it was rigorous application, and a couple of weeks ago I wrote about the importance of university graduates understanding their degree classifications were worth less than a CV packed with extra-curricular activities and work experience. Not so at The Spectator magazine, run by this paper’s former political editor, Fraser Nelson, where a strict “no CVs” policy applies to applications for paid internships.Sandy would have appreciated the stiff set of tasks set for hopefuls, such as provide “a one-page summary on the dismal state of the German military” and “suggest three guests for a podcast discussion on the recent Slovakian crisis”. But he would have loved the demand for “socioeconomic support for any two Beyoncé lyrics”. Like, perhaps, Booty-licious?Says Nelson: “We don’t care where, when or even whether you went to university.” But what if you don’t like Beyoncé?Anyone but England\u2028And finally to Russia and this afternoon’s big game, which Cambridge football blue Strang would have relished. An English friend on business in Dublin earlier this week was treated to some World Cup wisdom from a local taxi driver bemoaning the lack of an Irish presence. “I’m supporting whoever is playing England, but don’t get me wrong I want England to win ... Otherwise I won’t know who to support in the next round.”"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4765522.1530903397!/image/image.jpg","title":"leader comment would independent scotland support a big military","story":"        While it is widely accepted that the United Kingdom will never again be a global superpower, it still has one of the world\u0026#8217s most powerful armed forces.                The Global Firepower ranking for 2018 puts the UK military in sixth place, behind the US, Russia, China, India and France. And some experts suggest this ranking actually underestimates the capabilities of technologically advanced countries with Professor Malcolm Chalmers, deputy director-general of the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi), suggesting in 2014 that even China would be “out-matched qualitatively in a ‘straight fight’ with the UK in an equidistant location”. The UK is also one of only eight Nato countries that spend more than two per cent of GDP on defence.            So, it would appear that the UK punches more than its weight when it comes to military matters.            READ MORE: Stewart McDonald: Get defence of the north right or risk losing ScotlandHowever, it has now emerged that the number of Ministry of Defence jobs in Scotland fell by more than 12 per cent to 13,930 between 2012 and this year, with the SNP’s Maree Todd describing the cuts as “devastating” and adding that there was “barely a community that isn’t being hammered as the Tories grind down our armed forces [and] hollow out Scotland’s proud military past”. This, however, begs the question of what Scotland’s military would be like if it became an independent country.The Sustainable Growth Commission report says Scotland’s armed forces would number “around 12,600” on a pro-rata population share of the UK’s current strength, with a further civilian defence staff of less than 700. So it would appear from these two sets of figures that, despite the reduction in numbers, Scotland still has a slightly higher number of armed forces’ jobs than it would have on a pro-rata basis.Of course, as the SNP rightly points out, Scotland has a long military history and could choose to increase the number of defence jobs if it became independent.            But the Growth Commission report also forecasts several years of tough public spending choices after independence – described as “austerity” by Labour – until Scotland could catch up with the better economic performance of small countries like Denmark, New Zealand, North and Ireland.So, in those circumstances, would the public be willing to maintain an military that enables Scotland to also punch significantly above its weight? It seems unlikely.READ MORE: Scottish Government raises alarm over military bases in Scotland"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4765599.1530953540!/image/image.jpg","title":"almost 2 000 scottish mod jobs have gone","story":"        The SNP yesterday condemned UK government defence cuts after official figures revealed almost 2,000 Ministry of Defence (MoD) jobs have gone from Scotland in the past six years.                Figures disclosed in an answer to a SNP freedom of information request disclosed that there has been a 12.3 per cent reduction in the MOD headcount north of the Border.            According to the data ,there were 15,880 military and civilian MoD posts north of the border in April 2012.            That had fallen to 13,930 in April this year, a reduction of 1,950 – the equivalent of 12.3 per cent.The statistics, which were provided by the MoD and broken down by local authority area, showed that South Ayrshire had lost all 100 of its military posts and was left with just 20 civilian employees. Other areas to be hit hard were Edinburgh which lost 500 military jobs and Fife, which lost 520 MoD jobs in total.The SNP warned that the situation would get worse as a result of UK government plans to reduce the military footprint in Scotland. Two years ago the UK government announced that eight military sites in Scotland would close in the 16 years, cutting the defence estate by 20 per cent.The bases earmarked for closure included famous barracks such as Fort George in the Highlands, Glencorse Barracks, near Penicuik, and Redford Cavalry Barracks and Redford Infantry Barracks in Edinburgh. Others on the list were Stirling’s Meadowforth Barracks, Naval base MoD Caledonia in Rosyth, Craigiehall Barracks in Edinburgh and Forthside Barracks in Stirling.The closures, which will take place over the next few years, represent a 20 per cent cut to the Scottish defence estate. They are among 56 sites which were announced for closure across the UK.             Highlands and Islands MSP Maree Todd said: “These are devastating figures, which reveal the extent of MoD cuts upon Scotland. There’s barely a community that isn’t being hammered, as the Tories grind down our armed forces, hollow out Scotland’s proud military past and spare little thought for local communities and the jobs that depend on the military.”Scottish Conservative MP Douglas Ross said the UK government had invested heavily in defence. He said: “The SNP have conveniently forgotten that the UK government has invested heavily in defence locations across Scotland.  “You only have to look at  RAF Lossiemouth in Moray to see that. Millions of pounds and hundreds more personnel. Hardly the bleak picture the SNP want to create. The fact is that the main threat to our military capability and the jobs that depend on it is the SNP policy of Scottish independence.”"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4765681.1530983390!/image/image.jpg","title":"theresa may i won t let people down on brexit","story":"        Theresa May defended the Brexit deal struck at Chequers as Downing Street stepped up efforts to win Tory Eurosceptic support for the plan that will keep the UK closely tied to Brussels.                The Prime Minister said the plan thrashed out with the Cabinet was aimed at making sure “we deliver on Brexit for the people because I won’t let people down”.            Mrs May insisted that the UK would regain control of its borders, but refused to rule out giving EU citizens preferential treatment under the future immigration policy.            The Prime Minister’s inner circle is trying to secure support for the proposals to create a new UK-EU free trade area for goods, with a “common rulebook”.READ MORE: It’s ‘game on’ for keeping UK in single marketCabinet Brexiteers have already been persuaded to support the plans after the marathon session of talks at Chequers on Friday, but backbench Eurosceptics have expressed grave doubts.The common rulebook for goods, including food and agricultural products, could limit the UK’s ability to strike trade deals with countries such as the US, for whom securing market access for American farmers would be a big prize.Full details will be published in a white paper on Thursday, with Brussels expecting a round of negotiations in the week commencing July 16.            The Prime Minister told the BBC: “We’re leaving the European Union. I think when people voted to leave the European Union, they wanted an end to free movement - free movement will end.“They wanted us to end the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice in the UK - that will end.“They wanted us to stop sending the vast sums of money every year to the EU that we do today, and so take control of our money, our laws and our borders - and that’s exactly what we will do.“But we’ll do it in a way that protects drops and enhances our economy for the future.”            Repeatedly pressed on whether the new immigration system would offer preferential access to EU citizens, Mrs May said: “We need to look at that in the context of the wider rules we have for immigration from outside of the European Union and we will decide the rules that are right for the UK.”The Prime Minister said that “collective responsibility has returned” to the Cabinet after the Chequers deal and it was now important to get on with negotiating with the EU.“Up till now what we’ve seen from Europe are the proposals that they’ve effectively put to us of being ones that we couldn’t accept,” she said.She said there was a “willingness to sit down and talk” about the plans.The EU’s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier said he was looking forward to the publication of the white paper and the EU would consider whether the proposals are “workable and realistic”.            As well as potentially difficult talks ahead with Brussels,  Mrs May also faces the task of winning over Eurosceptic backbenchers.Jacob Rees-Mogg, leader of the influential European Research Group of pro-Brexit Conservative MPs, warned that a common rulebook could make “trade deals almost impossible” if it meant regulations would have to apply to any goods coming into the UK.He added that “it is possible that this deal is worse” than a “no deal” Brexit.“An egg that is very softly boiled isn’t boiled at all. A very soft Brexit means that we haven’t left, we are simply a rule-taker,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.“That is not something that this country voted for, it is not what the Prime Minister promised.”Backbencher Andrea Jenkyns said she was “awaiting the detail” of the plans before deciding whether to support calls for a leadership contest.Tories are being invited to briefings about the plans, with the Prime Minister set to address Conservative MPs at a meeting in Parliament on Monday.The first briefing was led by Chief Whip Julian Smith and the Prime Minister’s chief of staff Gavin Barwell, with 10 Tory MPs attending the Saturday morning session.James Cleverly, a deputy chairman of the party, said: “I went in there with some concerns as a Brexiteer and I come out with those concerns addressed.”He said the briefings “will massively calm the nerves of people who have been basing their views on the speculation that has been floating around in the media and social media”.Vicky Ford urged colleagues not to get “too hot under the collar” until they had seen the details.Transport Secretary Chris Grayling acknowledged the plans could cause “issues” in future trade talks.Asked what the common rulebook with the EU on food products would mean for the proposed US trade deal, Mr Grayling told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “There may be individual issues to address in future trade talks.”Taoiseach Leo Varadkar spoke to Mrs May about the plans on Saturday.He said he “welcomed proposals from British Government which can input into talks on the future relationship”.“Await detail in white paper late next week before agreeing an EU position,” he said."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4765607.1530960066!/image/image.jpg","title":"scottish airports among those to charge extortionate parking tariffs","story":"        More than two-thirds of airports have raised their parking fees for drivers picking up friends or relatives this summer, according to new analysis.                READ MORE - Leader comment: Edinburgh airport parking charges are a rip off            Thirteen out of 19 airports have hiked their prices for car parks close to terminals that drivers can use when picking up passengers, an RAC study revealed.            The most expensive is London Luton, where it costs £8 for up to 30 minutes’ parking, researchers found.This is compared with £7 for 40 minutes last year.London Stansted in Essex is the second most expensive, with motorists charged £5.50 to park for up to half an hour, followed by Birmingham airport where the fee is £5.10 for no more than one hour.The airports have raised their prices by 50p and 20p respectively this year.Out of four airports with an initial charge of £4, Edinburgh offers the worst value as the fee only gives drivers 15 minutes of parking.            London Heathrow, London Gatwick and Manchester all allow twice as long for the same price.The largest percentage increase in charges has been inflicted on drivers using Southampton airport.Its fee doubled from £1 to £2, although the length of stay has been extended from 10 minutes to a quarter of an hour.RAC spokesman Rod Dennis predicted that many people will be in for a nasty surprise when collecting loved ones at airports this summer.            He said: “With thousands of motorists driving to airports to pick up and drop off friends and family members, many will unfortunately find themselves shocked by some of the extortionate parking tariffs operated by some airports.“Our advice is to check parking fees and time limits well before setting out for an airport this summer so as to avoid a nasty shock.“Drivers should also be aware of just how high some charges can be if they inadvertently stay longer picking up or dropping off than they originally meant to.”A spokesman for London Luton claimed the RAC had “chosen to misrepresent facts”, stating that it offers a “set down area” where drivers can pick up or drop off passengers for a charge of £3 for 10 minutes.Free parking for various lengths of time is offered at car parks further from the terminal building.            London Luton says its parking charges are set to “manage a limited number of spaces” as its short-term car park is currently closed for the construction of a light rail link to the nearest train station and a second multi-storey car park.Parking at airports has been a controversial issue in recent months, with some holidaymakers finding their cars vandalised after parking on nearby residential streets to avoid fees.Passengers using London Luton, Manchester and Liverpool airports are among those affected.Here are the initial fees for using a car park close to airport terminal buildings to pick up passengers, according to the RAC:1.

The proposals, agreed after Theresa May summoned senior ministers to decide on plans for the future relationship with Brussels, will see the UK agree to remain in line with the EU on rules for all goods.            But under the Government’s plans the UK would be free to diverge from EU rules over services, a major part of the British economy, with ministers acknowledging this will reduce the levels of access available to European markets.            Brussels will be reluctant to consider any plan which would risk splitting the single market, and ministers appeared to acknowledge this by agreeing to step up preparations for a “no deal” Brexit.But Mrs May said she hoped the proposals would enable talks with the EU to move forward.Going into Chequers the Cabinet was split, with Brexit Secretary David Davis understood to have major reservations about both the plan and whether Brussels would even consider it seriously.But it is understood that all members of the Cabinet have signed up to the proposals and none of them have decided to quit rather than back the plan.The “common rulebook” for goods could reduce the UK’s flexibility to strike trade deals with other countries, particularly the US which would want an agreement allowing its farm products, produced to different standards, into the British market.            It would also involve the UK paying “due regard” to European Court of Justice rulings relating to the rules Britain will share with Brussels, potentially softening the Prime Minister’s red line on the jurisdiction of judges in Luxembourg.But the Prime Minister said the Cabinet had agreed a “collective position” on the future of the negotiations with the EU.“Our proposal will create a UK-EU free trade area which establishes a common rule book for industrial goods and agricultural products,” she said.“This maintains high standards in these areas, but we will also ensure that no new changes in the future take place without the approval of our Parliament.            “As a result, we avoid friction in terms of trade, which protects jobs and livelihoods, as well as meeting our commitments in Northern Ireland.“We have also agreed a new business-friendly customs model with freedom to strike new trade deals around the world. “Elements of the plan, which will be formally presented in a White Paper next week, were revealed in a three-page summary.They include:- The UK committing to “ongoing harmonisation” with EU rules on goods to ensure frictionless trade at ports and the border with Ireland            - A “joint institutional framework” would provide for the consistent interpretation and application of UK-EU agreements, with British courts ruling on cases in Britain and EU courts in the EU but a joint committee and independent arbitration settling disputes- A new “facilitated customs arrangement” would remove the need for checks and controls by treating the UK and EU as if they were a “combined customs territory”- The UK would effectively impose EU tariffs at the border for goods intended for the bloc but would “control its own tariffs for trade with the rest of the world”- Free movement of people will end, but a “mobility framework” will ensure UK and EU citizens can continue to travel to each other’s territories and apply to study or workMrs May said: “Next week we will be publishing a White Paper which will set out more details of how we will be taking back control of our money, laws and borders.“Now we must all move at pace to negotiate our proposal with the EU to deliver the prosperous and secure future all our people deserve.”Ahead of the formal announcement of the deal, Tory Brexiteers warned that Mrs May’s position could be under threat if she watered down her red lines.Leading Brexiteer David Jones, a former minister at Mr Davis’s Department for Exiting the EU, said the proposed deal breached all three of Mrs May’s red lines of leaving the single market, customs union and jurisdiction of the ECJ.Describing the plan as “not very good at all”, Mr Jones told BBC Radio 4’s Today that it would deliver “something less than the full Brexit we have had repeated promises of by the PM and Cabinet members”.Andrea Jenkyns, who quite as a ministerial aide in order to speak more freely about Brexit, said she would be willing to help trigger a leadership contest if the deal left the UK “one foot in, one foot out” of the EU.“I am not a hypocrite,” the Morley and Outwood MP said in an interview recorded for the BBC’s Sunday Politics in Yorkshire and Lincolnshire.“I am standing up for the 17.4 million people who wanted these red lines and who wanted to ensure we did not have a half in-half out Brexit.”And Stewart Jackson, a former MP now the senior aide to the Brexit Secretary, tweeted a link to a story about a poll warning that “Tories will lose votes if they cross Brexit red lines”.The entire Cabinet, including ministers who are not full members but attend meetings, arrived one by one by car at Chequers on Friday morning in time for discussions to start at 10am.Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said: “It is farcical that it has taken two years for the Cabinet to even attempt to agree a position on the basics of our future relationship with the EU.“On previous form, whatever has apparently been agreed will struggle to survive contact with Tory MPs and members.“This looks like a sticking plaster rather than the Government’s final position.“With just a matter of months of the negotiations left, Theresa May’s ability to deliver Brexit continues to be in doubt.”"},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.\n\nThe project, costing around £6 million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in 2006.

It’s manufacture uses up valuable natural resources but this is a result of human exploitation. This begs the question, why are humans capable of natural behaviour and unnatural behaviour in what seems to be equal measure?  Is it normal and natural to drive cars, fly in ‘planes, build tower blocks, dig for coal, aim to fly to distant planet ? The list is endless. According to the experts, global warming and ice ages have occurred many times and certainly before life as we know it existed.  We are worried about what are threats to our welfare only because it is a seemingly an alien threat . Surely, if we are able to stand outside ourselves, we are now caught up in a “ normal” event. And in our short sighted stupidity we are adding to the dangers. But not causing them.I would venture to suggest that long after life has ceased on  this planet there will still be episodes of change which will also be natural and normal except there won’t be anyone around to grumble, fret or lead campaigns !!\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 19 ","story":"Shetland’s young sports competitors retained their hold on the Stuart Cup at the weekend, with the margin of victory, in the end, being fairly comfortable.\nGoing into the last event of the junior inter-county, the netball, Orkney had to win by 32 points to overhaul the visitors’ lead. Despite a brave and thrilling attempt, resulting in an 11-point victory, realistically the overall result was never really in doubt.\n The Shetland swimmers, led by triple record-breaker Jasmin Smith, once again defeated their hosts by nearly 20 points.\nSuperiority in the water is now a regular occurrence in inter-counties, and the days when Orkney maintained a stranglehold on that event have been confined to distant memory.\nPart of the reason for the continued success could well be the number of swimming clubs around the isles, with Shetland, Lerwick, Delting, South Mainland, Whalsay and the West Side all competing for honours.\nRegular events in Shetland could be just as important as the trips to the mainland, as it helps to forge the competitive element necessary in the inter-county.\nThe only disciplines in which Orkney were successful this year were hockey and netball, where apart from school tournaments in the latter there is no recognised league structure here.\nHuge credit is due to the swimmers and their coaches, and also the many others who put in so much time and effort at the other sports involved in the Stuart Cup.\nHere’s hoping that the hockey and netball contestants will not have long to wait for their own success.\n: : : : : : : :\nOn the subject of hockey, mention needs to be made of former goalkeeper Sarah Couper who is now a qualified A grade umpire.\nShe travelled away last weekend to take charge of two international matches and is off to Swansea today to umpire a home international masters game.\nThis is the pinnacle of officiating in hockey and should be seen as a fine achievement both Couper and the sport in Shetland, which faces the perennial battle for getting a new playing surface.\n: : : : : : : :\nCongratulations are due to the Lerwick Spurs football team which is now through to the fourth round of the Highland Amateur Cup.\nSpurs defeated Ness from the Western Isles 3-0 at Dornoch on Saturday and now face Caithness side Staxigoe in the last-16 clash.\nIt was the first of two successes against a team with the same name in three days and no hangovers were obvious as they returned and picked up an important victory over Ness United in the local premier league on Monday.\nThe other Ness may not mean much to the average Shetland football follower, but some may know it was the club that Angus Murray represented for a long time.\nMurray, who played for Lerwick Thistle for a couple of seasons in the mid-1980s while working at the town’s Co-op, commented on Facebook this week that it was the “wrong half of Lerwick but well done Spurs”.\nHe continued: “The competition is in the doldrums and in need of new talent. It would be quite something if a Shetland team could win it given the logistics. I’ll be watching with interest.”\nPressed on his Shetland connections, Murray went on: “The Spurs of my era were formidable \u0026#8230 Watt Bros, Leask Bros, B Williamson, K Malcolmson et al. I must say I had not heard of Jim Peterson’s passing. A scholar, gentleman and Spurs stalwart, we had many a chat in the Lounge Bar.\n“How removed we are at times. He wrote the The History of Shetland Football 1887-1987, a copy of which I have, one of his many accomplishments I’m sure. All the best in the next games. The competition does islands no favours on balance.”\nMurray, much like the way he used to play, is bang on target here. The tournament organisers do little to help the furthest travelled teams, and Jim Peterson is indeed a massive loss.\nWith the anniversary of the Milne Cup now under two months away, and a competition running (see above) to name Shetland’s greatest team, Murray’s name may be on the minds of a few selectors.\nAnd we could hope that Peterson, although this column is not normally the place for religious connotations, may be looking down and having a dram when the big event happens on 28th July.\n: : : : : : : :\nProfessional footballers, especially in the modern era, obviously have a lot of time on their hands.\nThat could explain why they indulge so much in the absurd tattoos and haircuts which are now commonplace.\nThe latest to make the news is Manchester City’s Raheem Sterling, who has gone and had the image of an AK-47 assault rifle inked on his lower leg.\nSterling, rather bafflingly, claimed the idea was a tribute to his father who was gunned down by a gang in Jamaica when he was just a toddler.\nNot surprisingly Sterling has been criticised by anti-gun campaigners, who demanded he remove the tattoo or be dropped from the England squad.\nRichard Taylor, whose 10-year-old son Damilola died after being attacked by a gang in London, has also accused Sterling of setting a terrible example to fans.\nThe player has now explained that he would never touch a gun and that the tattoo is “unfinished”. Maybe he intends to have a deletion mark added on top of the offending image?\nApparently, Gary Lineker of all people has jumped to Sterling’s defence, claiming it is “weird, unpatriotic and sad” for him to be criticised by the media in such a way prior to the World Cup.\nI’m sorry, but it’s not the fault of newspapers that Sterling appears to be lacking in grey cells. I’ve never been a fan of Lineker, but did think he would show more common sense than this.\nTaylor is correct. It’s a crass act by Sterling and just as daft a move by those who support him.\n: : : : : : : :\nTo end on a more postitive note, surely cyclist Chris Froome has to be one of the UK’s best ever sports performers.\nThe way he destroyed the field to secure the recent Giro d’Italia, the third Grand Tour title he currently holds along with the Tour de France and the Vuelta a España, was incredible.\nSadly this country has not really taken to Froome, otherwise he would have surely already been a recipient of the BBC Sports Personality of the Year award.\nIf he wins another Tour de France this year, which would be his fifth victory, it would be a travesty if he didn’t receive the personality trophy.\nBarring Harry Kane scoring a hat trick in the final and lifting the World Cup for England next month, which I can’t really see happening, hopefully this will be Froome’s year at last.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"kia pro ceed ","story":"3dr Kia pro-ceed sr7, 4 year warranty remaining, one owner, full Kia service history, VGC inside \u0026amp out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 20 ","story":"As I write this all the teams have played at least one match at the World Cup, with hosts Russia and Uruguay becoming first to qualify for the last 16 from group A.\nOn the whole it has been a decent tournament so far, helped by a few shocks along the way and some memorable goals, although perhaps the less said about the commentary and punditry the better.\nFew would have expected Germany to lose to Mexico, or Argentina to be held by Iceland. One of the most remarkable performances in the latter game came from Kari Arnason, recently deemed not good enough by Aberdeen but still able to do a pretty fair job on shackling Lionel Messi.\nThe introduction the Video Assistant Referee system, or VAR as it is commonly known, has caused a few talking points. There was the decision to allow Diego Costa’s first goal for Spain against Portugal, and also to award penalties to France and Sweden against Australia and South Korea respectively.\nThese “assistants” are apparently not even at the game. They are sitting in a office somewhere in Moscow, but bizarrely kitted out in full referees’ uniform!\nWhy on earth they didn’t disallow Switzerland’s equaliser against Brazil is beyond me, however. Everyone seemed to notice Steven Zuber’s push on his marker before making room for himself to head the ball home.\nEveryone that is except the boys in black in Moscow. The ITV panellists were unanimous in their opinion that the goal should have been ruled out. Even Roy Keane, who used to think decapitation was just about permissable, appeared to agree with the others.\nOkay, so we will mention the commentary and punditry. Apart from Keane and Slaven Bilic – I loved it when he said he couldn’t really care less about whether the Swiss leveller should have been allowed or not – there is really no-one who comes with an opinion which makes you think.\nMost of the time they are prattling on about how far England are likely to go, even when the focus is on an entirely different group. And surely it is high time Gary Lineker was pensioned off. His pathetic attempts at puns, which could have been written by a five-year-old, had their day a long time ago.\nMeanwhile in our office “World Cup Sweepstake”, which requires the entrant to basically predict the results all the way through the competition, things aren’t going too badly. Despite obviously getting the Argentina/Iceland and Germany/Mexico games wrong, plus a few others, I remain in contention on the leaderboard.\nSo what about the last 16? I will still stick with the Germans and Argentinians as surely they must improve. My line-up is: Russia v Portugal, Spain v Uruguay, France v Argentina, Croatia v Denmark, Brazil v Sweden, Belgium v Japan, Germany v Switzerland and Senegal v England.\n: : : : : : : :\nThere has already been a healthy entry for our competition to name Shetland’s greatest football team of the past 60 years, but potential selectors still have a week and a half to make their minds up.\nThe main prize, a return trip for two people with car and cabin courtesy of NorthLink Ferries, is definitely not to be sneezed at. And there are also leather footballs from Cee \u0026amp Jays Intersport for the runners-up.\nSo whether you are a subscriber to the theory that the best players all hung their boots up decades ago, or you believe the standard of today is much better than yesteryear, get your thinking caps on and have a look at the details above.

The cricketer with roots connected to these parts was none other than the man of the match himself – batsman Callum MacLeod whose magnificent 140 not out was largely responsible for Scotland’s thrilling win.\nMacLeod’s father Donald attended the Anderson High School in the late 1960s and early 70s. He was a goalkeeper himself, playing for the Ness United team in the Shetland under-18 competitions.\nHe went on to make somewhat of a name for himself as a photographer, working for The Press and Journal and The Scotsman at times before establishing his own business.\nMacLeod (junior) has obviously usurped any success attained by his old man, however. Even before his recent moment of glory he has been an established international batsman, making several centuries at one-day level.\nHe has been good enough to play grade cricket in Sydney, which is no mean feat, has had stints at English counties Warwickshire and Durham and has just signed a contract with Derbyshire.\nIt is going on half a century since I last saw Donald MacLeod, but I know a certain former Whitedale goalkeeper who keeps in touch. If he happens to read this he’ll maybe pass on congratulations from me, and I’m sure a few others, to the family.\n: : : : : : : :\nTwo weeks ago I suggested that having clubs competing in a local league structure could be of great benefit to preparation for junior inter-county sports such as hockey and netball.\nWhile there is no regular junior league set-up in the isles for hockey, it has been pointed out that in netball this exists for primary school-aged players upwards.\nThe sport appears to be thriving at the various age levels, with under-13 and under-17 squads regularly competing on the mainland with success.\nThe Anderson High School team has also regularly sent a team to compete in the Scottish Schools Open competition, where they have performed with distinction over the past few years.\nThe AHS team also plays in division one of the senior netball leagues, while a feeder team called “Hotfooters” was created to provide easier access for youngsters to join the league.\nAccording to the organisers there have been over 1,000 competitive matches in Shetland and 32 competitive matches away from the isles for juniors this season in various leagues and tournaments.\nCoach Sanna Aitken says: “Of course it is disappointing that we lost the junior inter-county this year \u0026#8230 the girls were really gutted.\n“As a coach, I am delighted that the netball continues to be really competitive [with] an incredibly high standard of match demonstrating the hard work and success of the sport and junior set-up in both isles.\n“I am confident when saying the loss was nothing to do with any weaknesses in the local league structure. It just didn’t go our way on the day. Only two years ago it went Shetland’s way where we won on Orkney’s home turf. It’s always a great competitive game.”\nI am happy to set the record straight on this.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"watch viking bus station to get new graffiti mural ","story":"\n\nMarc Delaye, now based in Inverness, will oversee the graffiti project in August.

There is no doubt the English are cute enough to take full advantage of the introduction of VAR system with three penalty kicks so far despatched by captain Harry Kane.\nPenalising defenders for holding at corners and other set pieces is, I have to say, a major step forward. This has been going on for far too long in most levels of football, and thankfully the days of pundits uttering the words “part and parcel of the game” will now be over.\nGrabbing someone in a bear hug is not football – never has been and never will be. I recall a European match some years ago when Glasgow Celtic should have had about six penalties but the referee gave none.\nWhat this needs now is for officials to be in accordance with one another.

A recent poll suggested that only 15 per cent of Scots would support the English while 28 per cent would back anyone playing against them.\nThe same survey found that only two per cent of Scottish National Party voters would get behind England, although I actually find that figure quite high.\nIt does appear to be the case that Scottish football followers have nothing against English players, many of whom they actually admire, but it is those in the press and the media who they reserve their anger for.\nI sincerely hope that England do go all the way. I have always supported them when Scotland are not involved, and in recent years that has become the norm.\nA few issues do bother me, such as the constant gormless look on Kane’s face and the insistence of manager Gareth Southgate on dressing as if he was taking part in the World Snooker Championships.

I particularly enjoy the ITV panel and even Ian Wright is growing on me!\n: : : : : : : :\nIt is just over a month since the tragic death of former Aberdeen footballer Neale Cooper and I would like to add my own tribute to the many which have been paid to such a popular man.\nThe late Neale Cooper made a memorable trip to Shetland.\nAt just 19 he was the youngest member of the 1983 European Cup Winners Cup side which defeated Real Madrid in the final at Gothenburg in Sweden.\nAlong with that memorable triumph he was in the team which won two Scottish league titles, four Scottish Cups, a league cup and the European Super Cup, all achieved before he was 24.\nHe later played for Aston Villa, Rangers, Reading, Dunfermline and Ross County, where he later became manager.\nIt was in the summer of 1999, when Ross County were invited to Shetland as guests for Scalloway’s centenary celebrations, that I had the privilege of meeting Cooper.\nThere was a gala dinner in the village hall after the friendly match where County defeated Scalloway 8-2, and he agreed to give me time for a short interview. But not until after his speech, he said, which he was dreading as he hated speaking at formal events.\nSadly the evening dragged on somewhat, with various Scalloway luminaries spending rather more time on stage than was really necessary, and it was approaching 1am when Cooper eventually got his turn.\nI decided to give up on the interview that night, and maybe catch him the following day after a game against a Shetland XI in Lerwick.\nAs I was wandering along the embankment at Gilbertson Park prior to the match I heard someone calling my name, and was surprised to see Cooper running towards me.\nHe was full of apologies about the previous evening, although he had no justification, and he said he would speak to me immediately after the game.\nThe match ended 2-2 and Cooper was generous in his praise for the opposition. Shetland were “as good as any top Highland League side”, he said.\nThe two-day visit had been excellent both from a football point of view and a social one, he added. “It’s been fantastic. We had a great welcome from Scalloway and it was an honour to be invited to their centenary celebrations. I’ve never been to Shetland before and I only found out last week that my mother had been here 40 years ago.”\nFollowing Cooper’s untimely death, and the loss of the first of the Gothenburg greats, there have been many kind words. Colleagues, writers and others have pointed out what a humble, friendly and likeable character he was.\nThey are absolutely correct. I’ve meet a few well-known footballers over the years but I have no difficulty in stating that Neil Cooper was the nicest one of them all.\n: : : : : : : :\nCyclist Chris Froome is now free to go for a record-equalling fifth Tour de France win after his anti-doping case was sensibly dropped.\nThe Team Sky rider had been under investigation by the sport’s world governing body Union Cycliste Internationale but proceedings were closed on Monday.\nFroome, who is bidding to move level with Eddy Merckx, Bernard Hinault, Jacques Anquetil and Miguel Indurain as the only five-time winners of the tour, has been under intense pressure since an amount of the asthma treatment salbutamol was found in his system.\nGet off this guy’s back and give him a break, I say. Just because he’s the best cyclist in the world does not mean he’s benefiting from a performance-enhancing drug.\n: : : : : : : :\nWith all the buzz of the World Cup an annual competition in southwest London has almost been forgotten about.\nYes, Wimbledon is in full flow once again and the British competitors are as usual struggling to make it into the second week.\nAndy Murray was probably sensible to withdraw, citing that he was not quite ready for five-set matches after his hip operation. There were signs at Queens and Eastbourne, however, that he may be able to scale the heights once more.\nThere is of course a capable replacement in Kyle Edmund, who is seeded having reached the Australian Open semi-finals earlier this year.\nEdmund’s half of the draw looks fairly open, and he could well still be involved come Monday. But of course anything can happen, and by the time you read this he could be gone.

the eye of storm in Tornado Alley","story":"Nicole Webber\n\u0026nbsp\nA storm chaser from Newtonmore had to run for cover from some of the world\u0027s most extreme weather in Tornado Alley.\nScott Duncan (24), a former Kingussie High School pupil, has just returned from his dream adventure to the United States with a team of fellow meteorologists.\nHe got up close and personal with several tornadoes and massive electric storms during the trip of a lifetime which started on May 19, with the quartet returning on Saturday.\nThe daredevil and talented photographer captured breathtaking snaps of the huge storms as they crossed Nebraska, Kansas, Colorado and Texas.\nScott told the Strathy: \"The four of us flew out to Tornado Valley in the hope to witness some of the planet\u0027s most extreme weather.\n\"We decided to put our meteorological skills together and chase the storms ourselves.\"\nThe group of Reading University graduates rented a car and travelled 7000 miles over the course of the three weeks.\n\"We do it for the buzz as we all have a passion for extreme weather and it is also a great way to hit the open road and explore new states,\" he added.\nHe agreed that it can be a dangerous hobby but not for the reasons you would think.\n\"People often think tornadoes are the main concern but lightning, giant hail stones and flash flooding are often the hazards that prove most deadly,\" he said.\n\"Careful planning before and during a storm chase is absolutely essential.\"\n\u0026nbsp\nScott now works for MetDesk, a UK-wide weather service, and he took those skills across the Pond with him.\nThe friends used the latest weather model data, satellite and radar observations and invested in a portable internet device to ensure they had the best chance of remaining connected to signal while on the move.\nScott said it is incredibly important that the driver can access accurate directions quickly when faced with dangerous and often changing conditions.\nAlthough they had a few close calls, they managed to avoid getting themselves into \"major trouble\" by knowing when to back off and take shelter.\nThe Newtonmore man explained: \"We avoided driving through storms with tennis ball sized hail stones and 70mph straight line winds.\n\"But at one point we did have to take shelter in a gas station freezer room \u0026ndash the strongest room in the building \u0026ndash due to a tornado with confirmed flying debris just upwind of us.\"\nScott admitted that storm chasing is not for the faint-hearted but that \"it is an experience\" and in the US it is becoming an increasingly popular attraction.\nBecause the adventurers did not know where they would end up at the end of the day, accommodation had to often be found late and in an obscure towns in the middle of nowhere\nScott, who is now safely back in Hertfordshire where the weather is rather less dramatic, added: \"That alone makes the trip more exciting as it holds an incredible depth of freedom.\"\nTornado Alley is the name of the area in the United States where tornadoes are most frequent.\nThe term was coined in 1952 as the title of a research project to study severe weather in areas of Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, South Dakota, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, Nebraska, Colorado, North Dakota, and Minnesota.\nSaturday 7 Jul 2018 6:44
