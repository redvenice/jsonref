[{"url":null,"title":"Prince Charles live flat shop radical overhaul King","story":"Share this articleBut others – including Andrew\u0027s daughters Beatrice and Eugenie – will be vying for accommodation in the reshuffle.Buckingham Palace, which is undergoing a ten-year, £369 million renovation, is set to be opened up on a much greater scale, with public access all year round instead of the usual seasonal admission.Meanwhile, the Monarch\u0027s living quarters – which currently include 52 Royal and guest bedrooms and 188 staff bedrooms – will be dramatically cut. A friend of Charles said: \u0027Despite what everybody thinks about him not wanting to live there, he will certainly have accommodation there – but it will be a much more modest flat-above-the-shop situation akin to that of the Prime Minister at Downing Street.\u0027Both the Prince and the Duchess of Cornwall are very practical and see that the reigning Monarch must live at Buckingham Palace, otherwise it would become like Hampton Court\u0027 – a visitor attraction rather than a working royal palace.The friend added that the Cambridges are likely to move to Windsor – a relocation the family are said to want. \u0027Charles is not keen on Windsor because it is quite noisy,\u0027 the source added: \u0027His view is that if he\u0027s heading to Windsor, he may as well carry on to Highgrove in Gloucestershire.\u0027Charles is expected to keep his beloved Highgrove as his family home. It is owned by the Duchy of Cornwall, which William will inherit when Charles becomes King. Then William will be his father\u0027s landlord, taking £700,000 a year rent.In London, Charles\u0027s official Clarence House residence was originally earmarked for Harry but his departure to California means that is \u0027no longer on the cards\u0027.It is now more likely to be saved for Prince George, Princess Charlotte or Prince Louis, although its outdated decor is a turn-off for younger Royals. A source said: \u0027No one is terribly fond of Clarence House because it\u0027s still seen very much as the Queen Mother\u0027s place.\u0027Charles intends to keep another of his grandmother\u0027s properties – Birkhall in Scotland, which he inherited on her death in 2002 and one of the few places where he is said to feel at home. It is part of the Balmoral Estate, the Queen\u0027s favourite residence. Balmoral\u0027s grounds and gardens are closed to the public in the summer when she is in residence but under Charles, there is set to be far greater access. A source said: \u0027The talk is of opening a museum paying tribute to the Queen.\u0027Even Sandringham in Norfolk, which is privately owned by the Royal Family, might be opened up to the public when Charles inherits it. Wood Farm, the cottage in the grounds where Prince Philip spent his latter years, could be mothballed for future generations.The Cambridges look set to keep Anmer Hall, the nearby mansion which the Queen gave them after their 2011 wedding and also stand to inherit Llwynywermod, the Welsh home of the Prince of Wales."},{"url":null,"title":"Families told buy Christmas food FREEZER","story":"   Retail experts are warning of a grim Christmas.

Public officials have been pleading with unvaccinated people to get vaccinated, and health care workers are also now having to cope with demand for other types of care that has been delayed by the pandemic. “I think it’s clearly frustrating for all of us,” said Michael Pieciak, the commissioner of the Vermont Department of Financial Regulation, who monitors coronavirus statistics for the state.  “We want kids to be safe in school, we want parents not to have to worry about their child’s education and health.”  The increase is thought to be down to the Delta variant, despite the five states in the US are in the region, with Vermont leading, followed by Connecticut, Maine, Rhode Island and Massachusetts.One of the big events taking place for the first time today since the start of the pandemic is the London Marathon. More than 40,000 people are running the 26.2-mile (42.16km) course around London, from Greenwich to the Mall. Last year’s event was cancelled due to pandemic restrictions, and this year’s runners are bolstered by a further 40,000 taking part “virtually”, running the same distance across their own route. The event, one of the world’s best known marathons, is known for people tackling it in fancy dress, with costumes this year including a one-man-band, a phonebox and the Empire State Building.  Three men are even doing it as a “four-legged” race. Millions is raised for charity by the event, which was first run in March 1981. In the professional athletes’ race, which began before the amateur competitors, Sisay Lemma won the men’s elite race and Joyciline Jepkosgei came first in the women’s elite race. The death toll stands at 4,793,613, while 234,542,240 positive tests have been recorded. The World Health Organization estimates that the actual toll could be two to three times higher than official records, due to excess mortality linked to Covid.  Some countries have previously acknowledged that the likely number of dead is likely to be higher than its official counts.Its government’s coronavirus taskforce added it had recorded 25,769 new cases in the last 24 hours, including 4,294 in Moscow. A total of 209,918 people have now died from the virus.Under guidelines introduced on Sunday, people will only be eligible for the green pass if they have received a booster jab. Those who have already had two jabs will only qualify for the Covid passport if it was within the last six months. It means that nearly 2 million people will lose their vaccine passport in the coming days, Associated Press reports. It will limit their ability to use shops, restaurants, cultural events and gyms. Sabalenka, who lost to the Canadian teenager Leylah Fernandez in the US Open semi-final last month, was the top seed in the women’s draw at the Indian Wells after world No 1 Ash Barty pulled out. “Unfortunately I’ve tested positive at Indian Wells and won’t be able to compete,” the 23-year-old Belarusian wrote on her Instagram story. Three construction workers at the Expo 2020 world fair in Dubai have died from Covid-19, according to its organiser. A spokesperson said the deaths occurred over the course of the pandemic, and were in addition to 72 serious injuries among 2000,000 workers during construction on the site, according to Reuters. “Unfortunately we had three worker related deaths due to Covid. That was during the course of the pandemic,” Expo representative Sconaid McGeachin told a daily briefing.  Overcrowding in worker accommodation was one of the main factors in a surge of infections in the United Arab Emirates at the start of the pandemic. Expo 2020 says worker accommodation is audited to ensure conditions are not cramped. It defended the figure and said it was less than half of that of building work in the UK. Data from the National Health Commission reported that another 755,000 jabs were administered on Saturday, raising the total.Scientists in the UK have warned that the country may still have worse to come during the pandemic, as winter approaches. They fear that more people will begin socialising inside as the weather gets colder, which increases the chance of transmitting the virus. At the same time many workers have begun returning to offices for the first time in 18 months. Meanwhile New Zealand has widened its lockdown as the Delta variant has started to spread outside Auckland. A “short and sharp” lockdown was introduced in mid-August to counter rising cases, but 32 new cases were confirmed in the country’s largest city on Sunday, with two new cases in the Waikato region 147km (91 miles) south of Auckland. Prime minister Jacinda Ardern confirmed parts of the region would go into a five-day lockdown. "},{"url":null,"title":"covid 19 vaccine tracker how many people have been inoculated in ireland","story":"It has been over a year since the first case of Covid-19 was confirmed in the Republic of Ireland. Since then, over 300,000 people have been diagnosed in the State, and over 5,000 people have died.Globally, over 200 million people have been diagnosed and over 4\u0026nbspmillion have died since the virus was first identified in China in December 2019.Four of these have been authorised for use in the EU - one from AstraZeneca, one from BioNTech-Pfizer, one from Moderna and another from Johnson \u0026amp Johnson (Janssen).The EU has put in place purchase agreements with Sanofi-GSK\u0026nbspand Curevac, and\u0026nbsphas concluded exploratory talks with two other vaccine producers - Novavax and Valneva.Ireland, along with all other EU member states, will get a proportional amount of every vaccine that is approved for use by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) according to its population.But how do these other vaccines work, and when will they be approved for use here? Have there been any reported side effects? And when can you expect to receive a vaccine?The  Vaccine Tracker will be updated daily as the country embarks on the largest inoculation programme in the history of the State.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 70°C.EMA approval: Granted on December 21st.Overview: Developed by New York-based Pfizer and German company BioNTech this vaccine has a brand name of Comirnaty. It uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which has instructions for producing a protein from Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The person’s immune system recognises this protein as foreign and produces antibodies and activates T-cells (white blood cells) to attack it, giving them immunity. The vaccine will last for six months when stored at -70C, and five days when stored at between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. The EU has approved the withdrawal of six doses from each vial.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle and joint pain, chills and fever. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 546,000 in April, 738,000 in May and\u0026nbsp844,000 doses in June, with 5.4 million doses in total expected by the end of 2021.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 20°C.EMA approval: Granted on January 6th.Overview: Developed by Boston-based company Moderna, this vaccine is manufactured for EU states at partner plants in Switzerland, France and Spain before being distributed across the continent. Like the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, it uses mRNA technology to produce a Sars-CoV-2 protein, which the body then attacks to give immunity. It will last for up to six months when stored at - 20°C. The first Moderna vaccine was given in Ireland on January 16th.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, chills, fever, swollen or tender lymph nodes under the arm, headache, muscle and joint pain, nausea and vomiting. Less common was redness, hives and rash at the injection site. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 383,000 by June and 870,000 doses by the end of 2021.How many have been vaccinated here?Dose: Two doses, between 4 and 12 weeks apartEMA approval: Granted on January 29th.Overview: The OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine (also known as Vaxzevria) was thought of as a potential game-changer because it can be transported and stored at 2 degrees to 8 degrees for up to six months, making it much easier to move around and administer. It is also much cheaper, costing about $3-4 per shot, compared with $20 for the PfizerBioNTech jab, with the former being made on a not-for-profit basis for the duration of the pandemic.It is based on a harmless chimp cold virus that cannot grow inside human cells. Scientists have tweaked this virus so that it carries genetic material containing the instructions for a protein of the coronavirus. Once the vaccine has been administered, our bodies produce the coronavirus protein, triggering an immune response.During the trial, a dosing error led to the serendipitous finding that when clinical trial participants were given half a dose followed by a full dose, the vaccine had a higher efficacy than when participants were given two full doses, with 90 per cent efficacy in the former case and 62 per cent efficacy in the latter. This led AstraZeneca to announce in November a new global trial of the vaccine with the half dosefull dose regime.In January, a bitter row broke out between the European Union and AstraZeneca after the pharmaceutical company drastically revised downwards the number of doses it could deliver the bloc.\u0026nbspWhile the EMA approved the use of this vaccine for all ages, doubt was cast over its efficacy in the over 65s due to the lack of data from Astrazeneca’s clinical trials in this cohort. As a result, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Poland and Belgium have opted not to approve this product for their older population.Following suit, Ireland has also decided to use the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine for the over 70s where possible, not the AstraZeneca jab.It would not be the first time this jab led to a\u0026nbspsignificant reorganisation of our vaccination plans.Reports of serious blood clots, mostly in women aged under 60, led the\u0026nbspNational Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac) to first defer the use of the vaccine on March 14th, before resuming it\u0027s use on March 20th.However, on April 12th, Niac\u0026nbsprecommended that AstraZeneca should not be given to people aged under 60, once again leading to a reorganisation of the rollout. This was revised to people aged over 50 on April 27th. On June 28th, Niac revised its advice again and said the vaccine could be given\u0026nbspto people aged under 40, although the mRNA shots were preferable for that age group.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbspLatest projections are 224,000 in April, 262,000 in May and 327,000 in JuneStorage: Lasts for up to two years frozen at –20° C, and up to three months refrigerated at 2-8° C.EMA approval: Approved on March 11th.Overview: The EMA started a rolling review of this single dose vaccine from Janssen, the Belgium-based subsidiary of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson on December 1st.On January 29th the company announced the results of its Phase 3 trial: the vaccine had an efficacy of 72 per cent in the United States, 66 per cent in Latin America, and 57 per cent in South Africa.This vaccine uses double-stranded DNA to deliver a protein from the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the body, thereby creating immunity. It is different from others on the market in that it requires just one injection. The EU has agreed an initial contract for 200 million doses, with an option to buy 200 million more.On February 16th the company applied to the EMA for\u0026nbspseeking authorisation for its single-dose vaccine, and it was approved on March 11th.However, on April 13th the company paused deliveries of its vaccine in Europe pending an investigation of rare blood clot cases that have halted its rollout in the US. The blood clotting conditions reported in recipients of the Johnson \u0026amp Johnson vaccine in the US are the same rare condition linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine.On April 20th, the EMA\u0027s review of these issues found a possible link to very rare cases of unusual blood clots with low blood platelets, and agreed a warning should be included in the product information.\u0026nbspHowever, it concluded\u0026nbspthe overall benefits of the vaccine\u0026nbspin preventing Covid-19 outweigh the risks of side effects, and so Janssen announced it would resume deliveries to the EU. In Ireland,\u0026nbspNiac initially recommended that the jab be used only for people over the age of 50, but this was revised to include the under 40s on June 28th. Those aged 18-34 can apply to get the Janssen vaccine at pharmacies around the country.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbsp2.2 million doses in total,\u0026nbsp600,000 between April and June.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: US company Novavax has developed a Covid-19 vaccine which stimulates an immune response by delivering spike proteins into the body. These spike-proteins are grown and harvested from insects. Similar technology is used in the production of vaccines for influenza and HPV. The European Commission has concluded exploratory talks with Novavax with a view to purchasing up to 200 million doses. The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 3rd.Overview: In September the EU signed a deal to purchase 300 million doses of this vaccine. It is based on the same technology as one of Sanofi’s seasonal influenza vaccines - more conventional than the mRNA used by Pfizer and Moderna - and it was thought it could play a big role in ending the pandemic. However, despite positive results from Phase 1 trials, news came in December that Phase 2 trial results showed an insufficient immune response in older adults. Phase III studies were expected to start in December, but the companies now plan to begin a phase 2b study in February with a different formulation of the vaccine. Even if their new formulation is successful, they do not expect the vaccine to be available until the end of 2021.Storage: Will last for at least 3 months at 2-8°C.Overview: The German company CureVac began its final Phase 3 trials in December, with results expected in the first quarter of 2021. It uses the same mRNA technology as the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, but can be kept at normal refrigerator temperatures. The company has signed a deal with the EU to supply 405 million doses, pending regulatory approval.The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 12th.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: Valneva is a French company which has created a Covid-19 vaccine based on their Japanese encephalitis vaccine. It delivers a chemically inactivated coronavirus and uses an adjuvant (immunity booster) to create immunity. It entered clinical trials in December and reported positive results from these initial phase 1 and 2 trial in\u0026nbspApril 2021, while announcing it was entering\u0026nbspphase 3 trials on 4,000 people.On January 12th the European Commission concluded exploratory talks with the company for the supply of 30 million doses, with the option to buy a further 30 million.When might you be vaccinated?Over 80 per cent\u0026nbspof people in Ireland aged over 18 are now fully vaccinated, with over 90 per cent in receipt of at least one dose.

One even panicked to the extent of lining a bucket with a plastic bag to fill it with petrol (do not, as they say on Blue Peter, try this at home), there having been panic-buying of jerry cans.Eighteen months ago, early in the pandemic, when told there was enough lavatory paper, dried pasta and flour for everyone, people descended on supermarkets and stripped their aisles of lavatory paper, dried pasta and flour. We are the people that came through the Somme, the Slump, the Blitz, Suez and the legion horrors of the 1970s (including petrol shortages). What has changed? Our national character has suddenly degenerated. The pandemic, and politicians, may be to blame.Last year the Government sought to terrify people into obeying its lockdown strictures. It wasn’t just the promise of five-figure fines for people gathering in groups outside their “bubble”: it was the threat of serious disease and death for those who ignored the order.Many rational people felt it was an absurd exaggeration. The clip from Zulu (another example of our not panicking when things became really grim) of Jack Hawkins’s hysterical character yelling at those brave men defending Rorke’s Drift “you’re all going to die!” circulated on social media. We were encouraged to regard every other human being as a chemical weapon. Some became unhinged: and to this day some continue to wear masks in the street, and shun physical contact with others, even though most have had two vaccinations, and deaths have fallen.At least Covid was a matter of life and death, so ministers and officials may have felt justified in encouraging fear, even if it encouraged panic. There was no such excuse in 2016, when George Osborne led his ludicrous “project fear” about Brexit. He contributed greatly to the defeat of his campaign. Even that recently, the public resented attempts to frighten and manipulate them. But now, perhaps because of what opinion polls say is their low opinion of the honesty and competence of the Government, too many panic as a first, and not as a last, resort when trouble arises. For this substantial group, life has become a precarious, not to say dangerous, business: there is no calm risk assessment, and it is every man for himself.I remember queues at petrol stations after the oil price shock in 1973 then the crash in the stock market, inflation at 26.9 per cent, the trades unions running the country, Denis Healey running to the IMF to beg it to bail us out. We weren’t happy, but we kept our heads. We didn’t metaphorically fill buckets with petrol, or cupboards with bog rolls. We just bided our time and elected Mrs Thatcher. We were still the sort of people depicted in that famous photograph, admittedly staged, of a cheery milkman walking through rubble with his crate of bottles during the Blitz. Then, Britain could take it.But the power of mass media and the absence of statesmanship shown in the generation of fear over Covid seem to have bred a change of character. It reminds one of the collective hysteria after the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, when briefly it seemed millions lost faith in the monarchy. Remnants of that hysteria linger in our DNA: and the ease with which we now panic suggests we have lost our nerve.That was never what it meant to be British.

Police have been forced to painstakingly detach protesters who glued their hands to the tarmac, and cut off bike locks demonstrators attached to their necks.Extinction Rebellion has also employed similar methods in their anti-climate change protests. During a demonstration on Saturday, protesters blocked entrances to Farnborough Airport in Hampshire to raise awareness of the emissions caused by private flights.One set of protesters parked a stretch limousine outside an access point, and the driver was locked to the steering wheel to make the car harder to remove.The stop and search proposal for activists, reported by The Times, would be added to the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill currently going through Parliament.Another proposal reportedly being tabled is making participation in Insulate Britain protests a specific offence. This would broaden the charging options for police. Lisa Townsend, Surrey Police and Crime Commissioner, said if protesters are charged with relatively minor offences, they will likely be discontinued, yet the threshold for more serious charges is not met either.Ministers have resorted to applying for High Court injunctions to stop the activists, putting them at risk of being jailed if they continue protesting.Breaching the injunctions is contempt of court, which carries a maximum sentence of two years in prison or an unlimited fine.However, applying for emergency injunctions for specific motorways has led to a game of cat and mouse with protesters, who swiftly move on to another road not covered by the injunction.Grant Shapps, the Transport Secretary, said this week: Reckless protesters who repeatedly put lives in danger on the M25 have already had knocks on their doors.We are serving papers and those who continue these idiotic, dangerous and counter-productive demonstrations will be caught and face unlimited fines or prison.More from NewsPolitics latest news: Boris Johnson admits food shortages could last until Christmas Funeral of Taliban spokesman\u0026#39s mother bombed in KabulMan arrested after police alerted to fake vaccine passports being sold for £750South Korean politicians use Netflix sensation \u0026#39Squid Game\u0026#39 for election raceThe time has come to declare an official end to the Covid crisisChina sends record number of warplanes into Taiwan\u0026#39s defence zone for second day runningMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"price controls always do opposite intend ministers must learn","story":"During Mohammed’s exile in Medina, there was a famine – a common enough occurrence in seventh-century Arabia. As food prices spiralled, community leaders approached the Prophet, asking him to order stallholders to make their produce affordable. Mohammed refused, telling the delegation that prices were in the hands of God. Being a businessman, he understood what happens when prices are artificially lowered. First, there is a rush to buy and then, inevitably, there is a worse shortage, because people have little incentive to bring artificially cheap goods to market.I recall that episode for two reasons. First, because Islam’s free-market traditions deserve greater recognition. Second, and more important, because people still struggle to grasp Mohammed’s point.Fourteen centuries after the Prophet’s wise refusal to intervene, and two-and-a-half centuries after Adam Smith showed that price-fixing is always and everywhere counterproductive, we continue to have difficulty with the idea of supply and demand. Like suspicious mediaeval peasants (or Marxists) we cling to the notion that goods have an intrinsic price, and that raising that price is “profiteering”.“Greed in times of crisis: How dare fuel firms make money out of misery,” was a not untypical newspaper headline this week. “They see motorists as a cash cow and, frankly, they are a disgrace,” opined a not untypical Conservative MP.In fact, by any normal measure, the fuel companies did not raise their prices by nearly enough. Had they upped their rate to say, £1.80 a litre, we’d soon have seen who really needed fuel that day. Since the shortages were caused, not by an overall lack of petrol but by panic buying, the crisis would have passed, and prices would have dropped back again.So why didn’t the petrol companies do the sensible thing? Because they were frightened of the press reaction and, more seriously, the political reaction. Our current national mood, as this column never tires of pointing out, is worryingly authoritarian. Newspapers reflect it and so, naturally, do politicians and government officials.In March of last year, as people rushed (again, irrationally) to stock up on hand sanitizers, and toilet paper, the Competition and Markets Authority threatened action against anyone who charged a “vastly inflated” price – including “members of the public if they resell goods, for example on online marketplaces”. This kind of meddling is always popular in the short term, but always disastrous in the long term.What, after all, prompted last week’s crisis? The epidemic obviously played a part. But in most fields of life, the market worked its way around the disruption. No, the fuel crisis resulted from the unintended consequences of a series of government interventions. A price cap aimed at keeping bills low for consumers ended up forcing suppliers out of the market. Furlough payments intended to keep companies going through the lockdown turned out to be a lot more valuable to European drivers if they returned to their countries of origin. Licensing regulations prevented new entrants from moving quickly into the market. And, of course, the general thrust of government policy was to shift away from hydrocarbons.Walter Williams, the great African-American economist who died last year, once said: “Most of the great problems we face are caused by politicians creating solutions to problems they created in the first place.” Sadly, his aphorism holds true across most ages and most nations.For some reason, this argument is habitually dismissed as “dogmatic” or “ideological”. People who oppose price controls, rent controls and other forms of economic dirigisme are painted as doctrinaire Thatcherites, more interested in the sanctity of contract than in the welfare of the masses.In fact, it is the other way around. Free-marketeers hold beliefs that seem counter-intuitive but that turn out to work in practice. Most people, coming new to the subject, assume that lower prices are a way to help the poor – or, at least, to ensure that resources are not monopolised by a few oligarchs. But the most cursory study of history shows that the opposite is true. Price-fixing causes shortages, making everyone worse off – though the rich are usually more able to find ways around the rules.The story of capitalism is the story of the progressive enrichment of ordinary people through falling prices. Specialisation and competition mean that goods and services become cheaper, thus allowing people to live at a higher standard while working shorter hours. As the great economist Joseph Schumpeter observed in 1942, “the capitalist achievement does not typically consist in providing more silk stockings for queens but in bringing them within the reach of factory girls in return for steadily decreasing amounts of effort.”Most of us have known price deflation all our lives. Cars, washing machines, televisions, toys, food, central heating – all are vastly cheaper than they used to be. And not just cheaper. Your car is safer, less polluting and more fuel-efficient. Your mobile phone has not just replaced your desk phone it has also replaced your address book, your maps, your compass, your Walkman, your encyclopaedia and, for all I know, your chess set.The fall in prices is most dramatic when we look at elemental commodities rather than at the ways in which they are delivered. We can’t exactly compare candlelight, gaslight and electric light. But we can ask how long you have to work to purchase enough light to read by. Matt Ridley does the calculation in his book How Innovation Works. In 1880, a minute’s work bought you four minutes of artificial light in 1950 it was seven hours in 2000 it was five days.Which brings us neatly back to the energy crisis. Increasing regulation has halted the decline in prices. And not just in energy. Look at all the things that have defied the trend towards affordability – housing, education, child-care, medical treatment. What have they all got in common? They’re all subject to various forms of state rationing, quotas or controls.For example, rules that prohibit building make houses more expensive. The government recognises the problem, but instead of scrapping those rules, it adds new ones, which mostly serve to compound the problem: Help to Buy, eviction bans, rent controls.Regulations, however well-meaning, usually do more harm than good. The highest carer-to-child ratio in Europe gives us the most expensive childcare. Fixed-price degrees distort the market and create armies of graduates who will never repay their debts. The NHS monopoly guarantees waiting lists.There is a pattern here. Instead of letting go, ministers always feel the need to do something. And so, as Walter Williams observed, new problems are created in the name of addressing old ones.When it comes to regulating the private sector, the Government proudly proclaims that it is against “all types of anti-competitive activity, including price fixing and abuse of a dominant market position” If it applied that standard to itself, it would scrap housing restrictions, rail monopolies, the healthcare monopoly, the BBC and pretty much everything that DEFRA does.We have had prices and incomes polices before, of course: they led to the collapse of Edward Heath’s government in 1974. The main difference was that, in those days, the incomes policies were aimed at constraining what were seen as excessive pay demands.Today, with inflation again taking off, ministers are oddly trying to push wages up even further, by keeping out foreign labour and raising the minimum wage faster than average salaries. But if government meddling is not new, the scale of it is. Not since the Second World War – indeed, arguably not even then – has the state exercised such powers as during the lockdowns.The question, as after 1945, is how quickly the state will abandon the powers it had seized on a supposedly emergency basis. Will we be like post-war West Germany, which scrapped its price controls and other regulations in one big bang in 1948, thereby ushering in three decades of miraculous growth? Or will we be like post-war Britain, which hung onto many of its wartime economic controls into the 1970s, so becoming the sick man of Europe?The early signs are not encouraging. Tax rises, heavier regulation and higher prices are a calamitous combination. Given the exceptional circumstances, a government might get away with one of the three. But not two – let alone all three at once. The problems of excessive regulation will never be solved with more regulation. Let it go, ministers. Let it go.More from NewsPolitics latest news: Boris Johnson admits food shortages could last until Christmas Funeral of Taliban spokesman\u0026#39s mother bombed in KabulMan arrested after police alerted to fake vaccine passports being sold for £750South Korean politicians use Netflix sensation \u0026#39Squid Game\u0026#39 for election raceThe time has come to declare an official end to the Covid crisisChina sends record number of warplanes into Taiwan\u0026#39s defence zone for second day runningMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"prime minister must remember conservative principles","story":"Taxes are at their highest level for decades, so Oliver Dowden’s words to this newspaper are welcome: the Tories have always kept taxes low and sought to cut them, he says, and that’s where the Prime Minister and Chancellor’s hearts lie, too.Readers will be wondering: if the present Conservative Government is keen on low taxes, when might we expect them to start coming down?

Actually, it’s a lot like the old one. Woke picks up where Christianity left off (or chickened out), providing a religion without God that imagines itself to be new yet hammers home themes that are strikingly familiar. Here are the key parallels.Awaiting the Apocalypse. A basic tenet of Evangelical Christianity is that the world is ending, so you’ve got to get good with God. The end will be horrible it’s what we deserve. Greta Thunberg says the planet is dying because we consumed too much, and empty shelves, say Remainers, are the price of Brexit.Why do we vote for, or do, such “stupid” things? Original Sin. For Christians, it’s the rebellion against God in the Garden of Eden. For the woke, it’s pollution and slavery, crimes that happened centuries ago yet were so bad they irradiate the present. Nations are inherently racist iniduals, even the ones that want to be good, are guilty of “unconscious bias”. Woke has a Calvinist pessimism about our Total Depravity. You can’t escape the sin, the best you can do is confess it to the community.One sign that you might not be so bad is having bad stuff done to you. By dying on a cross, Jesus imprinted in our culture the archetype of the Victim As Hero – emulated now by a woke culture that, like Jesus, says the first shall be last and the last first. The more “marginalised” a voice once was, the louder it should sing.Victimhood, like sin, is inherited. Entire groups are cast as Martyrs, whether they see themselves that way or not, and suffering is categorised and ranked in a hierarchy of pain. The problem is that a lot of woke people are rich and white (probably most of them). A handful have pretended to be black to appropriate some grace – but the wider path is to present yourself to the world as a Visible Saint.The Puritans of the 17th century wanted to reserve their church strictly for the elect, but given that we can’t know who is saved or damned, they had to rely on outward signs of holy behaviour. Today, wokeness is displayed to the parish by how one acts, votes, dresses and, crucially speaks, for wokeness, like Christianity, has developed a Litany of magical words (“intersectional”, “heteronormative”).In the past, you might signal your faith by wearing a cross today, you write “theythem” on your twitter bio. There is Holy Writ and a Clerical Class of writers, activists and politicians, who will welcome your donation of money or votes. There are also Heretics who must be cancelled (including a number of Sixties feminists for whom this stuff seems a trifle barmy) and Demons to be exorcised or cancelled. Donald Trump, it goes without saying, is The Devil.And, finally, Wokery does a Supernatural, of sorts. It is anti-materialist: it would rather we were green than generating growth, more equal than inidually wealthy. It has challenged the laws of science and maths, arguing in one unironic discussion last year that 2 + 2 might equal 3 or 5 depending upon the subjective experience of the numbers involved. And it has declared that men have become women and vice versa, an act of Transubstantiation whereby physical substance is transformed by faith.Around the time most mainline churches dropped their more remarkable claims, be it miracles or the end of the world, wokery picked up and ran with them, the mystery of religion replaced with wonder at nature. In ages past we studied Bible stories told in church windows now we gawp at David Attenborough documentaries on TV, trying to ine a hidden meaning in the sex lives of penguins.Like any spin off, however, wokery lost the nuance of the original idea. Mercy is gone (the cancelled are never forgiven and the queue to cast the first stone winds around the block) and so is the submission of ego, because while religion plugs the inidual into community, encouraging us to stop being so tediously self-absorbed, workery hinges on telling “stories” – struggles, conflicts, the melodramatic psychoanalysis of a person’s life that condemns us to a constant state of “journeying”, with no no hope of arrival.That’s because woke lacks God. Minus the ine, there is no end point, no perfect justice and, thus, no relief from the anxieties of existence that, ultimately, we all have to endure – because while it would be nice if Jesus came back tomorrow, he hasn’t done so yet and we have to render unto Caesar and get on with our lives. Woke is a recipe for conflict. The best in religion brings inner peace.Tim Stanley will be discussing his new book - Whatever Happened to Tradition? - with Allison Pearson on October 14, at 7pm.

I spent three days last week in Brighton, attending party conference. Some parts were fantastic: the policy announcements on a New Deal for Workers, for instance. Contributions from the floor showed what our party could be at our best. Some of the debates were cast as “defeats” for the Starmer leadership, some were reported as victories. The media tend to see these things solely through the lens of what it means for Westminster, but this is democracy in action: it should be celebrated. That should have been the story. Unfortunately, there was another, much more toxic side to the week in Brighton. I think we should be honest about this: the seeds of this toxicity were sown in the weeks preceding the conference: as has been reported, scores of left-wing members of the party were “auto excluded” for a iety of offences - many on spurious grounds. This included many elected delegates, so when they turned up at the conference, some were turned away, accompanied by police. Hardly a great start to our democratic showcase. Those injustices and attacks upon the democratic rights of members have stoked tensions for weeks, and anger amongst the ordinary membership has been growing. These are, let’s remember, unpaid volunteers, who put in hours and hours a week in the service of the Labour Party. However, the overwhelming perception is that they are becoming surplus to requirements in their own party. In this context, the leader’s speech began at noon on Wednesday, the last day of the conference. I was not at all surprised that tensions boiled over, so frustrated are the membership with Starmer’s leadership and the actions of the General Secretary, David Evans, who narrowly survived an endorsement vote at the beginning of the week.  In the press, the focus in the wake of Starmer’s speech has been on the apparent heckling of Keir Starmer when he movingly talked about his mother in hospital. This illustrates the problem. It seems like “Labour sources” close to the leader’s office briefed, during the speech, that Keir was heckled whilst talking about his mother. But that simply isn’t true. The precise moment when the first heckle was heard was when, soon afterwards, he talked of the nurses who had looked after his mother, and specically when he said that nurses’ jobs were a ‘calling’. That was the flashpoint, and there is an important context. Because earlier in the week, Shadow Employment Rights Minister Andy McDonald had resigned, saying that he’d been asked by the leadership to argue against a £ living wage. That was the source of the anger in the hall, and it was always going to get a reaction. But it was wrong to say that left wing members heckled while Starmer was talking about his mother. I’ve listened back, and throughout that section, the leader of the party was listened to in complete, respectful silence. That spin, by those “sources” is not only unfair, but illustrative of a long campaign against the left of the party, aided and abetted, I’m sad to say, by parts of the media. There is a determination to paint socialists in the party as monsters. That’s the root of the toxicity in today’s Labour Party, and it must stop.  Another, less well reported incident during the leader’s speech was captured on video and shared via Twitter. In it, a man is seen to be harassing a woman delegate behind him, seemingly for not giving Starmer a standing ovation during a part of the speech. It’s awful to watch. We’re adults, with our own minds. We can decide whether we want to stand and applaud or not. This man had no idea whether the woman he is berating is unable to stand or just doesn’t feel moved to applaud. The point is, there’s no place for that kind of behaviour in a party that talks about social justice and respect. As it happens, I discovered later, the man doing the berating is a senior member of the party with a number of regional positions, which only makes it worse. There’s a bigger picture here: since Keir Starmer was elected in April last year, on a ticket not that far removed from his predecessor Jeremy Corbyn, he’s spent a large part of his time marginalising the party’s left wing – those enthused by Corbyn’s agenda. I don’t know whether this is coming from him or from the highly factional people around him, but it is clearly designed to make socialists feel uncomfortable and unwanted in their own party. To paraphrase the late Labour MP, Ian Mikardo, no bird ever managed to fly with one wing. Maybe because of a sense of entitlement, maybe because of a history of dominance in the party, maybe because of losing that control – albeit briefly - the right-wing of our party steadfastly refuse to acknowledge this law of physics. Rejecting wholesale everything that the party did between  and  is mindless, frankly. On policy and grassroots mobilisation, especially, we got a lot right, with members and yes, voters. Polling tells us that large elements of both Corbyn manestos were very popular with the public. Starmer had the opportunity to tweak and build, yet seems to be going down another road altogether, and I fear it’s auto-destruct. Of course, Corbyn also made mistakes. Anyone involved in politics who claims they are faultless is lying or delusional. Nor do I expect Starmer, someone with clearly very dferent politics and approach to Jeremy, to carry on ashe was the continuity candidate. That would be fantasy. I do, however, think that party members have to be at the centre of any party that has the words “democratic socialist” on the back of its membership card, and they must be respected. Any idea that the Labour Party can become simply a brand, with a party in Parliament, without its grassroots members, is reckless.  is not , and to think we can go back is ridiculous. The new leadership of the party have played a large part in creating an awful atmosphere of ision, and it is in their gt to defuse the tension and let us all get on with fighting this government. That process can start today. If they want to send a signal that this is their intent, that they are serious about creating a united party, using both of its wings, a good place to start would be to restore the whip to the person who led the party just two years ago.

Conservative Ministers regularly introduced so-called “reforms” like Universal Credit that further impoverished already-poor families. But never since the introduction of the welfare state have six million families been subject to an overnight cash cut of £ a week. For more than two million single people this is a sudden % cut in income. For millions more families facing high winter outlays on food, gas and electricity it represents a % cut. Their bills are going UP but their income is going DOWN. Do you agree with Gordon Brown  Have your say in the comment section  A report from the Standard Le Foundation says nearly six million families struggle to put food on the table and another , people have been pushed into poverty. Nothing these Ministers ever do in public le will shame them more than kicking millions of families when they are down. Nothing they say can undo the damage of more children going to school ill-clad and hungry, more families having to choose between heating and eating and the inevitable rise in payday lenders, loan sharks and threats of violence against those who cannot pay back. And nothing will make up for the inevitable rise in children taken into care, tenants evicted and mental health referrals as families are pushed over the edge. For this latest cut comes on top of ten years of austerity and benefit cuts which, for the average family, has already meant a reduction of £, a year since .

Her mother, Jemma Mansie, first noticed her daughter began pulling out her eyelashes a month into the first lockdown.

Their plea came this week when we went behind the scenes of one of the UK’s biggest Covid centres. At the Royal London Hospital, critical care staff said a staggering % of people now being admitted to intensive care with the virus had not been fully vaccinated. As we were shown around the ICU, where most Covid patients lay comatose, they said the number of younger patients was rising. And bosses told us they fear for staff who are already working harder than usual and under huge amounts of increased pressure.  Consultant Dr Chris Kirwan said: “We’re all under an enormous amount of strain and working above capacity at the time of year where we should be resetting and getting ready for winter.” The British Medical Association has said it is expecting “one of the worst winters on record” this year. One union has warned of a “perfect storm” as the demands of Covid, a huge backlog of care and staff shortages are compounded by the seasonal surge in admissions. There are also growing fears of a fourth wave of infections.  The worry was plain to see at the Royal London. Its ICU usually has  beds, but on Wednesday there were . Ten were occupied by Covid patients. Dr Kirwan, an adult critical care consultant, said around % of those admitted to ICU at the north-east London hospital in recent weeks were not double-jabbed. He said: “We’re running [a larger] ICU so we had to get extra consultants, nurses, junior doctors, physios, cleaners, porters. “But we’re anxious about having to expand further – and the pressure it is going to put on the staff. “If you have a hospital full of Covid, those beds are being used for patients with Covid.”  Latest figures show . million people aged  and over remain unvaccinated in the UK. Meanwhile the Office of National Statistics has revealed the number of unvaccinated people who catch Covid is three times higher than those who have had both jabs. Yesterday the total number of Covid cases in the UK stood at ,, – up , on the day before. The number of deaths had risen by  to ,. Latest figures also show  people were admitted to hospital with the virus on Friday.  And there were  Covid patients on ventilators. Dr Kirwan’s team said more people under the age of  with the virus are now being admitted than earlier in the pandemic. He said: “We’re seeing a younger group of patients, because the vaccination amongst the older group has been quite successful. Some people thought they are young, fit and healthy and Covid won’t affect them – then got a nasty surprise. “To be  and end up with severe Covid and on ICU is not what you’ would expect. “The vaccine doesn’t stop you getting Covid, butyou do get it, you’re much less likely to end up in hospital.”  And he murmured as quietly as he could: “Some people will not survive, despite the effort that’s gone in. It’s really sad.” One man, who appeared to be in his fties, with a tube in his mouth, seemed to stare at us as he lay sedated and on a ventilator. Like many other Covid patients, his eyes were bulging – an effect of the gas that was being pumped into his body. Another man, in his sixties, was recovering from kidney failure linked to the virus – a common Covid complication. He wore mittens to stop him pulling out his wires as a nurse held his hand and gently urged him to squeeze. Most of the patients lying hooked up to machines had not been double-jabbed. Some couldn’t have the vaccine because of other medications, some fell ill before they were fully vaccinated – and others simply chose not to have the jabs.  Senior ICU sister Althea Mentore said: “There was one man who came in very ill and was calling his relatives to say, ‘Go and have the vaccine.’” We also visit the respiratory ward, a -bed unit where  patients were fighting the virus. Dr Karl Metcalfe, a clinical director for specialist medicine, said: “Virtually everyone who thought vaccination was not a good idea says, ‘God, I wish I’d had it.’ It’s frustrating.” He said nursing Covid patients “takes twice as long” because of infection control measures. And he added: “What we’re looking at now is going into the winter with the equivalent of one to two wards occupied by a disease that didn’t even exist two years ago, plus everything  that still exists. “It’s going to be a huge challenge. I’ve been a doctor for  years and I’ve seen more death over the last  months than the rest of my career put together – and more anguish from staff and relatives. “Staff have lost colleagues. We’re seeing all this take its toll.”  In the Covid ward, respiratory consultant Dr Prina Ruparelia described the last  months as “stressful” and told us : “We’re trying to catch up on the workload – and prepare for winter pressures.” But there are fewer staff to cope with that pressure. The BMA’s Consultant Committees Chair, Dr Vishal Sharma, has warned of an estimated shortfall of , doctors in England. The Royal College of Nursing has reported , NHS vacancies. Both unions called on the Government to act now to ensure the NHS has resources to cope, rather than heaping more burden on an “exhausted” workforce. In Liverpool one doctor said  to  Covid patients had been occupying a third of the ICU beds at his hospital since June “effectively reducing our capacity”. In Middlesbrough, an intensive care consultant warned there is “little room to manoeuvre”. As we left the Royal London, Dr Kirwan was still stressing the importance of vaccination. He asked us to urge anyone with concerns or questions to contact a health professional. “We are more than willing to talk to people about it,” he said. “And they will get sensible and truthful answers.” Comment MORE ON British Medical AssociationNHSRoyal College of NursingHospitalsCoronavirusCoronavirus vaccine\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The Queen is said to be against her son’s vision to transform Buckingham Palace into a year-round museum and wants the palace to remain a family home of sorts for the royals.Charles currently splits his time between Clarence House in London and Highgrove in Gloucestershire.In recent months the Queen has been based at Windsor Castle but has private quarters at Buckingham Palace when she is in London.A source told the Mail on Sunday that discussing the future of the palaces is “on the ‘to do’ list”. The source said the challenge was to decide how to effectively spread two generations of the family across a large number of properties, once Charles becomes King. Central to Charles’s priorities is ensuring these spaces go beyond being somewhere for members of the Royal Family to live, and providing a service to the public.  The source added: “Everybody recognises it makes no sense to run so many residences butyou give them up entirely you will never get them back when Prince George and the younger royals grow up and need somewhere to live.” Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie, are said to be among those in the Royal Family vying for accommodation in the reshuffle.  Prince Edward and Princess Anne are also said to be safe in Bagshot Park at Windsor and Gatcombe Park in Gloucestershire respectively. Buckingham Palace is currently used as a working royal residence, housing the Queenaposs offices among its  rooms as well as  royal and guest bedrooms,  staff bedrooms,  offices, and  bathrooms. Members of the public can currently visit the majestic state rooms, the gardens, the priceless fine art hanging from the corridors, and Her Majestyaposs throne room. Under new plans, members of the public will be given access all year around to the palace instead of the usual seasonal admission while the monarch’s living quarters will be dramatically cut.  A friend of Charles said: “Despite what everybody thinks about him not wanting to live there, he will certainly have accommodation there – but it will be a much more modest flat-above-the-shop situation akin to that of the Prime Minister at Downing Street.” Charles’s official London residence at Clarence House was originally earmarked for Harry but his departure to the US means that is “no longer on the cards”, with the residence likely to be saved for Prince George, Princess Charlotte or Prince Louis.

Andrew Morton, author of the bombshell biography Diana: In Her Own Words, said: “Today for Harry, and increasingly for his we, all roads lead back to Diana.” The author claims the late Princess of Wales’s cause-driven le and her tragic death has shaped Harry’s relationship with the rest of his family as well as with the wider public.Writing in the Mail on Sunday, Mr Morton added: “As the Sussexes embarked on their own journey together through Royal le, not a day went by without a reference, a memory or a decision that related in some way to Harry’s late mother. Diana was the third wheel in their marriage.”Mr Morton, who has also written a biography of the Duchess of Sussex, claims family friends of Meghan have said she “wants to be Princess Diana .” and, aged , was deeply moved while watching Diana’s funeral with tears “coursing” down her cheeks. According to one childhood friend, Suzy Ardakani, Meghan would watch old videos of the  wedding of Diana to Prince Charles and the two girls – inspired by Diana’s humanitarian missions – collected clothes and toys for less privileged children.  Suzy’s mother Sonia even gted Meghan a copy of Diana’s biography and it reportedly stood on her bookshelves for several years. When the couple announced their engagement on  November , Harry paid tribute to his mother. Meghan’s ring included small diamonds from Diana’s jewellery collection so that she would be there to “join us on this crazy journey”. Although she was initially seen as bridge between the monarchy’s past and future, Meghan “came to realise, as Diana had done, that everything was not as it seemed in this looking-glass world”, claims Mr Morton. Harry and Meghan stepped down from royal duties in March  and moved to Calornia with their son Archie. They welcomed their daughter Lilibet Diana this summer and named her in honour of both the Queen and the Princess of Wales.

An estimated , sufferers have been undiagnosed since the Covid crisis began. And delays in diagnosis may mean , excess deaths. Many patients’ lesaving procedures were postponed. In the year to February , there were , fewer chemo treatments. Some patients now have terminal diagnoses. Other people are grieving the loss of a loved one who may have been saved with earlier medical intervention. And the problem is far from over. Hospital waiting lists in England are at a record high, and ening, with . million people needing treatment. Evenhospitals increase treatments by %, it may still take until  to clear the backlog, according to the Institute for Public Policy Research. Oncologist Prof Karol Sikora, founding dean of the University of Buckingham’s medical school, said: “Every day a thousand people in Britain will be told they have cancer for the first time. Have you or a loved one been waiting for cancer treatment during lockdown  Let us know in the comments  “But at the time of the peak incidence of Covid this dropped precipitously. Where did the missing patients go  We know they exist, and their diagnosis was signicantly delayed. Many will die consequently because of the delay. “The excess deaths can only be counted accurately in at least one year’s time. Estimates y from , to ,.” He said cancer patients were greatly disadvantaged by policies telling people to stay at home because of the threat of Covid-. Prof Sikora said delays in cancer diagnosis and treatment occurred because patients held off seeking medical help, and reductions in normal primary care services, made access dficult. He also said there was a breakdown of hospital diagnostic pathways and delays in starting the first cancer treatment – usually surgery. “Patient delay – essentially the bottling up of symptoms – were prominent at times of greatest lockdown. There were clear dficulties in accessing primary care services. Even before Covid, GP appointments took some time to get and were essentially rationed. “The lack of capacity within the system meant that once Covid caused additional workload, GP services in many areas simply crumbled.”  He said there were delays in accessing X-rays, CT scans, MR scans, ultrasound images, endoscopies, image guided biopsies as well as surgery. “These delays inevitably caused upward stage migration in many patients, so reducing overall five-year survival signicantly in many patients. “As an example, a stage-one breast cancer patient has a % chance of cure whereas a stagethree patient has only %.” Prof Pat Price, a cancer doctor and chairman of charity Action Radiotherapy, said the Government has been “reckless” and urgently needed to ringfence investment for cancer services with a national recovery plan. She added: “Cancer is an emergency and it hasn’t been treated as an emergency.” Cancer Research’s Kruti Shrotri said: “Tens of thousands of people remain undiagnosed, or waiting for tests and treatment. But cancer services have been struggling for years, even before the pandemic hit. We are concerned that cancer survival could go backwards.” No hope’ for mum told it was refluxMum-of-two Jackie Johnson, ,pictured above, has stage-four cancer of the oesophagus and has been told by medics there is no hope.Three times in lockdown, doctors told her she had acid reflux. She only realised the severity of her illness by reading notes left on her bed by a nurse. This was after months of problems eating and swallowing. She was unable to see her GP, despite spending hours on hold to her local surgery.  Jackie and her partner Colin considered selling their home in Fe to pay for a private CT scan but she finally has an NHS one booked in for next week. The charity fundraiser, who has been off sick for more than a year, initially paid for a consultation with an expert in her cancer at St Bartholomew’s Hospital in London after the NHS said she could only have palliative care. She said: “I haven’t had any cancer treatment since January and I feel like all the doctors are just expecting me to die. “It’s going to take years to catch-up on the backlog – but people with cancer don’t have years. Daughter died week after right diagnosis A grieving mum says the Covid backlog delayed her daughter’s accurate diagnosis of the cancer which took her le.

She was misdiagnosed in December with sciatica after medics had also suggested it could have been a water infection or a twisted bowel.. She was given only painkillers.  Lata, of Leicester, was finally diagnosed with epithelioid sarcoma, an aggressive cancer affecting soft body tissue, but it was too late for treatment. She died a week later, in February. Her mum Lizzie Molyneaux, , said Lata had a lump and could barely walk but was not taken seriously. “We didn’t have any time to properly plan her funeral or say proper goodbyes,” she added. “To sit and watch my daughter deteriorate like that is vile, absolutely vile. She had her whole future, her whole le, in front of her. And now it’s gone. Vital scan was too late Sherwin Hall had agonising leg pain but had to “beg” for an MRI scan during Covid. When he got it, it was too late. The dad of two, , from Leeds, was initially given antibiotics but the pain persisted and, unable to get a GP appointment, he went to AE  times in four weeks. The scan in May last year revealed a two-metre tumour in his pelvis and  small tumours on his lungs.  He died a week after marrying La’Troya, , last November. Their baby Sancho was just eight months. La’Troya said: “It’s likely Sherwin would still be herehis cancer was found sooner. But we were repeatedly told services had been slowed down and delayed due to Covid.” Covid delays ‘took young Kelly’s le The family of a young mum who died of bowel cancer believes she would have lived but for delays to chemo caused by Covid. Kelly Smith’s treatment was paused for  weeks at the start of the lockdown and she believed her cancer progressed rapidly during that period. She died in June after three-and-a-half years of living with the disease. Kelly, of Macclesfield, Cheshire, who was mum to seven-year-old son Finn, said at the time: “I’m angry at Covid because it’s me that had this break. It’s me that has been put in this situation.”  Get the biggest news delivered to your inbox.for the Mirroraposs free newsletters Her family has launched a petition and the #CatchUpWithCancer campaign to demand that cancer services are resumed to avoid other deaths. Kelly’s dad Craig Russell said: “The lack of urgency to tackle the cancer backlog is mind-numbing. “The Government and senior NHS leaders need to react to this national tragedy – it’s not OK to let cancer patients suffer and die. Every day of delay is a day too many. “It is too late for Kelly, but there’s still time to save others.

The child was playing on the fun house with other children at Gilberdyke funfair in Hull when she got her finger stuck after falling on a rotating walkway.A parent whose child was on the ride at the same time who witnessed the accident told Hull Live it was horric.A witness, whose daughter was in front of the child, said: It happened as soon as they got on, on the walkway. There were spinning plates and my daughter managed to stay upright, but this little girl, and my friendaposs daughter, both fell over. They could not get up. The two girls were on the same circle, spinning, and my friend suddenly started screaming aposstop the rideapos and making cut throat gestures.

The Duke of Lancaster began le as a passenger ferry and cruise liner in , with its passengers treated to silver service as they travelled the seas from Ireland, Scotland and Europe.During the s and s, its first-class quarters were branded the best around, according to a website dedicated to the ship, reports Wales Online. However, when the huge ship took its final trip in  it was sold to a Liverpool-based company who wanted to re-use it as a dry docked attraction. In the years since then it has stood empty, frozen in time. It is still the same inside, the bar, the restaurant, the cafeterias - everything exactly as it was. But now, decades later, it is preparing for a new lease of le with grand plans to restore it to its former glory. In  the Duke of Lancaster was beached at Llanerch-y-Mor in Flintshire and turned into a floating leisure and retail complex called The Fun Ship.Flyers were printed and there were grand plans for a hotel conversion and ious attractions. But the dream was short lived and never came into full fruition. The owners of the ship walked away following alleged long-standing legal disputes with the local council and by the mid-s, the ship had closed. One of the plans for The Fun Ship was an amusements arcade covering an entire deck. So when it closed over  arcade machines from the golden era were sealed shut inside the ship. The shipaposs owner, John Rowley, spent around  years trying to start a project that could restore the ship to serve the community and attract tourists. Sadly, it never happened, and in , Mr Rowley allowed several street artists to leave their stamp on the ship.  However, more recently things have been looking up for the iconic landmark. Johnaposs son, Antony Rowley, said after decades of trying, they had finally gotten an events project off the ground. In early September , a iety fun day was held at the quay just outside the ship - but there are a lot more events to come. The aim is to raise money that will go towards renovating the ship for it to eventually reopen to the public. Antony, who grew up on the ship, said: A few weeks ago we had Covent Garden street performers, live wrestling, bouncy castles and stalls. We also have a beach bar there that we built which is permanently there. One of the original leboats is being used as a beer bar so people can sit in there and have a beer next to the bar. On December , weaposre holding a Christmas market on the Quay. There will be all local businesses and street food stalls and we should have one of the local schools doing a carol service. Weaposre slowly starting to do more and more.  Antony said their first aim is to re-open the top decks into a working bar so the public can enjoy a drink while taking in the beautul scenery. It is hoped it will be complete within the next  months. All the money we earn from the events goes into restoration of the ship, Antony said. The area has been closed for  years because we had disputes over the access of the ship which has now all been rectied. Thataposs why weaposve held the first event and now weaposre going to start doing more events and everything we do will go into restoration. The main goal next would be to open up the top decks with a bar and then we will slowly work our way down. He said the rest of the ship would take a lot longer to restore, however, with regular events hopefully being planned throughout next year, the future looks bright. We have lots of other people who want to do other events here as well, he said. There are people who want to have weddings here.  They can use the bar, the pier, they can put a marquee up or have the wedding here. Any event is possible as of next year. Weaposve just done these two this year to prove events are viable on this site. Antony said that although they are restoring the shipaposs interior to make it fit for purpose, they will be sure to keep its original features for an authentic experience. He said: Itaposs been docked here since  and itaposs still the same inside, the bar, the restaurant, the cafeterias - everything is still exactly as it was. Weaposre keeping the original features when we restore it.  For Antony, itaposs not just nostalgia that drives him to restore the ship into something that can be enjoyed once again. He said it gave him joy to give something back to the community, to create something that locals and tourists alike can enjoy and benefit from. The area needs it, he said. Thereaposs nothing in the area, it needs a tourist attraction. Weaposre trying to do everything we can for the local community by bringing more tourists back into the area so everyone can do well out of it. We already get tourists who come down to walk on the coastal path just to have a look at the ship, but with the site being open, it will attract thousands.  Thereaposs a Duke of Lancaster appreciation society that has around three-and-a-half thousand members, among others, and theyaposre all wanting something to happen here.All the local businesses and local people want something to happen on this site. Itaposs been a long time coming. Itaposs been sat here for so many years empty and weaposve not been able to do anything and now we can finally start doing something.

The property in Notting Hill, west London, is just  square feetand contains a bed, sink, toilet and shower - but no kitchen. In comparison, the typical size of a parking space in the UK is  square feet.The property cannot be occupied as a permanent residence or let out, the sellers have stated, and only cash purchases will be accepted. According to the property website Zoopla, the flat offers “a wonderful opportunity to create a London bolt hole in this prime central location”. The description continues: “This studio room requires modernisation throughout and could become a wonderful base for someone.”The room was originally listed in February  for £,, but has been marked down several times since, thereports. Its first listed price was just over the cost of an average UK house of £, in September, according to Nationwide data.  The minimum studio floor area under national standards is  square metres, or about  square feet, but recent relaxations in planning laws mean smaller flats are available, especiallythey have been converted from office blocks.In August, a flat measuring  square feet located just a stoneaposs throw from Harrodaposs and Harvey Nichols in London was sold for a staggering £,. The so-called micro-penthouse with the eye-watering price tag made it one of the priciest ever sold in London at £, per square feet.

The flat was put up for auction in December  by auctioneers Allsop but the sale officially went through in December  for £k. It had previously been listed for sale in January  for £,. According to Zoopla, house prices increased by £ per day on average in the six months leading up to August. This was up from £ per day typically over the previous six months .

With last winter disrupted by lockdown, and young people missing so much school, college, time with friends and seeing grandparents, getting the vaccine will help make sure this year is a whole lot better. Not only does the vaccine protect young people against serious illness – almost  per cent of Covid patients admitted to hospital are unvaccinated – it also means they’re less likely to spread the virus to elderly family members. No more FOMO We’ve come a long way with the vaccination programme since those dark days of last winter. The Covid- vaccine has already saved more than , lives and prevented  million infections.Jabs are now being rolled out for the - age group, and more than  per cent of --year-olds have already had theirs. And getting the jab couldn’t be easier: schools and colleges are offering it through their immunisation programmes, while older teenagers can make an appointment through the online booking service at nhs.uk covidvaccination.If you’re a parent orof a --year-old, schools will ask for your consent before they receive the vaccine, and you can help --year-olds book their dose online. Then it’s one less thing for you to worry about – and they won’t need to worry about missing out on all those good times with family and friends.Fashion and lestyle influencer Arabella Daho , , is keen to book her vaccine appointment. “I think the vaccine is a great thing for everyone to have – it’s helping to keep us safe, she says. We have loads of events coming up such as Halloween and Christmas, and we don’t want to miss them. “On my digital s I’ve interviewed a few of the doctors who worked on the vaccine, talking about how safe it is, and why it’s important for everyone to get it. It was good to talk to them – I learned a lot, soanyone wants to see those videos or do research to help them feel better about getting the vaccine, I think they should. “Young people think they’re immune to everything, but we can actually be spreading Covid, especially to older people, who are more vulnerable. So getting jabbed helps communities and families get back to normal.” ‘All my kids have had their vaccines’ We asked GP and mum-of-three Dr Dawn Harper about what the vaccine means for young people… How do you feel about your kids being offered the vaccine  All my kids are in their s and they’ve all had their vaccines. I was very keen for them to get vaccinated as soon as they were eligible. If I had a -to--year-old I’d be putting them forward for the vaccine. We’ve been able to draw on global data several countries have already been offering the vaccine to --year-olds, and we have a lot of evidence to show that it’s safe for that age group. And while young people are less likely to become seriously ill with Covid, I am in total agreement with the chief medical officers concerning the impact on their mental health and their education, and also the possibility of long Covid. And, of course, we are only enjoying the relative freedoms we have today in the UK because of the vaccine programme. Without it, we’d still be in a lockdown. We need the vaccine to protect ourselves from Covid and long Covid, and also to protect our loved ones and our community. So I’m very keen for young people to come forward and have the vaccine. Did you have to persuade your children to have the jab  They were up for it. For me, lockdown was easier: I’m  and don’t mind walking my dog on my own, but I think young people really struggled missing out on their social lives.  What are the side effects of the vaccine in young people  The main one is perhaps a bit of soreness in the arm. I had a sore arm after my first vaccine but nothing at all after my second. It’s incredibly safe. I’m still amazed at how the researchers worked to get this to market as quickly as they did, running trials simultaneously without cutting safety corners. Long Covid is a worry for many parents. Will the vaccine protect young people against it  I have patients with long Covid. It is a horrible condition and there is evidence that the vaccine protects against this. We’re still on a very steep learning curve with long Covid. It’s unpredictable. We have fit young people who have been knocked sideways by it. The things that people talk to me about is the fatigue, the brain fog – I’ve got patients who are very intelligent academics who just can’tat work. Is the vaccine suitable for vegans and people with food allergies  It’s totally vegan-friendly and not a problem for those with allergies. What about those who are scared of needles  For the -to- age group, school nurses are well experienced in managing this. If you’re nervous you can ask to lie down. You can also buy over-the-counter cream to rub into your arm  minutes beforehand. I don’t even think I felt my second vaccine going in it’s such a tiny needle. For a moment of a sharp scratch, to know that you’re protected against Covid it’s well worth the trade-off. Has the vaccine been rigorously tested on the younger age group  Yes, I feel very confident about the science behind it. There’s been a lot of debate on risk vs benefit in dferent age groups. Young people are less likely to get seriously ill, but we need to weigh that against missed education, protection from long Covid and letting kids get out and about again so that we can help them with any mental health issues. If you come from a middle-class background where you’ve all got your own computers, home schooling was much easier thanyou’re all trying to share one screen, so it’s really important that we try to even out those dferences and get people back into the classroom.Last winter’s lockdown was so tough on young people’s mental health. Does the vaccine mean that things will be better this year  That wouldbe my hope. We’ll see messages coming out about meeting outside and ventilation I still wear a mask in the supermarket we have hand sanitiser in our bags and our cars, and I think that makes sense. But expanding the vaccine programme to include these younger people will mean that hopefully they can start to get back to some kind of normality. AGED  OR  If you have a teenager who hasn’t booked their vaccine yet, you can give them a helping hand so that they don’t get left behind – and protect the rest of the family from serious illness. Jabs can now be booked online at nhs.uk covidvaccination, or you can ask your GP or go to your nearest walk-in centre. PARENT OR CARER OF A --YEAR-OLD Offering young people the vaccine is essential to prevent them missing school and help make sure they can carry on doing the things they love with their friends and family. Everyone in this age group will be offered a first dose of the Pfizer vaccine through their school’s immunisation programme, which already administers the HPV and MMR vaccines. Parents and s will be asked for their consent via a form – andyou have any questions you can discuss them with the School Age Immunisation Service."},{"url":null,"title":"madeleine mccann suspect brags cops","story":":root Madeleine McCann suspect brags cops have no evidence over links to sex crimesChristian Brueckner, , the prime suspect over the disappearance of Madeleine McCann, claims police do not have a \"shred of evidence\" against him over his alleged links to five sex crimesChristian Brueckner was named as the prime suspect in the Madeleine McCann case last year Image: Carabinieri Milano via Getty ImagesByTim Hanlon:,  Oct  The prime suspect over Madeleine McCann’s disappearance has taunted police claiming they don’t have a “shred of evidence” against him over his alleged links to five sex crimes.Christian Brueckner, , a convicted sex offender, said that detectives were “clutching at straws” as they tried to link him to five other sex crimes.

Closing time was about am and I went over the road to get some chips. I sat against the window of Urban Kitchen when a guy came out of nowhere and just hit me.

The young plasterer first put his symptoms down to a hangover after going to a charity event - and suspected he might also have sinusitis, which his mum Viv suffers from.But his worried mum and dad later rushed him to Arrowe Park Hospital after his condition deteriorated, the Liverpool Echo reports.It was here that doctors discovered Luke was suffering from bacterial meningitis and he was put into an induced coma, but sadly died a week later. Two years on from Lukeaposs death on October , , his family are determined to keep raising awareness of the disease and the signs and symptoms that people need look out for.  Viv said: It was two years on Friday and my heart knows itaposs happened but my headaposs telling me it hasnapost, and Iaposm two years in. We certainly wouldnapost want anyone to walk in our shoes because itaposs not a nice le we are just existing, and we are still two years on trying to find our way in this new le forced on us without him. So raising awareness for us,it helps just one person then job done. Everyday, Lukeaposs parents Viv and Del, , visit him in the cemetery where he is buried and sit and speak to him. And at .pm every Tuesday, to mark the time and day that he died, they play songs at the graveside from his favourite artists including Gerry Cinnamon and the Stone Roses.

He loved a flutter on the horses and he loved his holidays, but he absolutely adored his niece and his nephews. Weaposre a very close knit family. Every loss is horric but I think to lose a child, I canapost even describe the pain. His friends are just unreal, absolutely unreal. They pick us up and they come and see us. Following Lukeaposs death in , the family set up the Luke Brown Foundation in his memory, with the aim of raising awareness of meningitis and to offer support to affected families. Ultimately, the family want to buy a lodge which families with loved ones affected by meningitis can use to get a well-earned break and have time to reflect on what has happened when the time is right for them. Viv said: The thing for the lodge is for anybody affected in the north west by meningitis, bacterial or viral - they can go to the lodge and reflect on whataposs happened to them as a family.For more information on the Luke Brown Foundation click here.

Abby Gibbsapos devastated family said she told them not getting the jab was the worst mistake I have ever made as she battled the virus in intensive care. The -year-oldaposs mum, Lynne Gibbs, and brother, Lewis Gibbs, have now urged others not to follow in Abbyaposs footsteps and go get the jabthey havenapost already. The former apprentice hairdresser, from Brandon, County Durham, was mum to Makayla, six, Harrison, five, and Fallyn, who turns three on Monday. She was supposed to get her first dose with her mum but decided not after becoming convinced it was harmful, Ms Gibbs explained.  Abby was supposed to go the same day as me to have her vaccine, but she was that hooked on conspiracy theories, she decided not to go. The first day she was admitted, she said aposmam, I wish I had gone and got the vaccine – this is the worst mistake I have ever madeapos. Abby was admitted into intensive care at the University Hospital of North Durham, where she spent  days battling the virus, after falling seriously ill with Covid at the start of last month. She died last Wednesday .  Only able to communicate with her children and family using Facetime, Ms Gibbs said Abby continued to provide for her family for as long as she could, even as her situation worsened. She said: She was in intensive care and she ordered online a full shop, with clothes – she was arranging stuff for the kids. Mr Lewis added: I was the last person she spoke to, and she said make sure you look after the kids – make sure they can have the best le they can. Ms Gibbs described her daughter as her best friend and said she had been known among everyone for her humour and loyalty to her loved ones.  She had a beautul smile, she was just so kind – it was her smile and generosity, and humour that got everybody. She would make us laugh to the point of crying, she was really funny – and was proud of her kids. She was my best friend, I could rely on her for anything and she would stand by her family through thick and thin. Mrs Gibbs went on to say Abby only ever wanted to be a mam.  Even from a very early age she was pushing prams with look-a-like babies in them. All she ever talked about was her kids, she was so very proud of her kids. She had even ordered clothes for one of her friendaposs kids who has not yet been born. Abby would even buy Christmas presents for the children of less fortunate families. Her death has hit the local community hard, with more than  people gathering in Brandon last Sunday to release a balloon in her memory. And a GoFundMe page has already raised more than £, in aid of helping to support Abby’s children. Mr Gibbs so the family has been overwhelmed and impressed by the amount support. This community in Brandon, it is so close-knit and itaposs just so special – we have been inundated with messages, cards and flowers and we don’t know how to thank everybody enough. Following Abbyaposs death all of her family have been for their vaccine and her brother hopes her story will encourage others to do the same. I wouldnapost wish this on anybody, he added.

After the kids had gone to school and her husband was at work, Pamela ordered takeaways for breakfast and curry for lunch. McDonald’s meals or baskets of KFC arrived five days a week for five years. The bill hit £ a month – £, in total. But the real cost was to ft in Pamela’s morale as she piled on st thanks to her , calories a day. Today, she reveals her takeaway torment – and how she managed to bin the junk diet and shed the fat. What are you best tips to lose weight  Let us know in the comments Secretary Pamela, , says: “It all started when I was picked on at work and spiralled into a depression where I didn’t want to leave the house. “I’d order McDonald’s, KFC, cooked breakfasts – and curry for lunch. “I’d have liked to have spent the money on clothes, socialising and saving for our dream holiday home but I was wasting it on food. “I just couldn’t stop. I never used scales but when I stood on them after five years and saw I weighed  stone I wanted to disappear. I hated the way I looked.” Pamela hid the wrappers to stop husband Gary, , daughter Payton, , and son Jayden, , finding out. At teatime she cooked them healthy food and tucked into it herself. She goes on: “I was in a dark place. As soon as I saw Payton and Jayden get on the bus for school, I went back to bed and slept the day away. I only got up to eat. “It made me happy for a short time, so I didn’t care how much I spent. I was desperate to feel good again.  I didn’t want my family to find out because I was ashamed of the downwards spiral I was trapped in. If Gary and I got invited somewhere, I would make my excuses not to go. The times I had to go out I dreaded seeing anyone I knew. I caught people laughing. “A guy in the local garage said ‘You’re getting bigger and bigger’. I sat in my car and cried. Gary suggested it was because I wasn’t as active as I used to be. He knew I was comfort eating but didn’t have a clue about the takeaways.”  Two things turned Pamela’s le around. First, she got a new job with an electrical firm in Glasgow. Second, last November, she saw an old school friend on TV – an Army veteran who had motor neurone disease and was raising money for stem-cell treatment.

Ken May has lived in the same property since  when he was a baby but now faces eviction. The -year-old, who lives in Standfield Gardens, Gateshead, has no mains electricity, instead using a petrol generator to charge car batteries and stores Calor gas canisters in his home. A judge blasted the storage of fuel as dangerous and backed the council to evict him as the property had deteriorated. But his neighbours are determined to help him stay.One local reportedly told the Sun : Kenaposs always helping with the lady across the road, heaposs a great help to everyone.The council have acted unfairly, they even said he had rats in his home once. Iaposve never seen rats in his home and I have a big dog sothere were any rats, we would have known about it by now. Other neighbours also backed Ken saying apospeople want to helpapos. Ken has  days to show heaposs getting the property into shape or heaposll be turfed out. His garden has debris from a hedge heaposs cut down and an abandoned motorbike is near his front door. But nonetheless there have been messages of support on social media.  On Facebook Ciprian Slatineanu wrote: We had a chat with Ken this morning and we are planning to help him with cleaning and remove all the unusable stuff. Several locals responded, with some offering their vans to help carry larger items to the skip or put them up for sale. Ken told The Sun he was grateful to his neighbours and said the generator is not dangerous and heaposs not harming anyone. He added: Iaposve paid my national insurance for  years so I get a full state pension and the right to live here. District Judge Charnock-Neal made the possession order, saying that it wasn’t in breach of human rights legislation and that housing law allows for eviction of tenants that allow properties to deteriorate. She said: “Storing fuel including petrol and Calor gas could cause danger. He failed to keep his home neat, tidy and clean, evidenced from the photo I have seen from -. “He failed to dispose of rubbish left in his shed, lean to, and garden. In contrast to the claimant the defendant offered limited evidence. “His reason for not offering entry to the property was his age. He offered no medical evidence that he was shielding.

Vatic, the British start-up behind the tests, has registered them with the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agencyfor professional use and is attempting to get approval for the tests to be used at home. The test works by identying whether the virus is active, in a similar way to how a flower bud can appear opened or closed. If the spike in the virus is active, the bud would be open as it would use this to enter human cells. If it is closed, then this means the virus is inactive and the person is not infectious, reports the . The test would be taken just using a swab from the mouth and would produce a result in  minutes. In its clinical trials involving about , people, no  positives have so far been produced. Alex Sheppard, a co-founder of Vatic, said the tests were aimed to “restore the liberties and freedoms that were lost for almost two years”.  He added that the tests had been built to be future-proof against mutations. “All of the other antigen tests which are out there, it’s not a question ofbut when they’ll stop working,” he said. “Eventually the tests will need to be redesigned because the virus will have mutated. “Our test will always be able to detect the virus insofar as it will enter human cells through the same mechanism, and that wouldn’t change becauseit did, it would be a new virus altogether.”It comes as the UK faces a surge in demand for Covid tests with many people are coming down with normal cold symptoms.Official figures from local test sites show that the numbers of swabs being received are the highest since July when there was a surge during the European Championships.  During the period from September  to  there were , tests taken place while four weeks before that the figure was a little over ,. Dr Simon Clarke, associate professor in cellular microbiology at the University of Reading said that it is logical that more testing is happening now in autumn due to generally more bugs similar to Covid being caught.He told the: “Given that the symptoms are similar, it’s reasonable to expect that people will seek out a PCR test, indeed it’s the responsible thing to do as ignoring symptoms would just mean greater spread of the virus, increasing the chance of restrictions being placed on all of our lives.”It is normal for there to be an increase in common colds and flu symptoms during the autumn and winter and this will have been intensied with people’s immune systems weakened by the lockdown and social distancing.However the number of tests also coincides with figures showing a rise in Covid cases with % more people in England testing positive.Official Test and Trace figures show , people tested positive for Covid at least once in the week leading up to  September. This is the highest number since the week to September .

could shoot up by up to p a litre this week - but said global factors were to blame rather than profiteering. Brian Madderson, chairman of the Petrol Retailers Association , today warned that fuel shortages are getting worse in some parts of the country. He said that London and the South East have been particularly badly hit. He told the BBC Radio  Today programme: In London and the South East and possibly parts of eastern England,anything it had got worse. Mr Madderson welcomed the announcement that military drivers are to be deployed from Monday, but he warned it will only have a limited impact. This isnapost going to be the major panacea, he said. Itaposs a large help but in terms of the volume, they are not going to be able to carry that much.  We do need a prioritisation of deliveries to filling stations - particularly the independent ones which are the neighbourhood retail sites - in London and the South East starting immediately. He said rising world oil prices mean motorists should expect higher prices at the pumps when filling stations are resupplied. Expect anything from ,  or even p a litre increases at the pump. This is not profiteering. This is genuine wholesale price increases causes by global factors. The average price of unleaded at supermarkets is £., says the AA. But yesterday the Cloisters Gulf station in affluent Cha, London, was selling unleaded at .p per litre and super unleaded at .p. Desperate motorists still queued to fill up and the station ran out of fuel.  A huge shortfall in HGV drivers has hit supply chains, with fuel not reaching garages and empty shelves in shops. The Government has announced a temporary visa scheme for nearly , foreign food haulage drivers, which was due to expire on December , will be extended to the end of February. Additionally, temporary visas are to be issued to  overseas fuel drivers “immediately”. Under the scheme, those foreign drivers will be able to work in the UK from now until the end of March.

The Petrol Retailers Associationhas said there is a notable improvement overall around the country but in their survey of , petrol stations, still  per cent have no fuel. A Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy internal assessment, reportedly seen by the , similarly said that London, and the South East of England were on a “red list” that showed stocks were below  per cent. Army drivers are to join the effort to refuel petrol stations from tomorrow and the PRA are calling for them to target the south east of England after a chaotic week of shortages that has resulted in panic buying and some drivers hoarding petrol in water bottles.At the same time there is a fear of a price spike in fuel that could go up by a reported five pence per litre next week.  This is thought to be down to the rising price of oil and a weak pound against the dollar, but also there have been claims that some petrol stations have been “opportunistic” in rising prices. The UK has been hit by long queues for petrol due to shortages and panic buying. Supply problems have been caused by a lack of drivers and this has led to the military stepping in. Brian Madderson, chairman of the Petrol Retailers Association, told the BBC: While more fuel is being delivered to forecourts than is being sold overall, the situation remains critical in London and the South East where many filling stations remain dry. He backed the help from military drivers and the extension of the HGV visa cut-off to March next year, to help ease the crisis. Mr Madderson also felt that special focus in supply needs to be on the South East of England.  He told the : ““In London and the South East and possibly parts of eastern England,anything, it had got worse. “We do need a prioritisation of deliveries to filling stations – particularly the independent ones which are the neighbourhood retail sites – in London and the South East, starting immediately.” The PRA also would like to see deliveries going to high streets ahead of supermarkets so as boost public confidence as the people could see the petrol available and so not panic buy. The chairman of the PRA told Sky News his organisationaposs survey showed that only  per cent of more than , sites checked on Saturday had no fuel, an improvement on the  per cent reported to be dry on Friday, but local bottlenecks remained. The survey also showed that  per cent of sites now had both petrol and diesel available to buy. Stories have appeared on social media of petrol stations that have raised prices to allegedly take advantage of the shortages with prices believed to be as high as p a litre. Howard Cox, Fair Fuel UKaposs founder, told the : “With the oil price hitting  a barrel, weaker sterling and of course, Grant Shapps’s naive ‘don’t panic buy’ proclamation, the perfect opportunistic time to make hard pressed drivers pay more to fill up is in place for the greedy unchecked fuel supply-chain businesses.” With an acute shortage of truck drivers straining supply chains to breaking point, the Government said on Friday that  military tanker personnel will complete their training over the weekend and start deliveries on Monday. Members of the military were pictured at Buncefield Oil Depot at Hemel Hempstead, north of London, on Saturday.Health minister Sajid Javid said earlier in the day that the supply situation was no longer deteriorating.He said: It seems the situation is stabilising, itaposs not completely over yet, thataposs one of the reasons that the army have been asked to help.

Aimee Keogh, , was called penguin by classmates because of her limp, but thought it was just a rugby injury. However the schoolgirl, from St Helens, has since learned that she has a rare condition called lipped upper femoral epiphysis.Aimeeaposs mum Sarah Keogh told the Liverpool Echo that Aimee had started limping before lockdown but the family thought it was just a rugby injury.However, when lockdown hit, Aimee struggled to see a doctor and had to have phone consultations with a GP. Got a story  Email webnews@mirror  Sarah said: They ended up doing an x-ray of her knee and her thigh and they couldnapost see anything wrong but she still wasnapost right. She was limping that badly she was being called a penguin at school. Her leg had turned outwards and I just thought it was to cause her less pain but I didnapost realise she actually couldnapost turn her leg. I had to keep pushingthat there was something wrong and that her leg wasnapost okay. Aimee was then taken to Warrington Hospital, where she was seen by a consultant who also worked at Alder Hey Childrenaposs Hospital. Sarah explained: As soon as the consultant saw her he had an idea what was wrong, she had this thing called a slipped upper femoral epiphysis, so basically her leg had slipped out of socket really. Slipped upper femoral epiphysis is the most common hip disorder in adolescents, yet still only occurs in around  children per ,.As soon as the diagnosis was made, Aimee was told by doctors that she was not to walk, and was taken to Alder Hey by ambulance, where consultant Mr Talbot performed her surgery.Sarah said: They essentially dislocated her hip and cut through the bone, so she has four screws in her hip now.They were hoping she would be walking within  weeks but there were problems with her blood supply, itaposs been almost a year since her surgery and sheaposs only really started walking in the past three weeks. Aimee took part in a km walk across Knowsley Safari Park, shortly after being able to walk again, on September , and raised £ for Alder Hey Childrenaposs Charity. As soon as she knew she could walk she wanted to do the walk she wanted to do this km walk to raise money for Alder Hey, but sheaposd just started walking again so she took one crutch as a security blanket but she wanted to say thank you for all that theyaposve done.

Now the Met Office has said the centre of those gales is moving north and a yellow wind warning is in place in Scotland on Sunday.Overall, weather forecasters are predicting Sunday to be a brighter day but severe gales are expected tofor southern England early next week. The high winds and torrential rain that have affected much of Britain will give way to sunshine in time for the London Marathon, the Met Office said.  Saturday saw gusts of mph at Needles Old Battery on the Isle of Wight, and between am and pm Evershot in Dorset recorded mm of rain, the Met Office issued a yellow weather warning for most of the south of England and there were a series of flood alerts. But on Sunday, temperatures in London will be at around C between -am as the race begins and rise to highs of C during the day. The Met Office does predict several showers throughout the day, but no more than -mm of rainfall as they will be fleeting and scattered. Gusts of wind between -mph will be consistent locally throughout Sunday, and could affect runners competing in the marathon. A Met Office spokesperson said: It looks a lovely sunny morning to come, plenty of sunshine around but a bit of a south-westerly breeze and the cloud will tend to increase as the race goes on.  Certainly for later finishes into the afternoon, there will be more cloud around the wind will have picked up a little bit, and there will be an increasing chance of a shower developing as well. The average temperature for London in October is .C, and ranges from C to C north to south. A yellow wind weather warning is also in place for the Shetland Islands for Sunday, with gusts of up to mph expected to cause disruption to travel, especially in coastal regions. Other areas of the UK are also staying average for the time of year, for example Manchester will peak at around C but the north of the UK is likely to get more rainfall throughout the day. The wind and rain is to continue into next week. A Met forecaster said: It’s all down to an area of low pressure that is dominating the UK at the moment, the centre of that moves to the north of Scotland on Sunday. We see this trail of westy winds bringing a mixture of sunshine and showers and that stays the case for Monday too, but on Monday night and Tuesday a deepening area of low pressure will bring a spell of wet and very windy conditions potentially to the south. UK forecast for the next  days Today: Heavy rain and severe gales over the Northern Isles clearing later this morning. Sunny spells for most parts, and many eastern parts starting dry, but showers already in the west moving east, some heavy with hail and thunder. Tonight: Further showers in the south and west, and remaining windy in the north. Else, becoming dry with clear spells developing. Monday: Another day of sunshine and showers, heaviest and most frequent in the north and west. Wet and windy weather arriving in the south-west during the evening.

The police officer - who was nicknamed aposThe Rapistapos by colleagues - performed duties in the Houses of Parliament at least five times. He had a known history of sexual deviance prior to his time on the parliamentary estate.The -year-old was even issued with an aposaccess-all-areasapos pass, one senior parliamentary source told The Times, who first reported on the story.It also emerged on Saturday evening that Couzens - who has been told he will never be released from prison - received up to £, from the Met Police in pay during the four months after his arrest.  He was not officially sacked by the force until mid-July after he pleaded guilty to raping and killing -year-old Sarah. Couzens joined the Metaposs elite parliamentary and diplomatic protection command in  with very little or no additional vetting. The Met previously refused to discuss his Westminster posting and had said last week his aposprimary role was to patrol diplomatic premisesapos. But after inquiries by Commons Speaker Lindsay Hoyle, a Met spokeswoman confirmed on Saturday: Couzens was deployed to armed static protection duties on the Parliamentary Estate on five occasions from February to July .  The shocking revelation has sparked fury among MPs. Hoyle said he was aposextremely concernedapos and would be speaking to under-fire Met chief Dame Cressida Dick. He told The Times: I have asked the Met to meet me urgently to discuss how this person could have been deemed suitable for deployment here. Further, I will be seeking reassurance that at no time was anyone on the parliamentary estate put at risk. Labour MP Rosie Duffield, who has been the subject of online abuse and threats due to her trans views, said: Itaposs chilling that someone whose nickname was aposthe Rapistapos was guarding MPs when we are told that we are protected by a ring of steel.  She also called on Parliament to hold a security review to ensure it does not happen again. One senior parliamentary source, speaking in The Times, accused the Met of deliberately trying to aposmisleadapos authorities by claiming Couzens did not have a parliamentary pass. Meanwhile Scotland Yard has come under fire for the fact Couzens still received a salary following his March arrest.  The Met claims it was bound by law to keep paying him until he pleaded guilty, after which he was sacked following a misconduct hearing. But a government source said Home Office lawyers determined his estimated £,-a-year salary could have been withheld once he was arrested and charged. It is not clearhe will be asked to pay back the earnings accrued while he sat in a jail cell in Belmarsh.

Mr Davis, an engineer from Florida, said he is currently hiking the trail and yesterday a man in a vehicle pulled up next to him to ask for directions. He said he has no doubt the man was Laundrie, who went missing three weeks ago after police named him a person of interest in Gabbyaposs disappearance. Laundrie, , ed home without Gabby on September  after the couple had been on a cross-country trip in their van. The -year-old influencer was reported missing on September  and was found dead near Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming on September .  Laundrie went missing just before Gabbyaposs body was found and has not been caught since.The case has attracted numerous online sleuths, with some people - including Dog the Bounty Hunter - joining the search to find clues about Laundrieaposs whereabouts.Mr Davis, a dad-of-four, said the man he saw - who was driving a coloured pickup and wearing a dark bandana - claimed he was lost and that he was travelling to Calornia to go and see his girlfriend after they got into a fight. He said: He was worried and not making sense.  The hiker said he did not immediately recognise the man and only after the encounter he thought it might be Laundrie.He told the New York Post : There is no doubt in my mind I spoke to Brian Laundrie — none whatsoever.Dog the Bounty Hunteraposs daughter sent me an audio file of Brianaposs voice and the voice was the same I heard.  Mr Davis said he has contacted authorities about the interaction but has not heard from the FBI or police yet. He added: Obviously, as a father with a daughter, I want to do whatever I can to help the family find closure and get this guy off the streets.Last week, a woman claimed she picked up Laundrie while he was hitchhiking last month and dropped him off at the site where the body of his partner Gabby was discovered.Norma Jean Jalovec said she gave Laundrie, a ride in Grand Teton National Park, Wyoming, on August , two days after Ms Petito was last seen. She said Laundrie had got into the front seat of her jeep at about .pm after she saw him “walking backward and holding out his thumb” in an attempt to hitch a ride. While she drove, Laundrie told her he had spent time hiking and seen elk and moose, and that he had a fiance, she said. The search for him is now entering its third week, with his family lawyer saying they hope he is still alive.

The couple moved to their £ million mansion last summer after leaving behind their lives as royals in the UK.Their new place in Calorniaaposs Montecito is as beautul as youaposd expect, with a garden that is particularly amazing, OK! reports.The green space includes an envy-inducing childrenaposs playground and a chicken coop, so naturally theyaposve chosen the location for some of their photo shoots. They even let Oprah Winfreyaposs camera crew film in there for a segment of their bombshell interview. Oprah got an exclusive invite to the chicken coop, which is adorably named aposArchieaposs Chick Innapos.  The chickens that live there were given a second chance when they were rescued from a local factory farm. While pictures of the play area have not been released by the couple, the real estate listing gave an insight into what it is like. Archie and Lilibet are lucky to have playhouses, slides, a climbing frame, a tightrope, a helter skelter, and climbing walls. Actual kid heaven! We did get a little preview of one playhouse, when Meghan and Harry released a sketch of themselves in front of it for Christmas .  Meghan and Harry also shared a video from a bench in their garden. Either side were trees, flowers and well-maintained grass. Itaposs clear why the couple have previously referred to their home as a sanctuary. The real world likely feels miles away while relaxing on the grounds.It’s believed that Prince Harry also has forget-me-not flowers planted to honour his mother, Princess Diana. While the outdoor space also features endless lawn space with rose gardens, a tennis court, a guest cottage and a large outdoor pool. There is also a vegetable patch, where the eco-friendly family source ingredients from for their meals. The main house includes a library, an office, a spa with a separate dry and wet sauna, a gym, a games room, an arcade, a movie theatre, a wine cellar and a garage with space for five cars.

The trend of dogs FaceTiming their owners for hilarious reasons has been taking TikTok by storm, as seen in these two clips. The videos, which come from TikTok users @moosiethemastf and @fionameikle, are part of the trend, and show a cocker spaniel and a Mastf attempting to ring people through Facetime for funny reasons. In the first we see Millie the cocker spaniel calling her auntie Rachel because her mum wonapost give her the full pack of ham. The dogaposs droopy ears are seen hanging over the screen as she waits for her auntie to pick up the phone as a dial tone can be heard.  This Mastf, called Moosie, was captured calling her dad because the ball had fallen in the deep end of the pool and her mother says she won’t fetch it for her anymore. The caption reads: Facetiming dad because the ball fell in the pool for the th time this morning and mom said sheaposs not getting it for me anymore.

Asbeing a parent isnapost dficult enough, it seems as though everyone has an opinion on every single thing you do, and sadly, theyaposre not always nice opinions. This is something one mum has learned the hard way, after her own mother-in-law made a series of cruel jabs about her eight-month-old daughter. My husband was a very well behaved, quiet kid. Everyone from my in-lawaposs side of the family tells me that he was super calm, didnapost cry or throw tantrums, always sat in the right spot and was never picky about food, the -year-old mum explained on Redditaposs Am I The A**hole forum. My daughter was born looking a lot like my husband, so my mother-in-law was expecting her to be like him, except she isnapost. She is well behaved but she cries and she can be picky sometimes, you know, like a NORMAL baby.  However, whenever the little girl shows any of these traits deemed to be negative, such as crying, the womanaposs mother-in-law canapost help but make rude remarks, suggesting she inherited them from her mum. Meanwhile, any behaviour deemed positive, the woman implies she got them from her dad. The mum continued: Iaposve been sucking it up ever since she was born but it kindaapos hurts. When my daughter started solids and didnapost like certain foods, my mother-in-law said, aposwell, my son always ate whatever was offered to him so its from your side of the family.apos When my daughter cries or throws tantrums, she says, aposoh my son wasnapost like that. He never cried. You probably cried a lot when you were that age.apos When my daughter developed a habit of putting toys in her mouth, aposall of my sons never put a grain in their mouth like thatapos. So, you can appreciate why after eight months of listening to countless little aposharmlessapos comments the woman had enough, and decided to take her child and leave.  For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here. She said: My daughter has recently started to grab furniture etc and started getting up on her own, but mother-in-law said, aposmy son was walking on his own at this age. You were probably a slow walker and thataposs probably why she cant do it.apos I flipped out and told her to stop associating all of my kidaposs negative traits on me and the positives on my husband. I told her its rude and grabbed my kid and went to my place. Fortunately, the womanaposs husband leapt to her defence, but she has since been bombarded with messages from ious members of her in-lawaposs family who have accused her of overreacting, while telling her that her mother-in-law is in tears.The woman then turned to Reddit to question whether others thought she was justied for lashing out at her mother-in-law over the comments. What a narcissist. Let her sit there and cry, one Reddit user commented. She’s upset she got called out and is now trying to guilt trip you. Information diet and restricted access until she can respect your boundaries. Another added: I doubt your husband was as aposgoodaposas mother-in-law claims. Your baby sounds like they are well within the normal ranges for what a baby should be doing. Side note: make sure your husband calls his family out more often for these types of things. It shouldnapost get to you exploding for him to make a comment. Do you have a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

Back in the summer, manager Hayley Budd was scrolling through her phone during a break when the chair opposite her seemingly tucked itself under the table.You can see her genuine look of surprise on CCTV footage of the eerie event, she even checks beneath the table, and has since tried to come up with a logical explanation to no avail. Of course, the footage went viral raising all sorts of questions, one being ‘why are pubs so popular with ghosts ’ Is it because they’re often so old and atmospheric, or that people are typically more susceptible to illusory events after a tipple or two, or that it’s simply great for marketing purposes  Perhaps that’s all too cynical. “Most people will experience at least one paranormal incident in their lives. If you have experienced something, I’d say be objective and open minded about it, don’t dismiss it. It’s something profound and unknown that we’re still trying to figure out,” says Steve Mera, a Manchester-based expert on all things paranormal.  “I started in the subject as a sceptic, and it was a few years before I witnessed something that changed my opinion, so I don’t mind people being sceptical, especially as so many hoaxes go on. But just because you haven’t experienced something, doesn’t mean it doesn’t exist,” he says. After almost  years researching paranormal phenomena, he’s not surprised by The Lansdowne footage. “I get plenty of them sent to me on a regular basis and have investigated a number of them. People think pubs are hotspots [for paranormal activity], but that’s because they tend to get reported. Normal residential homes have as many disturbances. I’ve done countless investigations with city councils regarding homes where there has been reported activity, but they don’t tend to get as much media interest or coverage,” says Mera, and that’s usually because there’s no spinetingling CCTV footage for people to pour over.Wondering where to eat, drink or visit for your next UK holiday  At Chill we help you decide where to go and stay next with hundreds of recommendations right on your doorstep.

For the latest must-have travel news follow us on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter. “Pubs, as well as office buildings, castles, hotels, inns and stately homes tend to get a lot of interest, because they’re public areas and monitored, so there’s more chance of capturing something unusual on CCTV, and then those things tend to get sensationalised over the internet,” notes Mera who reveals he’s always suspicious when it comes to CCTV. “The footage is interesting and might back up other claims, so you can’t dismiss them immediately, but some can be a little bit hoaxy. We’ve had a few in the past, and they’re usually poor quality. It’s very dficult to determine something just from CCTV footage, so I really do rely on witness statements. Of all the places he’s investigated over the years, Ye Olde Man  Scythe in Bolton town centre is one of the most perplexing. “It’s an extremely old pub and certainly has paranormal activity there. I’ve witnessed phenomena there myself, and the disturbances are very evidential. We had communication with something that wasn’t there, and there was unusual movement,” reveals Mera. “There’s supposed to be a man with depression who hanged himself, and we actually caught something very odd on the CCTV camera, a bit of a hooded figure. We didn’t know what it was, but everyone who works there has stories to tell about their experiences. They also recorded a man saying heart attack who might be one of the pub’s previous patrons. “The disturbances are often associated with a man who’d passed away having had a heart attack. He was a regular, an old guy who even had his own chair in the place. The idea is people imprint onto a location because they’re there on a regular basis, andthere are going to be hauntings, it’s going be something of a regularity rather than something that’s few and far between.”  Mera explains that imprinting is a phenomenon that captures events, typically in places where there has been heightened emotion, that then get imprinted into the environment and are played back. “People see them and go, ‘Oh my goodness, it’s haunted’, when in fact it could be an event replaying itself from time to time that people experience, like a recorded event being played back.” It might be something you see, smell, sense or hear, unlike the chair supposedly moving at The Lansdowne pub, which could be referred to as ‘localised phenomenon’. “It’s an interactive haunting, but what’s interesting is when you get a number of people seeing the same type of action,” says Mera who reminds us to be open-minded on our next visit to the pub. “Most public houses have got some story to tell usually, or strange disturbances. Enjoy the atmosphere, do a bit of history on the place and the stories behind it, and talk to people who work there. And be aware of yourself and your surroundings. We have a natural survival sense that kicks in, makes our skin tingle and the hairs rise on the back of our neck. Just because we can’t see something doesn’t mean it’s not there.” Comment MORE ON CCTVViralCCTV footageHeart attackHeart diseaseMental healthStately homesChillFrisk\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Fancy an escape to the Chill newsletter for weekly inspiration and advice on UK holidays Sign Up!Invalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

self-defence class for women, I left Ferryhill Community Centre in Aberdeen standing that little bit taller, walking with more confidence and feeling empowered.At first, we had all crammed ourselves into the corner of the room, directly opposite the emergency fire exit.About  of us were waiting for the women#s self-defence experience to begin, perhaps with a little apprehension about what to expect.Soon enough, we were coaxed out of the #scardey corner# by Arizona Brodie from Embodied Self-Defence, our coach for the evening.She began by introducing herself and the eight-week course, explaining this wouldn#t be just about physical self-defence.Arizona works as a domestic abuse worker with the charity Sacro, and is also a chairwoman for Rape Crisis Grampian.The -year-old has been training in martial arts for most of her le, from learning karate when she was younger to becoming the second woman in Scottish history to earn a black belt in Brazilian jiu-jitsu.She then went on to explain her own past trauma, which she experienced despite her years of training and knowledge of mixed martial arts.#I have all this martial arts experience, I wasn’t a black belt at the time when I experienced rape, but I still did have a good level of martial arts experience at that point,# she explained.#When I was actually in that situation, I had a massive freeze reaction. I was so panicked and I knew there were consequencesI had done something, it would have affected multiple other areas of my le.#After her experience, Arizona realised that self-defence was much more complex than physically being able to defend yourself. She went on her own self-defence journey and has learned that #mindfulness is just as important#, aiming to incorporate that into all her classes.Throughout the evening we practiced dferent mindfulness techniques, from breathing exercises to tuning in with your mind and your body and finding out how you#re truly feeling in that moment.These techniques help to calm us down, enabling us to think clearly and deal with the situation appropriately.She added: #You actually have to believe you’re worth defending in the first place. A lot of people completely step past that part and just assume the physical techniques are going to be enough.#The point isyou subconsciously think that you deserve to be treated badly, then it doesn’t matteryou know how to break out of a bear hug you’re still just going to stay in that situation because you don’t believe you deserve to be treated correctly.#That’s why wellbeing, self-esteem, having those emotional regulation tactics, being able to self-manage, being able to talk to yourself and be your best friend and having those mindfulness habits are just as important as the physical part.#The eight-week course in Aberdeen, which welcomes LGBTQ+ members, is broken down into a number of self-defence scenarios including being followed home, a date gone wrong, a bad relationship and digital dilemmas for women.Over lockdown, Arizona experimented with gaming and finding a way online for people to explore the decision-making aspect of self-defence.She had also used a number of role-playing exercises in her classes just before lockdown and had received good feedback from them.Arizona decided to run this block of classes as almost entirely scenario-based so that people could learn the inidual techniques in context.She said: #I had some really good feedback about the scenarios that I’d created so people could experiment with dferent decisions and try de-escalation, and almost get a taste of what a real-le situation would actually be like.#Trying to put across the complexity of whatit’s a person you know or what would be the consequences of making this decision or whatever.#Hopefully empowering people to apply those in a real-le situation much better thanwe were like okay here is a random move in isolation, without any background or what led up to it or triggers or what might happen after you do that move.#The scenario presented to us was being followed home. When Arizona asked us to raise our handswe had ever been followed anywhere more than half the room held up their hands.We were asked to partner up with someone so we could practice physical self-defence moves, designed around the scenario of women being followed home in Aberdeen.As we sheepishly shuffled closer, not sure what was to come, Arizona began demonstrating what to doyou were pinned up against a wall with her partner and co-teacher Rachael Thomson.We were then instructed to try those moves out on our partners. At first, I was the attacker, pinning my partner against a wall. It felt very strange to be trying to trap another woman, and looking around the room, everyone  felt the same way.She echoed my feelings when it was her turn to push me against the wall.As we took turns pushing and escaping the room was filled with laughter as people got the hang of the moves and began to relax.The more comfortable we were getting the more confident we felt. The people who were at first shy and nervous were suddenly having fun, learning how powerful they can be.Arizona explained that she wants the classes to feel like it is a safe space for everyone and that she thinks it is important people have fun when they are learning.She added: #This isn’t about here is the exact cookie-cutter template of what you should do in every self-defence situation. Because we’ve all got dferent strengths and weaknesses and personal, mental and physical attributes.#This is really about giving everyone a set of tools, and then you guys can focus on the bits that are natural for you and the bits that are maybe not the sort of thing you can see yourself doing you can leave to the side.#Many of the people I spoke to had come for the first time, but excitedly told me they were coming again.The transformation that occurred over an hour and a half was amazing, from being huddled in a corner we were filling up the space. Proud of ourselves for our achievements, and proud of each other.The self-defence classes for women will run until December  at the Ferryhill Community Centre in Aberdeen, from .pm on Thursdays.

Academics agree that a sustainable level of material use, which would still allow for a high quality of le, is about eight tonnes per person per year.Zero Waste Scotland is advocating for mindful shopping, encouraging Scots to buy smarter and adopt reuse, repair and renting behaviours as well as embracing second-hand shopping.When finished with an item, it is calling on people to dispose of items responsibly by donating, reselling or recycling.With global climate change discussions at an all-time high and COP coming to Glasgow this November, the topic of responsible consumption in relation to the climate crisis has never been more timely.Everything we buy has a carbon cost and we are urging Scots to think dferently about what we buy and how we consume.Changing our own consumption habits is the single biggest thing we can all do to play our part in tackling climate change.Now is the time for action and we want people to bin less and buy better, seeking out items which will last longer.Responsible consumption isn’t on the COP agenda so we wanted to ensure it is top of the consumer agenda.To learn more about the campaign, please visit www.howtowasteless for further details.Iain Gulland, chief executive, Zero Waste Scotland"},{"url":null,"title":"science matters does genetic tolerance aid wild swimmers","story":"Dorothy H CrawfordUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowWild swimming has become increasingly popular during lockdown, but in general people are ided into those who love swimming in cold water and those who think that it’s complete madness.Now scientists have found a possible explanation for this ision related to a muscle protein called alpha-actinin- .We have two types of muscle fibres # type  and type .Type  fibres provide fatigue resistance important for prolonged, submaximal activity like marathon running, while type  fibres produce a rapid and powerful force for short-burst, vigorous activities such as sprinting.The two types of fibres respond dferently to cold exposure # type  fibres produce an involuntary, low-intensity, continuous increase in muscle tone, while type  fibres give bursts of high-intensity activity causing overt shivering.ACTN is only active in type  muscle fibres, and deficiency of this protein is caused by a non-ing ACTN gene.This occurs in - per cent of the world’s population, around . billion people, and is most common in Europe and Asia.These people lack type  muscle fibre activity and although this is compensated by having larger type  fibres, it adversely affects muscle , impacting on athletic performance, particularly in sprint and power activities.Now scientists have investigated the role of ACTN in cold tolerance .Male participants,  with ing and  with non-ing ACTN, were immersed in water at °C for -minute periods interspersed with -minute rest periods at room temperature .The ordeal ended either after a maximum of six immersions or when participants’ body temperature dropped to .°C.The scientists found improved cold tolerance in those with non-ing ACTN, some  per cent of whom maintained body temperature above .°C compared to  per cent of those with al ACTN.So those lacking al type  fibres had better cold tolerance, suggesting that cold-induced increased muscle tone is more efficient at generating heat than overt shivering.Improved cold tolerance probably gave our ancestors an evolutionary survival advantage after their migration from Africa to colder climes in Eurasia, so explaining the high frequency of non-ing ACTN in today’s northern populations.It would be interesting to investigate how many Scottish wild swimmers carry this genetic iant.

When they got there Jesus asked them: #What were you arguing about along the way #They couldn#t answer, for they had been arguing about which of them was the greatest. They were silent, because they#d been caught out.Then Jesus took a little child in his arms and said to them: #Whoever welcomes one such child in my name welcomes me, and whoever welcomes me, welcomes not me but the one who sent me.#Greatness, Jesus was saying to them, is found in welcoming and receiving into our arms someone vulnerable, powerless and dependent, regardless of age.Greatness is found not in what we have accomplished but in what we have done and given to #the least of these#, the hungry, thirsty, naked, sick, and imprisoned: the symbolic children in each of our lives.Greatness never makes itself superior over another.

We were delighted to welcome them to Argyll for their first performance as a quartet and for three of the four performers this was the first time they had performed in more than a year.The quartet # Andrew, Dean, Jack and Richard # introduced each piece, giving background to both the role of the saxophone and the composer, with many of the pieces arranged by the group themselves.Purcell’s #Festival Rondeau# was the dramatic opening, a work well-known across all age groups, so a perfect start to the concert.Following this was a work composed specically for a saxophone quartet in  by Jean-Baptiste Singelée, a friend of Adolph Sax who invented the saxophone. We were treated to the traditional Andante before moving onto the exciting Allegro.The third selection of pieces were all by Debussy. This was a surprising choice as the saxophone is not really associated with the Impressionist period, however, it showed the versatility of both the saxophones and performers. #Arabesque No.# was followed by #The Little Shepherd# which was delightful, calm and serene with only the sound of the river flowing through the trees and birds singing along. The jaunty #Cakewalk# completed this ied section.#Air on a G String# by Bach and known to many as a TV advert was the next offering. The opening descending bass line showed the depth and quality of the baritone saxophone in much more than just a supporting role. This music predates the invention of the saxophone by more than  years.Gershwin and a selection of show tunes from the swing era were just what we needed after the relaxing #Air#. The four musical songs, all showcasing dferent styles, certainly had the audience smiling, toe-tapping and singing along. In the final piece #I Got Rhythm# we were all moving to the music, including the quartet. Closing your eyes, you could imagine you were relaxing in a jazz club anywhere in the world.The next piece, #L’Arlesienne Exhibition#, is a collection of highlights for the saxophone in an orchestral situation. The music was composed by Hiroki Takahashi, with many familiar themes from film and TV # including The Apprentice # all thoroughly enjoyable.Gershwin’s #An American in Paris# portrays the many sights and sounds that Gershwin experienced there in the s. While it was composed for an orchestra which included saxophones and car horns, the music played by the quartet didn’t include any car horns # just skilled and imaginative saxophonists.A change of pace to enjoy some relaxed, laid-back music from West Africa followed with Will Gregory’s #High Le#. The repeated rhythms with the peace of Kilmory, the cooling air and the gentle river flowing was almost hypnotic and brought the concert to a finish.The audience cheered, clapped and blew their cars horns to ensure the quartet provided an encore. #Witch Hunt# by Ulrich Schultheiss was the encore # a dramatic and fiery work challenging all the performers and bringing a fantastic concert to a close.The quartet members themselves didn#t feel the cars were a barrier and said they #had a blast at a unique and special event#.MAAA thank the th Argyll Scoutsfor helping with the car parking.

especially when it comes to the impact of proposed sites on traditional fishing grounds # poor site maintenance and monitoring which can lead to instances of vessel entanglement and also the environmental impact of the sites on both commercial and non-commercial species.The group believes that while the sector has made many advances over the past decade, increased transparency and oversight are needed to ensure the aquaculture sector can better co-exist with the fishing industry.The initial aim of the group would be to ensure that there is a proper analysis of localised fishing and follow up with clear and sensible communication between the two sectors to ensure that with expansion does not come conflict.It is a timeous idea, which will hopefully reassure fishermen that they will not simply be displaced by fish farming but will be respected for their own produce.The group will cement a policy to assist the fishing industry deal realistically with the fish farming industry and the Scottish Salmon Producers Organisation.Simon Macdonald, chair RIFG Aquaculture Work GroupSir,NFU Scotland is calling on the UK Government to address the nation’s growing labour crisis, which is undermining all parts of the food and drink supply chain, leading to signicant losses on some Scottish farms and resulting in a growing number of empty shop shelves.Last week#s #BackBritishFarmingDay on September  came as a UK Government announcement of a free trade #agreement in principle# between the UK and New Zealand is believed to be imminent.Having agreed in June to provide unfettered access in the future to Australia, the cumulative impact of another deal with a major exporting nation has huge signicance for Scottish farmers and crofters.With so much to celebrate about the quality and standards of our food and drink, #BackBritishFarmingDay was a fantastic opportunity to thank the nation for their incredible support throughout Brexit and Covid-.NFU Scotland, both independently and in conjunction with the Scottish food and drink industry, has written several times to UK Government calling for measures that address the shortfall in both seasonal and permanent staff.Should it fail to do so, I have absolutely no doubt that the situation will deteriorate further.It is galling to hear that the UK Government is on the verge of signing up to another free trade deal that will permit a growing level of imports while delivering very little to our food and drink sector in .The blunt fact is that neither deal has been afforded any kind of proper parliamentary scrutiny as the government’s promised Statutory Trade and Agriculture Commission has yet to be established.Safeguards against market disruption are also promised, but the cumulative impact of these deals will be profound for UK farming.If handled badly, these may make it impossible for some of our family farming businesses to continue to compete with high levels of low-cost imports produced to standards that would not be allowed here.Martin Kennedy, president, NFU ScotlandSir,National audits of diabetic services have shown that only around  per cent of people with type one or two diabetes have nine key annual checks to help prevent long-term diabetic complications.The pandemic has made this situation dficult because many routine checks and face-to-face appointments have not been available.The InDependent Diabetes Trusthas published a free new booklet which explains the nine key tests.It helps people look after their health by ensuring that they know what checks they need from health professionals.Get your copy of Diabetes care #

Try and get evergreens planted by the end of the month.Dormant roses are now available at local nurseries and garden centres and are very good value for money.You can easily create a rose garden for the coming year that will provide beautul flowers and fragrance from early summer through to autumn. Before planting, mix in some good quality compost and make sure the plants are watered well once planted.It#s an excellent time to plant coners as well. Coners are cone-bearing seed plants and include cedars, cypresses, firs, junipers, larches, pines, spruces, and yews.While being practical and useful, coners are also visually stunning and can transform a garden into something quite magnicent.They are a wonderful way of adding colour and shape to your outdoor space, particularly as many coners change colour throughout the year.With several hundred ieties available in the UK, there is one to suit every type of garden, and they are easy to look after.They need good drainage and water to get them established, but once growing will need little attention as they are pretty disease resistant and maintenance free.In addition to coners, another way to bring colour to the garden at this time of year is with autumn bedding plants.One of the most exciting group of plants to brighten up any part of the garden is Heuchera.Native to north America, Heuchera were originally grown for their flowers # dainty spikes of red, pink and white bells.They carry their plume like flowers high above their crowns of leaves, but gardeners are now mainly interested in their foliage which comes in a iety of colours.Heucheras grow in full or partial sun, in well composted soil and are fairly pest resistant.They can be established as ground cover in many garden situations like under trees where grass could struggle.October is often a time spent clearing up after the summer and preparing for the winter and wpring ahead so here are some top tips for jobs this month from the Royal Horticultural Society:"},{"url":null,"title":"gardens of argyll in new tv series","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowTwo Argyll gardens will appear in a new BBC ALBA series which started last week.Gàrraidhean Mòra na h-Alba, or Gardens of Scotland is presented by Murdo Macdonald, and the programme will feature Ardkinglas and Benmore gardens.In a programme screened on Thursday September  and available on BBC iPlayer, it was the turn of Ardkinglas Garden at the head of Loch Fyne.There, Murdo finds out about the model railway that used to run along the lochside, and wanders around the azaleas bursting with colour in the Ladies# Garden.He walks up to the old mill by the river, then explores the champion trees and renowned rhododendron collection in the Woodland Garden.He also finds out more about the fairy garden for children which is made up of lots of little houses next to the bottom of tree trunks, laid out in trail.#The fairy garden attracts thousands of families each year so it#s become a destination in itself,# said Murdo. #The Ladies# Garden with azaleas is also well worth seeing in summer it’s stunning because it#s ablaze with colour.#On October , Gàrraidhean Mòra na h-Alba will showcase Benmore Garden at the end of Loch Eck, a regional garden of the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh.Murdo visits the Victorian fernery, the Tasmanian Ridge and the Chilean Rainforest Glade, where he plants a monkey puzzle tree.Murdo said: #Benmore is a dramatic garden in its terrain with amazing views and you could easily spend days walking around, just taking in what’s there.#There’s a wildness to the garden that isn’t as apparent at some of the other more formal gardens which can almost make you feel as though you’re in a dferent country.#"},{"url":null,"title":"glendaruel hosts tighnabruaich open","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowGlendaruel and Colintraive Gun Club hosted the Tighnabruaich Open on September , the first club competition to be held since March .The High Gun of the day, after a three-way shoot off, was Ted Blakeway.In second was Alan Brown third, Paul Chalmers and fourth equal were Martin Young,  Gordon Grfiths and Eric McAllister.The ladies prize went to Jessica Young.

How often has it outwitted us with its amazing flight paths, ducking and ing to avoid our threatening gestures.While we have developed some of the most sophisticated flying machines the world has known, none can match the bluebottle in its agility.We have mentioned pollination. What insect is more important than the bee as it goes about its business from flower to flower ensuring that the plants will produce seed for another year and giving us honey as a product of its labours.How beautul too are its colours and the structure of its body – a remarkable little insect.Then there is the humble moth and its gravity-defying antics walking across ceilings.

This included him having a relapse when we thought we might lose him.He was diagnosed with an autoimmune condition and needed a long course of treatment and regular blood tests but thankfully he pulled through.Sadly, Red’s story is not an isolated case. Many animals arrive with us when they are literally broken.Some have suffered for a long time, carrying physical and emotional scars. Animals can’t tell us where it hurts, why they’re sick or why they’re scared.It’s our job to uncover what has happened to the animals and what treatment they need.Red’s happy ending is the best possible outcome for us. To see the broken animals which arrive with us go on to loving forever homes. It’s the reason we do what we do.We don’t just fix broken bones. We fix broken hearts too.The Scottish SPCA receives no government funding and is entirely reliant on donations from the public.To find out more about our Broken campaign and becoming a member of the Scottish SPCA, visit www.scottishspca.org brokenanimals.Jo Neilson, Scottish SPCA senior vet"},{"url":null,"title":"scout-adkin-qualifies-world-championships-thailand","story":"PEEBLES hill-running siblings Scout and Jacob Adkin were both in action at the British Championships at Sedbergh in the Lake District last weekend.Scout Adkin took the womenrsquos senior title finishing more than a minute ahead of Katherine Maltby who claimed second place and a signicant margin ahead Naomi Leng in third position.The race was also the trial for the World Mountain Running Championships in Thailand next February and Scoutrsquos victory guarantees her selection for that tournament.Jacob, however, took fourth place despite an injury which later ended with a hospital visit and an avulsion fracture diagnosis.He injured his ankle on the first descent but continued and was visibly in pain, hobbling over the finish line.This contributed to Scotlandrsquos senior men beating England by a single point.ldquoFortunately it is not a lsquoproperrsquo broken leg, he told the Scottish Athletics website.ldquoI was in a bit of pain but didnrsquot want to let the team down and it was brilliant for Scotland to get two sets of team golds.ldquoThe diagnosis was that it was a clean little fracture at the end of the bone and Irsquom not in plaster of anything like that.

Coners are cone-bearing seed plants and include cedars, cypresses, firs, junipers, larches, pines, spruces and yews.While being practical and useful, coners are also visually stunning and can transform a garden into something quite magnicent.They are a wonderful way of adding colour and shape to your outdoor space, particularly as many coners change colour throughout the year.With several hundred ieties available in the UK, there is one to suit every type of garden, and they are easy to look after.They need good drainage and water to get them established, but once growing will need little attention as they are pretty disease resistant and maintenance free.In addition to coners, another way to bring colour to the garden at this time of year is with autumn bedding plants.One of the most exciting group of plants to brighten up any part of the garden is heuchera.Native to North America, heucheras were originally grown for their flowers – dainty spikes of red, pink and white bells.They carry their plume like flowers high above their crowns of leaves, but gardeners are now mainly interested in their foliage which comes in a iety of colours.Heucheras grow in full or partial sun, in well composted soil and are fairly pest resistant.They can be established as ground cover in many garden situations like under trees where grass could struggle.October is often a time spent clearing up after the summer and preparing for the winter and spring ahead so here are some top tips for jobs next month from the Royal Horticultural Society:"},{"url":null,"title":"blue bin recycling service to start in kintyre and gigha","story":"It comes after a controversial decision by Argyll and Bute councillors in February not to extend Kintyre Recycling Limited#skerbside collection contract which it had fulfilled since .The council says the new service is designed to make it more convenient for people in Kintyre to recycle and will be sustainable in the long-term as new government legislation for waste disposal and recycling comes into place.The new dates for scheduled uplts are on the council website at www.argyll-bute.gov.uk kintyre-new-recycling-serviceThey can also be downloaded and printed out as calendars.Those who previously received a printed copy of the calendar will be sent a new one, and those who receive an assisted uplt for their green household waste bin, will automatically receive an assisted uplt for their new blue bin.The materials picked up for recycling in Kintyre go to the Lingerton waste and recycling facility, in Lochgilphead, which is operated by Renewi on behalf of the council.Once there, it is bulked up with the rest of the blue bin recycling from Mid Argyll and sent on to a materials recycling facility in Linwood.Information on how the dferent types of material are sorted and processed can be found on the council#s website at www.argyll-bute.gov.uk what-happens-your-recyclingA very small percentage of properties, mainly tenements, will stay on a bagged service.

I feel very sad that, apparently, Jamesrsquos body was never found so a funeral may never have taken place.But he added: ldquoIt is good that the descendants are meeting up.ldquoIt would be even betterthe wider community in the Musselburgh Fisherrow area was made aware of this heritage and perhaps the local authority could do a bit to help here.He felt a lasting memorial to the crew of Star of the East at Fisherrow Harbour would be a fitting tribute to them.Mr Johnston added: ldquoAttending our harbour ceremony felt like stepping back into the past to remember and honour, not only James Ritchie and the other brave men of The Star who lost their lives, but also to allow us today to pay tribute to every family within the Fisherrow fishing community for the important contribution it has made to the economy and history of Musselburgh over many years.Walter Brown jnrrsquos great grandson Walter Moffat, , who lives in Toronto, Canada, visited the skipper Walter Brown snrrsquos grave at Dunwich in early  where a memorial stone had been placed by his widow Jane lsquoBonthronrsquo Brown.He said his ancestor was seen by commanding everyone to ldquosave themselves as he held the mast going down with the ship.ldquoCoincidentally, Walter Brown jnr forgot to take his bible on that trip ndash I have it at home, said his descendant who is the grandson of Walter Brown, the son of Walter Brown jr and Elizabeth Brown , who was just one when his father died in the shipwreck.The Scottish Fisheries Museum at Anstruther is planning to mark the th anniversary of the loss of The Star at its annual memorial service in the museumrsquos Memorial Room in October. The ceremony is organised in conjunction with the Fishermenrsquos Mission and is open to relatives of those lost.The names of the crew of The Star who died also look set to be listed in the museumrsquos memorial book which records the names of fishermen lost at sea prior to . Those from  onwards are recorded on brass plaques on the walls.Curator Linda Fitzpatrick said: ldquoThe entries are made at the request of family members and can reflect iniduals or entire crews of boats. They are not a complete record of all losses.ldquoThis ensures that we have the details correct and that we take account of family sensitivities.She added: The dangers of le at sea are all too well known and, often, the tragedy of a sinking was compounded by the fact that the men sailed with their relatives so that a father, husband, brother and son could be lost in a single incident."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-peeps-past-1996-1971-1921","story":"lsquoFEAR of cuts in hospital servicesrsquo was front page news in the East Lothian Courier on September , .Fears that local hospital services could be under threat to release cash for new hospital building in Edinburgh have led to a top-level meeting with Health Minister Lord James Douglas-Hamilton.Labour MP John Home Robertson, local councillors and health officials say they are seriously concerned by reports that, in the run-up to using private finance, Lothian Health Board will run down services such as day surgery at Roodlands Hospital, Haddington, where the casualty unit has already been withdrawn.And the MP promised ldquofierce resistancecuts to vital services were proposed.He was joined by East Lothian Councilrsquos social work chairman David Costello and Roodlands consultant Dr George Rhind for last weekrsquos meeting with Lord James at the Scottish Office.Mr Home Robertson demanded assurances about plans for the new Royal Infirmary at Little France as well as existing hospital services in East Lothian.lsquoBILLY the beer drinking budgie diesrsquo, The Haddingtonshire Courier of October ,  sadly reported!Regulars at the Plough Tavern, Haddington, were disappointed to find an empty cage in the bar last week.

But the Mansi of Polunochnoye speak an endangered dialect of the language. There may be as few as  of them left.Last week, this tiny community made national news in Russia. In stories with real echoes from more serious abuses at residential schools for indigenous people in Canada and where, it emerged that pupils were going hungry because they couldnrsquot stomach the food they were served.The row started with a teacher called Anna Voronkova. A specialist in minority languages, she had come up the Urals to do some volunteering with Mansi youngsters.ldquoI was doing some work with the children, making postcards, she told independent newspaper Novaya Gazeta, ldquowhen one drew a picture and wrote on it in Mansi lsquoI want to eatrsquo. That image has been widely shared on mainstream and social media.Many Mansi are lactose-intolerant, Novaya Gazeta explained. The young people were not able to process the milky cereals they were given.There are only eight children, aged between  and , from this group of Mansi and their parents live and work more than  miles away in the forest.But education is compulsory so like many other northern indigenous people they are packed off to residential schools.Voronkova ended up being hauled into the local police station to explain her complaints.But parents, some of whom had been unable to visit during Covid, added spoke up: ldquoThe pandemic has turned the school into a prison, Voronkova told the paper. The linguist, who works for the Russian Academy of Sciences, also claimed children who did not understand Russian were shouted at.The schoolrsquos head accused Voronkova of encouraging complaints and dismissed criticism.However, one senior local official has already agreed to demands from parents for their children to get moose and deer meat they can digest. Human rights officials have scheduled inspections.Most Mansi live in the resource-rich Khanty-Mansi autonomous district on the other side of the Urals.This area is sometimes called Yugra, the ancient name for the lands of the Ugric-speaking peoples before they were taken over by an expanding Russia in the sixteenth century. A campaign for more devolution for Yugra in the early s failed.Last week, Canadian Catholic bishops publicly apologised for the treatment of indigenous children separated from their parents by force and put into residential schools right up until .ldquoWe acknowledge the grave abuses that were committed by some members of our Catholic community ndash physical, psychological, emotional, spiritual, cultural, and sexual, they said.ldquoWe also sorrowfully acknowledge the historical and ongoing trauma and the legacy of suffering and challenges faced by indigenous peoples that continue to this day.Such institutions were run by ious churches and organisations. Canadarsquos Truth and Reconciliation Commission called them an act of ldquocultural genocide.USAPennsylvania is set to undo prison gerrymandering ... and the electoral map as it does soTHEY cannot vote. But for decades Americarsquos more than two million men and women behind bars ndash who are disproportionately people of colour ndash have been helping to elect largely white Republicans.Ever since its war on drugs in the s, the United States has had one of the worldrsquos highest incarceration rates. The Home of the Free has more of its citizens in jail than Communist, authoritarian China, whose population is five times bigger.Now, authorities in several states are starting to understand that their penal system is distorting their electoral one. It is not just that more black and brown people are disenfranchised as part of their punishment.It is that locking them up far from home is literally being used to manipulate constituency sizes because inmates are counted as ldquoresidents where they are incarcerated, boosting the size of that electoral district, and not where they grew up. But they do not get a ballot where they reside. Experts call this ldquoprison gerrymandering.There is a growing move to stop this. American commentators describe it as a pitched battle over the landscape of the nationrsquos democracy between liberals and conservatives.A cascade of states, including giant Illinois, are changing rules. The American Civil Liberties Union this summer called on more authorities to use new data from the US Census Bureau to redraw electoral boundaries with jailed people recounted where they live, not where they are serving their sentence.ldquoIn an era of mass incarceration, where people are counted has a profound effect on our democracy ndash with downstream ramications for under-counted communities, the ACLU said.ldquoIncarceration facilities were largely constructed in rural areas, ensuring a steady flow of captive constituents to those wards and districts. Representatives of those communities, in turn, donrsquot see themselves as accountable to their non-voting, incarcerated constituents.Last week, The Washington Post reported on just how big a deal prison gerrymandering is in one of Americarsquos key swing regions: Pennsylvania.The state ndash well, commonwealth, technically ndash has a legislature where Republicans dominate despite losing the popular vote to democrats.The newspaper cited new research from Villanova University in Philadelphia that found more than a quarter-of-a-million people in the state were living in districts which would be too bigprisoners were added back into them.That included , African Americans in Philadelphia. Experts reckon black parts of the city would get two extra seats in the state legislature without prison gerrymandering.Itrsquos not just about prisoners or their families, Rory Kramer from Villanova told the paper.ldquoItrsquos the person down the street, itrsquos the victim of their crime who lives in the same neighbourhood, itrsquos grandma down the street whorsquos lived in that neighbourhood for  years, he said.ldquoItrsquos actually harming all of their representative power.His colleague Brianna Remster equated the gerrymandering to the original US constitutional compromise when enslaved black people were counted as two-thirds of a person for census purposes.ldquoThis is very reminiscent of the Three-fths Compromise, of how black and brown bodies are still being used to this day in most places around the United States to advantage White votes and White political influence, she said.Pennsylvania is set to undo the gerrymandering and Americarsquos electoral map as it does so.TajikistanHow a tiny former Soviet republic becamea safe haven to opponents of the TalibanAMERICA, Britain and their allies may no longer wish to stand up to the Taliban. But there is one country which does. And it is right next door to Afghanistan.The government of Tajikistan has emerged as the main regional bulwark against the new regime in Kabul.The tiny former Soviet republic has given safe haven to opponents of the Taliban, such as the National Resistance Front, many of whom are ethnic Tajiks.ldquoThe whole weight of the negative consequences of the international coalition departure is falling on the shoulders of the neighbouring countries, Tajik president Emomali Rahmon, who has effectively run his country since the collapse of the Soviet Union and a s civil war, said last month.He added: ldquoVarious terrorist groups are actively using the unstable military-political situation in Afghanistan in order to strengthen their positions.Small, poor central Asian nations like Tajikistan are braced for the fallout of the departure of US-led Western troops from Afghanistan and the fall of the government the West supported.Officials in Dushanbe, the Tajik capital, fear a new wave of refugees and drug trafficking.They also worry the Taliban could support islamist opponents of their own government.Rahmon, who has long secured the letime title of Peshvoyi Millat or ldquoleader of the nation, is widely seen as an authoritarian.The Financial Times last week quoted an unnamed Western diplomat in Dushanbe on concerns Rahmon will use the Afghan crisis as a pretext to crack down on opponents, most likely citing counter-terrorism.So far, the confrontation between Rahmon and the Tajiks and the Afghan Taliban has been verbal. But the war of words has been heated. A senior Taliban figure last week told Qatar-based broadcaster Al Jazeera: ldquoWe will not allow any neighbouring nation to interfere in the internal matters of Afghanistan.More junior figures in the movement have said they will take no lectures on democracy from Rahmon after his -year uninterrupted rule.Some regional watchers fear a cold war could get hot. Russia, which has thousands of troops in central Asia, carried out border exercises last week. It also called for calm. The Tajik defence ministry is understood to be preparing for a potential mobilisation, drawing up reserve lists.The Taliban might not be in a position to invade ndash and they have denied a build-up of their forces on the border ndash but they could still use force to try to influence Rahmon.ldquoLarge-scale provocations on the border could be viewed by the Taliban as a means of putting pressure on the leadership of Tajikistan and to force it to change its position and withdraw its support for the National Resistance Front, analyst Parviz Mullojanov told regional news website Eurasianet.There are strong linguistic and cultural links between the two countriesThe Persian spoken in Tajikistan is almost identical to Dari, the lingua franca of Afghanistan, and Farsi in Iran. Dari-speaking ethnic Tajiks in Afghanistan have played a key role in fighting the Taliban, whose main recruitment ground has traditionally been among speakers of Pashto, another Persian language which is spoken on both sides of the Afghanistan-Pakistan border.However, there are Pashtuns who oppose the Taliban and Tajiks who support it.Radio Free Europe late last month reported officials in Dushanbe were concerned Tajiks who had fought with the Taliban were filtering through the nearly -mile-long border between the countries.Tajikistan has not just sheltered ethnic Tajik fighters from Afghanistan but also commemorated Ahmad Shah Massoud, who fought both the Soviets and the Taliban and was best known as the ldquolion of the Panjshir after the valley where he put up a last stand against Russian invaders.This is also where opponents fought a rearguard action against the Taliban before surfacing in Dushanbe.ItalyLeft expected to gain major victories as lsquocrisis of nervesrsquo grips Italian votersITALYrsquoS populist right goes into key local elections today facing what one of the countryrsquos biggest papers called a ldquocrisis of nerves.The once seemingly unstoppable Matteo Salvini of Lega ndash an admirer of Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin ndash has collapsed in the polls and failed to cement an alliance with the far-right Fratelli drsquoItalia.Lega has been rocked by revelations of sex and drug parties by Salvinirsquos spin doctor, a man much credited with helping the politician build up a social media campaigning machine.Salvini and the leader of the Fratelli, Giorgia Meloni, botched a photo opportunity in the key city of Milan last week ndash failing to show up at the same time in what left-leaning La Repubblica on its front page said was a symbolic split two days out from the polls.Meloni said her plane was late and Salvini claimed he could not wait for her ndash but their proxies engaged in recriminations in the media.The pair on Friday tried to make up ndash with a public hug ndash at a meeting in support of a single rightist candidate for mayor of Rome. ldquoWe are destined to govern together, Salvini declared.Almost certainly not in Rome, however. The candidate they and their ally, former premier Silvio Berlusconi, are backing is not expected to occupy the mayorrsquos office on the Capitoline Hill.Lawyer and radio journalist Enrico Michetti has likened Covid to flu and called for Italians to use the Roman salute ndash a gesture many associate with fascism and the inspiration for the Hitler salute ndash to greet each other during the pandemic.Incumbent mayor Virginia Raggi, from the anti-establishment populist Five Star Movement, has become deeply unpopular amid a Covid-era litter crisis which has seen wild boars enter the Italian capital to forage in piles of rubbish.But polls suggest that a left candidate, Roberto Gualtieri, will take Rome.Pollsters now predict the centre-left will take most high-profile cities in the first elections since, mid-pandemic, Italian lawmakers appointed technocrat Mario Draghi as premier.Salvinirsquos Lega slipped back from around  per cent at its peak in  to around %, about the same as the centre-left PD or Democratic Party and Melonirsquos Fratelli.The PD and Lega, along with the remnants of Five Star, are both officially part of Draghirsquos rainbow coalition government. Salvini, however, has distanced himself from Draghirsquos vaccine passports while Meloni has harried the administration from opposition.Aside from Rome and Milan, up for grabs are mayor posts in cities like Naples, Bologna and Turin as well as hundreds of smaller towns up and down the country. The left is expected to win in the major cities ndash but it may have to wait for run-off elections later this month to finalise victories."},{"url":null,"title":"london-marathon-2022-ballot-apply-next-years-race","story":"It is  days since the colourful charity spectacular last followed the . mile route from Greenwich to The Mall.It was replaced in  by a virtual run where participants chose their own route and a further , participants will earn their medal by taking part in the virtual event this year.The ballot for the London Marathon  ends on Friday, October  at pm.You can apply for the  ballot here.Tickets cost pound for UK entry and pound for international entry.Those not accepted can apply to run for a charity here, or those who already have run a full marathon in a fast time between October   and October   can apply to qualy for a Good For Age place here.The next London Marathon takes place on October , .It will be the third time in a row the race has been run later in the year in Autumn rather than Spring.There is no bag drop at the start and runners were instead asked to leave any belongings they will need at the finish line at the ExCel centre when they collected their number.There will be no volunteers hanging medals around the necks of finishers, who will instead find their medal in their bag.Large groups will not wait at the start line together and instead participants will set off in more than  waves across a -minute period with no official pacers this year.Participants are being encouraged to wear a bottle belt so they can carry a drink to further reduce touchpoints on the day, and have been asked to invite just one supporter to reduce crowds along the route.Those running in central London will have to be able to show a negative lateral flow test for Covid-."},{"url":null,"title":"bellgrove-hotel-plans-lodged-glasgow-city-council","story":"In later years the privately-run Bellgrove Hotel in the citys Gallowgate areashoused homeless men with drug and alcohol addictions.Concerns steadily grewabout the conditions the men were living in and it waslikened to a \"modern day poorhouse\" by one politician.The hotel wassold to Wheatley Group after a deal to buy it was struck by thecouncilearlier this year and an initial, proposal of application for the site has now been lodged with the planning department.It proposes a major development consisting of a conversion of the B listed hotel into flats and a community centre or commercial space.A new block will also be created withflats and houses at anadjacent site.Around  units will be provided in total, along with associated car parking.Glasgow-based firm Collective Architecture Ltd are leading the project, wholed the re-development of the Victoria Infirmary into housing.The full planning application is expected to be lodgedin December.The Wheatley Group said previously that thefuture use of the Bellgrove Hotel wouldbe decided through working with the local community and partners, including Glasgow City Council and the Gallowgate Transformation Regeneration Areas.The building was owned by Ron Barr and Kenneth Gray, who reportedly bought he hotel for pound, in .The owners are estimated to have earned around pound.m a year in housing benefit.Previous reports found more than pound a month wasbeing paid to the owners for each of the men to live there but they shared shower facilities and most received no support for their addictions."},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"October ,  at : pmThe #never-ending scale# of the demand for optometry appointments in Orkney is driving droves of patients to seek treatment south.

Proposals also include “active travel” routes, e-bike chargers and welcome facilities, alongside coach permits and charging at some car parks.The programme is being funded with joint investment of up to £. million from the Scottish Government and UK Government, as part of the Islands Growth Deal — a ten-year investment programme jointly funded by the UK and Scottish governments, the three island councils and their partners from the public, academic and business sectors.During the in-person sessions, due to take place next Tuesday and Wednesday, attendees will be guided through proposals with representatives from project partners.OIC leader, Councillor James Stockan, said: “The Islands Deal commitment we have from the Scottish and UK Governments to support the Orkney Gateway is hugely gratying and reflects the position our World Heritage Site holds as one of the jewels in Scotland’s and indeed the UK’s tourism crown — not to mention the global archaeological signicance of the site.“But we must remember that at the core of this is a landscape and series of monuments which for many Orcadians is a direct, mysterious and powerful link to their past. And we know equally they are held very dear by people who’ve moved into these islands over the years.“So, as partners, we are all very clear that we want to gather local people’s views on the range of options that we could bid for through our final Islands Deal business case.”The consultation events are scheduled for Tuesday, October , at Maeshowe Visitor Centre, Stenness, from pm to pm, and Wednesday, October , at St Magnus Centre, Kirkwall, from pm until pm.If you’re unable to attend these events, further information is available at www.orkney.gov.uk orkneygateway.

This includes Memorandums of Understanding with Orkney Harbour Authority and Scrabster Harbour Trust to enhance port infrastructure and position the area more competitively to support offshore wind projects in the future.The announcement of this bid comes after the completion of the leasing round of Scotwind, a programme which will lease areas of the seabed around Scotland for wind farm developments.The Scottish Government hopes that as much as ten gigawatts of new generating capacity will be built over the next decade.Stephen Kerr, project director of the West of Orkney Windfarm, said: “While ScotWind has created the opportunity for a global industry to tap into Europe’s best wind resource, our consortium believes that success will be driven by targeted proposals built upon strong local relationships.”We have designed our bid specically around this location and brought together a unique combination of stakeholders to maximise the opportunities for the region.“In particular, the upcoming round of offshore wind projects are a terric opportunity for ports in Caithness and Orkney to win signicant long-term contracts in the installation and operational phase of these major infrastructure schemes.“Our agreements with Scrabster Harbour Trust and Orkney Harbour Authority will enable us to work together with a clear focus on long term delivery. Each port has its own specic capabilities and attributes, and on successful site award we have committed to fund collaborative design and supply studies and to invest where appropriate in improving each harbour’s infrastructure.“We will apply a similar collaborative approach across the supply chain, working closely with Scottish and UK suppliers to deliver on climate targets and enhance local economies.”The consortium has undertaken extensive site investigations, including birds, marine mammals and near-shore geophysical surveys, and has finalised a grid connection agreement with National Grid that will enable the project to commence generation in .Jim Buck, harbourmaster for Orkney Harbour Authority, said that Scapa Flow # the second largest natural harbour in the world # offers an environment like no other and said that the £million masterplan to develop ports around Orkney is key in attracting new business to the islands. “Our Masterplan embraces decarbonisation and a transition away from fossil fuels,” said Mr Buck.“It includes a range of infrastructure enhancements across key locations around the Orkney mainland, including a new deep-water facility in Scapa Flow, which will be crucial to us realising our ambition to deliver social and economic benefit from offshore wind energy.“The West of Orkney Windfarm is ideally positioned to make signicant use of these future facilities and this collaboration represents another key step on our journey to position Orkney as a base for innovation and a major contributor in delivering a carbon-free future for the islands.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

MacRae raced onto Jordan Fraser#s lofted pass and as MacDonald advanced the Shiel attacker kept a cool head to deftly clip the ball home and make it -.The goal knocked the stuffing out of Lovat, who struggled to create much in the way of clear chances thereafter. And deep into injury-time MacRae completed the fairy tale with another adroit finish for the hat-trick.There were no shortage of contenders for the Albert Smith medal for man of the match # but the award, now in its th year, went to defensive lynchpin Conor Cormack.After the match the -year-old hat-trick-hero, who previously feared he might have to quit the game after a succession of knee injuries, said: #It#s not really sunk it yet # at the final whistle we had people running to us and crying. It will take a while and maybe it will be a few days before it all hits home.#It#s something we all hoped hadn#t passed us by # you need a good run of games, and fortunately it has worked out for us this year. It#s an amazing feeling.#Kinlochshiel manager Johnston Gill, who has now led the club to the Premier League, MacAulay Cup and Camanachd Cup, added: #Lovat gave us a hard time of it, but we had Keith MacRae on fire today # the whole team were brilliant. #It was nip and tuck after they came back to - but I think we shaded the game as a whole.#We knew the threat they carried, but Fraser Heath was well marked by Finlay MacRae and Conor did a great job against Greg Matheson. #We got our tactics right and used our subs well # they were all outstanding.#It#s a fantastic day # most of the community is here with us in Oban # they are great for us, and give us fantastic backing.

But were it not for Murdo Dan’s job as a joiner and Chrissie Mary doing a few shts as a carer, their economic ‘situation’ would be very dficult indeed.To supplement their income, they have decided to use their meagre savings, borrow a not insignicant sum from their local bank, and apply to stick a couple of pods on the croft.Meanwhile, Nigel and Pippa saw a croft for sale in the Sunday Times Property Section for what they thought was a snip at £k and decided to use part of a trust fund to purchase it as a commercial investment.They thought that they could also capitalise on the local tourist ‘boom’ and have applied to turn the derelict croft house into a vegan cafe and craft shop and also to stick several pods on their newly acquired croft to offer a ‘holistic getaway’ for their jet-set pals.Do you, and I certainly don’t mean to pre-judge anyone who reads this paperthink that their ‘cases’ should be treated any dferently by the local planning authorities If the answer is “yes”, then think again.Too dficult a scenario to judge Try this one.Should an application to build a couple of pods on a croft, which is basically  per cent bog, in the middle of Ranish and has no view of anywhere except adjacent croft bog, be given any additional merit over a similar application in beautul Scaristavore or Ardroil where ‘breathtaking scenery’ will be the selling tagline Wrong again.As a member of the local planning board here in the Western Isles, I’m more than well aware of what my responsibilities are and it’s certainly not to pre-judge any applications based on my own preconceptions, or prejudicesof what should or shouldn’t be allowed.I’ve to stick to the guidelines and the training I’ve been given, understand what’s expected of meand to base my decision without emotion or bias. across the front pages of this paper and others, on social media and the television news, can influence any of my our decisions.The capitalist playground which crofting tenure has now become, and the seismic change in the scale of speculation on ‘marketable’ properties available, is in danger of knocking the fragile socio-economic balance of the west of Scotland even further off its already very shoogly axis.Crofts have now become the equivalent of crypto-currency the ‘Bitcoins’ which can provide financial security for those fortunate enough to be sitting on ‘gold’.What’s being done to stabilise and bring a dose of reality to a market which threatens to get completely out of control How can single iniduals be able to own several crofts with not an intention to ‘work’ or develop any single one of them I believe that a crofting historian once said that this form of land tenure has become ‘the single biggest impediment to sustainable development in Western Scotland and the Highlands and Islands’.That wasn’t yesterday.‘Things’ are already well out of control.But who should intervene I’m not the only one who keeps asking the question.Apparently ‘we’ should legislate to address.We need, it has been suggested, to become Jersey or Guernsey.That people shouldn’t be allowed to buy homes here unless they intend to be used as a primary residence .Second homes taxation needs to increase signicantly and the additional income be used to support tourism infrastructure.From the Butt to Bodmin there have been ious proposals as to how to legislate to prevent the worst effects of tourism from destroying fragile local economies.Have any worked, andso, could they be implemented here to make any dference Let me be very clear.Tourism is hugely important to our rural economy.More so since Brexit and Covid.But I’ll say this again, at the risk of boring you all: it needs to be carefully nurtured and sustainably developed.We cannot survivewe turn our villages into ‘ghost-towns’#yes, I know…..for the winter months.We need a balance, we need the ‘tools’ with which to legislate properly and we need those charged with ‘oversight’ to take better ownership.We need, and I’ve yet to see any evidence of this, these same people to begin to take this seriously.For our future generations.They are the ones who will be impacted mostwe don’t sit up and pay attention.Now."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/CATTLE-SALES-SEP-21-2-scaled.jpg","title":"remember your roots skye plan is urged to recognise","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThose were the comments of Roddy Murray, former Western Isles councillor and now the grazings clerk for Tarskavaig in Sleat, who this week voiced his concern that there was no mention of crofting at all in the ‘Skye and Raasay Future’ plan published in August with the full backing of all four local councillors.He told the Free Press: “There are  projects listed in the plan but not a single mention of crofting. Crofting is the basis for so many of the settlements on Skye outwith Portree, Broadford and Kyleakin and this should have been acknowledged.“There is quite a signicant impact from crofting on the economic and social well-being of Skye and Raasay. You only have to look at the , high quality calves sold for high prices last week in Portree to see that.”In terms of infrastructure improvements to support crofting, Mr Murray said the auction mart in Portree must be redeveloped to improve parking and animal welfare, and an abattoir facility must be provided so that livestock does not have to be driven to Dingwall.He added: “We are being told by the Scottish Crofting Federation that there is a huge demand for new crofts.#To meet that demand we either have to encourage landowners to make this happen or there has to be acquisition of an estate.“If we want to keep our young people in our communities we need to address the availability of crofts.”The Scottish Government are guilty of an “abject failure” when it comes to creating new crofts on publicly-owned land, Mr Murray added.Stung by the criticism, the council said they hoped to “discuss the plan further with organisations like the Crofting Commission” and would be keen to hear from any other interested parties.A spokeswoman said: “Skye and Raasay Future has been prepared with and by wider representatives of the community across the area.#It reflects people’s vision and priorities for the future, following feedback gathered through workshops and online consultations held throughout the year.“In workshop discussions, the important role that crofting plays in the identity and culture of Skye and Raasay communities has been clearly referenced..#Skye councillor John Finlayson said all stakeholders should be involved in “shaping, evaluating and changing” the plan’s priorities and he acknowledged the importance of crofting “in all its guises” across Skye and Raasay.He added: “Crofting is still a central part of le on Skye and while it is part of our history and culture it will also I hope continue to be a key part of our future and it is an important element of SARF.#As those who took part in the engagement to create the initial plan agreed, it is important that representatives from the crofting community are fully engaged in the continued development and implementation of the plan and I am confident this will happen.”"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_4108705.jpg--.jpg?1632478259000\n","title":"craigdun bids fond farewell to wilma","story":"CRAIGDUN Private Nursing Home in Cullybackey has bid a fond farewell to Wilma Swann who retired recently after  years of dedicated employment.

Northern Ireland has experienced a .% increase in average rental values this year[]. With the price increase, OFTEC, representing the liquid fuel industry in Ireland, is concerned that students may take cheaper accommodation options without properly inspecting the property. With this in mind, OFTEC has issued advise to help students ensure their accommodation is safe before they sign the dotted line. Raise the alarm – Currently, it is not a mandatory requirement for private landlords to provide smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, but the HSENI recommend that they do. It is a legal requirement to fit a carbon monoxide detector when a fossil fuel appliance has been replaced. Carbon monoxide is potentially lethal as it has no smell, taste or colour. Without a working alarm, it is impossible to identy carbon monoxide leaks. OFTEC’s advise is to ensure that there are working fire and CO alarms in the property, and that they are tested on a regular basis.Heating requirements - The Health  Safety Executive recommend that all boilers should be serviced annually and tenants should ask for evidence of recent servicing. If you have concerns, ask for a CD  Landlord Oil Installation Check which is carried out by an OFTEC registered technician and will give you peace of mind. For a gas heated property, ask for a copy of the annual gas safety check.Look for damp – It is easy to hide damp patches with a coat of paint, soyour house smells musty or you see evidence of mould, find out how the landlord is planning to fix the problem. Mould has no place in the home as it can cause respiratory problems and headaches.Furniture and fittings – Ask the landlord for a list of everything that is included and make note of any damage that is there before you move it. Check any beds, sofas and chairs are in good condition.Secure your home – burglars may target student areas because of lax security. Ask your landlord to fit key operating locks on the windows and lever deadlocks on external doors.  OFTEC Ireland Manager, David Blevings, said: “Quite often the excitement of moving in with friends can overshadow the concerns about the accommodation itself. We are urging students to play it safe this year and carry out these essential checks before signing a lease and moving in. “Asking a landlord about safety may seem awkward, but it could prevent you from living in a potentially dangerous property for the next  months. It’s vital that your new home is not a burden as you start your time at university.

There had been a flurry of activity in June as buyers rushed to maximise their tax discounts.A % deposit on a typical first-time buyer home is now around % of gross income - a record highRobert Gardner, Nationwide Building SocietyMr Gardner continued: “House prices have continued to rise more quickly than earnings in recent quarters, which means affordability is becoming more stretched.“Raising a deposit remains the main barrier for most prospective first-time buyers. A % deposit on a typical first-time buyer home is now around % of gross income – a record high.“Due to the historically low level of interest rates, the cost of servicing the typical mortgage is still well below the levels recorded in the run-up to the financial crisis. However, even on this measure, affordability is becoming more challenging.“For example,we look at typical mortgage payments relative to take-home pay across the country, it is notable that in the majority of UK regionsthis ratio is now above its long-run average. By contrast, pre-pandemic, this was only the case in one region .“Recent price patterns suggest an element of rebalancing is occurring where most of the regions that have seen the strongest price growth are those in which affordability is still close to or below the long-run average.”Mr Gardner said the outlook remains uncertain.He added: “Activity is likely to soften for a period after the stamp duty holiday expires at the end of September, given the incentive for people to bring forward their purchases to avoid the additional tax.“Moreover, underlying demand is likely to soften around the turn of the yearunemployment rises as Government support winds down, as seems likely.“But this is far from assured. The labour market has remained remarkably resilient to date and, evenit does weaken, there is scope for shts in housing preferences as a result of the pandemic – such as wanting more space or to relocate – to continue to support activity for some time yet.”Here are average house prices in the third quarter of this year and the annual increase, according to Nationwide Building Society:– Wales, £,, .%– Northern Ireland, £,, .%– Yorkshire and the Humber, £,, .%– Scotland, £,, .%– North West, £,, .%– North East, £,, .%– East Midlands, £,, .%– West Midlands, £,, .%– South West, £,, .%– Outer South East£,, .%– East Anglia, £,, .%– Outer politan£,, .%– London, £,, .%.app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Most ReadBelfast Marathon runners rage as they queue for hours to collect race packsCommunity ‘deeply shocked’ as man dies after single-vehicle crashShane Lowry reveals #dog#s abuse# suffered by family at Ryder Cup: ‘Some people are idiots, especially when they drink’Former PSNI detective cleared of assault on ex over Covid rowSam McBrideOpinionA scandal within a scandal: Just one RHI official disciplined — and several promotedTop Videos \"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news fcc .ece AUTOCROP wh fcecacfa.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news fcc .ece AUTOCROP wh fcecacfa.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   \"PlayVideo: Parades Commission determination prevents Centenary parade entering Kilcoole area of BelfastPlay#Only in Dublin# – Bizarre clip of men removing couch from flat with brooms goes viralPlayVideo guide: The new  Belfast city marathon routeLatest Northern IrelandProbation Board appoints new chief executiveBelfast City Marathon: Co Armagh’s Fionnuala Ross claims victory in women’s racePM branded ‘hypocrite’ over Everard remarks while supporting Troubles amnestyMan taken to hospital after ‘vicious’ attack in CarrickfergusMan charged with rioting offences by police investigating Lyra McKee murderLatestGovernment still committed to Slaintecare, says Cabinet ministerEight reported dead as small plane crashes into building in Milan‘Out of touch’ Johnson accused of ignoring the plight of pig farmersUS expresses concern as China sends warplanes into Taiwanese airspace againConservatives the ‘party of working Scotland’, Douglas Ross claims,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendNewsEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

With the furlough scheme set to end this week and a number of Covid- restrictions remaining in place, he argues until businesses can operate without restrictions the scheme should be retained. At the beginning of the pandemic in March , immediate thoughts turned to how businesses could stay afloat and how jobs and incomes could be protected. googletag.cmd.push The UK Government, to its credit, moved rapidly and put in place the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, better since known as the furlough scheme. As of this month, over . million workers across the UK have been furloughed at one time or the other, with the government supporting up to % of their wages in order to protect jobs and avoid widespread destitution. Sixty-six billion pounds has been spent by the Exchequer on the furlough scheme, a testament to the government’s commitment to protecting livelihoods and protecting businesses. However, the decision to wind down the scheme this month and remove the furlough safety net appears premature and may leave businesses and employees in the lurch. With coronavirus restrictions still in place in Northern Ireland, and no date set in stone yet for the removal of all remaining restrictions, businesses here are not operating with full freedom and full flexibility. If pandemic restrictions persist, then pandemic protections should also. Executive Ministers, including the First and Deputy First Ministers, have recently made confusing and contradictory comments about the future of the pandemic and restrictions in Northern Ireland. While the Economy Minister has shown an urgency and willingness to set a date for the lting of all remaining restrictions, the First Minister recently dampened these expectations while the Deputy First Minister refused to rule out future lockdowns or so-called ‘circuit breakers.’     The continued confusion and uncertainty over restrictions is bad for business, bad for employers, bad for workers, and bad for the wider economy. The last thing the business community needs after  long months is the threat and anxiety of another deeply damaging lockdown. Until we get to a stage where we can fully operate and live without restrictions, however, pandemic protections like the furlough scheme must remain in place. Other countries like Germany and the Republic of Ireland are extending their wage subsidy schemes well into . At a time when global finance and borrowing rates are extremely cheap for national governments, this is not the right point to be unwinding supports for businesses or workers.

In circumstances like this, cash is king, but when you continue to stockpile cash long after you’ve reached your emergency fund number, that’s when it begins to hurt you financially.Excess savings sitting in accounts earning negative s mean the purchasing power of those savings are going down in value, and whilst that may not hurt your finances much in the short term, it’s the opportunity lost in not investing in accounts that are producing much better s that will.The opportunity cost for one client of mine who had €, sitting in a deposit account, that had no reason to be there, was €, over just one year.         I had a zoom call with her back in February and she told me she had savings of c. €, sitting in a deposit account earning .%. But when you factor in DIRT tax and inflation, her actualwas -.%.Anyway, she knew she was cash heavy, but was unsure how much of the €, she should ide up and what number should be assigned to her emergency fund and what could be set aside for investment and so on.So, what I suggested to her was very similar to what is primarily used when it comes to pension planning in retirement, and it’s known as The Bucket Strategy. I thought the concept is such a great one, it should be adapted and used when it comes to iding up the amounts people have accumulated in cash.The solution is iding up the amount you have in savings into three dferent accounts, and the amount you deposit into each account is based on:*When you need the money*How long you want it to last for, and*How much you need or can set asideWhen we applied this logic, the strategy for her looked something like this:Bucket Number  – Emergency FundAccount Type: CashRisk: ZeroPurpose: Covers emergency expenses for  monthsOptimum Balance in Account: €,We looked at what deficit would existthere was a loss of income, and we focused on the cost of funding those priority expenses that must be covered and paid. And we discovered that monthly cost was €,.We were happy that having  months of those expenses in an account dedicated for this eventuality was enough.So, she set up a separate account, called it her emergency fund and transferred €, into it. Next up was,Bucket Number  – Short Medium Term ExpensesAccount Type: Cash Fixed TermRisk: ZeroPurpose: Known, once off expenses, incurred in the next   monthsOptimum Balance in Account: €,This is an account you set funds aside for large once off expenses you know you’re going to incur in the next  months.The women I met was planning on changing her car next year and whilst she didn’t know exactly what car she was going to buy, €, was a good number to ring fence from her savings.But rather than leaving this amount sitting in a deposit account, she moved it to a fixed notice account for  months, earning .%. It’s still a terriblebut at least it was  times better than leaving it where it was.Bucket Number  – InvestmentAccount Type: EquityRisk: MediumPurpose: Make money beat inflationOptimum Balance in Account: €,Now more than ever, you need to be invested in equity-based accounts, you just have to.We set up this type of account up for the woman I met back in February where she deposited €, into it. And theon the account since then, has been +.%. The same account had s of +.% over  year and +.% over  years.Contrast them to the .% she was making by holding excess savings in cash.It meant her €, was going down in value by € every year.But had she set aside €, a year ago in an equity account, it would have gone up by €,.And eventhe equity s dropped in value by c. % from what they made last year, they’d still be % more than what she’d getshe left her money languishing in a deposit account.Whatever way you want to present it, the dference is staggering, and the reason I said from the outset, why holding too much cash is bad for your finances.One of the long-term financial effects, Covid could leave on people, is a fear that something like this could happen again, so people begin to hoard money and whilst there isn’t anything wrong with that, it’s where they leave this money accrue that’s the problem. And that’s in cash accounts that are earning nothing.Let me repeat again, those accounts are fine for your emergency fund, but once you’ve past that amount, you really need to consider other accounts that will yield higher s.And perhaps not everyone will have enough in savings to fill three buckets.They may not have enough to fill even one, and that’s okay as well becauseyou follow this very simple strategy, it will prevent you from using money that’s being invested but should really be assigned to your emergency fund or leaving money in an emergency fund that should be set aside for investment.So, you really need to know your numbers and the dficulty I find with people, is that they have one, maybe two accounts and the amount they’ve accumulated is used for everything i.e. emergency fund, investment and once off expenses.And this is one of the reasons people are not optimising their finances. They may have spare cash that could be used towards investment, but it’s getting lumped in with emergency funds and once off expenses and it stays there and earns nothing.Having a dedicated amount for specic purposes makes things much easier because you know, you have the optimum amount in place for each purpose and you know you’re not affecting other areas, either.And using the Bucket Strategy will help. It’s not time consuming to set up, but I assure you, it will be time well spent.Liam Croke is MD of Harmonics Financial Ltd, based in Plassey.

A legally binding commitment was made by Ireland to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by % by the end of the decade. According to a new sustainability study conducted by Empathy Research in June this year, % of businesses are doubtful theyll achieve these goals. googletag.cmd.push The study also found that % of companies claim they dont have science-based emissions targets, while a further % dont knowtheir targets are science-based or not. This is despite the fact that % of businesses believe their sustainability efforts have positively impacted their bottom line. Commenting on the studys findings, Head of Sustainability at EY, Stephen Prenille, said, Businesses have a very real responsibility to take charge of the role they can play in addressing the global climate change crisis. He continued: [They]need to proactively consider the cost-saving benefits of sustainable practices from the get-go and build them into financial planning. It doesn’t undermine sustainability efforts to draw a connection to long-term profitability, on the contrary, it supports its adoption and longevity.” Forty percent of respondents to the study said they will seek support in the next six to twelve months to help improve sustainability efforts.

She co-founded successful online learning company Learning Pool in Derry in . Today, she works extensively with start-ups and scaling tech companies. She is one of the co-founders of cross-border social enterprise and female founder community AwakenHub and she is part of the EU’s flagship EIC Accelerator innovation team. googletag.cmd.push -------------------------------------------- A few weeks ago Digital DNA’s Simon Bailie asked me to write a short piece about Derry for DDNA’s Top Tech Companies in NIreport. Simon asked me to cover the Derry tech scene – how it’s altered in the almost  years I’ve been working in the city and perhaps more importantly, what the missing ingredients are that would make the Maiden City’s tech scene really sing. I enjoyed writing it and was surprised to find that no-one  has written about this. Here’s what I had to say in full. How much has the Derry tech scene changed  I began working in Derry in . I moved from Belfast where I’d been global CFO in one of QUB’s semiconductor IP spinouts.I’d spent a good bit of my time in the early noughties in Silicon Valley and Derry in  couldn’t have been further from San Jose. The only similarity was that the streets were completely deserted by .pm. When I told my friends in Belfast that I was taking a job in Derry they all tried to talk me out of it. I remember trying to recruit a team in  and talent was very thin on the ground. Most of the local workforce were lers in one of the FDIs or they commuted to tech jobs in either Belfast or Letterkenny.     The local tech scene back then was dominated by the prominent FDIs Seagate  Allstate , big fish Singularityand a never-ending raft of call centres and it was populated by revered avuncular middle-aged men like Bro McFerran and Dr Alan McClure. Anyone calling the HP or Expedia customer help lines back in the day would’ve been greeted by a Derry accent, way before it was trendy. We started Learning Pool in London in  and quickly moved the company to Derry because it was bootstrap-affordable and because of the ready talent graduating from Magee. We couldn’t afford to hire an experienced team so we recruited new graduates with the right attitude and trained them. We didn’t have an office so we took a few desks in theshockingly haphazard co-working space at the university. Even though the space was supposed to be reserved for new startups, a few companies had been renting in there forever so we ended up with desks dotted here and there in random parts of the floor. No-one in our team could sit together and the co-working space manager constantly shushed us whenever we took phone calls and harped on forever about the washing-up. We had a desktop PC in the corner with a paper notice sellotaped to the top of it which read DO NOT SWITCH OFF  Today there’s a stable of promising scaling tech companies choosing to base themselves in Derry. Established companies likeElemental Software  Newer entrants like medtech company Respiratory Analytics, cyber security companyITUSand caretech challenger startupInCharge. Many companies keep one foot in Derry and the other in Donegal, thus preserving their EU status for access to customers and funding. Catalyst Incopened its doors in  on the historic Fort George site just outside the city and has been a great formal addition to the fabric of the local ecosystem. Other active startup supports likeStartacusand new island of Ireland female founder community AwakenHubare anchored in Derry. Today, the local tech scene is younger, more female, less formal, more global, well educated and informed and definitely ambitious. A lot of newer founders have lived away from Ireland for a while but are electing tohome and settle down, build a business. Catalyst’s Co-Founders programme has uncovered some interesting nascent companies. Some of those new graduates that I recruited back in  or  have gone on to found their own startups. That’s how ecosystems work. The FDIs are still present but they’re less dominant today. They don’t have a lot of employee churn and just tick along in the background, largely behind closed doors. They bring employment to an area of Northern Ireland that badly needs it and they sponsor the odd event and programme. Many of the call centres seem to have been bought over and have disappeared. Innovation and all the interesting stuff happens in the smaller, agile companies around the edges and this is what we need more of. As well as the FDIs we now have the presence of indigenous scaleups like Kainosand FinTru. It would be great to see a few more like these moving in but high quality office space is an issue. Maybe not so important in the future we’re facing post-COVID. The traditional talent pool has extended from the Bann well into Donegal and in Derry I’ve worked beside people who’ve commuted daily from as far afield as Ballycastle and Creeslough. Missing Ingredients If it was Christmas morning and I could have three wishes to improve the tech sector ecosystem in the North West this is what I would wish for: - An ambitious cross-border university named after the late John Hume with campuses in both Derry and Donegaland strong links into the powerful North West diaspora that stretches from Philadelphia to London to Singapore. I’m always impressed by the vibrant startup scene that exists in Letterkenny as a result of the numerous overseas students and researchers who come to LYIT for academic reasons and end up staying. This new university to be fastened at the hip to a well funded and well resourced startup, student and alumni accelerator regime like Oxford University has withOxford Foundrywhich in turn connects firmly into sources of venture finance, a bit likeEDEMin the marina in Valencia - A Derry-Letterkenny- Sligo-Galway Economic Corridor along the Wild Atlantic Way to mirror the Belfast-Dublin corridor that was formally announced in the east of the island last month. This to connect the opportunities that will naturally flow from the new Magee Medical School to the vibrant medtech cluster of companies and investors in Galway and to link in with the newly reinvigorated Western Development Commissionand the string of Atlantic hubs the Irish State has invested in over recent years. I am encouraged by news of a new cross-border scaling hub led by Catalyst Inc  LYIT which will be built in the image of thePortershedGalway model - A focus placed on determining how Derry and indeed all of Northern Ireland can tangibly and quickly benefit from being so close to an EU border in the post-Brexit world. Can Derry compete with Belfast  This was a provocative question posed by Simon in his brief to me. In my view, this is not the right question and shouldn’t be part of anyone’s ambition. Any venture starting out in the new world should instead think about opportunities presented as a result of global changes that the past  months have fast tracked. It’s now genuinely possible to be a global company from Day  and utilise talent from any part of the globe. Barriers no longer exist. Cities and regions need to start thinking this way too. To ask Derry to compete only with Belfast would not be setting a big enough challenge. So, in conclusion,you’re looking for a friendly and affordable university city to start your tech business, where it’s possible to be in both the UK and the EU, an hour from London by air, where   of the population is aged - and is well educated, where government startup funding is readily available, close to some of Europe’s finest beaches, with top class local state schools and a long history and culture … then maybe you should take a look at Derry. And my final call to action, on  April  Jayne Brady started in a brand new post at Belfast City Council as Belfast’s Digital Innovation Commissioner. An engineer and former Venture Capital Partner, in the  months since Jayne started she’s made a massive dference and she represents Belfast at the digital and innovation negotiating tables in both Westminster and Dublin. In truth, although she works for Belfast City Council she does her very best to represent all of Northern Ireland. Isn’t it time we appointed a Digital Innovation Commissioner to do the same and really own this agenda for the NW region of Ireland and its citizens, present and future ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular MultimediaTake a stroll down memory lane from the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at TheBar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at TheBar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry hospitals Emergency Department is currently very busyDerry NewsPublic urged to attend Altnagelvin AE only in an emergency overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Elms Park in Coleraine where the shots were fire.

It may be le itself that has caused this loss. Past hurts, traumas and grief. Although it may be challenging, I invite you to think for a moment, what the very word “passion” means to you. Maybe it is a hobby or interest, a relationship, your passion for your children, your career or maybe most importantly, the passion you have for the relationship you nurture with yourself. Or maybe, there is a nothingness that presents itself. googletag.cmd.push Maybe you have memories of past passions, past hobbies, past relationships, lost loved ones or the lost version of yourself that you deeply miss. I would suggest that there is a trauma that exists with losing your passion or passions in le. To grieve a past role you played in someone ’s le possibly or maybe even your own. There is a loss that exists. Recognising that it is, indeed a loss, is a huge step in the process of finding one’s self again. Recognising this, may be hurtful. We may relish the times that have passed. The things we feel we may not have the time for anymore or it may not be a feeling but a reality we succumb to. Once we recognise this loss of self, the next step is a process of acceptance. This may not be a quick fix or the flick of a switch so to speak. It may be a long, laborious process where we can tend to dwell on the past and the “good times” that have passed. Is there any way of getting around this  To say that there is a quick way of doing so, would not honour the space that is needed in this loss.     It truly does need the breathing space which is a timely and robust effort. However, once you do this inner work, the pay off is ten fold. Look, things won’t ever be “the same” again and to act like they will be would firstly be a lie and secondly delusional. How could they possibly be  Think about it. With all of your experiences to date, how could you go back to your former self  It is simply not possible. I would suggest that in the present moment we can make better choices that can result in a future that leads to fulfilment, joy, happiness and brings us to an even better place. That is not optimistic, innocent, naivety or wishful thinking. There is a science behind it for starters but also it is common sense. If you do the same things over and over again and expect a dferent result or expect things to be like they used to be, you are surely on a road to disappointments and perceived “failure”. If, however, you start to inject small steps into your le where you make time for the endeavours you find most passionate, there is hope. If this resonates with you or speaks to you, then I invite you today, not tomorrow or next week, to find time for something you are passionate about. Evenit is five minutes. So what. Time is on your side and this is not a race. The most important relationship we have in this le is with ourselves. Foster it. Nurture it. Go easy with it . Tend to the garden of your le. It is too short for endeavours we don’t enjoy. But what about “responsibility” I hear you say. What about the job I work every day to put food on the table and pay my bills  Look, we always have choices. Evenit doesn’t seem like it today. There is always another job. There is always another bus. It is up to you which bus to take. By finding time for your true passions you are giving yourself the priceless gt of time, experiences and memories. When we sit on our deathbeds and look back at le , we will not think about the days we put down at work. Reframe it. Those days give us a chance to create memories with our families, with ourselves. Ever hear the saying: “Live today asyou will die tomorrow”. I believe that is BS. We need to plan for weeks, months and years ahead. However, it does have merit in that we should enjoy today. Embrace the day or seize the moment - Carpe Diem. So why wait  Yes, there are challenges ahead. For some, the biggest challenges we may face in our lives. But take these challenges on and remember to make time for yourself in the process. Don’t, ever, lose your passion and zest for le. So I invite you today, not to forget about the past, the past is a very important part of our lives. I invite you to acknowledge it deeply, to realise the loss of the past but to also realise things will not “be the same again”. Embrace today, for its wins, for its losses, either way there is always something to be learned. I will leave you with a quote from the famous ancient Greek philosopher Socrates who said: “The unexamined le is the le not worth living.”ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular MultimediaTake a stroll down memory lane from the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at TheBar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at TheBar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry hospitals Emergency Department is currently very busyDerry NewsPublic urged to attend Altnagelvin AE only in an emergency overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Elms Park in Coleraine where the shots were fire.

The financial support is helping firms across the nation to adapt, innovate and protect jobs. Here are two examples of how companies have been helped, and what support is available. googletag.cmd.push NORTHERN IRELAND IN NUMBERS , jobs furloughed through the Coronavirus Jobs Retention Scheme up to May  , claims amounting to pound million through the Self- Employment Income Support Scheme up to May  Across the whole UK  per cent of those eligible for SEISS made a claim. The average value of a claim is pound, Source: Her Majesty’s Treasury CASE STUDY  SHNUGGLE  Planning, forward-thinking and invaluable help from the UK Government has enabled a Northern Ireland firm to ersy and remain solvent. When Covid- struck, Newtownards baby product manufacturer Shnuggle’s owners Sinead and Adam Murphy were prepared thanks to advice from their export colleagues in China. Sinead said: “We reduced our out-goings, put on pause our marketing spend in the business. We just tried to protect the cash that we had. “The first impact was our customers that we sell to in Asia. They all went into lockdown so our orders and sales to them stopped. But also a lot of our production happens out in Asia so our factories went into lockdown. “Luckily we had bought a lot of stock beforehand. We were so relieved that we had, at least we could carry on trading with our UK and European customers.” With around half of the company’s sales in the UK and Ireland and half in the export business, Shnuggle had to rely on their local retail-base. Sinead continued: “Baby items were classed as essential goods which was a huge relief to us. This meant as long as we could socially distance within the warehouse we could continue trading and selling online. All of our business is supplying other retailers like John Lewis, Mamas and Papas, Amazon. But our online sales actually grew because everyone was at home and maybe an element of panic buying.”      CASH HELP: The Shnuggle team Shnuggle took advantage of the furlough and Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Schemeschemes. Sinead said: “We furloughed five out of our  team, and were able to access the Business Interruption loan through Ulster Bank. “We were relieved to get the money in quickly, so we weren’t worrying about paying wages or our biggest overhead was our suppliers in China who were calling in all of their debts. “That was our biggest headache and stress, we owed signicant amounts of money to them and we didn’t have the cash as we needed time to sell our products.” Shnuggle also received a pound, Small Business Grant. Adam said: “Furloughing was brilliant, and the CBILS was the one that was the best for us because it meant that we could keep all our suppliers happy. “So even though we had a temporary dip in our sales, and obviously the inventory was sitting there ready to sell, it just kept us solvent and the cash flow moving. It’s really going to help us trade out of it, andall goes well, we should be able to get back into a reasonably strong cash position within the next six to  months. The loans coming in helped us to sleep at night.” The Government schemes also gave Sinead and Adam the freedom to ersy into the PPE market and the development of HeroShield Ltd, enabling local firms to unite to develop a protective face covering for key workers. This non-profit company designs, produces and distributes reusable visors.   ‘It’s surprisingly easy and money arrives quickly’ CASE STUDY  Q-MASS An unprecedented package of UK Government financial support has helped firms like Q-Mass in East Kilbride weather the coronavirus crisis. Director Ronnie Robertson said lockdown hit his company’s order book, but the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme has been vital to help them hang on to their valued staff. Ronnie said: “Before this, we had quite a good order book, with three to four months of work planned, so we were pretty worried where it was going to take us.” At first, he was worried how he would keep Q-Mass’  staff on the payroll, but then the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme was announced. It offers UK Government support to pay  per cent of staff’s wages up to pound, a month, and the scheme has now been extended until the end of October. Q-Mass manufactures bespoke parts for the oil, gas and defence industry so staff training is important. Ronnie said: “Our staff are very highly skilled. We’ve gathered a bunch of people here and trained them up and taken on apprentices. We do a lot of training, we’ve got good people, we train them a lot and we want to hang on to them.” He found applying for the furlough scheme quick and straightforward. He said: “It was surprisingly easy and we were surprised that the money came through relatively quickly.” Now staff at the firm who’ve been furloughed are gradually ing to work, with strict safety measures in place. Ronnie said: “We’ve put a day sht back on and we’ve still got a few office people working at home, with quite a few still on furlough.  ‘SURPRISINGLY EASY’: Q-Mass director Ronnie Robertson praises the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme “We’re just ticking over. We’re trying to cover our costs every month, trying to break even, to stay still. We’re looking at it thatwe can stay still we’re doing very well.” And because of the size of the building, maintaining a two-metre distance hasn’t been a problem for ing staff. Ronnie said: “It’s been really easy. We’ve got a big workshop with wide corridors and we’ve got a lot of the doors propped open internally so no-one has to touch doors or handles. We’ve got a few toilet areas with restrictions on them and a couple of one-way corridors, but the offices are open plan, so there’s no real need for people to be near each other. The workshop’s a big, wide-open space and we have to keep cleaning things like photocopiers and touch screens, but it’s been quite straightforward.” Now Ronnie’s looking forward to a brighter future. He said: “I feel like we’re on the side of the valley and we’re looking across to the other side and it looks absolutely fantastic.” Money for business and staff Here are some examples of the support available for businesses and workers. middot The Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme has enabled businesses to put employees on a period of temporary leaveand apply for a UK Government grant to cover  per cent of those workers’ usual monthly wage costs, up to pound, a month. middot The Self-Employment Income Support Scheme will allow eligible self-employed iniduals to claim a taxable grant of  per cent of their average monthly profits, up to pound,. middot UK VAT-registered firms have been given the option to defer VAT payments until the end of June.

The Emmets got off to the best possible start with a Brendan Rogers goal in the second minute. He added a second as the champions went into the first water break - to - ahead. googletag.cmd.push Brian Cassidy capped a brilliant team move for Slaughtneils third goal. Michael McShanes side limited Lavey to shots from distance, with Ryan Mulholland, Ryan McGill and Aidan Toner registering points in the first half. Chrissy McKaigue led the way with seven points and was constantly reminding his side not to concede frees, with their control helping them to a - to - interval lead. Seacute McGuigan added Slaughtneils fourth goal early in the second half to put the game out of reach. Lavey had a goal disallowed for square ball when Ciaran Hendry had a long-range ball flicked to the net.

The motion, which had been tabled by Deputy Mayor Christopher Jackson of Sinn Feacutein, called on both the Council and the Department for Economy to establish working groups to research the proposal further. googletag.cmd.push Iceland successfully trialled a four-day week between  and  with a trial to come in place in the Republic of Ireland next January. The motion read: “This Council recognises that a lack of work le balance contributes to work related stress, low productivity and burnout amongst workers. “ accepts that there is a growing body of International evidence that shows that moving to a four-day working week, without a reduction in income, enhances productivity and happiness amongst workers.  acknowledges that companies such as Unilever and Microsoft have trialled the concept of a four-day working weekend found it had positive impacts both for business and workers “ calls on the Council and Department for Economy to establish working groups and pilot programmes that support employers to trial the concept of a four-day working week amongst their workforce.” Deputy Mayor Jackson in support of his motion said: “There are many countries right across the world that are exploring the adoption of a four-day working week. “A similar trial has been carried out in Iceland and its been described as a resounding success.     “Thats not surprising when you look at the vast swathes of research thats been carried out on the benefits of a four-day working week. Productivity is boosted, the health and well-being of employees is drastically improved as is job satisfaction. “When we look at this, we look at it in the context of that one hundred years ago, a seventy working hour week was the norm and weekends didnt exist. “I knowthats something trade unions had campaigned and worked for. “Today, trade unions are advocating on behalf of workers who are having dficulties in achieving a le-work balance. “Theres workers who are claiming that theyre over-worked and feel under-valued. “We can all acknowledge how the pandemic has almost overnight changed the working environment for most of us. “We believe theres an opportunity in front of us to look at changing our working patterns. “So as we emerge from the pandemic, we can seize that opportunity and try and support workers. “The research on this done in terms of Britain alone says that a four-day working week would bring about the same reduction in carbon emissions as removing .million cars off the road .” “Also, over  per cent of work absences are down to stress. If we can create the right environment for workers across the board, theres a possibility that we can create a more positive environment for people to be working in.” An amendment from Cllr Shaun Harkinwas tabled and passed unanimously. It read: “It has been almost  years since Trades Unions secured workers the right to a weekend. Therefore, Council will facilitate employers in the private, public and community sectors to work with trade unions on shaping four-day working week pilot programmes. Furthermore, Council agrees to work alongside Trades Unions and other relevant bodies, to bring forward a plan within twelve months to implement a trial under review within our own Council workforce, based on best international examples and practices where. “The Council agrees also that progress and implementation reports be presented to the Council on a quarterly basis, to support and inform any policies being progressed within the Department for Economy or other relevant bodies where.” Cllr Sean Mooneybacked Deputy Mayor Jacksons motion saying: “Since the pandemic, a lot of employees are working longer hours, probably finding it more dficult to switch off their laptops at the end of normal working hours. “This has led to complications with stress and burnout and probably a lack of productivity for both workers and employers. “The evidence that Ive seen from a study in New Zealand shows thatit brings a  per cent rise in productivity. Carbon emissions are brought down with one day less of commuting and a better le-work balance. “Employees can now spend more time with their personal le and allows employers to retain better recruitment practices. “A more notable aspect too is that national governments have decided to trial this. “Obviously, the downside is that this can only apply to certain sectors of the economy. Im thinking of the emergency services but with that said, we would certainly be supporting this motion.” There was a note of caution that a four-day week might not reach every worker in the country. Alderman Keith Kerrigansaid: “I dont wish to pour cold water on this but whatever is decided is grand, however, it will not work in the private sector. “Theres a lot of wee, small businesses with less than  employees or a lot of self-employed iniduals out there. “It would be very dficult for them to try and cut out that extra day when theres work there that has to be done. “This motion is grand for the larger firms and for the civil service but it will be very dficult to bring this in for the private sector.” Deputy Mayor Jacksons was voted on and passed unanimously. Of the result he said: “There is a growing body of international evidence showing that moving to a four-day working week, without a reduction in income, enhances productivity and happiness amongst workers. “It has already been trialled by major international companies who found that it had positive impacts both for business and workers. “Therefore I’m delighted that the council has passed my motion calling on the local authority and the Department for Economy to establish working groups and pilot programmes that support employers to trial the concept of a four-day working week amongst their workforce. “The pandemic and the working from home revolution has shown that major changes in the way we work are possible and that will bring massive benefits to workers and their families.”ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular MultimediaTake a stroll down memory lane from the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at TheBar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at TheBar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry hospitals Emergency Department is currently very busyDerry NewsPublic urged to attend Altnagelvin AE only in an emergency overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Elms Park in Coleraine where the shots were fire.

Photo: Martin McKeown.Reporter: Staff Reporter Oct   addthis, There was great excitement in the Shantallow area as the long-awaited official opening of the new Shantallow Community Centre took place last week. The pound.m state of the art development replaces the former centre which served the community for over four decades on the same site. The project has been delivered by Derry City and Strabane District Council with poundm in funding from the Department for Communities through its Neighbourhood Renewal Investment Fund. googletag.cmd.push Speaking at the event, Alderman Warke acknowledged the signicant effort to deliver the project despite the challenges faced during the pandemic, and after many years of planning. He also praised community partners in the area for helping to shape the plans for the facility to meet the needs of local people. “This is a great day for the Shantallow area and one which has been much anticipated for a long time,” he declared. “Shantallow Community Centre has been at the heart of the community for decades, serving an array of s and serving as a base for many local organisations. “This new facility will become an even more important hub, accommodating a wide range of activities, and providing a modern and welcoming space for people of all ages in the area to enjoy. “Investment in local communities is vitally important, and I want to thank the Minister for continuing to support the provision of fit for purpose facilities, particularly in the most deprived areas. “This centre follows the delivery of a brand new community hub in Top of the Hill, and will soon be followed by a new hub in Galliagh, delivering vital services in community areas.     “I want to acknowledge the work of all involved in the delivery of this important capital project, as well as the support of our community partners throughout the process.” The original Shantallow Community Centre was first built in , with the expectation that it would serve the local community for ten years. It was home to numerous groups over the decades, hosting Irish dancing classes, youth discos, bingo, bowls and a whole host of social events, from dinner dances to luncheon clubs.  years later the pound, building was finally demolished in  to make way for the new state of the art centre which features a new sports hall, a multi-purpose room, staff changing facilities and fitness suite. Welcoming the opening, Councils Director of Health and Community Karen McFarland, said: I am delighted that we have reached this milestone today. This vibrant new facility will signicantly improve the community infrastructure in the Outer North Community Area, serving a wide range of needs and being utilised by people of all ages. “Its just one project within Councils wider Capital Development Programme which prioritises the transformation of local Community areas, as laid out in the City and Districts Local Strategic Growth Plans. “Thanks to Councils Capital Development team, the local community organisations and all who played a part in realising this vision for the Shantallow area.” Communities Minister Deirdre Hargey said: “The provision of this funding through my Neighbourhood Renewal Programme, will be of great benefit to those who live in the local area. This poundm investment from the Department for Communities provides fantastic new facilities that will improve community based services and will help to improve the quality of le for local people for years to come. “This is one of several major investments that my department has made in the North West recently, including poundm for the Top of the Hill Community Centre. I thank all partners for their dedication and collaborative approach across the public and community sector. I am delighted to continue to deliver for the local community.” Cathal McCauley, manager of Shantallow Community Residents Association, who hold a Shared Management Agreement for the Centre with DCSDC, said: There has been a fantastic buzz in the community over the last year as local people could see the new building materialise. This new building now provides us with greater opportunities to deliver vital community services in an area which suffers from extreme levels of deprivation. “The local community are delighted with how brilliant it has turned out and would like to thank all those who helped us along the way other local community organisations, the Greater Shantallow Area Partnership  ONNP Growth Partnerships, Northside Dev Trust, Dept. for Communities N.W. Development Office, and Council. “The NWDO and Council officers have all been extremely helpful throughout the process. We also want to thank all our local political representatives who have supported us and this project over the past number of years.” Sinn Feacutein MLA Ciara Ferguson also welcomed the opening of the new Shantallow Community Centre. The Foyle MLA said: “I welcome the opening of the brand-new pound. million community centre in Shantallow. “This is the beginning of an exciting new chapter for Shantallow and the surrounding area as this facility will not only regenerate the area, but it will also deliver first-class services to residents. “I want to congratulate everyone who worked to make this development a reality and I look forward to working with the staff in the time ahead. “This is the latest in several major investments in community facilities in the city to improve the quality of le and improve community services.”ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular MultimediaTake a stroll down memory lane from the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at TheBar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at TheBar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry hospitals Emergency Department is currently very busyDerry NewsPublic urged to attend Altnagelvin AE only in an emergency overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Elms Park in Coleraine where the shots were fire.

Available exclusively in Attitude Black paintwork, the new Sport Black Edition brings a distinctive sporty look to Toyota’s fth-generation RAV, and is available in front-wheel-driveguise only.  googletag.cmd.push   However, for buyers looking for the added security of an all-wheel-drivedrivetrain in their new RAV, there is the option of AWD in Sol, Sport and Platinum iants, while the entry-level Luna model is FWD only.Petrol Electric PowertrainLike every iant in the RAV range, the Sport Black Edition is powered by a .-litre four-cylinder petrol-electric hybrid powertrain, which produces bhp and Nm of torque and enables the five-seat family SUV to sprint from -km h in just over  seconds. Standard across the entire RAV range is a suite of safety features which offer maximum protection for all occupants, while providing the RAV driver with the latest technology in driver assistance systems.     Collectively called Toyota Safety Sense  , features include Pre-Collision Assistance , Speed Assistance , Lane Keepingand Automatic High Beam Assist.Gracious Exterior, Spacious InteriorThe exterior design of the new RAV is more appealing and less anonymous that its predecessor, and this is gained by way of boxy wheel arches, a squared-off nose with a large grille, and angular edges and creases in the bodywork. I feel that Toyota has done a great job of making the new RAV look and feel more ‘premium’ than ever, while also offering more interior space than any of its predecessors.         Cabin quality is exceptional, with sturdy and durable materials used throughout, while overall passenger space is generous in every respect. This has been made possible by placing the front and rear axles mm further apart than before, and even tall adults will be able to sit in the rear seats comfortably, with plenty of legroom and headroom on offer.The RAV’s battery is located under the floor, but its boxy dimensions help to hide it well, with a slightly higher boot floor the only clue to what lies beneath.Compared to its predecessor, the RAV’s boot capacity has grown to -litres , with a massive ,-litres available when the rear seats are folded down.The RAV was awarded a full five stars by Euro NCAP in  and that was thanks in part to an upgrade to the second-generation of Toyota Safety Sense for the latest model.Test CarMy test car was a RAV Sport Black Edition which drew lots of admiring glances due to its terric road presence and distinctive design details.An impressive array of standard equipment includes TEX leather black upholstery with heated front seats, powered driver seat, auto-dimming interior mirror, front and rear parking sensors, rear view camera, auto lights and wipers, LED front light guide with daytime running lights, LED projector headlights, electrically operated boot door, ” Toyota Touch multimedia system, dual zone climate control, rear privacy glass, satellite navigation, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, black headliner cloth, paddle sht, light blue ambient lighting, and illuminated entry along with many more comfort, convenience, safety and infotainment features.As is the case across all models in the RAV line-up, fuel consumption as low as .l km is achievable on a WLTP combined driving cycle, while Co emissions of between  and g kmensures low annual road tax in addition to low overall running costs.Toyota’s advanced hybrid technology ensures that the RAV’s petrol engine and electric motor combine seamlessly to deliver extra performance and outstanding fuel efficiency, while remaining ultra-smooth and extremely quiet when driving in electric mode.Toyota claim that up to % of the time you drive a Toyota Hybrid, you are in electric mode, with the added advantage that you never have to plug the car in to charge the battery.Toyota’s self-charging hybrid harvests the energy normally lost from deceleration and braking into a small battery. This unit doesn’t have enough capacity to propel the RAV alone for any considerable distance, but it does offer the convenience of being able to charge itself without any input from the driver.The RAV sits on Toyota’s New Global Architecture, which is also used in the Toyota Prius, C-HR and Corolla models. It brings big benefits in ride and handling, with more sophisticated suspension than the old model, so the RAV is capable of turning into corners with a surprising amount of poise and precision, with plenty of grip while resisting dramatic levels of body lean.The RAV’s CVTtransmission is smooth and slick in its operation, while a well-insulated cabin ensures that on-road refinement is top class. When travelling through towns and cities at low speed, the RAV’s electric motor is barely audible, with the engine shutting off entirely when stationary in traffic. At motorway cruising speeds, the RAV settles into a quiet hum, with only small amounts of tyre and wind noise getting through to the cabin.Verdict, Cost and WarrantyWith its unique and distinctive modern styling, faultless build quality, impressive tally of standard equipment and frugal petrol electric hybrid technology, the new RAV has all the necessary ingredients to comfortably fulfil the needs of a growing family.The new RAV Sport Black Edition represents great value. The new Toyota RAV is backed by a three-year ,km warranty, along with a five-year ,km warranty on hybrid components.Additionally, a hybrid battery warranty of up to an incredible -years is available upon completing an annual hybrid health check through Toyota’s nationwide dealer network.

Available exclusively in Attitude Black paintwork, the new Sport Black Edition brings a distinctive sporty look to Toyota’s fth-generation RAV, and is available in front-wheel-driveguise only.  googletag.cmd.push   However, for buyers looking for the added security of an all-wheel-drivedrivetrain in their new RAV, there is the option of AWD in Sol, Sport and Platinum iants, while the entry-level Luna model is FWD only.Petrol Electric PowertrainLike every iant in the RAV range, the Sport Black Edition is powered by a .-litre four-cylinder petrol-electric hybrid powertrain, which produces bhp and Nm of torque and enables the five-seat family SUV to sprint from -km h in just over  seconds. Standard across the entire RAV range is a suite of safety features which offer maximum protection for all occupants, while providing the RAV driver with the latest technology in driver assistance systems.     Collectively called Toyota Safety Sense  , features include Pre-Collision Assistance , Speed Assistance , Lane Keepingand Automatic High Beam Assist.Gracious Exterior, Spacious InteriorThe exterior design of the new RAV is more appealing and less anonymous that its predecessor, and this is gained by way of boxy wheel arches, a squared-off nose with a large grille, and angular edges and creases in the bodywork. I feel that Toyota has done a great job of making the new RAV look and feel more ‘premium’ than ever, while also offering more interior space than any of its predecessors.         Cabin quality is exceptional, with sturdy and durable materials used throughout, while overall passenger space is generous in every respect. This has been made possible by placing the front and rear axles mm further apart than before, and even tall adults will be able to sit in the rear seats comfortably, with plenty of legroom and headroom on offer.The RAV’s battery is located under the floor, but its boxy dimensions help to hide it well, with a slightly higher boot floor the only clue to what lies beneath.Compared to its predecessor, the RAV’s boot capacity has grown to -litres , with a massive ,-litres available when the rear seats are folded down.The RAV was awarded a full five stars by Euro NCAP in  and that was thanks in part to an upgrade to the second-generation of Toyota Safety Sense for the latest model.Test CarMy test car was a RAV Sport Black Edition which drew lots of admiring glances due to its terric road presence and distinctive design details.An impressive array of standard equipment includes TEX leather black upholstery with heated front seats, powered driver seat, auto-dimming interior mirror, front and rear parking sensors, rear view camera, auto lights and wipers, LED front light guide with daytime running lights, LED projector headlights, electrically operated boot door, ” Toyota Touch multimedia system, dual zone climate control, rear privacy glass, satellite navigation, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, black headliner cloth, paddle sht, light blue ambient lighting, and illuminated entry along with many more comfort, convenience, safety and infotainment features.As is the case across all models in the RAV line-up, fuel consumption as low as .l km is achievable on a WLTP combined driving cycle, while Co emissions of between  and g kmensures low annual road tax in addition to low overall running costs.Toyota’s advanced hybrid technology ensures that the RAV’s petrol engine and electric motor combine seamlessly to deliver extra performance and outstanding fuel efficiency, while remaining ultra-smooth and extremely quiet when driving in electric mode.Toyota claim that up to % of the time you drive a Toyota Hybrid, you are in electric mode, with the added advantage that you never have to plug the car in to charge the battery.Toyota’s self-charging hybrid harvests the energy normally lost from deceleration and braking into a small battery. This unit doesn’t have enough capacity to propel the RAV alone for any considerable distance, but it does offer the convenience of being able to charge itself without any input from the driver.The RAV sits on Toyota’s New Global Architecture, which is also used in the Toyota Prius, C-HR and Corolla models. It brings big benefits in ride and handling, with more sophisticated suspension than the old model, so the RAV is capable of turning into corners with a surprising amount of poise and precision, with plenty of grip while resisting dramatic levels of body lean.The RAV’s CVTtransmission is smooth and slick in its operation, while a well-insulated cabin ensures that on-road refinement is top class. When travelling through towns and cities at low speed, the RAV’s electric motor is barely audible, with the engine shutting off entirely when stationary in traffic. At motorway cruising speeds, the RAV settles into a quiet hum, with only small amounts of tyre and wind noise getting through to the cabin.Verdict, Cost and WarrantyWith its unique and distinctive modern styling, faultless build quality, impressive tally of standard equipment and frugal petrol electric hybrid technology, the new RAV has all the necessary ingredients to comfortably fulfil the needs of a growing family.The new RAV Sport Black Edition represents great value. The new Toyota RAV is backed by a three-year ,km warranty, along with a five-year ,km warranty on hybrid components.Additionally, a hybrid battery warranty of up to an incredible -years is available upon completing an annual hybrid health check through Toyota’s nationwide dealer network.

The Formentor’s design inside and out is something quite dferent to what we have seen before, and brings with it a new dimension in style and sophistication. Being part of the Volkswagen Group means that Cupra has access to cutting-edge mechanicals and technology, and this has enabled the new Formentor compact SUV to hit the ground running, so to speak.  googletag.cmd.push   There is a lot of money and confidence behind the Cupra brand, and that is evident in the bold product plan promised by the company.Engine  Trim OptionsThe Formentor sits on the familiar MQB set of chassis components that also underpins other crossovers such as the Seat Ateca and VW Tiguan. Petrol engine options in the Formentor consist of a .-litre TSI with bhp and a .-litre TSI unit with a choice of ,  or bhp. The . TSI engine is available as a -speed manual or -speed DSG , while the . TSI comes with a DSG transmission as standard, with Cupra’s Drivesystem standard in bhp guise. A . TDIEVO engine is available with bhp and can be mated to a -speed manual or -speed DSG transmission, with the latter coming with Drive as standard.     Additionally, a .-litre e-Hybrid powertrain is available with a choice of bhp or bhp, both of which are mated to a -speed DSG transmission with promised fuel consumption as low as .l km on a combined WLTP driving cycle.There is a choice of two trim levels in CUPRA’s new compact SUV — Formentor and Formentor VZ — with the latter being the Cupra Formentor’s most powerful trim, named in reference to the Spanish word ‘Veloz’, meaning ‘fast’.The Formentor VZ trim offers high-performance powertrain options. Coming with ” alloy wheels, a ” Navigation system, autonomous assistance technology and performance bucket seats as standard.         Test CarMy test car was a Cupra Formentor . TSiDSGwhich was finished in stylish Graphene Grey Premium metallic paint with optional ” Exclusive Aero Black and Copper alloy wheels for an added dose of visual drama. Producing bhp and Nm of torque, the ,cc engine propels the Formentor from a standing start to km h in just .-seconds, on its way to a top speed of km h .Key standard features include full LED headlamps and Daytime Running Lights, rear ‘coast to coast’ light with welcome ceremony, front fog lamps with cornering , heat-insulated and tinted rear windows, leather-wrapped multi- heated sports steering wheel, dark aluminium glossy interior package, textile sport seats, keyless unlocking and ignition system, .” Digital Cockpit, ” Media System with DAB radio, Connect Online infotainment , rain and light sensor, heated front seats, adaptive cruise control, park assist, rear view camera, Drive Profile Selection, and auto high-beam assist, along with a suite of advanced safety systems.Optional extras fitted to my test car included premium metallic paint, black leather bucket seats, ” alloy wheels, hands-free electric tailgate, Dynamic Chassis Control, and Safe  Drive “L” . The sweet-revving petrol engine in my test car produces bhp and Nm of torque, enabling the car to sprint from -km h in .-seconds, with claimed fuel consumption as low as .-l km .As in other VW Group models, the .-litre engine is commendably quick to drop onto two cylinders to save fuel when cruising, and the process of cutting out and back in again is hard to detect. Composed and predictable handling is admirable, as is the Formentor’s ability to soak up road imperfections with ease.Impressive Sporty InteriorTake a seat behind the wheel of the CUPRA Formentor and you could be forgiven for thinking that you are in a hatchback rather than a compact SUV. The seating position is low, as is the base of the windscreen, so you feel like you sit much closer to the road — as you would in a performance-focused car.Selectable driving modes in the Formentor consist of Comfort, Sport, Cupra and Inidual, with each mode bringing a greater degree of aggression and engine noise that gets pumped through the cars speakers.Cabin space in the Formentor is excellent, with adults over six foot tall still able to sit comfortably in the rear seats. You could even sit three abreast thanks to the shallow transmission tunnel. The use of quality materials, with a grainy metal finish in the middle of the fascia, makes the cabin of the Formentor a pleasant and comfortable place to be, while bronze Cupra highlights on the air vents add a sense of occasion to every journey. The boot capacity of -litres in the Formentor . TSI can be expanded by dropping the rear seatbacks, allowing for even greater practicality when called upon.The Formentor scored a full five star rating in its Euro NCAP crash test, thanks in part to standard safety systems such as lane-keep assist, forward collision warning, predictive cruise control and driver alert warning.The new Cupra Formentor offers a more exclusive, contemporary vision of sportiness, which is instilled into an exquisitely sleek and bold design.

Based on the A-Class of the time, Mercedes-Benz gave its smallest model some SUV flavour with clever body cladding and a raised ride height.  googletag.cmd.push   More SUV-Like Than EverLaunched in , the second-generation GLA also shares its DNA with the latest A-Class, but it gained a more traditional SUV shape. Standing cm taller than its predecessor, the new GLA’s wheel arches are more squared-off in shape and are clad in protective black plastic. Its wheelbase has also been increased to create more passenger space, while the wheels are pushed out to each corner, resulting in much shorter front and rear overhangs.     Pitched directly against rivals like the BMW X and Volvo XC hybrids, the new GLA  e uses the same powertrain as the plug-in A-Class— a .-litre petrol engine and bhp electric motor, drawing power from a .kWh battery. The fuel tank in the GLA  e is located ahead of the car’s front axle, which leaves space under the boot to fit the hybrid battery. Importantly, this means that the GLA avoids the awkward box-shaped intrusion into the boot area seen in some plug-in hybrid cars.Specication DetailsThe new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is available in a choice of two generously-equipped specication levels — Progressive and AMG Line — both of which come with standard features such as stylish five-twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, parking sensors with reversing camera, LED high performance headlamps, Light and Sight package, hard-disc navigation, MBUX multimedia system, digital radio, Android Auto, Apple CarPlay, Seat Comfort package with heated front seats, automatic climate control, roof liner in black fabric, Mercedes-Benz emergency call system, galvanised steering-wheel gearsht paddles, Easy-Pack tailgate, Dynamic Select, acoustic ambient protection, Active Lane Keep Assist, and Speed Limit Assist, along with many more comfort, convenience and security features.         Additional AMG Line specication includes lowered comfort suspension, AMG body styling, carbon-structure trim, ” AMG -twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, Artico leather Dinamica microfibre black upholstery, and AMG floor mats.Test CarMy GLA  e ‘Progressive’ test car was finished in Night Black paintwith contrasting Macchiato Beige Black Artico leather upholsteryfor maximum impact.With a % battery charge, my test car estimated its own electric range to be km’s. The car defaults to Hybrid mode when started up, so you proceed in zero-emission fashion at speeds of up to km h, as long as the battery has charge and you accelerate gently.When the petrol engine cuts in performance is strong, as it and the electric motor combine their power in a smooth and orderly fashion. With a combined power output of bhp and a mighty Nm of torque, the GLA  e can sprint from -km h in as little as . seconds, and can achieve a top speed of km h .The petrol engine only really makes its presence known when you ask for more performance, while neat handling and sufficient grip from the driven front wheels provides great confidence on the road. The car’s steering is light but direct, and the ride is more than comfortable enough to deal with rutted road surfaces and speed ramps with ease.Cabin space is impressive, with excellent head, leg and elbow room available for all occupants, while a -litre boot capacity will be more than adequate for most families. However, the GLA’s standard split-folding rear seat backs allow for the transportation of larger items when called upon, with up to ,-litres of space on offer in this mode.The cabin of the new GLA certainly feels vastly improved over the original GLA in every respect. This has been made possible by the latest Mercedes-Benz MBUX interior layout, with crisp digital displays replacing the analogue instrument dials and flowing across onto the dashboard.Buttons have been largely replaced by a controller ahead of the gear-lever and voice control, which uses articial intelligence similar to that found in home smart devices to recognise more natural speech and commands. The turbine air vents from the original GLA have been retained, but the dashboard has been slimmed-down for a more spacious feel.VerdictOverall, the new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is a competent all-rounder that offers a decent electric range, low emissions, predictable handling and a luxurious, technology-filled cabin — encased in a stylish and practical premium compact SUV body.

Joe Irwin won an Ulster medal with the county and Eunan Rafferty was also on Derry teams in that era.The clubs recent underage development work has provided Michael Mullan to Derrys Ulster minor winning team of , with Tiarnaacuten McHugh, Dara and Ruairi Rafferty part of the group who repeated the feat two seasons later on their way to the All-Ireland Final.Current senior captain Tiarnaacuten Woods has represented Derry at minor and U level, with McHugh and Ruairi Rafferty – who have played senior hurling with Kevin Lynchs – having also played the wee ball game for the county.On the camogie field, Una Rafferty and Aoe Kelly have represented Derry at minor and U level respectively. It has all comeas a result of the work being done at the club.“It is great to have Richard Ferris back involved again,” Shane adds. “He has set up a winter programme in place for the players in first to fth year , with the older players getting looked after under the senior  with their strength and conditioning.”The current senior group has benefited from the influx of youth as they have one eye on the Derry IFC Quarter-Finals later this month.McGonigle paid tribute to those who have sat on club committees down through the years and it has been bolstered with new blood coming on board in recent years to help with the clubs progression. Another great development has been an influx in new coaches coming forward at primary school level. Every bit helps. Like many other clubs across Ireland, Drumsurn reaches deeper into the locality.

Reporter: Gary Ferry Oct Email: gary@derrynews.net  addthis, Institute vs. Knockbreda Ryan McBride Brandywell Stadium Today, pm  Six wins in seven games has perhaps changed the perception of Institute in recent weeks, with Brian Donaghey’s team now going into games as favourites to win. That winning mentality has seeped into the players ever since Donaghey’s arrival, and after six wins in seven games in all competitions, there is new le about a club which was on the floor just a month ago. googletag.cmd.push They are the form team in the Lough  Championship, with no other team managing four winning four of their last five league games and they are now expected to beat Knockbreda today and move even further up the table. That change in mindset is a challenge in itself according to Donaghey. “I challenged the players last week because for the Queens match, people thought they were favourites, probably for the first time, and I asked ‘How do you cope with this ’,” he admitted. “We started very, very poorly and it took us  minutes to get to grips with it. That will happen in the Championship I don’t think there’s a massive dference between bottom and second bottom, and top and second. Some of the results would prove that because the top teams are getting beaten by the bottom teams.” Donaghey admits he is surprised that results have improved so dramatically in such a short space of time, but puts the upturn in fortunes down to the players themselves. “If you were to say we would win six out of seven, I would have been surprised considering the fact that they lost their previous four and conceded  or  goals,” he said. “It has been a good turn round and it’s been down to the application of the players, giving them a wee bit of belief, and getting them enjoying their football again and giving them a bit of structure and getting them a wee bit more organized. The players take full credit for taking on everything we’ve asked of them.     “Working hard is a given. They are taking on board any information they are given which is good. It’s a thing you get with young players where they want to learn, and they have good learning capabilities, which is brilliant start for any manager or coach. “Getting the results also has given them that wee bit of belief. We’re embracing it, but we’re not getting ahead of ourselves.”  Brilliant Benny Benny McLaughlin was the hero again for ‘Stute last week, scoring yet another winning goal to take his tally for the season to six. He has been a massive factor in ‘Stute’s winning run. “Benny is a threat, and he will tell you in hindsight he should be sitting on double figures because he’s had quite a few chances,” Donaghey continued. “He’s a bit of a talisman at the moment, and even though his girl had a baby last week, he was the first one to say he would be there for the game. I just thought that was something I’m trying to recreate in the squad, that we’re a family and we will pull each other out when we need it and we’ll do things together and enjoy the good days together and we’ll get through the hard days as well. I’m pleased for Benny, but he’s only as good as the service he’s getting from the players around him as well.” Favourites they may be this time, but Donaghey knows that means little in such a competitive ision. “If you’re not on it % in any game in this league, you’ll get found out,” he said. “We just want to get a bit of momentum and hope that whatever information the players get they can act on. We aren’t getting too far ahead of ourselves we want to accumulate as many points as we can between now and Christmas and then we’ll see what we need, and maybe look for a few players in certain areas.”ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular MultimediaTake a stroll down memory lane from the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at TheBar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at TheBar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry hospitals Emergency Department is currently very busyDerry NewsPublic urged to attend Altnagelvin AE only in an emergency overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Elms Park in Coleraine where the shots were fire.

Four defeats and even more injuries have given coach Richard McCarter plenty of headaches, and the club veteran admits he has never quite seen anything like this in his time at Judges Road. googletag.cmd.push “In terms of injuries and bad luck not really, no,” he admitted. “Anything that can go wrong has gone wrong in terms of injuries and we just haven’t really caught a break. There’s no point dwelling on that, we have to continue with what we’ve been given and keep trying our best under the circumstances. We have a bit of positivity on the injury front this week so we’re hoping we can get a stronger back line together and attack the game with more positivity.” It will be hard to shake the Ulster League losses of recent times, particularly the heavy home defeats to Bangor and Omagh. But McCarter believes they have to put that all behind them as they prepare for the bread and butter of the All-Ireland for the first time in  months. “We have probably gone through every emotion in the last four games in the Ulster League but evenwe had won all four all those, it sort of counts for the same because no-one judges you on your Ulster League results, it’s all about the All-Ireland,” he explained. “We just have to see this as a fresh start, draw a line under what’s happened and just be really positive this week. We’re away from home which is always dficult, but it means that we can go down there relatively pressure-free and just have a good crack at it and you just never know what can happenwe stay in the game and get off to a decent start.”     Changed times So much has changed since Derry’s last All-Ireland game, which was coincidentally against Tullamore back in February . That day at Judges Road, the home side came out as - winners, but that seems a dferent world to now, with new management, a new squad and new challenges. “It’s notoriously dficult to win away from home in the All-Ireland,” McCarter added. “That maybe concentrates us a bit better but regardless we have to go down there and see this as a fresh start. If we can get off to a good start and quiet the home crowd, they become jittery and our tails can go up, so it’s important we try to get off to a good start and maintain that. “It’s probably a fairly dferent team which will go out to the one which played them  months ago. We have got to be happy with the squad we’re taking down I have full confidence in those boys and see how we get on.” Given the circumstances, it would be impossible to predict how the season might go for City of Derry, and McCarter hasn’t even thought of setting a target, especially after coming through the last few weeks with plenty of collateral damage. “Genuinely I don’t have any targets,” he said. “We are just going to take every game as it comes I have learned in the last six weeks that anything can happen. I don’t want to put pressure on the players. We’ll focus on Tullamore this week then it’s about Enniscorthy next week.”ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular MultimediaTake a stroll down memory lane from the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at TheBar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at TheBar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry hospitals Emergency Department is currently very busyDerry NewsPublic urged to attend Altnagelvin AE only in an emergency overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Elms Park in Coleraine where the shots were fire.

No Oil Paintings are a rowdy Americana four piece from Belfast. What am I doing writing about a Belfast band when all I do is slag them normally  They do have some good bands and even some great ones and besides most of the funding was gone before anyone  had filled their application. googletag.cmd.push Where was I  Their mix of folk instrumentation, four-part harmonies and high energy live shows serves to create their own brand of genre bending roots music. The band share and switch lead vocals with each member delivering their own style and strength to the songs they bring to the table. Expect to hear everything from swampy blues rock to straight up-country waltzes. What’d you do during the lockdown  “Most importantly we finished recording our debut album, but when we weren’t focused on that we just tried to keep creative. “We recorded live sessions, performed live streams, made ‘zoom videos’ and set each other writing challenges.” Have you got plans for normality, whatever that is, s  “Release the album out into the world. “ We’ve a few more singles to put out before releasing next year, so we’re concentrating on those and trying to book a tour to coincide with that.” Do you like any local musicians andso, who do you like  “We have loads of incredible friends that are part of the music scene here and there really is too much talent to choose from. We’re all fans of The Bonnevilles, Joshua Burnside, Joel Harkin, Laytha, Dani Larkin - The list could go on forever.”     Are there any valuable people, places, organisations to musicians anymore  “There is a huge lack of infrastructure within the music scene in the North, however the people that are here to help do a fantastic job of it. Help Musicians N.I helped fund a lot of the cost of our album through their ‘Do It Dferently’ fund. Places like the Oh Yeah Centre, The Nerve Centre, and how they influence the younger generations as well as nurture the more experienced performers is a credit to all of them. I think a lot of grass roots venues are incredible throughout the country, but we love The Sunflower Bar and The American they’ve always been good to us - and of course Half Bap Recording Studios where we recorded our album.” How was Stendhal, I’ve seen you there a couple of times now  “We’ve slowly made Stendhal a home from home for ourselves, so it’s always a dream to get up to the farm to play again. August  made it our th time performing in the last six years. We’ve made great friends and amazing memories over that time and will always be there for as long as they’ll have us.” Any misconceptions about the band that you’d like to clear up  “I think a lot of people still have us down as quite a bluegrass   folky band, and over the years we’ve had line-up changes and dferent sounds and styles. I think we’ve settled a lot more now into the Americana Alt-folk genre. “We keep very true to our roots and still write folk songs, but they come with a little more decibel now.” Is the oh yeah of any worth  “Absolutely, the work that Charlotte and the team are doing there is really admirable. We’ve been fortunate to play gigs for them on numerous occasions, most recently at last years ‘Sound of Music’ festival. “They have also helped promote us in the past with their ‘Getting To Know’ series and the ‘Native Music Mart’ they host each year. “Aside from ourselves the work they do with Scratch My Progress, Volume Control, Over The Hill and a long list of other”.Well, that’s me proved wrong. I probably owe them an apology So,the Oh Yeah is so good what’s wrong with Irish music scene  “I think the lack of infrastructure is our only downfall. There is an incredible amount of talent on this island, but we don’t have the private investment needed to be able to export it at the right volume. “Small things that people don’t think about such as tour managers, tour buses, right up to major labels and publishers. “We don’t even have representatives for PRS, MU or PPL.” You can find them at www.nooilpaintings and message them atinfo@nooilpaintings,listen to them at open.spoty artist DAlMAJRiFSuRMgdand soundcloud no-oil-paintings,stalk them at instagram no_oil_paintings and twitter nooilpaintingsand watch them atwww.youtube channel UCmxiPBRaPiDbbJiuA-aqA ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular MultimediaTake a stroll down memory lane from the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at TheBar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at TheBar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry hospitals Emergency Department is currently very busyDerry NewsPublic urged to attend Altnagelvin AE only in an emergency overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Elms Park in Coleraine where the shots were fire.

We’re all fans of The Bonnevilles, Joshua Burnside, Joel Harkin, Laytha, Dani Larkin - The list could go on forever.”     Are there any valuable people, places, organisations to musicians anymore  “There is a huge lack of infrastructure within the music scene in the North, however the people that are here to help do a fantastic job of it. Help Musicians N.I helped fund a lot of the cost of our album through their ‘Do It Dferently’ fund. Places like the Oh Yeah Centre, The Nerve Centre, and how they influence the younger generations as well as nurture the more experienced performers is a credit to all of them. I think a lot of grass roots venues are incredible throughout the country, but we love The Sunflower Bar and The American they’ve always been good to us - and of course Half Bap Recording Studios where we recorded our album.” How was Stendhal, I’ve seen you there a couple of times now  “We’ve slowly made Stendhal a home from home for ourselves, so it’s always a dream to get up to the farm to play again. August  made it our th time performing in the last six years. We’ve made great friends and amazing memories over that time and will always be there for as long as they’ll have us.” Any misconceptions about the band that you’d like to clear up  “I think a lot of people still have us down as quite a bluegrass   folky band, and over the years we’ve had line-up changes and dferent sounds and styles. I think we’ve settled a lot more now into the Americana Alt-folk genre. “We keep very true to our roots and still write folk songs, but they come with a little more decibel now.” Is the oh yeah of any worth  “Absolutely, the work that Charlotte and the team are doing there is really admirable. We’ve been fortunate to play gigs for them on numerous occasions, most recently at last years ‘Sound of Music’ festival. “They have also helped promote us in the past with their ‘Getting To Know’ series and the ‘Native Music Mart’ they host each year. “Aside from ourselves the work they do with Scratch My Progress, Volume Control, Over The Hill and a long list of other”.Well, that’s me proved wrong. I probably owe them an apology So,the Oh Yeah is so good what’s wrong with Irish music scene  “I think the lack of infrastructure is our only downfall. There is an incredible amount of talent on this island, but we don’t have the private investment needed to be able to export it at the right volume. “Small things that people don’t think about such as tour managers, tour buses, right up to major labels and publishers. “We don’t even have representatives for PRS, MU or PPL.” You can find them at www.nooilpaintings and message them atinfo@nooilpaintings,listen to them at open.spoty artist DAlMAJRiFSuRMgdand soundcloud no-oil-paintings,stalk them at instagram no_oil_paintings and twitter nooilpaintingsand watch them atwww.youtube channel UCmxiPBRaPiDbbJiuA-aqA ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular MultimediaTake a stroll down memory lane from the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at TheBar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at TheBar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry hospitals Emergency Department is currently very busyDerry NewsPublic urged to attend Altnagelvin AE only in an emergency overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Elms Park in Coleraine where the shots were fire.

Dancer and choreographer Helen Hall will be performing her new show ‘Collecting Moments’ at the Nerve Centre on Friday, October  from -.pm. Helen, who has been visually impaired from birth, began dancing as a young child and says it helped her with spatial awareness and movement. Her new piece was inspired by a multi-media collaboration put on hold because of Covid-. It combined dance with music, visual art, video footage and photography. She ed to the studio in June, and it was this creative exchange between Helen and fellow artists Bronagh Broderick, Jamie Maison-Harper, Paul Moor, Vasiliki Strasinaki, Katie Richardson and George Sloan that led to her new show. She said: “Because I had collected all these beautul moments of sights and sounds, it had a real sense of joy, so they all found their way into this new piece, which I’m looking forward to sharing with the audience.” Alice McCullough’s new show, ‘Brave New Words’, is taking place at the Verbal Arts Centre on Saturday, October  from -pm. She will be supported by popular spoken word poet Abby Oliveira from Derry.     Alice, who is bi-polar, is an acclaimed performance poet and stand-up. Her show is a collection of poems, stories and spoken word, dealing with her condition, creativity, and the process of stepping back on stage for the first time since the Covid- outbreak.

Sinead’s new video exhibition, Grounding and Flying Dreams will be on show at the Centre for Contemporary Art in Artillery Street from October -. It was developed from a series of explorations researching public space and how it informs and shapes ideas relating to feminine landscapes. She said “During the pandemic I found myself thinking: where can I make my work  and do I feel safe in public spaces making my work  At this time the rise in domestic violence being reported was hitting the media and the seriousness of this reality was becoming an everyday thought. I thought about a person, or family not feeling safe at home and how I could make work publicly in safety. So, questions of safety and the feminine body is an ongoing concept that informs my work.” All in-venue events will be subject to enhanced Covid- protocols and procedures to keep everyone safe.

This is the true story of Bernard Gallagher who became a national celebrity during the early s. Considered Derry’s greatest scammer and conman, Willie John was convicted and jailed more than  times for  pretences, impersonation and theft. Born in  in the Rosemount area of Derry City, Bernard Gallagher moved from place to place in pursuit of money, lodgings, food and drink. He became widely known as ‘Willie John’ when he posed as the long lost son of a widow in his hometown. Eventually it was discovered that Gallagher was in fact not Willie John McGranahan and he served five years in prison for this crime. At a time of widespread poverty and emigration, ‘Willie John’ targeted families in remote areas and his favourite scams involved impersonating a long lost relative and tall tales from overseas. In other elaborate ruses, he took on the guise of an official claiming to bring good news about an inheritance from America. By the early s, his court appearances were sensational affairs with large crowds gathering to catch a glimpse of the infamous ‘Willie John’. He often conducted his own defence, playing to the gallery and sometimes pleading that his case not to be tainted by ‘my former character’. Using newspaper articles from the time, Doacutenall investigates how one man managed to hoax people in Derry, counties Donegal and Tyrone, and further afield in Ireland, Scotland and England. Doacutenall travels to the National Archives in Dublin in search of ‘Willie John’s’ prison records and comes ‘face-to face’ for the first time with the man himself as prison photographs of ‘Willie John’ track his changing appearance as he s again and again to prison over the years. Despite his infamous career and his celebrity status, Doacutenall discovers that ‘Willie John’ spent the last  months of his le in Derry’s poor house and reflects on what drove this man – who made a career out of tricking ordinary people – to act the way he did.Made by Macha Media for BBC Gaeilge, Willie John –RoacutegaireMoacuter Dhoire, airs this evening at:pmonBBC Two Northern Ireland.  googletag.cmd.pushADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular MultimediaTake a stroll down memory lane from the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at TheBar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at TheBar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry hospitals Emergency Department is currently very busyDerry NewsPublic urged to attend Altnagelvin AE only in an emergency overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Elms Park in Coleraine where the shots were fire.

This is the true story of Bernard Gallagher who became a national celebrity during the early s. Considered Derry’s greatest scammer and conman, Willie John was convicted and jailed more than  times for  pretences, impersonation and theft. Born in  in the Rosemount area of Derry City, Bernard Gallagher moved from place to place in pursuit of money, lodgings, food and drink. He became widely known as ‘Willie John’ when he posed as the long lost son of a widow in his hometown. Eventually it was discovered that Gallagher was in fact not Willie John McGranahan and he served five years in prison for this crime. At a time of widespread poverty and emigration, ‘Willie John’ targeted families in remote areas and his favourite scams involved impersonating a long lost relative and tall tales from overseas. In other elaborate ruses, he took on the guise of an official claiming to bring good news about an inheritance from America. By the early s, his court appearances were sensational affairs with large crowds gathering to catch a glimpse of the infamous ‘Willie John’. He often conducted his own defence, playing to the gallery and sometimes pleading that his case not to be tainted by ‘my former character’. Using newspaper articles from the time, Doacutenall investigates how one man managed to hoax people in Derry, counties Donegal and Tyrone, and further afield in Ireland, Scotland and England. Doacutenall travels to the National Archives in Dublin in search of ‘Willie John’s’ prison records and comes ‘face-to face’ for the first time with the man himself as prison photographs of ‘Willie John’ track his changing appearance as he s again and again to prison over the years. Despite his infamous career and his celebrity status, Doacutenall discovers that ‘Willie John’ spent the last  months of his le in Derry’s poor house and reflects on what drove this man – who made a career out of tricking ordinary people – to act the way he did.Made by Macha Media for BBC Gaeilge, Willie John –RoacutegaireMoacuter Dhoire, airs this evening at:pmonBBC Two Northern Ireland.  googletag.cmd.pushADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular MultimediaTake a stroll down memory lane from the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at TheBar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at TheBar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry hospitals Emergency Department is currently very busyDerry NewsPublic urged to attend Altnagelvin AE only in an emergency overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Elms Park in Coleraine where the shots were fire.

One of the most effective ways of identying how we meet these needs is consulting with our existing business stakeholders who have invested into our town and community.Cllr Sharvin said the proposed consultation will focus on the business communityrsquos view on what is positive about the work the local authority currently does.ldquoIt will also seek to find out what the organisation does not do so well, what businesses want to see in terms of support and what steps can be taken to attract additional investment, he continued.ldquoGiven Downpatrickrsquos rich and vibrant history, we have visitors coming from all over the world to visit St Patrickrsquos final resting place and complementing this is a fantastic array of attractions such as Inch Abbey, the St Patrick Centre, Downpatrick and Co Down Railway, Ballydugan medieval site, Struell Wells and Saul Church.ldquoHowever, the last thing I want is for those who visit the town and experience all this to then move on to Newry or Belfast.Cllr Sharvin said it is important that there are facilities for visitors to stay to have a meal and even remain in the town overnight.ldquoThis is something that I and my colleagues would like to see delivered which would have a positive,ripple effect on delivering a nightle that we can be proud of, he remarked.He said he believes that a town centre manager or a chamber of commerce could be the right mechanism to bring the town together and play a proactive role in attracting investment and new business to the area.He added: ldquoWe have to get the right blend of making Downpatrick attractive not only to tourists but, just as importantly, to residents who live and work in the area.ldquoI would urge all businesses to engage in the council survey and highlight what they would like to see in the Downpatrick area.

occasions.Philip Doran, Connor Marron, Shea McComiskey and Kieran Taggart made up the rest of the tally in what was a resounding win.Ballynahinch had their opportunities, but Ballynagross felt secure

national newspapers outlining the scale and potential of the sprawling complex.The Recorder understands the move has already attracted signicant interest among potential buyers, with no less than four firm bids already lodged.Last month, the Northern Bank changed the locks on the gates of the major complex after months of intense speculation surrounding its future and local planning officials announced they were considering taking legal action because the owners had exceeded the number of race meetings they were allowed to run.The current owner of the circuit, Mr David Beattie, confirmed yesterday afternoon that the complex is for sale, but he revealed he is currently working on a rescue package which he hopes will allow him to retain sole control.It has also emerged that he is due to meet shortly with Stormont Ministers Sam Foster and Michael McGimpsey to discuss his plans for the race circuit.DUNDRUM ndash Sectarian vandals caused thousands of pounds worth of damage to Dundrum Gaelic Football Club during a weekend arson attack.A UVF slogan was brandished on the near-completed building before it was set alight on Saturday evening.Damage to the building, which it is estimated will cost the club thousands of pounds to repair, included broken windows and burnt door frames.The fire had gone out before the incident was uncovered shortly before am on Sunday.Police this week confirmed that the fire had been started ldquomaliciously but said they were keeping an open mind about the perpetrators who they believe may have been youths.Club secretary Jarlath Carey said the arson attack was unusual for the club.ldquoWe have good relations with other sporting groups in the town, he said. ldquoThere is a certain amount of cross-community co-operation and that makes this incident surprising.NEWCASTLE ndash Traders campaigning for specialist closed circuit security cameras to be installed in Newcastle have been told the initial bill alone could stretch to pound,.The startling figure was revealed to some of the townrsquos businessmen and women during a meeting of Newcastle Chamber of Commerce earlier this week.The group, which has been lobbying for the seven cameras to be set up along the resortrsquos Main Street, has priced the system but warned thatthe scheme does go ahead it will be some years down the line.The Chamber carried out a survey during the summer, asking traders and residentsthey thought the cameras would be a benefit to the town.Revealing that there was ldquo per cent support, for the system from respondents, the Chamberrsquos president Peter Law, told members that the installation of the cameras would ldquoinevitably reduce ious crimes which have a times given the town a reputation.CLOUGH ndash A mobile telecommunications company has announced its intention to erect a mobile telephone mast in Clough.BT Cellnet has this week advertised plans to erect a . metre mast at Watsonrsquos Garagein Clough, as well as a radio base station at the Downpatrick Telephone Exchange at Church Street.The proposals have led local anti-mast campaigners to urge communities to take action before the equipment is installed close to local houses and offices.Martine Fulcher, who helped form the group People Against Masts in Bryansford earlier this summer, this week said people should be made more aware of the potential health issues related to living near such masts.ldquoOnly when I went to a public meeting and heard somebody talk about the risks of these masks could I make an informed decision about not wanting them near my children and home.DOWNPATRICK ndash Senior officials from the Downpatrick Property Trust have detailed their plans for the regeneration of a number of derelict buildings in the town.During a special briefing session with local politicians last week, Trust officials spelt out their development plans for premises at English Street and at Breenrsquos Corner.They explained their plans will result in the provision of several new shops and a number of town centre apartments.The grouprsquos chairman, Mr Cecil Maxwell, said that since the Trust was established in , it has worked closely with both the Department of Environment and Down Council, to make both groups fully aware of its plans.A number of local councillors have recently been critical of the Trustrsquos plans to redevelop Breenrsquos Corner, suggesting that the building should instead be bulldozed to help improve town centre traffic flow by widening the Irish Street Market Street junction.But following last weekrsquos meeting they have accepted that bulldozing the building is not an option and that responsibility for addressing the townrsquos traffic chaos is a matter for the Roads Service.BALLYNAHINCH ndash The man spearheading the campaign for a Ballynahinch by-pass, has called for increased political pressure to drive the initiative forward.Mr Francis Casement said the congestion in the town is getting progressively worse and fearsthe by-pass is not addressed more urgently by politicians, traffic could grind to a halt.Over the past number of months, he has been working closely with regeneration officials and members of the townrsquos business community and a series of meetings have already been held in progress the issue.Stormont Minister Gregory Campbell visited the town last year to view the scale of the traffic problem at first hand, but Mr Casement says that since then, very little progress has been made.Mr Casement has suggested that children from local schools could be asked to get involved in a major cross-community project and carry out traffic surveys at all the main approach roads to the town.Mr Casement said while Ballynahinch struggles to make headway to secure the pound.m funding to build the new by-pass linking the townrsquos Newcastle and Belfast roads, development of a new poundm by-pass in Comber is only weeks away.KILLINCHY ndash Tourism officials have been given a sneak preview of a major new holiday complex which is set to provide the local economy with a major boost.The first of  purpose-built holiday cottages at Hazelwood Glen at Lisbane near Killinchy was publicly launched last week and has been given the thumbs up by both the tourist industry and local politicians.From next Easter, holidaymakers will be able to stay in the homes which have been furnished to a high standard and constructed to comply with five-star self-catering guidelines.Each comes with central heating, three ensuite bedrooms, log burning fire and all the usual equipment which people expect in modern accommodation.Outside, each cottage has its own barbecue, with  acres of newly landscaped park land providing the perfect back. A pitch and putt course also forms part of the development, in tandem with new tennis courts.A series of walkways have also been created throughout the development and running alongside them is a wildle pond and wildflower meadow.Holidaymakers also have a spectacular view over the international acclaimed Strangford Lough, which is less than a mile away.CASTLE ESPIE ndash Every year thousands of Brent geese complete an epic ,km journey from Canada to Strangford Lough, arriving in huge flocks in late autumn.Next Saturday and Sunday the National Trust and the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust, will host a series of Brentwatching for Beginners sessions at Castle Espie, so that members of the public can get a close look at one of the greatest spectacles of local wildle.Around , geese have arrived at Strangford Lough since the beginning of September and those figures look set to rise in the coming weeks.Although there will be thousands of Brent geese there should also be opportunities to see other species of wildfowl and waders such as dunlin, knot, curlew and oyster-catcher..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29September2021-Full.jpg","title":"Full steam ahead at railway  ","story":"AFTER an absence of over  months, the first train of the Downpatrick and County Down Railwaysnaked its way through the countryside out to Inch Abbey.Itrsquos not full steam yet however for the transport charity, as the runs were for driver re-familiarisation following a long period in mothballs.Railway chairman Robert Gardiner said: ldquoWhilst wersquove been keeping our locomotives and railcars ticking over at regular intervals to keep them in good order, we need to do a few refreshers to get people back in the swing of operating them.He explained that throughout the lockdown period, DCDR had been carrying out signicant work on the track between Downpatrick and Inch Abbey, which has seen every joint unbolted and lubricated, rails changed, signage erected, and track geometry improved in anticipation of reopening.Mr Gardiner continued: ldquoThe first train out of the gates for nearly two years was former NIR  Class railcar, with a number of runs along our Inch Abbey line took place through the sunny Sunday afternoon as drivers Norman and Mike reacquainting themselves with the controls of this classic diesel railcar, familiar to many who used to commute to work from the mid s onwards, and as the Coffee Carriages parked at Inch Abbey.ldquoBoth railcar and drivers performed brilliantly.

That being said, it is no wonder that our rural communities may feel isolated from our bigger towns and cities, where investment and opportunities are more obvious.Rural isolation is closer to all of us than we realise exploring this topic brought to light my own childhood memories of growing up in the countryside.While I loved my upbringing, I hadnrsquot considered how it was impacted by the fact that I grew up in a rural area. It was through exploring the topic of rural isolation that I realised the social effects it can have on our youth.My own children are growing up in the countryside as well and I can now see how this may impact them socially they are not playing with friends in the evenings like many would in housing developments and built up areas.They are playing with each other in their own garden, similar to my own experience. While I donrsquot think this is a negative thing for my children, due to the volume of social groups and clubs that they participate in, I am now consciously taking opportunities to expose them to a wider iety of social situations, so they do not feel the potential effects of rural isolation.It is clear to see the effects of rural isolation when just recently at a meeting with Translink, the cutting of rural bus routes and services was brought to light. This is another slap in the face to those living in rural areas without access to their own vehicle, especially when considering the climate crisis.I and my fellow councillors and party colleagues are encouraging constituents to use active travel and public transport.Meanwhile, those exact services are being cut removing the option for active travel. This is not good enough.I have conducted a range of investigative meetings to see how groups and organisations within South Down in particular are taking action to prevent rural isolation.I recently met with Nicholas McCrickard, manager of Co Down Rural Community Network, an organisation crucial in combatting rural isolation in South Down as itrsquos an umbrella body set up and managed by community groups in the area for more than  years.The aim of the organisation is to create an inclusive future where all citizens actively participate in local le which stimulates a vibrant society.Nicholas and his team, with the support of community groups, ensure regular outreach to all of the citizens in the area so that they can enhance their own lives through participation with ious organisations. This stimulation is a sure-fire way to combat rural isolation, but the resources need to be available to ensure no one is left behind.I recently visited the offices of Good Morning Down in Downpatrick mdash another vital service many in our community rely on. It is an organisation which regularly makes telephone calls to those facing isolation for a iety of reasons. These calls are a method of friendship building between volunteers and residents of a wide iety of ages.The youngest volunteer in Good Morning Down is in their late s, while the eldest is in their late s. Nearly  years worth of knowledge and experience will be exchanged through these conversations and I walked away from this meeting, feeling truly touched by the dedication of the staff and volunteers.In addition, having met with Womenrsquos Aid in recent days, fresh in my mind are the stories of the impact that living in a rural setting has on many women who are isolated from much of society.Not having that friendly neighbour close by can impact the severity of abusive relationships. Thankfully, we have organisations such as Womenrsquos Aid who recognise this and work every day with women in these situations, but funding, resourcing and legislation is always an issue.These are only a few of the fantastic initiatives that offer support to those in rural communities, however, there are many who are unaware of their operation.I would like to raise awareness of the services available to our rural constituents, to promote inclusivity and encourage a positive approach to mental health and wellbeing. It is extremely important to raise awareness and encourage our rural communities to stop and think about their mental health and to consider how rural isolation may affect them.I would encourage our rural communities to take time out to improve their mental health, normalise discussion around issues of isolation and avail of local mental health services.It is time that Newry, Mourne and Down Council took responsibility and recognise the vital work local groups within our community do for the residents of our district and remember that ratepayers donrsquot just live in our major towns like Downpatrick, but also in rural areas such as the wider Lecale countryside.There needs to be a serious refocusing on service provision in rural areas and a renewed approach to capital investment. We need to stand up for the safety of our rural communities, and protect them from the effects of isolation. Rural communities cannot continue to be left behind..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29September2021-Horse.jpg","title":"Horse show fundraiser for Uganda  ","story":"THE organisers of Saintfield Horse Show handed over a cheque for pound, at a reception at Temple Golf and Country Club last Thursday evening.The money was raised at the show which was held at Danescroft Equestrian Centre, near Lisburn, on Saturday, August .Last year money raised from the horse show and the Saintfield Christmas Charity Ride provided a borehole for a village in Uganda, giving the community fresh, clean water.Show director Joan Cunningham said: ldquoNow wersquore committed to continue making a massive dference by providing a maize milling machine which will enable the farmers to process their crops for food.

Therefore there wouldnrsquot be much point providing floating wheelchairsthe council did not have the facilities for these people to get into or access these wheelchairs.Independent councillor Jarlath Tinnelly said that the beach access issue had been raised with him throughout the summer and he called for other beaches to be included in the pilot.He said his only concern with the motion would be thata pilot project was being proposed, the councilrsquos blue flag beaches at Tyrella and Cranfield should be considered.ldquoThe experience of wheelchair users to get on to the beach and enjoy that same thrill is a priority and we should be doing whatever we can to facilitate that, he said.ldquoThese floating wheelchairs can be taken into the water and allow people to enjoy the same experiences as everybody , things that are taken for granted.The motion to improve beach access was initially tabled in August and was inspired by the campaigning work of local activist, Naomi Herron, who approached all her local councillors askingsomething could be done to give her better access to the beach.At the time, Cllr Brown said he understood that while a small scale trial of the idea has operated in Cranfield in the past, it was important that this was expanded out into other parts of the district and that he could ldquothink of no better place than Newcastle given the large number of visitors it gets every year.He continued: ldquoAs a council, it is important that we ensure all facilities are open and accessible to all residents.

Part of the modern failure is because the Scots Irish blended so effortlessly into the dominant culture that they often became Americans, without a prefix, and their impact waned, whereas the much later Catholic Irish and Italians felt somewhat on the outside for the better part of a centuryand retained their European identity.Latterly this has changed markedly and now people of Catholic Irish descent are prominent everywhere, from the US Supreme Court to both the Biden and Trump presidencies.   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...There is already a Northern Ireland Bureau in Washington DC but it must be neutral between unionists and nationalists. Unionist lobbyists would not be so constrainedIn living memory there was rarely more than one Catholic at any one time on America’s most powerful court of nine judges. Now they form a majority of the justices.The phrase Scots Irish was for a long time partly used as a code for saying non Catholic Irish.While the Ulster influence was large in the early United States, and massively so proportionate to the small population of Ulster itself, it was still under % of the population. The influence of German and English Protestants was much greater.You see this in early Belfast News Letters from the mid s, with ads for some boats sailing from Ulster to America, but reports of far larger numbers of departures from England and northern Europe But the millions of English and Germans were so dominant that they lost most of their European identity and became mainstream Americans. To a signicant extent the Scots Irish did too.Even so, unionist influence in shaping Washington’s view of Northern Ireland ought to be easily as great as that ofIrish America. In  I was on a trip to America with a number of journalists from both sides of the Irish border, only two of us from a northern Protestant background. We travelled to Kentucky and met Senator Mitch McConnell, already then one of the most powerful Republican Party politicians in the land . He asked us all where we were from, before telling us: “I’m from Banbridge.”Not only do many of these politicians have such Scots Irish roots, American conservatives generally have seen Britain as a trusted ally of the US for more than a century.On the other hand, Eirewas neutral in the war against Hitler, something that was remembered in the American corridors of power after .Few such US leaders think about Ireland in that way now, but they are aware that the UK has fought on the same side as America in recent conflicts such as the  Gulf War. Even Joe Biden, who unionists fear is anti British, strongly backed the UK in the  Falklands War .The UK and US often side together in the UN security council.This week the ex Ulster Unionist leader and submarine commander Steve Aiken wrote about the Aukus defence deal between Britain, America and Australia, and how it reflected a US understanding of the UK as a key security partner .Yet for all this shared history, unionist influence is negligible compared to Irish America.Not only have US congressional politicians scolded and threatened London over Brexit and any possible UK deviation from the Northern Ireland Protocol, they have — incredibly — scolded it on the legacy of the NI Troubles too.A nation that has been phobic about terror post September   is lecturing the UK for supposedly covering up its notably mild response to decades of IRA terrorism.Part of the failure to combat a Sinn Fein version of our past is rooted in a British Foreign Office mindset, that has little sympathy for Ulster Unionism and little inclination to defend it abroad.Part of the UK reticence in defending itself from American criticism of Brexit’s impact in Northern Ireland is rooted in its own paradoxical approach to the Irish Sea border .But much of the problem of unionist invisibility is due to the fact that there is a vast, well connected, strongly motivated Irish American caucus whereas unionism lacks the bandwidth to lobby in Washington.Recently we ran a letter from the Ireland Israel Alliance on how the Republic is now one of the west’s most anti Israel nations.Why do we not have British diplomats and unionist politicians hammering this home to pro-Israel America at every opportunity If a wealthy benefactor was to sponsor even two well-informed, permanent unionist lobbyists, they could make great headway in DC.One of the first things such lobbyists could do is make connections with the influential American Israel Public Affairs Committeelobby group and emphasise Irish hostility to Israel.There is so much  that unionist lobbyists could work on, above all building bridges with influential American conservatives.This is lobbying that the Northern Ireland Bureau in Washington could never do, being neutral between nationalists and unionists. Even that natural diplomat, Trevor Ringland, is restricted in his role as a part-time NI envoy to the US.Unionist lobbyists could, and would have to, go much further.• Ben Lowry: A belated happy th birthday to ourselves at the News Letter!• Ben Lowry is News Letter acting editor——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityWhile not a great deal is known about the history of the village, there are signs of early occupation in the form of a Bronze Age flint tool and cooking mounds that have been discovered. The name of Bonvilston or Tresimwn dates back to the th century when the Norman lord Simon de Bonville was granted the manor by Robert Fitzhamon, Lord of Glamorgan and he constructed a ringwork castle as added protection for the castles at Dinas Powys and Sully.There are also references to monks being at Bonvilston and in a papal bull which is a public decree or charter issued by the Pope, a grange was mentioned in .When the parish became part of the Cottrell Estate, the last resident of Cottrell House was Mackintosh of Mackintosh from Moy in Scotland who was married to Lady Maud Cavendish. In  she donated the reading room for the male population of the village to learn to read, but it wasnrsquot until  that women were allowed in.At the end of the th century the Bassett family owned the estate and the family lived at Bonvilston House for more than  years. The house passed on through more famous names like Tudor Crawshay, the grandson of the well-known Ironmaster William Crawshay and then into the Brains brewery family. Although the house was demolished in  the lodge still remains.Gathering at Maes-y-Ffynon, which was built between  and  the group followed the bridleway at the far end of the road and walking between green hedges arrived at the busy lane which leads to Pendoylan. Crossing the lane and a stile a superb view opened out in front of them across a newly cropped field. Continuing downhill through a sheep-filled field and over the next stile they spotted two donkeys in the field, one of which looked very near to giving birth!At the bottom of the field a holly hedge was very carefully negotiated in order to enter a beautul garden belonging to Trehedyn House in the tiny hamlet of Tyrsquon y Pwll, said to be the birthplace of the Welsh hymn writer Thomas Williams, who later moved to Llantwit Major and in  built the Bethesda Chapel there.     Making their way through beautul meadows, they arrived at Lanlay Meadows in Peterston-super-Ely, which are owned by the National Trust. This quiet rural area has been farmed for centuries and the land is untouched by fertilisers, the hedges are left untrimmed, with its twisted oaks the area is rich in animal and plant le and forms part of the Ely Valley Site of Special Scientic Interest.A fairly rare plant Monkshood or Wolfsbane, which also has a number of other names, grows along the riverside and the whole plant, especially the root, is poisonous. The lovely orchard in the meadows provided the group with a great place to enjoy their morning refreshment in the increasingly warm sunshine, before backtracking slightly to follow a grassy path to the river which twists and turns its way along the northern edge of the meadows.Joining part of the Valeways Millennium Heritage Trail and following the river with its bends, nooks and crannies, an unmarked path led them through some rough, muddy ground. Then passing through fields whilst being preceded by a large herd of cattle, they exited just below the village of Pendoylan.Following a surprisingly busy road to re-enter fields on their journey to Caer Wigau Isaf, this th century Tudor manor house is Grade II listed and after a pause to admire the stunning stone and brick-work of the many buildings, they carried on through a small wooded area for the climb up to Lillypot Farm, where the fertile land was acquired by the Bonvillersquos in the th century.Climbing up through meadows they stopped for lunch at the base of their last climb whilst drinking in the stunning views across the Ely Valley. Then continuing their climb, at Lillypot Farm they were greeted by a lovely chestnut pony who was very friendly and eager to have his photo taken with them, before descending through fields near to the defensive ringwork of Y Gaer, an oval enclosure defended by a bank and ditch.Following a path bounded by gardens they arrived back at the extremely busy A to pass through the grounds of St Mary the Virgin Church, which dates from Norman times, but was rebuilt by the Victorians in  and only the tower and chancel arch remain of the original church, before ing to their start point.You can follow the grouprsquos exploits at penarthramblers.wordpress or Facebook article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Northern Ireland has experienced a .% increase in average rental values this year[]. With the price increase, OFTEC, representing the liquid fuel industry in Ireland, is concerned that students may take cheaper accommodation options without properly inspecting the property. With this in mind, OFTEC has issued advise to help students ensure their accommodation is safe before they sign the dotted line. Raise the alarm – Currently, it is not a mandatory requirement for private landlords to provide smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, but the HSENI recommend that they do. It is a legal requirement to fit a carbon monoxide detector when a fossil fuel appliance has been replaced. Carbon monoxide is potentially lethal as it has no smell, taste or colour. Without a working alarm, it is impossible to identy carbon monoxide leaks. OFTEC’s advise is to ensure that there are working fire and CO alarms in the property, and that they are tested on a regular basis.Heating requirements - The Health  Safety Executive recommend that all boilers should be serviced annually and tenants should ask for evidence of recent servicing. If you have concerns, ask for a CD  Landlord Oil Installation Check which is carried out by an OFTEC registered technician and will give you peace of mind. For a gas heated property, ask for a copy of the annual gas safety check.Look for damp – It is easy to hide damp patches with a coat of paint, soyour house smells musty or you see evidence of mould, find out how the landlord is planning to fix the problem. Mould has no place in the home as it can cause respiratory problems and headaches.Furniture and fittings – Ask the landlord for a list of everything that is included and make note of any damage that is there before you move it. Check any beds, sofas and chairs are in good condition.Secure your home – burglars may target student areas because of lax security. Ask your landlord to fit key operating locks on the windows and lever deadlocks on external doors.  OFTEC Ireland Manager, David Blevings, said: “Quite often the excitement of moving in with friends can overshadow the concerns about the accommodation itself. We are urging students to play it safe this year and carry out these essential checks before signing a lease and moving in. “Asking a landlord about safety may seem awkward, but it could prevent you from living in a potentially dangerous property for the next  months. It’s vital that your new home is not a burden as you start your time at university.
