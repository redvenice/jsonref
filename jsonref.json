There are more risks for you and your pregnancy if you contract Covid-19 without the vaccine, and the flu vaccine will also help protect your unborn baby.If you catch flu when pregnant, you\u0027re at risk from complications such as bronchitis and it could cause your baby to be born prematurely, have a low birth weight and may even lead to stillbirth.If you are pregnant, you can get a free flu vaccine from your GP, pharmacist or through your maternity service.  ◼ To check your eligibility for the flu vaccine and Covid-19 booster vaccine or to find a service, visit nhs.ukwintervaccinations ■ This article is part of a paid-for partnership with the UK Government"},{"url":null,"title":"Meghan Markle barred presidency 211 year old amendment Constitution","story":"Share this article \u0027Britain has a very strong tradition of keeping royals out of politics and so this is perhaps more intrusive than anything a royal would dare to do in Britain.\u0027Meeting with senators to lobby for a bill - this is her injecting herself into US politics.\u0027The Duchess is currently eligible to run as a US-born citizen.    Acid-penned Mr Bower, who reportedly agreed a six figure sum to tell the pregnant Duchess\u0027s story earlier this year, said she is \u0027likely\u0027 to launch a US presidential campaign but would \u0027struggle\u0027 with the barrage of criticism levelled at politicians because she is \u0027sensitive\u0027. "},{"url":null,"title":"Experts tell Brits order turkey infections summer cases low","story":"Share this articleShare this article Looming lockdowns weighed on a range of financial market sectors on Friday, pushing stocks and oil down and boosting the dollar.\u0027We expect targeted measures (against COVID-19) across some countries mainly according to the health situation, but other factors, such as domestic political situations, will be relevant,\u0027 Oxford Economics analysts said in a note.\u0027And while it might take a while before a political consensus can be reached in other countries, it is clear that the tide has turned.\u0027 As cases rise again, a number of European governments have started to reimpose limits on activity, ranging from Austria\u0027s full lockdown to a partial lockdown in the Netherlands and restrictions on the unvaccinated in parts of Germany, the Czech Republic and Slovakia.Niels Van Regenmortel, the intensive care units coordinator at the ZNA Stuivenberg hospital in Antwerp, said there was an increasing risk hospitals in Belgium will have to resort to triage as ICUs fill up amid soaring COVID-19 numbers, calling on the government to restrict night life. Whether or not countries opt to lock down again depends on a wide range of factors, including vaccination rates, mask mandates and the extent to which booster shots are being made available.Germany has said further measures will be decided based on when hospitalisation rates hit certain thresholds, while Friday saw its first states - Saxony and Bavaria - cancel all their Christmas markets.The Bavarian state capital of Munich on Tuesday had become the first major German city to cancel its Christmas market for the second year in a row. Saxony\u0027s cancellations means the famed Dresden Christmas market is also scrapped. Germany hosts some 2,500 Christmas markets each year, cherished by visitors who come to savour mulled wine and roasted chestnuts, and shop for seasonal trinkets among clusters of wooden chalets.In pre-pandemic times, they drew about 160 million domestic and international visitors annually who brought in revenues of three to five billion euros ($3.4 billion to $5.6 billion), according to the BSM stallkeepers\u0027 industry association.In France, President Emmanuel Macron has made it clear he thinks high levels of vaccinations should be enough to avoid future lockdowns.Britain, with higher numbers of infections than most countries in Europe, is rolling out third shots - or boosters - to offset waning protection from the first two and help keep the economy open. While the new measures across Europe are not seen hitting the economy as much as the all-out lockdowns of last year, analysts say they could weigh on the recovery in the last quarter, especially if they hurt the retail and hospitality sectors over Christmas.A full lockdown in Germany would be more serious, however.\u0027With Germany... imposing new restrictions, any thoughts that the vaccines would offer a way to a more normal Christmas period appear to have gone up in smoke for now, in Europe at least,\u0027 said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK.\u0027Although there is a nagging fear this could ripple out across the region.\u0027 The pressure on intensive care units in Germany has not yet reached its peak, Spahn said, urging people to reduce contacts to help break the wave. \u0027How Christmas will turn out, I dare not say. I can only say it\u0027s up to us,\u0027 he added.Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Thursday Germany will limit large parts of public life in areas where hospitals are becoming dangerously full of COVID-19 patients to those who have either been vaccinated or have recovered from the illness.\u0027It\u0027s clear from our experience in England and from what\u0027s happening across Europe that while vaccines do a lot of the heavy lifting ... other interventions are required to prevent case numbers rising,\u0027 said Lawrence Young, virologist and professor of molecular oncology at the University of Warwick.\u0027Less mask wearing, more mixing indoors due to colder weather and waning immunity are also contributing to the high case levels across Europe.\u0027  Sweden, meanwhile, has the lowest Covid infection rate in western Europe — after double-vaccinated nationals were told they don\u0027t have to test for the virus even if they get symptoms.The Scandinavian nation — which was subject to international scrutiny last year when it refused to lockdown — is currently recording 85.4 cases per million people, according to Oxford University research site Our World in Data.By comparison, the rate is nearly 1,400 per million in Europe\u0027s current Covid capital Austria, which today announced it is going back into a full lockdown from Monday.Sweden\u0027s infection rate is far lower than other Western European countries like the Netherlands (1,048.7), Britain (581), Germany (536), and France (201). And for the first time in the pandemic, Sweden is recording fewer cases per population size than its Scandinavian neighbours Denmark (655), Norway (351) and Finland (150).But critics say Sweden has been left \u0027in the dark\u0027 over the true extent of its coronavirus wave because the double-vaccinated, equivalent to almost seven in ten people, are not being routinely swabbed.Last week, Sweden broke ranks with its European neighbours once again and told Swedes they did not have to get tested if they were fully jabbed, even if they had symptoms. Covid swabbing rates plunged 35 per cent last week, compared to a month earlier. But this week the policy was reversed in response to rising cases on the continent. A fresh wave of Delta is rolling across the continent and putting pressure on hospitals once again, which has forced most in the EU to bring back some form of curbs.Latest figures show Sweden is only carrying out 1.26 tests per 1,000 people, which is also the lowest number in western Europe.The threat of fresh lockdowns comes as optimism grows about experimental drugs developed by Pfizer and Merck that cut the chance of hospitalisation and severe illness, more weapons in the world\u0027s fight against the virus.On Friday, the EU drug regulator said it was reviewing data on Pfizer\u0027s COVID-19 pill to help member states decide on quick adoption ahead of any formal EU-wide approval. Slovakia has also seen a surge in infections, with 9,171 reported on Friday, its biggest daily tally since the pandemic began. The country of 5.5 million earlier in the week tightened restrictions on people who have not had COVID-19 shotsWith a seven-day incidence of 11,500 new cases per million inhabitants, the country has the worst reported epidemic situation in the world, according to Our World in Data statistics."},{"url":null,"title":"Princess Mako seen stepping NYC time moving US","story":"Share this article He met Mako in 2013 when they were both studying at the International Christian University outside Tokyo. His proposal propelled him to the front page of Japanese newspapers - his only previous claim to fame had come from being named Prince of the Sea to lead a tourism campaign in the coastal town of Fujisawa.The couple, both now 30, got \u0027unofficially engaged\u0027 in 2017, and planned to tie the knot in November 2018.Initially the news was greeted with delight in Japan, but then a scandal grew up when it was discovered that Kayo had not repaid a 4million yen ($35,000) loan from a former fiancé, partly to pay her son\u0027s tuition. That led critics to suggest Komuro was only marrying the princess for money or fame.

Those same expectations cannot be met forever. Illustration: iStock“The ability to find quick and clever ways to overcome difficulties.” “Being able to deal creatively and effectively with problems.” “The quality of being good at finding ways of solving problems.” These are just some of the ways of defining the “something” our students are lacking: resourcefulness. After three decades of teaching I find students are less resourceful now than they have ever been. Covid’s role in this is limited, so let’s park that chestnut and look at the bigger – and more worrying – picture, the picture that both predates Covid and will also long outlive it.How we provide for students with special educational needs sends a message to all our students. They can be hawk-eyed when it suits them and they absorb every detail of how work is set, distributed, differentiated and adapted. They acquire ways of responding to the challenges they meet. Just the thing for students on the lookout for opportunities to offload work they find onerous.At their age, being fully informed of all the details is irrelevant – what they see is that Billy or Bob gets an “easier” option, and they simply want that too. As adults. it is our job to ensure that all adjustments and accommodations are granted in accordance with the guidelines, and that each student is offered their own best shot at optimal learning and maximum achievement.Across the board in Irish education, policies are very clear on our responsibility as teachers to provide for and accommodate all of the students in our care, whatever their particular needs.Nothing less would make sense, and yet once class size, teacher to pupil ratio and the number of teaching hours per week are factored in, we must question how effectively any teacher can deliver this for every single student.The goals and targets set for those with special educational needs will of course be adapted, and appropriately qualified additional teachers will be allocated time with those students. This in itself creates extra demands on teachers. Communication between the mainstream and special education teachers requires time, which is a good deal harder to come by in our profession than anyone outside it realises.What if the increased demand on adults as a result of resource provision means the student is ultimately less rather than more resourceful? What if we risk conveying the message that we can outsource our challenges?With this in mind what we communicate to our students – all of them – about how to respond to challenges urgently needs reassessing. Current policies lack emphasis on the student’s own role and responsibility towards learning.Parental guidance and support is crucial to youngsters, and provision needs to be made in policies for how parents can consciously engage in dialogue with their children about learning.Much of this work involves students recognising when they are working at their peak so that they can develop a hunger for it. Experiencing the delight that comes with rewards and success is what helps them along the way. This is how we allow them the time and space required to navigate their own path to a very particular sweet spot in the learning experience: the feeling of real achievement. The kind that involves bumps in the road and a need to overcome obstacles. Exactly the kind of experience which I believe many students are denied. It is all too easy for them to get off to a poor start in a subject and then write it off forever. Appropriately scaffolded work combined with the right doses of motivation works wonders and can lead a student down a very different road. Making it about what they already know and have already accomplished is vital. If we only focus on the gaps we nourish self-doubt, and the student’s inner self-saboteur soon takes centre stage. And with that their capacity to be resourceful dwindles rapidly.A student who gets the message that they need to be relieved of a particular learning burden will inevitably relax the corresponding learning muscle. Right now, based on what our current system values, decisions are taken to avoid unnecessarily overloading or discouraging the student.When we value academic performance above and beyond all else, we have no choice but to protect a student from inevitable failure. Essentially, that is what we do when we lower the bar and make allowances. I’m not against this in principle, but what concerns me is that those allowances will not necessarily be made throughout their lives.We create certain expectations in our students when we adjust what is required of them. Those same expectations cannot be met forever, and for that reason I would argue that we would better serve our students by making fewer allowances, especially in the early years. Let’s think bigger and outside the box, and place the emphasis in such a way that pupils experience learning without pressure for longer. We could leave them free to develop a broader range of learning muscles before putting any of them to the test. We could monitor more, and report less.Young people imitate what they see. They model their behaviour on that of others. What we make possible for them and what we ourselves do are both influential here. We who are in roles that youngsters observe need to ensure that they recognise challenges as the massive opportunities they so often are. It is important to convey the language of motivation and excitement rather than discouragement and anxiety. This is what leads young people towards finding new ways and being creative. They get to exercise their problem-solving muscle and learn as they go.Resourcefulness is most definitely an inside job, so let’s not encourage our students to outsource it."},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Michael Viney: Scientists fear key attitudes may change if climate change worsensStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus business supports may be extended in event of closures","story":"Chief Medical Officer Dr Tony Holohan: said that 20 to 25 people will end up in hospital for every 1,000 coronavirus cases.

It’s understood that the initial proposal envisaged rolling out the programme through pharmacies first, before other retailers, with a discount of around €4 per test across the board, but this was still under discussion late in the evening with no agreement reached.While the EWSS is to last until April, it is to close to new entrants at the end of the year.The top two rates of €350 per week and €300 per week are to go in December, with €203 per week the most an employer can get per staff member from then.New entrantsThe  understands that the option of allowing new entrants to the EWSS beyond the current cut-off date if there are renewed closures is on the table, as is extending the system of Covid Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS) payments into the new year.While such options remain a possibility, the Government is not conceding that fresh closures will be necessary.There was said to have been a general discussion on business supports at the subcommittee meeting on Monday evening and no decisions have been taken.Sources said the options to be examined are only in the event that businesses have to shut their doors and indicated that the Government will seek to avoid that scenario.The situation will be kept under review – with advice from the National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) to be taken into account.The Department of Health on Monday night reported a further 5,634 Covid-19 cases, a figure described by the State’s chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan as a “concerning number”. Since June, one in four people with Covid-19 who required critical care died, he said.Different positionOne source pointed out that the country is in a much different position than when previous lockdowns were imposed given the extent of the vaccination programme and the rollout of booster shots.Earlier Taoiseach Micheál Martin told reporters in Cork that the number of cases of Covid-19 can be reduced without having to go into a lockdown.He said the Government has other options and responses to help tackle rising case numbers.Mr Martin said he believes pressure on the health service can be reduced, adding that the booster campaign will “have an impact”.“We can reduce the spread of this virus,” he added.Setting out the future impact on the health system from the rising number of infections, Dr Holohan said in a statement that 20 to 25 people will end up in hospital for every 1,000 coronavirus cases, while between two and three people will require critical care in intensive care units.“This information is not easy to hear but it is an important reminder of the serious risk that Covid-19 continues to pose to all of us,” Dr Holohan said.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Officials claim West wants to \u0026lsquoGermanise\u0026rsquo and instil special identity in strategic regionNato monitors heavily armed Kaliningrad as locals long for borders to reopenAttack on renowned Memorial rights group deepens opposition anger and international alarmSaint Petersburg Letter: Russia\u0026rsquos old imperial capital celebrates 200 years since birth of Crime and Punishment creatorEnergy giant hopes vast forests will offset carbon costs and ease green transitionCircassian heritage trampled and property rows continue as Winter Olympics city boomsKremlin criticised as most Russians reject vaccination and hospitals face huge strainKremlin changes tack on global warming and looks to vast forests to offset emissionsRussia and Japan co-operate on Sakhalin despite row over nearby Kuril islandsIndustry and struggling communities fear wildlife support could stifle Far East developmentCity with echoes of San Francisco is thrillingly original, yet tarnished by graft and neglectGrowing energy, security and diplomatic links between Moscow and Beijing worry WestDecembrist rebels and their aristocratic wives embraced \u0026lsquoreal Russia\u0026rsquo in Siberian exileFears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo roleInside Russia: More protests planned as officials reject calls to address e-voting complaintsMoscow Letter: Poet\u0026rsquos statue has been a magnet for generations of Russian dissenters"},{"url":null,"title":"often called p told go home also discovered gentle face","story":"The past may be a foreign country but it cannot be as brushed aside, as Azeem Rafiq has discovered. Having given harrowing testimony of the racism he has suffered he has been forced to apologise for his anti-Semitic comments made more than a decade ago. Nevertheless, Rafiq’s testimony to the DCMS still stands and struck many chords with me. Although I am a ‘Midnight’s Child’, born just as India became free, I was not brought up to hate England, but to value its goodness. My father insisted that we had an English car which he believed was far superior to Japanese rubbish and would never fail to start in the morning. He also believed that the English had superior moral standards. One of his favourite stories was about the abdication crisis. Whatever happens, he used to say, no orced woman will be allowed to become Queen of England. In 1961, when the Queen made her first visit to India, my mother took my sisters and me to wave to her as her motorcade passed by. Soon after I arrived in January 1969 to study engineering at Loughborough, however, I realised my colour made me an alien. I was often called a ‘P---’ and told to ‘go home’. It was just nine months after Enoch Powell’s rivers of blood speech. Nothing had prepared me for this hard, racist face of England.Just as Michael Vaughan is alleged to have talked to Rafiq about ‘you lot’, referring to the Asians in the team, an allegation Vaughan vehemently denies, the senior partner of the London accountancy firm where I qualified to be a chartered accountant made his views on ‘you lot of Indians’ clear on the very day he hired me. ‘I hope you will live in an area where there are not too many Indians. The trouble with Indians is that they tend to congregate together.’  My problem was that I didn’t find it easy to get away from the ‘Indian lot’. While I would have very friendly telephone conversations with landladies about renting flats, the moment I rang the doorbell and they saw me, they would invariably say, ‘I am sorry, I have just let the flat.’ After many such rejections, I decided to warn them on the telephone that I was from India. One day I saw an attractive advertisement about a place in Hampstead. After the landlady said she would be delighted for me to come over, I said, ‘Oh, by the way, I am an Indian.’ For a few seconds there was silence and then she said, ‘I am dreadfully sorry, but my husband would not like that.’Over time, many friendly white people reached out to me and I discovered that the kind, sweet, gentle, face of England that I had read about in India did exist. But when I returned to London after a stay in India in the late 1970s, I found that my skin colour could also mean physical danger. One Friday evening in 1980 I was travelling home from The Sunday Times on the Central Line when suddenly a skinhead let fly with his fist and floored me. As I scrabbled for my glasses, he got off the train with a laugh and the rest of the passengers looked away as if nothing had happened. After that, whenever I saw a skinhead, I crossed the road and, if they were in a group marching with a Union Jack, I hid in an alleyway. For several years, once it got dark, I did not take the underground, seeking instead the security of a taxi. But London cab drivers could not protect me from racist football fans when I reported matches. This was a time of very overt racism and, on match days, the National Front sold their magazine outside the grounds shouting, ‘Get your colour supplement.’ In March 1981, coming back from a Norwich match against Arsenal, an Arsenal fan chased me down the train shouting, ‘Coon, coon, hit the coon over the head with a baseball bat.’ It was then a popular football song. Fortunately, just as he caught up with me, I reached the first-class carriage where there was a policeman – a black woman. Six months later, returning from reporting a match between Nottingham Forest and Leeds, I felt I would not live to see another day. First, young boys, no more than 12 years old, taunted me. One of them pressed his face against the door of my compartment, flattening his nose against the glass in a racial ridicule. Another shouted Sieg Heil and started marching up and down the corridor. Then they entered the compartment. One of them asked me what I did. I told him I was a sports reporter. He retorted, ‘How do you know anything about football? P---s don\u0027t know anything about football, do they? Who do you work for?’‘Sunday Times,’ I said. ‘What\u0027s your name?’ asked another boy. When I told him he said, ‘What? Not Patel? All you P---s are called Patel. That is what the P--- who owns the corner shop is called. What do you think of the National Front?’ When I made no response he asked, ‘What do you think of Enoch Powell?’‘I understand he is a very fine Greek scholar.’ This reply seemed to throw them and for a few minutes silence reigned. Then they warned me that Chelsea supporters on the train were planning to attack me. Sure enough they came. They roughed me up but they could not decide who should be the first to work over ‘the wog’. By the time they made their minds up the train drew near St Pancras. Suddenly the cry went up: ‘Old Bill\u0027s coming.’ The Transport Police boarded the train and the fans fled. This did much to restore my faith in this country. But for five years after that I did not take a train, choosing to drive to football matches instead. I always arrived very early, often even before the stewards, so that I could park as near as possible to the ground. The best moment of the match was getting into my car and driving away knowing I could no longer be attacked. I also offered lifts to my white colleagues, hoping the presence of a white person next to me would provide more protection.The press box then was uniformly white indeed I hardly saw a non-white face in a football ground. At post-match press conferences, football managers would look hard at me as if wondering what a person of colour was doing there. It was a common belief then that Asians could not know anything about football. The popular joke was that if the Asians got a corner, they built a corner shop. Such remarks would have been unthinkable in the cricket press boxes of this country. Unlike football many of the journalists had old Raj ties, been to India and knew Indian cricket. Also, unlike now, when cricket at the county level is more uniformly white, English cricket was remarkably multi-racial with the great and the good of the game coming to hone their skills and advertise their ability. In Somerset Ian Botham’s greatest friend was Viv Richards and there was much talk in the press box about Imran Khan’s latest white girlfriend.The racial ide was whether England should resume playing cricket with apartheid South Africa. I spent many an evening travelling up and down the country debating with cricket followers why the ban on playing with apartheid South Africa should not be lifted. I was opposed by many cricket correspondents and administrators for whom the whites of South Africa were “kith and kin” and whose hospitality they had enjoyed when visiting the country. It was in pursuance of this story that I had my most memorable moment in journalism, a Sunday morning coffee with Nelson Mandela at his home in Soweto in June 1991. Mandela explained how he would use sport to reach out to the Afrikaners to create his rainbow nation which he did.And whatever racism existed, it did not ruin my dream of becoming a writer. The only job I ever got in India was through sheer nepotism thanks to my brother-in-law who was the senior partner of the country’s leading accountancy firm. When I tried for a broadcasting gig, the man who then ran sport at All India Radio asked me to get perfumes for his wife from Harrods. In contrast, doors opened in this country from the Sunday Times, Daily , where I worked for 12 happy years, to the BBC, without anyone ever asking me for a gift. Such bribery is unthinkable in this country.I treasure the gentle English face where everyone always says ‘sorry’ and has a deeply ingrained sense of justice. I voluntarily chose to live here, sacrificing greater wealth in India as a chartered accountant, to become a writer. But for my daughter’s generation it is different. As my daughter puts it, “This is our home. We don’t have another home. We should be treated like everybody else.”The challenge posed by the testimony given to the DCMS is how English cricket and society measures up to their expectations.:: Mihir Bose’s Dreaming the Impossible: Creating a Non-Racial Sports World will be published next year by Birlinn.  More from NewsWant to stay young?

As record-breaking numbers of illegal migrants cross the English Channel by boat, a scandalous revelation now gnaws at the public: despite the Vote Leave vow to “take back control” of immigration, Britain apparently cannot even police its borders. And yet, No 10 has already dismissed the option of returning boats to the French coast, known as a push back policy, as only feasible in the rarest circumstances, even though this is the one idea that is most likely to work. Senior Tories shrug that push backs are too controversial. They also sigh that, when it comes to risking renegade status on the world stage, all the Government’s capital is being expended in tussles with the EU over the Northern Ireland Protocol.Plan B is for the Home Office to try and deter migrants by processing them offshore. Yet the pioneers of this approach, Australia, figured out as far back as 2014 that detention camps in the Pacific have no impact whatsoever on illegal crossings. It has been quietly winding down the policy ever since, and last month announced the closure of its notorious Papua New Guinea camp. In contrast, the country’s push-backs have proved so successful that some have called for a policy shift to focus exclusively on patrol tactics.For the UK, offshore processing would not only be fruitless, but politically sticky. Such a policy can do little to take the heat off the Tories in the short term, as it will take months or even years to implement. The Home Office is still casting around desperately for a country willing to take part. If the UK finally finds a partner, it can expect exactly the kind of humanitarian uproar that the PM fears push backs would trigger. The UN and the ICC have long blasted Australia for its “cruel, inhuman” and “unlawful” treatment of migrants.The Tories should then look again seriously at push backs. Of course, they should never be carried out in a way that endangers migrants’ lives. Nor should British border guards ever hesitate to assist a migrant boat that is in imminent danger. Nonetheless, it should be possible to implement push back operations on a greater scale than is currently envisaged by No 10. Britain has a moral duty as well as a sovereign interest in taking strong action to deter boat crossings: more than 300 have died on the Channel route, whether by land or sea, since 1999, and as boats replace lorries as the preferred means of travel, we might expect the number of drownings to rise dramatically.The UK should then urgently pursue bilateral cooperation with Emmanuel Macron to stop boats as close to the French coast as possible and to guide them, safely and smoothly, back to port. The big question is what the French President’s price might be. Financial incentives are unlikely to fly, not least as Britain has already given Paris millions to police properly the Calais border to little effect more valuable to Macron is something he can sell to his electorate. Why not throw a curveball and offer for Britain to take a greater share of asylum seekers clogging the French system via legal means, in exchange? In the year ending March 2021, the UK received 26,903 asylum applications, whereas France had 93,475. Even backbench MPs who take a tough line on illegal crossings concede that the UK is not currently “taking its fair global share” of refugees.A push back campaign will be controversial, but it will not necessarily be as toxic as feared. No 10 would need to get on the front foot by busting liberal myths. Push backs are not illegal per se. Nor do they contravene search and rescue convention, as long as boats are directed to a “place of safety”. Some countries interpret lifeboats, which allow migrants to safely return from whence they came, as such a “place of safety”. Cooperation with the French would lend the UK even more legal cover it is extremely difficult to see how search and rescue rules have been broken if boats are guided to a “place of safety” in the form of French patrol vessels.Some have argued that in certain circumstances push backs may contravene some UN conventions, particularly if the migrants have reached British waters, but it is an open secret that these rules are already routinely tested by Western powers, not least by the EU. The latter’s attitude is particularly grotesque, as it virtue signals about incorruptible “freedom of movement”, while it turns a blind eye to dubious actions taken by overwhelmed countries on the fringes. While Greek coastguards are accused of stabbing refugee boats with hooks and firing into the water, reports abound of masked officers beating people back on the Croatian-Bosnian border.In contrast with the EU’s brutal border controls, the UK’s approach should be professional and transparent, emulating Australian best practices. The latter has even developed “unsinkable” life vessels to transfer migrants onto, as smugglers resort to their latest despicable tactic of sabotaging or sinking boats, so that migrants are obliged to be “rescued”.A tough approach on the border might be softened politically by coinciding it with a winding down of the Home Office’s “hostile environment” policies. This would be in keeping with the pragmatic instincts of the PM, who has said he is open to an amnesty for some illegal migrants. The hostile environment policy has proved a dismal failure, with the number of voluntary departures by illegal migrants actually falling in recent years.The Home Office’s shift to a zero tolerance culture has not only allowed scope for absurd judgement errors like Windrush but distracted from the department’s institutional chaos. The Home Office blob has not bothered even to try and estimate the number of illegal immigrants since 2005. It is utterly unaccountable, with no infrastructure in place to track whether the immigration enforcement policies it spends £400 million on each year have any effect whatsoever.In other words, the Tories’ current approach is a noxious fusion of tokenistic cruelty and cowardly impotence. They must instead shift to a strategy that is both respectably humane and ruthlessly focused on doing what works. It won’t be easy, but Boris should take the gamble, instead of catastrophically folding so early.   More from NewsWant to stay young?

The agency said in the majority of cases, scammers had infiltrated the websites via a known vulnerability in Magento, a popular e-commerce software.Shoppers have been told they can protect themselves by being selective about where they shop online, not giving more information than is necessary and using secure third-party payment methods such as PayPal, Apple Pay and Google Pay.NCSC Deputy Director for Economy and Society Sarah Lyons said: “We want small and medium-sized online retailers to know how to prevent their sites being exploited by opportunistic cyber criminals over the peak shopping period.“Falling victim to cyber crime could leave you and your customers out of pocket and cause reputational damage.“It’s important to keep websites as secure as possible and I would urge all business owners to follow our guidance and make sure their software is up to date.” Since the pandemic, more and more high street businesses have been setting up websites to trade online.However, small businesses were warned that not keeping software up to date could allow hackers to steal customers data and damage their businesses reputation. Graham Wynn,  the British Retail Consortium Assistant Director for Consumer, Competition and Regulatory Affairs added: “Skimming and other cyber security breaches are a threat to all retailers.“The British Retail Consortium strongly urges all retailers to follow the NCSC’s advice and check their preparedness for any cyber issues that could arise during the busy end of year period.“The Cyber Resilience Toolkit for Retail, produced in partnership with NCSC, is available on the British Retail Consortium’s website for retailers to consult and boost cyber defences.”More from NewsWant to stay young?

As well as enforcing a new month-long lockdown, the chancellor announced that, from February next year, Austria would become the first European country to make vaccination compulsory.The rationale behind Schallenberg’s decision is that ongoing vaccine hesitancy is thought to be one of the driving forces behind the country’s recent sharp rise in cases. Austria has one of the lowest vaccination rates in Western Europe only 65.7 per cent of the population are fully jabbed, a rate lower than the UK (68.7 per cent), France, Italy, Portugal and Germany.According to Andreas Bergthaler, a virologist at the Austrian Academy of Sciences, there appears to be a link between regions in Austria with low vaccine uptake and particularly high Covid-19 rates, such as the province of Salzburg, one of the hotspots of the current outbreak. “The vaccination rate in Salzburg seems to correlate at least partially with the high infection numbers,” says Bergthaler.Over the next two months, the Austrian government will put into place a legal framework for the mandate. According to the latest reports, authorities will first offer an appointment for anyone who has yet to be vaccinated, before penalties of up to 3,600 euros (£3,022) will follow if the offer is rejected. For those who are already double-vaccinated, there will still be fines of up to 1,500 euros (£1,259), if they refuse to get a booster shot. Exemptions will only be offered to those who are able to prove, via a doctor’s certificate, that they cannot receive a vaccine on medical grounds, such as severe allergies to all currently available vaccines or those who had an adverse reaction to the first dose.But while this decision has been prompted by the increasing urgency of the situation in Austria – in Salzburg, intensive care units are under such strain that some hospitals have been forced to consider turning away all but the worst patients – it remains a deeply controversial one.Only Indonesia, Micronesia and Turkmenistan have introduced full population Covid-19 vaccine mandates, and the subject has become increasingly politically charged. In Vienna, protests turned violent as an estimated 40,000 people took to the streets to show their anger against the new mandate, while similar demonstrations were held in Rotterdam against a proposed law that would prevent unvaccinated people from entering businesses.While intensive care doctors in Austria are reportedly relieved by the news of the vaccine mandate, other scientists are not so comfortable with the idea.“I think vaccines are really crucial and key, but I find it sad if we need mandatory vaccination because we cannot convince people otherwise,” says Bergthaler. “There might be certain parts of society where it would make sense, say, people working in healthcare and nurseries who are dealing with vulnerable people on a daily basis. But in the long run, I think it would make more sense to invest in communicating and convincing people rather than forcing them.”Ethicists also remain unsure that the severity of the pandemic warrants compulsory vaccines at a population level. According to Dominic Wilkinson, professor of medical ethics at the University of Oxford, the ethical case for mandatory jabs is stronger for healthcare and care home workers than the wider public.“If we had an outbreak of a disease that was like the bubonic plague or Ebola, that had devastatingly high mortality, and we had a massive threat to our health system and way of life, I think there would be a strong case for having a vaccine mandate,” he says. “I’m not convinced that this pandemic is sufficiently severe that it’s ethically proportionate to have compulsory vaccination for the general population.”  But while Austria and nations such as Romania and Bulgaria – which have double vaccination rates of just 34 per cent and 22 per cent respectively – have struggled to overcome widespread mistrust of the Covid jabs, other European countries have been far more successful.Portugal is among the world’s leaders in vaccinations with roughly 87 per cent of its 10.3 million people fully inoculated, and the daily death rate correspondingly dropping to single digit numbers. Like Austria, Portugal is politically ided with the country run by a minority Left wing government, and its citizens have also been exposed to a flood of vaccine misinformation on social media channels.The issue of Covid vaccination may have become something of a political tug-of-war between rival parties in Austria, but the Portuguese have deliberately kept their campaign almost completely separate from politics. Rather than being run by elected ministers, Portugal’s vaccine rollout has been orchestrated by former military officer Vice Admiral Henrique Gouveia e Melo, whose communication policy has prioritised building credibility and trust.    Scientists say that this apolitical approach has been the bedrock of Portugal’s success. “Vaccination has been politicised in many countries, which has undermined our response, attitudes and uptake,” says Daniel Salmon, who directs the institute for vaccine safety at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. “We need science to drive public health to drive politics, not politics driving public health that drives science.”Yet vaccine mandates are nothing new and, in recent centuries, played a key role in eradicating smallpox, one of the deadliest diseases in human history. Smallpox vaccines were compulsory in the UK for nearly 150 years after English doctor Edward Jenner developed the first jab in 1796.More recently, similar mandates have been utilised as a way of boosting vaccine uptake in schoolchildren in the wake of rising hesitancy among parents, a trend that the World Health Organisation described as one of the gravest threats to public health in 2019.In the US, all 50 states require schoolchildren to receive the MMR vaccine as well as jabs for polio, tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis, and varicella. In the past five years, legislators in Australia, France and Italy have restricted school access for children who haven’t received the country’s recommended panel of vaccinations, such as MMR. Australia has also introduced a so-called “No Jab, No Pay” legislation, which withholds financial child support from the parents of unvaccinated children. In Italy, parents can also receive fines of up to €500 (£419) for sending children to school who have not been vaccinated against chickenpox, polio, measles, mumps and rubella, while children under six can be turned away.Early data suggests that these mandates have succeeded in achieving their desired goals. In France for example, the number of fully vaccinated children born after 2018 has increased significantly compared to those born in previous years, while childhood immunisation rates in Australia are now close to 95 per cent.But they can backfire. Vaccine mandates have resulted in violent riots in Brazil, while some have linked them to the rise of the anti-vaccine movement in Europe. After California introduced legislation in 2016, which made it impossible for parents to legally avoid immunising their children on anything other than medical grounds, the number of unvaccinated children being home-educated quadrupled between 2016 and 2019.Health experts fear that compulsory Covid vaccination will diminish trust in the healthcare system over time. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control have already called mandates a double-edged sword, fearing that overly draconian rules will induce an even greater number of sceptical anti-vaxxers.Bergthaler would prefer governments to pursue greater engagement with the public on the issue, attempting to actively create an open dialogue with communities who are resistant to the idea of Covid jabs.“This is not even that specific to Covid,” he says. “We see it with the seasonal flu vaccines, where in Austria rates are really low. I think it needs a lot more communication, not just TV commercials but reaching out to people, having testimonials, finding peers among different layers of society. So not just making it one inidual’s decision but trying to convey that this is getting us out of this situation together. That wasn’t politically seen as an attractive strategy, and I think it is haunting us now.”More from NewsWant to stay young?

Speaking at the Airlines  conference in Westminster, Mr Courts said: We all want to see aviation bounce back. We all want to reduce not just testing but all the restrictive measures.  He went on: Weaposre going to review the policy in January. Weaposll be looking to see what we can do at that stage. The minister refused to be drawn on what aspects of the travel rules could be amended. Willie Walsh, the ex boss of British Airwaysapos parent company IAG, told the summit: I think weaposve had overly restrictive measures in place in the UK for far too long, and thataposs definitely slowed down the recovery. He described the lists named after dferent colours as ridiculous, adding: Iaposve never seen a traffic light with five or six colours on it. Mr Walsh urged the Department for Transport to be more vocal in defending the aviation industry. He added: It has a job to do to ensure that other parts of Government understand the critical contribution that aviation makes, which I think has been taken for granted in the UK for far too long. International arrivals who are fully vaccinated are no longer required to self-isolate, but must pay for a test to be taken on or before day two. This can be a lateral flow test, which is cheaper and quicker than a PCR test. People who are not fully vaccinated must take a test in the three days before they arrive in the UK. They must also quarantine at home or in the place they are staying for  days, and pay for two post-arrival PCR tests.

Strategy documents seen by the Mirror reveal the Tory Deputy Prime Ministeraposs desperate bid to hold on to his seat - boosting fundraising and doubling the number of paid campaign staff and party volunteers to stave off a challenge from the Lib Dems. The event took place on Saturday  September - just hours after Mr Raab ed from an emergency diplomatic visit to Pakistan following the fall of Kabul - at Chevening House, the Foreign Secretaryaposs official residence. The Ministerial Code says Government property should not generally be used for constituency work or party activities - though residences can be used in some circumstances, as long as all costs are covered by the party. Mr Raabaposs spokesperson confirmed the bash took place, but did not say how much it cost or whether it would be declared. As many as  donors, activists and local councillors enjoyed hospitality at the bash, where Mr Raab gave a speech on the steps of the mansion, overlooking , acres of garden and a lake. Liberal Democrat Deputy Leader Daisy Cooper MP said: “It is staggering that just days after the fall of Kabul, Dominic Raab appears to have been using Chevening House to host a do for his local Conservative party.“While Afghan interpreters were desperately trying to escape the Taliban, the then Foreign Secretary was apparently busy giving a tour of his country mansion to local Tory activists. “This raises serious questions over whether an official residence has been used to boost local Tory campaigning efforts. Mr Raab must publish details of how much was spent to rent Chevening House, who paid for this visit and whether it has been used to host other local party political events. “It shows yet again why Dominic Raab is not fit to be a government minister or to represent the people of Esher and Walton.” Liberal Democrat Deputy Leader Daisy Cooper MP said: “It is staggering that just days after the fall of Kabul, Dominic Raab appears to have been using Chevening House to host a do for his local Conservative party. “While Afghan interpreters were desperately trying to escape the Taliban, the then Foreign Secretary was apparently busy giving a tour of his country mansion to local Tory activists.

Polling suggests Mr Raabaposs enthusiastic support for Brexit has hurt him in the leafy, prosperous Surrey constituency - which has elected Conservatives for more than  years. And after the Lib Demsapos shock victory in the Chesham and Amersham by-election in June, party bigwigs have been nervous about Mr Raab suffering a aposPortillo momentapos - and losing the seat at the next election. The Mirror revealed in September that Mr Raab was hiring a full-time aposcampaigns assistantapos to help him hold on to his seat. Some £, was donated to Mr Raab between June and October in the wake of the Chesham and Amersham poll. And today it can be revealed Mr Raab plans to increase the number of party volunteer campaigners in his seat from  to , and boost the number of paid campaign staff hours per week from  to . A leaked strategy document also set out a target of increasing local Tory Party membership numbers to ,. Chevening, in northern Kent, has been the subject of a Cabinet row in recent months, with both Mr Raab and Liz Truss, his successor as Foreign Secretary determined to retain access to the -room house. Mr Raab argued that despite being ousted as Foreign Secretary in the reshuffle, he should still have use of Chevening - as former Deputy PM Nick Clegg did during the coalition years. Boris Johnson eventually ordered Mr Raab and Ms Truss to share the property.A spokesperson for Mr Raab said: An event to thank volunteers in September was paid for in full by the local association.

We don’t need to factory-farm animals to stay warm or look stylish. As skins are still imported from abroad, ending this monstrosity in Britain is only part of the answer. This despised trade is powered abroad by pounds spent in Britain. Our revelations today about the breeding of furs in Finland is only the tip of a gruesome iceberg. But public pressure can force the Government to put a stop to this outrage. We can no longer blame the EU. There are no more excuses for inaction in Britain. The sooner new fur purchases are outlawed, the sooner breeders will be put out of business.  Inidually, most of us will boycott these products but collective action is what will finish off this miserable, blood-soaked trade. Con backfires Boris Johnson’s con trick on the elderly is backfiring because people are realising that he’s taking them for fools. The scam is being played on older folk in England’s North and other areas with lower property prices, including some in the South and Wales as well as Scotland.  The Tories are increasing taxes for everybody, then penalising people with ordinary houses to subsidise owners of expensive places in London and the Home Counties. It’s another giant deception by a Prime Minister levelling down working and middle-class folk to finance the well-off and rich. Johnson is a stranger to honesty but, even by his debased standards, the deception plotted against those who fear they may require help in later years is stomach-churning. Tory MPs who vote for the trick deserve to be kicked out of Parliament – hopefully, alongside their despicable leader.

New-style Integrated Care Boardswill be allowed to include private representatives, alongside NHS clinicians and council public health leaders, as part of their make-up. Labour tabled an amendment in the House of Commons that would have banned private healthcare reps from serving on these boards.The Labour ban would have exempted “GPs who hold a contract for the provision of primary medical services in the area”. However, Labour’s amendment was defeated by  votes to .Instead, Health Secretary Sajid Javid put forward a compromise that will ban private health reps from ICBs in some situations.Private sector appointees will be blockedthey “could reasonably be regarded as undermining the independence of the health service”.  Another Labour amendment, adding layers of scrutiny to contracts that are awarded for local NHS services, was also defeated. The amendment, dubbed a safeguard from cronyism by the party, was defeated by  votes to . The votes was part of a wider debate on the Health and Care Bill, which has sparked a furious campaign by anti-privatisation campaigners. The Bill will get rid of  or so Clinical Commissioning Groups which decide how local NHS services are provided in England. In their place will be Integrated Care Systemsin  regions of England, controlling purse strings and setting five-year plans. These are made up of Integrated Care Partnershipswith representation from Integrated Care Boards .  The boards decide what healthcare local groups of people will and won’t receive, what services are kept open, which are shut or scaled back or ‘digitalised’. The idea of a “corporate takeover” has been branded “complete nonsense” by Health Secretary Sajid Javid, and think tanks such as the Nuffield Trust and King’s Fund have not voiced serious concerns about private reps sitting on ICBs. But the Unite union has branded it an “NHS privatisation Bill”, with general secretary Sharon Graham saying it will be “used to further run down the NHS and to bring in more privatisation by the back door.” The union brought together campaigners and celebrities at a rally outside Parliament, while groups including Keep Our NHS Public handed in a ,-strong petition against the Bill. Campaigners are concerned about the presence of private reps on health boards, and another clause in the Bill which will do away with the automatic need to go out to tender for every contract. This is a bid to cut red tape , for example, an established local body is doing the job well. The NHS will only have to tender services where it can lead to better outcomes.  But the BMA has warned the rules “allow contracts to be awarded to private providers without proper scrutiny or transparency”. The Kings Fund added: “Rather than contracts being awarded to new providers without sufficient scrutiny, we believe the greater risk is that contracts are automatically handed out to incumbent providers irrespective of their performance.” Health minister Edward Argar suggested claims about private sector involvement in the NHS after the Bill were “misleading and inaccurate”. The minister said no one will be appointed to an ICBwho would undermine the independence of the NHS. He added: It was never the intention for independent providers to sit on independent care boards and it still isnapost. We were clear that the conflict of interest provisions, despite misleading and inaccurate claims by some campaigners and others, address this. However, we are clear, we are happy to put this even further beyond doubt, the amendment makes clear that no one will be appointed to an ICB who would undermine the independence of the NHS.From coronavirus to Brexit, our daily politics newsletter is there to guide you these turbulent times.

He said a Government amendment would prevent stakeholders of private healthcare companies, lobbyists, and anyone with an obvious ideological interest clearly running counter to NHS independence from sitting on the board of an ICB. But Labour’s Justin Madders said: “This is really about who runs the NHS. “There is a complete and utter incompatibility between the aims of private companies and what we say should be the aims of the NHS and the ICBs.” He added: “A company’s primary concern is the shareholders, not the patients. “With that clear and unanswerable concern about conflicts of interest, we invite the Government to withdraw their amendment and support ours.” Comment MORE ON Conservative PartyLabour PartyNHSPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Ray Edwards, , thought his estate agent was winding him up during a viewing when he mentioned that the Queen frontman used to live in the house. Freddie Mercury, whose real name was Farrokh Bulsara, came from Zanzibar to Gladstone Avenue in Feltham with his parents in , when he was just  years old. While living in the west London house, he started exploring his incredible musical talents, before going on to join Queen as lead singer in . Ray, who is retired, thought his estate agent was fibbing when he name-dropped the iconic star - but after buying the property, he realised it was true. For more of the news you care about straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here But in , when Queen band member Brian May unveiled a British Heritage blue plaque on the house, he was finally convinced - and even let  guests into the house to watch the unveiling. Ray said: “I’m proud to say I live in Freddie Mercury’s old house. It’s nice to have some sort of recognition of Freddie. “The plaque does stand out. The idea is that people look at it and that makes them think of Freddie and reflect on his le and his contribution. “I do look at it occasionally and reflect, I will admit. I’m proud to have it there. Freddie was a very talented person. He added heaposd heard a few rumours the house had been owned by someone famous when he first viewed it, but heaposd never been convinced there was any truth to the rumours.  And when the estate agent kept bringing up Mercuryaposs name during the viewing, Ray was certain it was just a sales tactic. “I wasn’t surethe estate agent was taking the pee,” Ray added. “I did a quick search on the internet and it was dficult to find out who used to live here.” Since the home was occupied by a famous face, itaposs changed quite a bit. The loft has been converted, while one of the three bedrooms has been made into a bathroom - but sadly, during renovations, Ray didnapost find any clues that gave an insight into the le of Freddie Mercury. Ray currently rents the staraposs old bedroom out to a mum and her daughter - who are well aware of the incredibly history of the place where they live. The Bulsara family moved out of the house in , when Freddie was  and just starting out in Queen - where he went on to sell more than  million records. But while living in the house, Mercury made friends with bandmates Roger Taylor and Brian May - meeting John Deacon a year later in .  Although he appreciates the incredible history of the house he lives in, Ray admits Queen isnapost quite his cup of tea. “I wouldn’t say I was a huge fan,” he said. Though, I wouldn’t say I dislike their music. I do have some of their music, some of their records. “But I’m not one of these people who idolise them and stand outside gazing at the plaque.” Mr Edwards estimates the plaque attracts two visitors a week, though this used to be more before the pandemic. He says he doesnapost mind people ogling his property as they walk by - even when fans loiter at his front gate. Freddie Mercury died at the age of  in  after developing bronchial pneumonia resulting from AIDS. His death shook the world, and shone a light on the AIDS epidemic around the globe. Next week, BBC will release a new documentary, Freddie Mercury: The Final Act, which features new interviews with Brian May and Roger Taylor. It also has chats with his sister Kashmira, friends Anita Dobson and David Wigg, and PA Peter Freestone and will air November  - exactly  years after Freddie died.

Yekaterina Shumskaya, , also known as Kate, has . million followers and has thrown fans of the Avengers starlet with her lookalike videos. Kate is so convincing as Scarlett that sheaposs been able to give up her job as a construction company sales manager, making the move from her home town of Maykop to Moscow in May. However, le isnapost always easy for the model, who says lookalike work is scarce in Russia and she wants to move her career forward. Iaposd love one day to film a series of videos of me travelling to America to meet Scarlett Johansson herself. My followers always askIaposve ever spoken to her or whether Scarlett knowsI exist.For more of the news you care about straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here She admits she has no idea what to say when people ask her these questions - because sheaposs never met her doppelganger in person. As well as taking her lookalike career one step further, Kate also wants to make a name for herself in her own right. I want to live my own le, not Scarlettaposs, she said. The model says she first became aware of her uncanny resemblance to the stunning Hollywood actor when some classmates at school made comments. Some schoolfriends came up to me when I was around  years old and showed me a photo and I was like, aposIs that me apos They said, aposNo, itaposs Scarlett Johansson when she was a child,apos and I was really taken aback. So Iaposve known I look like her for a while, but I didnapost really think anything of it.  When she turned , Kate first dabbled in modelling - but she didnapost stick with it for long. I was quite popular in my region of Russia, but I became so bored and upset by the constant comments and messages that I deleted my page after just two weeks, she explained. Instead, she moved into an office job and rose to the role of sales manager at a construction company - managing to but her own car and apartment by the age of  - despite only earning £, a year. But by  she felt something was missing in her le. I was starting to have enough of my work and thought it didnapost bring in the income I felt I deserved, she said. Crudely speaking, I woke up one morning and thought, aposMy youth is passing me by and no one will even notice me soonapos. Although her parents warned her against a change of career, Kate put it all on the line, quit her job and tried to pursue modelling once again. My parents even now donapost understand. They didnapost want me to leave my job. They thought I would never earn enough modelling for adverts, she said. I had a stable  dollarsa month and my parents didnapost want me to turn my back on that. But I made my decision, I quit and well, it was worth it. And even before Kate had officially quit her day job, sheaposd already taken TikTok by storm. She said: At that time all everyone was talking about was TikTok. So, I decided to see what all the fuss was about. There was this very popular hashtag at that time called aposwho do I look like apos in Russia.  So, Kate filmed her own video, comparing herself to her Hollywood lookalike and, before long, her video had racked up millions of likes. There were millions of followers, mainly men, from America, Colombia, Brazil, Chile, all commenting and askingI had spoken to Scarlett orshe knew I existed, she said. Before long, she was being approached with lucrative advertising contracts and moved to Moscow. Now, Kate is earning enough to support herself and her parents - although sheaposs tight-lipped about exactly how much money she brings home each month. There has also been a massive downside to online fame - in that any criticism given to Scarlett Johansson is also directed at her. She said: When Scarlett Johannsson was accused of whitewashing an Asian character in the film Ghost in the Shell, some of the criticism ended up aimed at me, as her lookalike.  Some people commented, saying, aposLetaposs kill herapos when I attempted to aposcosplayapos Scarlettaposs character from that movie. People from all over the world dress up as that character, but they decided to attack me, because Iaposm a lookalike. It was very unpleasant. Kate would like to take her career forward as a cosplayer, but she admits sheaposd need to leave Russia to make a good go of it. Once my followers from all around the world encouraged me to go to the Moscow premiere of Black Widow as Scarlett, as she was starring in it, she said. I dressed up and went down to the centre of town with a photographer, but no-one came out to see me. People just looked at me asI was a weirdo! I was so embarrassed that I burst into tears and ran to a cafe to get changed.Do you have a celebrity lookalike  Email your photos to jessica.taylor@reachplcIronically, in the toilets, once Iaposd taken off my Black Widow costume, a girl came up to me and asked, aposDo people often tell you you look like Scarlett Johansson apos and I just screamed!

Thomas Hughes, , is accused of subjecting his son Arthur Labinjo Hughes to a persistent campaign of cruelty during lockdown, and is currently on trial for his murder. Little Arthur was found with  areas of bruising on his body after he died from unsurvivable brain injuries in June last year, while alone with Hughesapos partner Emma Tustin, . In evidence today, text messages from Hughes to Tustin were read to the jury detailing how Hughes said he would deal with Arthuraposs behaviour.  Prosecutor Jonas Hankin QC told Hughes: On that day, June , you signalled your intentions to cause Arthur serious harm in messages. You messaged Emma to aposdig Arthuraposs graveapos, aposIaposll take his neck off,apos aposto gag him with rope and a sock in his mouthapos, aposkid is getting it when I get backapos. Hughes agreed he had sent the messages. Mr Hankin quizzed Hughes about further messages on June , where he texted, Iaposll deal with him, it wonapost be pretty and put him outside, put him out with the rubbish. Mr Hankin asked: Did you threaten to take his c*ting jaw off his shoulders  Hughes replied: Yes.  Addressing the jury directly, Hughes said: The things I have accepted, I am disgusted in. No parents should act like I did. I cannot see my son ever again because of this, it is horrible. Emmaaposs behaviour was disgusting - she gaslighted an awful lot of people. Prosecutors accused Hughes of being an utterly ruthless, unthinking and pitiless parent, but he denied that, along with a further claim that he relished in abusing his child. Hughes also admitted forcing Arthur to stand for  hours a day and applying pressure to his neck using techniques learned from watching videos about police brutality in America. Jurors were told previously how the youngster was found unresponsive at the coupleaposs home on Cranmore Road, in Solihull. He had been subjected to a cruel and systematic campaign of cruelty which amounted to the medical definition of child torture, the court was told. The couple are also accused of depriving Arthur of food and poisoning him with salt.  Jurors were told that when he died Arthur was found to have consumed so much salt medics questioned their own machinery. Hughes told the court he was mentally abused into complying with a disciplinary routine and didnapost intentionally want to hurt Arthur He agreed that he had subjected Arthur to forced standing, denying him an ice-cream during a heatwave and depriving him of adequate amounts of water. Hughes also admitted he would use pressure points on Arthuraposs neck to discipline him after seeing videos about police brutality in the USA online. He said he would use these pressure points for about  to  seconds to help discipline him. Under cross-examination Mr Hankin asked Hughes: You demonstrated this on yourself didnapost, and even hurt yourself   Hughes replied yes and when quizzed on how forceful this was on a scale of one to ten Hughes said: Probably a six or seven Mr Hankin asked: You researched how to inflict pain on your son  No, said Hughes. The court was shown images of Arthur with bruising on his back and Hughes claimed Tustin had coached him to say the marks had come from boxing with other children. When social services came to visit the house, he admitted lying about the pictures. Hughes denied throughout his cross-examination that he was taking sides, to try and protect Tustin over the well-being of his son. But when asked whether he valued Tustinaposs love and attention more than his sonaposs welfare Mr Hughes replied: Towards the end, probably. Hughes was also aware that his parents had concerns over Arthur and had rung social services, but Hughes thought this was a threat on his parenting by his own parents.  On one occasion Hughes tricked Arthur into the car by pretending he was going to visit his grandparents - a place he had felt safe - but then never went. Hughes admitted that this was an evil act probably on a scale of six or seven out of ten and it was purely to trick him. Hughes, said: All Arthur wanted to do was go back his grandparents, I felt that wasnapost the right move. Arthur would get his own way a bit too much there. I did trick him. I never relished it. When Hughes was asked about the dehydration Arthur had suffered, Hughes admitted to denying him food and water and said he would reject food. Mr Hankin asked: He rejected food because it was contaminated with salt, didnapost he  Hughes replied: That has been an explanation, yes. Hughes and Tustin have both pleaded not guilty to murder. Tustin admitted one count of child cruelty, but has denied further charges of the same offence. Hughes also denies child cruelty offences.

We later found eBay had debited our bank account by around £, for charges but they were unable to state what charges. He said: They immediately blocked my account. There have been one or two sales but nothing like the volume we would normally be doing this time of year. They have tried to charge me for the items the hacker had posted on my listing. I have a direct debit so they can take normally, which is fine. But last week it was over £, and this week it is £,. None of this is my fault. I canapost see why I have been penalised like this. But I have had to lay off one member of staff andnothing improves then I cannot carry on on and the other two staff will lose their jobs. I donapost have enough money to pay the staff and rent. There is no likelihood of the situation improving.  Ebay know it is not my fault, but froze my account. Surely when checks are done they must have realised I donapost sell Rolex watches. One of them was paid for at , by a chap in Flushing, New York. We never had that. The hacker has got the money and legged it. He added: Someone got in touch asking why I was selling his Pokemon card. But it was a fraud. People are upset. They paid money and nothing arrived. I am getting abuse and it results in bad feedback. When all this is happening eBay recognised the account had been compromised but still took money from my account. They paid a buyer , and took it from my account and said it was my fault. It has been dficult enough with the pandemic without this. I just had a pacemaker fitted and this isnapost doing my stress levels any good. An eBay spokesman said an investigation is underway and could take a few days.

John said: We went on holiday around three weeks ago and trusted that the house would be safe with the family friend. But when we got back on Friday November , we couldnapost get in.  They told us that theyaposd barricaded themselves in and wouldnapost leave. It was just so strange as we didnapost know what weaposd done wrong to them. Itaposs just so odd. I just couldnapost believe theyaposd do this to us as well. Itaposs disgusting to be locked out of your own home. The couple were not left homeless as John has another property they could stay in. Their efforts to get back in the other home proved in vain until very recently however. John said: Weaposve made ious attempts to make amends and reason with them but to no avail. Itaposs made me both of us unwell with the stress and worry.  What theyaposve done to the property is unforgivable. As John and Laura own Buy  Save next door to their home, they were able to witness what was happening first hand. John said: They were throwing our furniture into the backyard and ultimately destroying it. Theyaposve even knocked part of the wall down outside the property. All we wanted was our house back. When the family friend eventually vacated the property, John and Laura say the damage to the property was catastrophic.  John said: The back door windows were broken, the dog has chewed away at the wall frame and the door. The electric cables have been badly damaged so weaposll need to get an electrician out to sort it. Theyaposve stolen items like our television and even our shampoo. Itaposs a complete mess and we are both deeply hurt by what has happened.  Humberside Police said they were called to a disturbance on Thursday, November . They said: Officers were called to reports of a disturbance at a property on Welholme Road, Grimsby, at around .am . It was reported that a woman was acting in a threatening manner towards two known people. Officers resolved the incident safely and there were no arrests made. John and Laura are now looking to make a quick exit from Grimsby after the experience. My lease on the shop, Buy and Save, is up at the end of the month and weaposre hoping to leave as soon as possible, John said. Itaposs just mad around here. The experience weaposve had to reclaim our home has been horrendous. And the drugs and all sorts are terrible as well around here. I donapost know where we will go, but itaposs certainly going to be far away from here.

Cases peaked at around , a day in August but, since then, numbers have dropped signicantly - on Friday, only  new cases were recorded in its capital Tokyo. One of the theories for the sudden fall in the Delta infection rate is that continued mutation has caused it to effectively fizzle out. While mutations can make a virus even more potent, the makeup of it changes over time as it replicates and genes undergo copying errors, which can lead to evolutionary dead ends. Do you have a story  Email webnews@mirror. Researchers led by the National Institute of Genetics, Mishima, Japan, found lots of genetic changes before a sudden stop in the evolution process.Ituro Inoue, a genetics professor at the institute, told The Japan Times : “The Delta iant in Japan was highly transmissible and keeping other iants out.“But as the mutations piled up, we believe it eventually became a faulty virus and it was unable to make copies of itself. “Considering that the cases haven’t been increasing, we think that at some point during such mutations it headed straight toward its natural extinction.”  Prof Inoue said the virus would still be spreadingDelta were “alive and well”. Dr Simon Clarke, Head of Division of Biomedical Sciences and Biomedical Engineering at University of Reading, explained too many mutations could lead to the virus dying out. He told The Sun: The virus accumulates too many mutations and therefore stops being able to replicate. When you get a virus like that, it just dies out. It’s like a person that never has children, their genetic material stops, end of the road. That doesn’t mean that everyone  stops producing children.  Dr Clarke added: “It is possible for the strain to stop evolving, but only when it stops replicating, which these Japanese scientists think has happened – a virus has evolved to stop replicating. “You need somehow to break the chains of transmission and some mutations will make the virus unviable – they become evolutionary dead ends. “However, that will only occur in a very small subset of cases.There will still be a lot of coronavirus around that is capable of infecting people and will do just that until we have sufficient immunity or we can break the chains of transmission, which is what happened with SARS because it wasn’t as good at transmission as Covid-.”Comment MORE ON DeltaCoronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Ellis Thomas, from Caernarfon, north Wales, had spent the day with his partner browsing the Christmas markets in Cardf, around  miles south as the crow flies, before catching the .pm train home on Wednesday. What should have been a four-hour journey then ended up taking more than  hours as he criss-crossed Wales after multiple delays and abrupt train terminations.The -year-old eventually arrived back in Bangor, where heaposd left his car two days before, just after am, Wales Online reported. His awful journey, which he likened to a day from hell, started going awry just one stop in when the train rolled into Newport. An announcement informed passengers the train was terminating and Transport for Wales staff advised anyone heading north to race across the  to catch the next train to Manchester instead.   As Ellis and his partner sprinted over the bridge between s, the Manchester-bound train pulled away. He said: There were  people running over the bridge and when the train left, some people just lost it. I just thought, it is what it is and waited. The train disruption was caused by a broken section of track at Craven Arms in Shropshire, which affected services on Wednesday and into Thursday. By late afternoon, Ellis and his partner were still four hours from home. Staff advised the pair to catch the train to Hereford, which was at least more northern. But as the train reached Abergavenny, it halted and the driver said there was a red light ahead. It stayed on the tracks for two hours, not moving, said Ellis. We were just sat on the train outside the station for two hours, he said. When they eventually got to Hereford, two hours later than planned, they heard the track had been fixed and the service could continue to Manchester. But one stop from Craven Arms, the train ground to a halt again due to further faults down the line. There was another two-hour wait for Ellis and his partner in a two-carriage train with no drinks trolley and one toilet out of order. Another announcement told them the train would terminate at Craven Arms and a bus would offer alternative onward transport.  Craven Arms is a small station, with no staff, and around  of us were just dumped there, Ellis said, adding that he watched the train they had just alighted sailing back in the direction it had come towards Cardf. We all just stood there in the car park, waiting for the bus. When it arrived, there were just  seats on it, he claimed, and he was lucky to get on. Next thing, everyone was pushing for the bus and ramming the door, Ellis added. The bus only took them as far as Shrewsbury, which meant Ellis had still only completed two thirds of his journey and it was by now approaching midnight. He waited an hour at Shrewsbury for the next train to Chester, which was then promptly cancelled and in desperation he phoned for a taxi instead. Shelling out £ for a cab, they were halfway to Chester when his train app said the .am train to Bangor was cancelled too. Ellis said: I just thought weaposll have to get a taxi all the way home. We went right through mid-Wales, Corwen, Bala, Capel Curig, all the way to Bangor, he said. His taxi cost £, on top of the £ heaposd paid for the original ticket, and it was am when he finally saw his car again. So exhausted from his near- hour journey, Ellis said he slept in until lunchtime the next day to recover. He is due to travel back to Cardf this weekend to watch the rugby and is hopeful he has a more straightforward journey home. A spokesperson for Transport for Wales said they agreed ticket acceptance with three other rail providers and added rail replacement services. They blamed the broken tracks and said they apologise to Mr Thomas for any inconvenience this may have caused.

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex were spotted onboard heading back to New York, having spent three days in the Big Apple for Veterans Day earlier this month.Someone claiming to be on the plane with them shared a photo of what seems to be the prince wearing a suit and a face mask, Mail Online reports. The passenger wrote on social media: Ok this might sound unbelievable and I couldn’t get a good picture and I get [sic] you can say this could literally be anyone….BUT….Prince Harry and Meghan were on our flight to LA last night! We were held up for about  minutes from our departure time and they were snuck into the last  seats.  We didn’t even know until a girl waiting to get off the plane next to us pointed them out. I couldn’t get my phone out fast enough but it was them. They were quickly whisked away and we were in shock that we were so close and breathing the same air as our beloved royals! The Duke and Duchess found themselves in hot water earlier this year for spreading the word about claiming change while using private planes to jet around the globe. In September the couple appeared at a gig in New York calling for action on climate change before later using a private jet tohome to their £million home in Calornia.Former government minister Norman Baker, , told Newsweek : Itaposs completely hypocritical for Prince Harry or other members of the royal family to lecture people about climate change when theyaposre emitting more carbon than almost everyone  on the planet. People using private jets are in the top one percent of carbon emitters in the world. Prince Harry needs to stop using private jets orhe wants to use private jets, he needs to stop lecturing people on climate change. It is not particularly challenging to get a flight from New York to Calornia - people do it all the time. His criticism came after the couple reportedly used  private jets in two years. Judging by their appearance on the commercial plane, it seems that the Mr Bakeraposs words of advice have filtered through to the couple.  The Sussexes spent three days in New York midway through November, staying at a luxury apartment on Manhattanaposs East Side and taking part in two online summits. They also appeared at a red carpet gala on Wednesday honouring veterans at a museum aboard aircraft carrier USS Intrepid, which is moored in Manhattan. At the red carpet event, former soldier Prince Harry presented Intrepid Valour awards for bravery to five fellow veterans.

Another said: When the owner mingles with every employee of any designation and shows how smallest of the work is done, the company will rule the business. Another person posted: I wanna work for this guy. It comes after the restaurant in London controversially advertised for a toilet attendant, with the low salary on offer meaning it would take three weeks for them to afford one of his infamous steaks.The wages offered at the venue are only £-an-hour which would take any worker three weeks to buy just one of Nusr-Etaposs £ gold encrusted steaks.

As the festive season closes in, a spectacular array of Christmas lights and decorations have been erected up and down the country. But this rather sad looking specimen hasnapost even been decorated - making it look very naked in among the festive celebrations. One resident in Springburn couldnapost believe her eyes when she saw the offering. The local posted a picture on Twitter of the small, scrawny Christmas tree - which had been abandoned with four metal fences around it.In the post, which has now been liked almost , times, she said: Merry Christmas from Springburn! Naturally, social media users were quick to poke fun at the little tree. Paula-jane posted: Never been more proud of my roots. James replied: Coca cola should implement this into their next Xmas advert. Jordo said: Thereaposs council and then thereaposs this. And Kaitlin Coffey joked: Missed the light switch on, followed by a broken heart emoji.It comes after a Christmas tree that was branded anational embarrassment has been removed from Grimsby town centre after locals were left disappointed by it.The ft cone-shaped articial tree in the town cost North East Lincolnshire Council more than £,. Locals were baffled when the festive decoration was installed in Riverhead Square on Thursday and several people complained about it, with a resident claiming they had a bigger tree in their house.A person said: That is so embarrassing. Itaposs an insult to Grimsby. Another added: Itaposs a bit of a let down. Could have done better. Following criticism by residents, the Christmas tree was dismantled by contractors last week. Councillor Callum Procter issued a statement to explain why the tree was removed, claiming it was installed too early - and adding that a bigger one will be installed in the town next week. He said: There are great plans for celebrating the start of the Christmas period next week. Unfortunately, the Christmas Market tree was installed too early, and we understand that people were confused and thought this was our civic tree. The tree has been removed temporarily today and our contractors are reinstalling again, for free, ahead of the market next week. I’m looking forward to seeing people enjoying the illuminations, the market, and the revamped St Jamesapos Square with the civic tree and the special lighting on the Minster as part of the Christmas experience.

Met Office experts predict some regions will see snow fall before the end of the week as most regions struggle to stay above freezing point. The north will be hit hardest where the heavy and wintry showers will fall. Frost is also expected to cover cars and pavements across the north, and other regions, as the week continues. Most of England will also feel the chill as temperatures across the nation drop. Some areas will feel the freeze more, like in Wales where an icy -C is expected. It will remain bright and sunny for most places, but that sunshine will not indicate warmth. A Met Office spokesman told the Mirror that deep snow will cover the mountain tops of Scotland on Wednesday before slowly moving southwards over the course of the week. He said: This snow will build in for the high ground of Scotland from Wednesday, and will likely persist in high areas through to the weekend.Coupled with this will be some gusty winds on Wednesday with up to knot gusts possible in the far north.That windy theme will persist for the northwest in particular later in the week and in to the weekend.

Plan B is a contingency plan to try and bring cases down, but health secretary Sajid Javid is playing down the chances of it happening.But the winter may force their hand and experts might just conclude that this is the ideal situation for keeping the rising in hand. Experts are also calling for some restrictive measures to increase social distancing to be reintroduced. Viruses in winter are already a problem and high cases of Covid- puts the stretched health service under strain.The seven-day average for cases across the UK is now around the , mark, though this is lower than the end of October, it is not ideal for the NHS.Englandaposs deputy chief medical office warned there will be hard months to come in the winter. Countries around the world are also experiencing a rise in cases. German chancellor Angela Merkel admitted the country is in the midst of a new wave, while Austria began a ten-day lockdown on Monday. Boris Johnson currently has no plans to do the same. But what would plan B look like What would closeplan B was introduced   It is unlikely anything would actually close. These plans are not a lockdown. The government says plan B prioritises measures which can help control transmission of the virus while seeking to minimise economic and social impact. Lockdown meant that a huge hit to the economy occurred and many dferent businesses and sectors had to shut down completely, while staff were furloughed. Plan B will recommend that people work from home, so some business may choose to temporarily close their offices, but bars and restaurants will likely not want to close. People will also recognise some measures put in place as akin to some of those put in place in lockdown. Would restaurants, bars and shops remain open during Covid plan B   Yes. Or at least there currently donapost seem to be any plans to the contrary. But the effects of plan B would be unknown, it may mean that some people are discouraged from going out and some in the already heavily hit hospitality sector have warned against this. The government would be keen not to see such a hit to its economy and local economies across the UK with the introduction of plan B measures. They may change this at the time when, and , they introduce plan B measures, but currently they will not close. Face coverings will become compulsory, but exactly in what setting is again unclear. It may well include in restaurants, bars and most likely in shops. What  does the governmentaposs Covid Plan B involve   Like shops, face coverings will also have to be worn on public transport, as well as in hospitalsthe measures are introduced. The public will be clearly communicated to and people will be encouraged to act more cautiously. College and secondary school staff and pupils will have to test regularly. A contingency framework exists for schools, where cases are monitored locally and would reintroduce compulsory mask-wearingneed be.

Letitia Brown, , from Scotland, was visited by a GP at am on October  after suffering with sickness and diarrhoea for days. The doctor told her paramedics would arrive within an hour, but her family became increasingly panicked as that hour turned into .As the wait dragged on all day and night, they watched as as her condition deteriorated, the Daily Record reports.She became so unwell that she could no longer walk the few steps to her next-door bathroom. Her daughter Elaine, , said: “The doctor was here just after am and went out to his car for a while to phone an ambulance. He was back in before noon and told us it would be here within the hour. “It didn’t arrive until .pm, by which time my mum’s condition had really deteriorated. She could no longer walk to the bathroom next door to her bedroom. “My mum is one of those women who just gets on with things, she never complains, so when she first asked for a doctor, we knew there must be something seriously wrong. “She had been not quite right for a couple of weeks but there were a lot of sickness and diarrhoea bugs around at the time so we didn’t think too much of it.” On October , she had a telephone consultation followed by a personal visit by her GP two days later when Elaine called to say the prescription he had left for it wasn’t having any impact.  Elaine said: “She seemed to be getting a bit worse and was getting tenderness in her stomach. The GP gave her something to help the diarrhoea and gave her anti-sickness medication but because she was still being sick, she wasn’t getting them into her system properly.”On October , just after am, Elaine called NHS . She said: “She was getting worse and the pain in her lower abdomen was getting worse as well.“The out-of-hours doctor came just after  and after examining my mum, he said he was going to his car to phone an ambulance. “My dad said we could put her in the car and take her to hospital but the doctor said not to do that because she would be safer in an ambulance and that it should be here within the hour.  “He also called to speak to a surgeon at the hospital so we knew it must be something serious.” Over the course of the next few hours, mature student Elaine spoke to the ambulance service a number of times but she said: “They kept saying, ‘We are really sorry the ambulance has been erted to more emergency cases’. “I was getting worried because I could see she was deteriorating throughout the day and she was grey. “They told meit got much worse to phone . “About pm, I called  but all they said was, ‘We’ll let them know she is getting worse’. “We thought that would mean she would get an ambulance quicker but then we got a call saying the ambulance had been erted to a more serious case. “I said I had already told them mum was deteriorating. They just saidshe deteriorates much more phone . I said, ‘How many times do I need to do that’  “About pm they called to say they would upgrade it to an emergency. When a doctor calls an ambulance, you already think it is an emergency. “I ended up having a bit of an argument with the call handler because she suggested I put mum in the car and transport her to hospital myself. That riled me. “Had she asked me to do that at am, I could have managed it but all those hours later my mum had deteriorated so much she couldn’t even get to the toilet. “She told me she would get an ambulance as soon as she could. But it didn’t arrive until .pm. By then, she wasn’t even able to speak. I believe mum wasn’t treated as seriously as she should have been.” After admission, Letitia has had two emergency operations after she was discovered to have cancerous growths on her oies and peritonitis – a potentially fatal inflammation of the tissue which lines the abdomen. She is also suffering from pneumonia. She remains in a serious condition in hospital.

Joanna Georgiou, , had first consulted with her GP after discovering a suspicious lump on her knee in  - but says she was simply told ibuprofen will help the pain of the aposcystapos. Now after five years after finding her first lump, Joanna has a tumour the size of satsuma next to her heart and six tiny tumours in her lungs and one large one in her knee - the one first diagnosed as a cyst. Over the years and with increasing pain, Joanna said she continuously confided in doctors who would only prescribe stronger painkillers. Joanna suffered more pain during the Covid pandemic where she found herself struggling to stand and unable to receive adequate help from e-consultations with doctors. But in August , Joanna decided to visit a private surgery and was diagnosed with Stage  Synovial Sarcoma despite previous doctors diagnosis. Synovial Sarcoma is a cancer that forms in soft tissue, with only three in a million people being diagnosed with it. It most often grows near joints and can spread very quickly.Joanna feels majorly let down by the NHS and feels more could have to done to recognise the tumours earlier. Joanna said: “I’ll never forget that first doctor I went to. I told him I had this soft lump that wasn’t really painful to touch but didnapost feel right. And he barely looked at my leg, he was completely uninterested in what I was saying. She stated she initially had two diagnoses - ganglion cyst and calcium bite injury - neither of which were correct. Joanna was then informed it was a benign tumour and was placed on a waiting list to have it removed.  But she was shockingly pushed back of the list to make room for more critical patients with cancer. Joanna spoke of the betrayal she felt from the NHS stating: “We believe what weaposre told and we trust in our medical professionals. “We trust in the NHS and I was just going with what I was told even though I felt like they might have got something wrong.  “The one thing that we get is the NHS and I feel let down. Joanna believes her treatment was further delayed because of the pandemic. She said she felt forgotten about during those times - stating many with cancer and other terminal conditions were neglected. Joanna has now gone through four rounds of chemotherapy, lost her hair and is considering having her leg removed in order to save her le.  But still, after the four rounds of chemotherapy, the six tumours in her lungs have sadly remained the same - as well as the tumour within her knee. But the tumour within her heart had decreased dramatically in size, shrinking from nine centimetres to three and a half centimetres. Sadly this will not have a major impact on her prognosis.  But despite her hardship, Joanna is not giving up. She is determined to not only prolong her le with radiotherapy but live her le to the fullest. She said: “It would be a long road to recovery but I am a stubborn person, and I won’t give up that easily.” Comment MORE ON NHS\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The -year-old said she and her granddaughter, , were forced to walk to another hotel in their pyjamas. Susan Leger was on the first of a three-night stay at the Baymont Inn  Suites in the town of Helen, Georgia in September when she says she received a call from the hotel manager telling her she had to leave. That call allegedly came soon after she was asked to leave a review following her check in, in which she called the property aposrun down.apos She was also said to have complained that the toilet in her room didnapost flush properly and the pool was shut, say reports. She said police turned up to remove her and her six-year-old grandchild, writing in a report that management had wanted he to leave due to giving aposthe hotel a bad review.apos Speaking to WXIA she said: My granddaughteraposs like clinging to my leg and crying so hard. This was scary. This was just horrying.The man is screaming at me. He was saying, You get out now. I call the police. She says the manager told her: aposYou get out … You lie, you lie. You gave me bad review.apos She added: And Iaposm just sitting there going, Oh my gosh, is this a prank call apos The woman was said to have given the hotel three stars out of five, claiming the accommodation was aposrundownapos adding: Pool’s not open. Toilet doesn’t flush well.  She was unaware that reviews were forwarded to management during a guestaposs stay. She added: So, the only way to keep the room, in my mind, is not to have answered Hotelsaposs request. If you don’t want to be walking in your pyjamas with your six-year-old granddaughter, don’t leave a reviewyou’re currently still at the place. In an interview the hotel manager, Danny Vyas, said that the woman had complained several times. He said: They called me at least ,  times in maybe one hour. Sink is not working. Everything is not right. Officers were said to have helped the pair find another hotel nearby.

Kyle Rittenhouse gave his first TV interview after jurors cleared him of all charges including two counts of homicide and one count of attempted homicide for wounding a third man. He insisted he is a supporter of Black Lives Matter and suggested that he might sue US President Joe Biden. He was just  when he used an assault rle to shoot and kill Joseph Rosenbaum, , and Anthony Huber, , in Wisconsin in August . He also wounded Gaige Grosskreutz, , during violent demonstrations being held over the police shooting of Jacob Blake, .  He had pleaded not guilty to the shootings in the city of Kenosha - claiming he was ambushed and had acted in self-defence and was found not guilty of all charges on Friday, after a three-week trial. The verdict sparked an angry backlash across the country with one protest of around  people in Portland, Oregon, being declared a riot. In an interview with Fox News on Monday night, Rittenhouse said that he was not a racist and supported Black Lives Matter. He said: This case has nothing to do with race, it never had anything to do with race. It had to do with the right to self defence. Iaposm not a racist person, I support the BLM movement, I support peacefully demonstrating and I believe there needs to be change.  Rittenhouse claims he has received numerous death threats and that he now fears for his le. He said: I was an innocent  year old who was violently attacked and defended myself. Apparently for a lot of the people on the left it is wrong to want to defend your community. I have to have people with me because people want to kill me, just because I defended myself. Some of the things people say, itaposs just sickening.He also said he had aposreally good lawyersapos who were looking into defamation charges and claimed that he believed Joe Biden acted with aposmaliceapos for previously suggesting he was a white supremacist. After the acquittal the heartbroken relatives of Mr Huber released a statement that said Rittenhouseaposs verdict sends an unacceptable message. It reads: Todayaposs verdict means there is no accountability for the person who murdered our son. It sends the unacceptable message that armed civilians can show up in any town, incite violence, and then use the danger they have created to justy shooting people. Mr Huberaposs devastated girlfriend Hannah Gittings said: Everyday I wish I could come home to him and unload some of the weight thataposs on my shoulders. But I canapost. Because heaposs dead.

A suspect was taken into custody by police soon after, who has now been named as Brooks Jr, . Reports say he has a number of convictions and had been bailed from prison just two days prior. It is also said that he raps under the name MathBoi Fly - and a similar vehicle to that involved in the incident can be seen in one video.Do you have a story  Email webnews@mirror. A law enforcement source told CBS News it appeared the suspect was fleeing another scene when he ran into the parade.A motive is yet to be disclosed. City officials have so far confirmed that five people died in the tragedy - but admitted the numbers may change.A Twitter post said: At this time, we can confirm that  people are deceased and over  are injured.However, these numbers may change as we collect additional information.  Many people have self-transported to area hospitals. The Police Department has the person of interest in custody. It is not thought the incident was related to terrorism at this time, reports say. Waukesha Police Chief Dan Thompson said officers had opened fire on the vehicle as the incident unfolded. But police did not believe shots had been fired from the vehicle, he added, contrary to earlier reports. The FBI has also been drafted in to to assist with the probe.  People were screaming as the vehicle sped through the crowd at roughly .pm local time. One unveried video shows a red SUV flying past the parade, narrowly missing a child dancing in the road. Another clip shows what appears to be a similar vehicle smashing through a barricade as the sound of gunshots ring out.Witness Brayden Kowalski, , told Fox News he was with his family when he saw what happened.[The driver is] just blowing through people, kind of just dinging a lot of people, bodies flying everywhere, he said.  for our newsletter to keep up to date with all the essential information and changes at www.mirror email .These people didn’t get run over, they got f*****g thrown through the air.

Many families who get together on Christmas day split the dishes between each household to alleviate both the cost and the effort on the hosting house – but one family has instead asked for every guest to pay a fee to cover the expenses. A mum took to Mumsnet to express her frustration at being told to pay an undisclosed amount to have Christmas dinner with her in-laws, as she said she has hosted the big day at her house several times and has never considered asking for money. She said: “My brother-in-law and sister-in-law are hosting Christmas dinner this year. Iaposve hosted before. Basically, they are charging us per family for dinner.  Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. Iaposve never charged them before but apparently because theyaposve got a lot of people going this year they have decided to charge.” The woman said she was especially annoyed by the monetary fee because most of it would be going on champagne – which she won’t be drinking because she’ll be driving her family to the event. She added: “Then in the next breath they’re saying how many bottles of champagne they are planning to buy, but have said they will be splitting the cost evenly between us all. They know I wonapost be able to drink as its just assumed by everyone Iaposll do all the driving. “I donapost want to seem tight but charging for Christmas dinner for me just feels wrong.” And the mum insisted she would be more than happy to take over a dish to contribute to the dinner, but doesn’t want to give them cash. She wrote: “I would, of course, have taken things round or would have been perfectly happytheyaposd ask me to bring a certain course. “My husband says he is on their side as they are doing all the hard work. Granted, but Iaposve never charged them and would never dream of! It’s really put me off going, but of course I will go to keep the peace!” The mum’s post has split opinion online – but many people agree that her in-laws are being out of order by asking for money. One person said: “I do not understand this mentality. I’d stay at home. You do not charge people for dinner in your own home no matter day of year it is.” While another added: “Fair enough to ask people to contribute by bringing dishes, desserts, or wine. I would feel uncomfortable being asked for cash too, especiallyit was paying for champagne which I wouldn’t drink.” And someone  wrote: “You donapost invite people over to your house and then charge them.” However, other commenters tried to sympathise with the rest of the woman’s family, as they pointed out the cost of hosting Christmas. A comment read: “One of my siblings always hosts Christmas because they have the space. “The rest of us chip in with the cost. We aren’t being ‘charged’ we just recognise that it isn’t fair for one family to bear the signicant expense. “And it is more important to be together, and enjoy being together, than staying in our own homes because ‘ they can’t afford to host they shouldn’t invite.’ ” And a second person agreed, adding: “I think you should offer what you’re prepared to pay. “I’ve lost count of the number of Christmas dinners I’ve cooked and hosted at - quid a pop and nobody offered to contribute!” What do you think  Let us know in the comments below.

But while many of us will have simply lost a lipstick or forgotten which bag we left our keys in, one nightclub has revealed some people leave behind vital everyday items – including mobile phones. The Garage in Glasgow posted a video on their TikTok, @thegaragegla, in which employees donned plastic gloves and went around the club at the end of the night to pick up items left on the floor by clubbers. First on the list was someone’s phone charger, followed by “endless passports” from people showing their ID to get in, as well as a super stylish puffer jacket. Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. The staff also found a tiny pack of playing cards for “some late-night entertainment”, as well as several pieces of jewellery, a bottle of perfume, and a tampon. Among the strangest items left behind was an old iPhone with a severely cracked screen, and one shoe. Commenters on the TikTok video were baffled by some of the items seen in the clip, and were particularly stunned by the lone shoe – as they couldn’t understand how the footwear’s owner wouldn’t realise something was missing.  One person wrote: “I will never understand how someone loses ONE shoe.” While another agreed, adding: “I don’t go to night clubs so I’m going to need someone to explain how you lose one shoe ” And a third posted: “I just know the panic those people felt when they woke up to a lost passport.” Other commenters shared things they’d found at the end of a night at their own local nightclub – with some even weirder additions. Someone said: “I once found an entire Jenga game.” A dferent user commented: “I once found a full  pack of Aunt Bessie’s Yorkshire puddings.” Have you got a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

Faye Angeletta, director of house building and property recruitment company TDM Recruitment, had put a candidate forward to one of her clients for a role in new home sales. But when she asked the employer for feedback, she was horried that theyaposd branded the jobseeker aposnot the slimmestapos. She claims he even said that he feared for the showroom stairs or that she would suffer a aposheart attackapos due to her apossizeapos. In retaliation, Faye then pulled the size  woman from the running and explained she could not open her up to bullying over her appearance.  For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here. However, the recruiter claims the candidate asked for aposhonest feedbackapos so she felt compelled to reveal that the boss had said she was simply too big. The -year-old from Stratford, East London, said: Iaposve been working in recruitment for seven years. It was unbelievable. That message came through on text message. I absolutely couldnapost believe heaposd put it in writing. On the phone, he said aposwell, you know, I worry for the stairs that weaposve got in the showroom or her having a heart attackapos. He was a slimy, horrible man. He laughed down the phone. This woman is a size  - the average size for a woman in the UK. Itaposs just honestly unreal.  Faye was then forced to call the unnamed candidate up to tell her the feedback, refusing to bite her tongue so she could avoid the woman aposreengagingapos with the client in the future. Faye said: Iaposm looking for the best person for the job. At the moment across the whole of the UK, there is a shortage of talent. I said to him aposI just want you to realise that your reason for not taking this candidate is wrong. There will be criticism and I have to filter what is said to me back to the client. This lady had a battle with cancer. She is actually taking steroids. [In the past] one client has come back to me and said someone picked their nose. She said aposI donapost knowitaposs a nervous thing but thataposs not how you conduct yourself in front of somebody. It was very uncomfortableapos. I had one candidate who hadnapost washed for a few days. People need to know why they didnapost get a job and what they can improve on. You might say aposjust make sure before your interview you check yourself in the mirror and make sure your hairaposs tidy or you donapost have coffee on your lipsapos.  But with this person, they were overweight. I have a duty to make sure this candidate doesnapost try to reengage with this person. He didnapost actually say no to her. He basically said he was still interested but she was too fat. If I put that person in that job, I would feel responsible for the bullying that could happen. I couldnapost put her in a job where she would be judged on the basis of her appearance is absolutely not okay. She said aposI want to know honestly what the feedback wasapos. When I told her, she just laughed and said aposare you joking apos The recruiter shamed the boss on LinkedIn, where she said: aposSorry, you havenapost got the job - youaposre too fat!apos I was lost for words on the feedback below. Iaposve had it all when it comes to reasons for rejection: aposThey had the worst garlic breath Iaposve ever encounteredapos aposBig fat no - he reminded me of Piers Morgan on speedapos aposThey were stroking a cat at on their lap the entire zoom call like Dr Evilapos aposEr, so it turns out I slept with their brother so, er, might be a bit awkward apos  Some reasons I can understand from clients, first impressions count and itaposs up to you as the candidate to sell yourself. But, to discriminate against someone for their weight  Itaposs just bang out of line and pure bigotry. I recruit in new homes sales and it is an industry full of drop-dead gorgeous people. In customer-facing roles, there is an expectation for presentation and it comes without question you need to look the part on site. However,you want to recruit on the basis of appearance over ability, maybe try a modelling agency. Naturally, I have pulled the candidate from the running and made the client aware we are no longer interested in working with them. He didnapost seem to see the issueand hung up on me along with some other rude words in the mix. But size isnapost the only characteristic used to discriminate against potential candidates Faye says, as she claims recently one woman was rejected because she would soon get married and the hirer was worried she might get pregnant. Faye said: This young lady was getting married in the next three months and he said apossheaposs getting married  You know what that meansapos.  I said I didnapost know what it meant and he said he needed someone committed and people change when they have children. Fayeaposs decision to pull the woman from the running was supported by LinkedIn users, as they branded the man absolutely disgusting. One person said: I would love to see a picture of this guy. Would he be a suitable candidate for the cover of Menaposs Health  Itaposs usually those that arenapost a   that would make these kinds of comments. Another user wrote: Just a shame itaposs not possible to name and shame. There appears to be a shortage of good new homes sales staff and it would be shame for anyone to work for such a tool! A third commented said: Itaposs not just size people get turned down for - there are some people out there that wonapost take people because they donapost fit their mold, and then the ageist. I got told the other day your too old to get the job. People like this donapost deserve the jobs they are in. While someone  said: Wow, Iaposve heard some very unsavory reasons not to hire but this is up there with the worst....how do you provide feedback on this as a recruiter Have you got a story to share We want to hear all about it.

Swathes of central and Eastern Europe have some of the worst rates in the world and the continent is quickly emerging as a global hotspot. As the UK and much of Europe looks ahead towards what could be a dficult winter for healthcare systems, many European countries are already being forced to bring in restrictions. These include targeted restrictions on the unvaccinated and lockdowns. The UK seems to have relatively low Covid rates compared to some of its European neighbours with a seven day average of . new cases.Scroll down to see the  countries with the highest Covid rates in the worldA number of countries have seen violent protests against restrictions and lockdowns in recent days, with Austria, Switzerland, Italy, Denmark and Croatia all seeing unrest after bringing in new restrictions. Slovakia currently has the worldaposs highest seven-day average rate of Covid cases per million people, with , people catching the virus - nearly triple the rate of the United Kingdom. To deal with spiralling case rates, the country has introduced tight restrictions on the unvaccinated, meaning they will not be able to enter restaurants, shopping centres or shops, sports activities and public events. The country has resisted a full lockdown so far during Europe’s fourth wave.  Slovenia and Austria follow behind with , Covid cases per million people each. Both countries have some of the lowest vaccination rates in Europe, and Austria has seen cases rising unabated since September. The country entered its fourth national lockdown yesterday and became the first European nation to make the vaccine mandatory, with the law coming into force from next February. Not only do both countries have rates one and a half times higher than the UK, but the dramatic increases recently in cases contrasts to the UK’s which since the summer has been rising and falling around its current mark of  cases per million. Top  worst affected countries : Slovakia - , Slovenia - , Austria - , Czech Republic - , Netherlands - , Belgium - , Liechtenstein - , Croatia - , Georgia - , Ireland - . The Czech Republic is another hotspot, with rates having risen sharply since mid-October. The country now records a seven day average of , Covid cases per million people, one of the highest globally and mirrors the worrying picture of its Eastern European neighbours. Similar to Austria, it has introduced restrictions on the unvaccinated parts of its population, with rules preventing them attending public events, restaurants, pubs and other services.  Netherlands and Belgium have , and , Covid cases per million respectively, and recently saw violent protests in response to new restrictions the governments introduced. , people marched in Brussels in what started as a peaceful protest but descended into violence. Signs among the crowd ranged from far-right insignia to LGBTQ+ rainbow flags. Liechtenstein, Croatia, Georgia and Ireland are the next four countries with the worst covid rates globally, three of which are located inside the Eastern European hotspot. Whilst Liechtenstein’s rates seem to only be on the up, Croatia and Georgia have experienced a decline in cases recently. Ireland’s rate of . cases is signicantly higher than that of the United Kingdom’s.  Germany currently has a lower case rate than the United Kingdom, but the direction of travel isn’t positive as cases seem to be trending upwards. Angela Merkel, similar to her counterparts across Europe, announced tighter restrictions for the unvaccinated in Germany. The restrictions limit access to restaurants, pubs, sporting events and cultural venues for the unvaccinatedthe state breaches a threshold of six hospitalisations per , people. The UK comparatively has brought no restrictions in, but cases in the UK have oscillated up and down since the summer and despite currently being on the rise there is no sign of restrictions being introduce. Another signicant dference is that Germanyaposs Standing Committee on Vaccination only recommended booster jabs for everyone over  last Thursday.

Reports of a half-human, half-dog monster first originated in  in the US state of Michigan but, fast forward to the present day and there have been multiple so-called witnesses across the world.One of those witnesses is John, who was fishing in the Australian bush when he claims he encountered the spooky creature stalking him from the riverbank, reports Daily Star. Sharing his story on the Believe: Paranormal  UFO Podcast, the Aussie explained that he had headed out for a fishing trip in his kayak on Boxing Day last year, when he suddenly heard a snap from the woods next to him.“I noticed that every time I took a stroke with the paddle of my kayak, whatever this thing was, it was taking a stride to each paddle I was taking, he said. “I stopped for a bit and the sound stopped in the bush too, and I thought it was a bit odd. So I took off paddling again, and sure enough as soon as I started to paddle every stroke, this thing would take a step.  “So whatever it was, this thing was following me, it wasn’t a coincidence or anything. It was more of a stalk.” Eventually, noticing something black in the trees, John captured a photo on his phone, and was shocked at what he saw. “The creature, I actually got it in the photo, and what I think it is - I’ve spoken to a few people - and I reckon it’s a Dog Man,” he suggested. “After that I couldn’t go back to the area to check it out by myself, I was petried for probably a month after it. I was waking up in the middle of the night and seeing the creature in my dreams. Events only ramped up when John ed to the area on a future fishing trip. Settling into a new oasis, he remembered: “Off to my right, I heard a bit of a bang, and then I could hear running. “As it was running, it was smashing trees out of the way. I don’t knowthey were breaking or it was hitting them, you couldn’t see what the bush was like because it was so thick.The Mirroraposs newsletter brings you the latest news, exciting showbiz and TV stories, sport updates and essential political information.The newsletter is emailed out first thing every morning, at noon and every evening. Never miss a moment by signing up to our newsletter here.  The creature, John explained, then started roaring. “I’d never heard anything like it in my le,” he said. “It would roar, and then it would take a breath in, but then the breath it was taking was actually louder than the roar it was doing.” Scrambling to get out of the water and chucking his haul back in, John claimed: “This creature just went to another level and it was crazy. He added: “I could hear in my head something saying, ‘go now or you’ll die’… It wasn’t my own voice, my own consciousness, it was something . “That  minutes was probably the longest in my whole le, I thought I was going to be killed. I had no weapons, didn’t even have my fishing kne, no phone service.” Eventually, John was able to escape in his car, and now claimed that he is sharing his story to protect others. He continued: “I’d heard about it [the Dogman], and thought it was a joke, but actually I’ve had encounters with it now and it’s terrying. “I wouldn’t be putting myself out showing these photosit was a fake, or I didn’t know that there was actually something there. “That’s the main reason I came forward, I’m worried that someone’s going to go missing or get hurt, and I’ll have it in the back of my mind that I should have told someone about that.” Comment MORE ON Stalking\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The spray has scents of metal, leather and glass and is designed to smell like the inside of a cockpit in Russiaaposs deadly new stealth fighter jet.The aftershave has been released to promote the Kremlinaposs new Rostecaposs fth-generation Sukhoi Su- aposCheckmateapos warplane.The light, single engine tactical fighter can reportedly fly at speeds of . times the speed of sound, has a range of , kilometers and a payload of , kg. Do you have a story  Email webnews@mirror It is tipped to hit the skies in . Checkmate aftershave bottles are modelled on a black chess piece and it uses the strapline turn the chess board - appearing to liken war to a game. A sinister Rostec video plugging the scent also features a Sukhoi Su- bomber, and a narrator who sounds like something out of Squid Game.  Speaking over ominous music, a narrator says: While the majority are hesitating, there is a handful of those who change the world. While the majority are playing by the rules, a few rewrite the rules to suit themselves. Only special pieces can turn the tide of the game. Checkmate is a fth-generation fragrance, for masters of the game.  The video seems to refer to Russian President Putinaposs reputation for flouting international rules to advance the Kremlinaposs geopolitical interests. The advert comes amid rising tensions between Russia and NATO allies. Russia is reportedly amassing troops on the Ukrainian border sparking fears of another invasion. It also sent nuclear bombers to patrol the skies over Belarus earlier this month, supporting dictator Alexander Lukashenko, who stands accused of orchestrating a migrant crisis by pushing asylum seekers towards the Polish border.  A Rostec spokesperson said: Checkmate fighter jet-scented perfume created in Russia The notes of the fragrance combine the scents of glass, natural leather and metals used in the construction of the fuselage, engines and cockpit of the aircraft. But some people mocked the product on social media, with one person blasting: Please tell me, what are scents of glass Because that sounds like asbestos.  Another person quipped: Awesome, canapost start my day without kerosene. A third troll slammed: The perfume is stealth perfume so itaposs actually water. President of the Perfumers Guild of Russia Oksana Chernyshova said: This technogenic chord permeates everything: from the creation of the machine by Russian designers and engineers to the aircraft itself, which is just as much a living being consisting of metal structures and mechanisms. And it also breathes as it flies and feeds on the fuel! Limited edition bottles of Checkmate perfume were touted at the Dubai Airshow in UAE this week, where the jet prototype was also showcased.

Star failed to clear the danger from a cross and the unfortunate Coll McCallum erted into his own net past Leon Murphy.The Arthurlie equaliser arrived with  minutes remaining when winger Sean Ross cut inside before unleashing a spectacular effort into the top corner.The hosts would have been expected to go on and win the game from here but the Star defence remained well-organised and resolute and a fine goalkeeping performance from Leon Murphy ensured the Lochgilphead side ed home with a well-earned point.Star put their unbeaten league record on the line on Saturday November  when they welcome fellow Argyll side Cardross to the Joint Campus G.

It is expected that MV Argyle, which like Bute can carry  passengers,  cars is due to take MV Coruisks place after she comes out of her overhaul. The vessel is due out on Friday.One Argyll and Bute councillor Liz McCabe said she had had contact over the weekend from CalMac to say they have not been able to get to the root cause of damage to the engine on MV Bute and that there will have to have a one vehicle service for \"some time\".She said she was told it will be out of service until December  at the earliest.MV Argyle was currently in dry dock at Gourock until November , however when she comes out of dry dock and MV Coruisk will go in.\"It looks like we will have one vehicle for some time which is absolutely shocking and just not good enough,\" she said.Services were cancelled on Friday morning when problems with one of the main engines of Bute first emerged on Thursday night.:Revealed: Execs extended working le of Scotlands beleaguered ferry fleet by  years in ruseCalMac withdrew the vessel from Saturday because as the problems continued.As a new one-vessel was put into operation, CalMac \"strongly advised\" passengers that as vehicle space would be \"very limited\" that \"where possible to travel by foot\".The state-controlled ferry operator advised thattravel with a vehicle is necessary passengers should \"please consider\" travelling through an alternative Bute route from Colintraive to Rhubodach.That would involve a  mile detour from Wemyss Bay. Rhubodach is eight miles away from Rothesay.It is the latest in a summer of issues with breakdowns and Covid issues involving Scotlands ageing ferry fleet.Transport minister Graeme Dey has said attempts were being made to ease the ferry crisis by purchasing another ferry.The breakdown in April of Scotlands biggest publicly-run ferry MV Loch Seaforth, which operates on the Stornoway to Ullapool route, caused disruption across the islands network for seven weeks.Islanders from Arran to Islay have lodged complaints to ministers about disruption and cancellations to services as the ageing Scottish ferry fleet falters.While industry experts agree the working le of the ferries is  years,  of the -strong ferry fleet run is older than that, with eight, including Hebridean Isles, past their th birthday.Glen Sannox in dock last year.The delivery of new island ferries MV Glen Sannox and Hull , still languishing in Ferguson Marine shipyard, which were due online in the first half of , was found to be over four years late with costs doubling to over poundm.Tommy Gore, Clyde area operations manager for CalMac, said: ldquoMV Bute has been taken off service for further investigation into the cause of an engine fault, and we have been advised that this work may take up to  days. A single vessel will operate between Rothesay and Wemyss Bay in the meantime.

She explained that a formal decision on this would be announced next Tuesday, and that consultation with businesses would take place later this week.The First Minister said that extension of the scheme is likely to include a broader scope of businesses, such as indoor cinemas, theatres and other hospitality venues.

She has urged all business owners and employers to think carefully and #look again# at whether their employees can be supported to work from home, this winter.#While we hope we will get through winter without introducing further restrictions, we do have a duty to keep proportionate options under review,# she said.#We are publishing an updated strategic framework today, covering some of the issues have already summarised.#Finally, the First Minister urged the nation to stick as closely to the current guidance as possible in order to prevent the spread of COVID-.

More than  people and organisations contributed to the Toolkit, whose development was supported by the Scottish Government.And Stromness will be among the communities highlighted as a prime example of success as the toolkit is discussed at the Scotland’s Towns Conference on Friday, November .The toolkit highlights how more than a decade of investment has helped revitalise the area, including the new £m Copland’s dock, the Orkney Research and Innovation Campus, and the creation of a new arts centre.Explaining the reasons for the community’s success, town planner Nick Wright, who developed the toolkit for STP and will highlight Stromness at the conference, said: “Everyone pulls together, making the most of every opportunity.“This is an ambitious community where people aren’t afraid to muck in and make things happen — with strong political will and a clear plan of modernising Stromness while maintaining its historical elegance.”That work includes the  year multi-million pound investments secured from the Lottery and Historic Environment Scotland to restore and modernise the town centre. Working with local landowners and organisations, these schemes restored  vacant or dilapidated historic buildings, improved shops, created new business spaces, and revitalised the town’s streets and spaces.Nick Wright added: “This toolkit is about sharing that wealth of experience from across the country — showing that you can do it because it’s been done before. It’s about how to make things happen — a one-stop-shop on how to make towns the best they can be.”While inspiring communities and groups, it is also hoped that the toolkit will prove useful for local authority officials working in planning, community development, leisure, transport and the economy when considering developments in their region, as well as for politicians at every level.For more information, go to www.towntoolkit.scot.

It is important that those who are convincedcan demonstrate.#Addressing the potential for far-reaching consequences to impact people across the world, she said: #We are cushioned now to some extent, although people in the UK have had to suffer from flooding, wildfires, and drought.“Much of our food comes from overseas, andpeople will have to migrate and find somewhere  to live # so people will be moving around the world, so places that are nice and comfortable now might then receive other people.#A huge element of this issue is about all the youngsters and children # the more carbon we put into the atmosphere, the more trouble that they will have to face, meaning there will be less chance for them to turn the situation around.#This issue is critically important.”On Friday th November, as the conference is expected to be closing, there will be a candlelight vigil in Somerled Square in Portree from .-pm.Ms MacLennan added: “There is a sense that people want to show solidarity with what#s happening at COP in Glasgow, and they want to be able to express their concerns.#Holding it in Portree makes it more accessible for people in the north of the island, because Saturday#s march over the bridge is a long way for people further north to travel to be involved, especiallyit is a dreadful day.#For those unable to attend Saturday#s march over the bridge, everyone is of course welcome to walk over the bridge with signage at any point at the weekend.“It might be good for people to be wandering over the bridge to and fro at dferent times to help convey the message.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Uist-beach-Floraidh-Forrest.jpg","title":"climate change and the hebrides the rising sea and an eerily prophetic","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineFor those acquainted with Gaelic oral lore, it cannot be denied that there is something intensely perceptive, and eerily prophetic, about the traditions tied to the steady ingress of the sea.Since time immemorial, the mental record-keeping of a coastal people has documented and predicted the near imperceptible, yet near constant, rise of the waters since the Ice Age. century.In Tobar an Dualchais, there are numerous recordings illustrating similar examples where the sea has conquered the land.In one example from , Dòmhnall MacCuinn and Dòmhnall Ailean MacCuinn were recorded describing old domestic ruins seen at extreme low tides over a mile from the shore in An t-Ìochdar .These homesteads must have once been on dry land, they surmise.In Tracks   , the collector Dòmhnall Eairdsidh Dòmhnallach of the School of Scottish Studies asks Dòmhnall Alasdair Johnson about submerged places near An t-Ìochdar, including Sgeir na h-Àtha – The Skerry of the Barn.Similar shore names which incorporate terrestrial features dot the seascape of Uist and evidence the widely held belief that the machair once stretched much further into the west.Anxieties tied to coastal le were not only informed by past experience and day-to-day observation they also manested themselves in people’s visions of the future.There is a prophecy, for example, retold by Dòmhnall Alasdair Johnson in Track . It presages that the Ìochdar shoreline will soon be as far inland as A’ Bhuaile Dhubh and An Càrnan, close to where the old Church of Scotland is.He remarks that such an outcome isn’t all that farfetched, considering the severity of coastal erosion in the area.Alexander Carmichael, the folklorist and compiler of Carmina Gadelica, also published several climactic prophecies. He was fascinated by these histories and repeatedly drew attention to the submerged remains of houses, temples and tree-roots in his writings.A poem collected in Lìonacuithe in  prophesies the flooding of the Atlantic: “The walls of the churches shall be the fishing-rocks of the people, while the resting-place of the dead shall be a forest of tangles, among whose mazes the pale-faced mermaid, the marled seal, and the brown otter shall race and run and leap and gambol, like the children of men at play.”The approaching catastrophe so arrestingly depicted in this verse parallels many of the same fears voiced by coastal communities today.Indeed, such predications are the reality for hundreds of millions of people across the globe. The most recent UN report on climate change published in August  warned that we could see the ocean ascend nearly  metre by the end of the century.Such outcomes will threaten many of these societies existentially. Island nations such as the Males and Tuvalu will disappear.Cities, including New York City, Shanghai and Kolkata, will be exposed to coastal flooding by . Bangladesh could lose up to a fth of its land mass, displacing -million people. century is our frightening reality.In Scotland, low-lying areas with soft coasts of machair are particularly vulnerable, especially those at the edge of the Atlantic like Islay, Tiree and Uist.In addition to the constant erosion on the western edges of Uist, there is a further struggle in low-lying areas.Drainage is critical, as any crofter will tell you.Sufficient and well-maintained drains allow water to flow to the ocean. When there is heavy rainfall – a trend that is due to intensy in the UK in the future, drains alleviate inland flooding.In South Uist, a large drain is called a “lig”, a term associated with letting water.There are several main lige systems in South Uist and some are apparent in placenames. There is An Lige Mòr in Dalabrog, An Lige Mòr in Loch Aoineart, Loch Bun an Ligidh in Dreumasdal and Loch an Ligidh at the western terminus of Loch Bì.While the ligidhean today act as drains, most of these sizeable watercourses were likely built as canals to transport goods.This is reflected in the oral tradition of Uist that most of the machair lochs were once connected by ligidhean.In Track , Dòmhnall MacAonghais of Taobh a Deas Ghleann Dail credits the Norse with the original construction of the canals, which ran from Poll a’ Charra to An t-Ìochdar. He says that the waterways were used in place of roads. Track  runs into Track , where Dòmhnall says that there were three places where the Norse wintered their fleets, at An t-Ìochdar, An Ròdha Glas in Cill Donnain, and at Poll a’ Charra.Interestingly, these places correspond to locations where there are manmade drains running to the Atlantic Ocean.Regardless of their actual origin, which is the subject of ongoing research, the ligidhean of South Uist endure as critical infrastructure against flooding.As sea levels rise, however, the drains are rendered less effective due to the reduction in the height between the inland water table and the sea.This gets so bad during some springtides that saltwater can even flow back into the freshwater system, risking the salinisation of the ecosystem.The threat of climate change and sea-level rise unites coastal communities across the world.It is imperative that the COP debates take notice of these voices and reflect on the cumulative experience and knowledge of these societies.Gaelic is only one voice, and there are numerous other climate threads and themes, from within Tobar an Dualchais and without, which couldn’t be included into such a short article.We can only guess at the breadth and depth of information about climate change that exists in other endangered and indigenous languages across the globe.This information is not only relevant to fully understanding the crises we face they may also point to a way out of them."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_4193378.jpg--.jpg?1635492771000\n","title":"frightful fun for all at hallowena 2021","story":"THE People’s Park, Ballymena will host one of the scariest nights of the year on Friday, October , from pm to .pm.The free event, organised by Mid and East Antrim Borough Council, will thrill and chill with a packed programme of spooktacular activities for your little monsters to enjoy, with a huge walking dragon, fire juggling display, a fancy dress competition, a kiddies funfair, live music from The VIPs and a spooky illumination trail.You can sink your fangs into some sweet treats or tasty hot food to beat those Halloween hunger pangs, while the fun and festivities will finish with a fangtastic fireworks finale at .pm.Why not have your own #MEAdventure in the park  Outdoor areas including the brand new play equipment will be accessible during the event and there will be a free kiddies fun fair to entertain your little terrors.Wandering ghouls and spine tingling figures will be ready to spook you at every turn with a few hair-raising special additions.Follow the extended spooky illumination trail throughout the park and bump into some familiar characters along the way!Mayor of Mid and East Antrim, Councillor William McCaughey, encouraged everyone to join in the Hallowena fun: “It is a great delight for us to be able to safely welcome our community to events this year and the Hallowena celebrations are always among the most popular on Council’s entertainment programme.“There is literally something for ghosts and goblins of all ages to enjoy on Friday  October in the stunning People’s Park in Ballymena, and I am really excited about the evening.“I am privileged to welcome everyone in our community to the park for some spooktacular fun, and I encourage those attending to observe the necessary public health guidelines so that we can protect ourselves and those around us.”There are over  off-street car park spaces within a -minute walk of People’s Park so make an evening of it with a visit to any of the fantastic shops or restaurants in the town.Parking for blue badge holders is available from pm at the People’s Park council car park off the Ballymoney Road.To help with a safe set-up of the site People’s Park will be closed to all members of the public on Friday  October until the event starts at pm.For everyone’s safety dogs, alcohol or fireworks are not permitted in the park and under s must have a responsible adult with them.Admission is free and no tickets are required.Visitors to the Hallowena event are asked to use the hand sanitisers provided and observe social distancing.

Credit: Mal McCann FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueSafety measure: People in Belfast city centre wear masks and use hand sanitiser while out shopping. Credit: Mal McCannLisa SmythTwitterNovember   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailLast week, the BMJ published research which suggests handwashing, face coverings and social distancing are associated with reduced transmission of Covid-.Despite the fact the first two, at least, are low cost and easy to implement, the Northern Ireland Executive has been locked away once again debating the merits of face coverings as part of a last-ditch attempt to avoid strict restrictions in the run-up to Christmas.Health Minister Robin Swann reportedly wants Justice Minister Naomi Long to oversee enforcement of face masks, while the Alliance leader has said the onus should be on inidual businesses to ensure people adhere to legislation.So, how have we reached this point, particularly when we know face coverings do help reduce the spread of Covid- There aren’t any figures that demonstrate definitively that fewer people are adhering to face covering legislation but it’s clear to anyone going into any public space where they are required that there has been a drop off in their use.Mark Tully, a professor in public health at Ulster University, said the problem is not unique to Northern Ireland: “We have always had an anti-establishment sentiment in Northern Ireland and there is certainly some of that at play here.“However, I think it is more to do with apathy, although it isn’t confined to Northern Ireland.“I speak to colleagues in other countries like Denmark and they’re having exactly the same experience as we’re having with a drop off in the number of people wearing face coverings.”Instead, Prof Tully said the conflicting positions from politicians has played a role, while the declining use of face coverings can also be attributed to the way the mind works.“I don’t think the First Minister coming out with his remarks that he wanted restrictions like face coverings done away with by the end of September was particularly helpful,” he said.“That was a message coming from an authority figure which essentially said that face coverings weren’t of value any longer.“We’re also hard-wired to think quickly, so we use heuristics to make decisions on past experiences.“We observe the world around us and take a cue from that to make decisions about what we’re going to do.“That meanswe go into a number of places and people aren’t wearing face coverings and we’re in that position again, we’re less likely to wear one as well, orwe walk into a room and no-one  is wearing a mask, then we’re more likely to take ours off too.“It all comes from the cues we’re getting.“We have also had a gradual releasing of ious measures, there are dferent rules when it comes to face coverings as well, which has created issues.”Prof Tully continued: “People also don’t seem to feel as threatened by Covid like they once were, they don’t think it’s going to be as bad as they did in the early stages of the pandemic.“But I think they need to remember that wearing a face covering isn’t necessarily about protecting themselves, it’s about protecting the people around them.“For example, when I’m lecturing I wear a mask because I don’t want to spread Covid to other people.“I think it’s disappointing that as a society we aren’t taking this cheap and easy step to look after each other when possible.”Related topicsRobin SwannNaomi LongUlster Unionist PartyAlliance

One senior position was advertised at paying a salary of between £, and £,.The personal details of six candidates, including home addresses, previous employment and education, phone numbers, email addresses and personal references, were all contained in a folder abandoned in the set of office drawers. The majority of the documents were linked to the Belfast Health and Social Care Trust. There were also a small number linked to the South Eastern Health Trust.They included a claim form for ordering a vehicle under the Business Lease Scheme. It revealed the employee’s £, salary, address, and make and model of the car they leased under the scheme.A personal address book full of contacts was among the bundle of documents. As was a report commissioned to allow staff to talk about safety concerns.The majority of documents appear to be dated around  , though some dated back to .One showed that issues around patient safety predates the recent pandemic.A questionnaire filled out by a senior member of nursing staff highlighted a number of signicant failings on a Belfast hospital ward.It stated staff training, patient falls and infection control as the three major areas of concern for nursing staff.It added that problems with managing infection control included a “bedpan washer frequently out of order due to faults or lack of detergent”.The report dated July  stated that a housekeeper post on the ward had been vacant for almost a year, and that staff nurse vacancy posts needed filled.Many of the documents related to job recruitment and staff salaries. One labelled ‘Confidential’ and dated  outlined the trust’s considerations linked to paying social care staff the national living wage.It gave confidential budget breakdowns of the cost of providing domiciliary care to older people and those with mental health and learning disabilities.The loss of such a large quantity of highly personal and sensitive information is believed to be the biggest data breach since the loss of patients’ details at Belvoir Park Hospital.The Belfast Health Trust was fined £, after records were found abandoned in the disused hospital, which closed in . The Information Commissioner imposed the fine because the trust failed to secure confidential files.The watchdog received new powers in  allowing it to impose fines on public bodies which failed to secure personal data.Responding to the data breach, the Belfast Trust said “Thank you for bringing this matter to our attention. “The trust takes the handling of personal sensitive data very seriously.“In order to further investigate and report the breach to the ICO, we would require copy of the documents to evaluate where the data has come from.“The trust would wish to undertake a thorough internal investigation and report same in line with the Health and Social Care incident management process.” The South Eastern Trust said: “Thank you for bringing this matter to our attention. “The South Eastern HSC Trust takes the handling of personal sensitive data very seriously. “In order to further investigate and report the breach to the ICO, we would require copy of the documents to evaluate where the data has come from.“The trust would wish to undertake a thorough internal investigation and report same in line with the Health and Social Care incident management process.”The Information Commissioner’s Office said: “We’ve been made aware of a potential incident and will assess any further details.”Most ReadDUP critic Guy Spence now a DJ in FalklandsRevealed: East Belfast has the highest Covid- death toll in all of NIDUP’s Frew under fire over meeting with woman who abused Swann onlineOwner of Draperstown sweet firm ‘Greedy Gwin’: ‘I aimed too high and my sweet business turned sour’UDA’s Poppy Day disgrace: Insult as Fisher leads terror group on Remembrance paradeTop VideosPlayWhat happened on day four of Cop  \"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news df .ece AUTOCROP wh dabdccecfccdecfdbb.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news df .ece AUTOCROP wh dabdccecfccdecfdbb.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   \"PlayVideo: Hundreds gather to party in Belfast Holyland area as new term beginsPlayAnti-vaccine passport protest takes place at Belfast City HallLatest Northern IrelandExecutive slammed over decisions as it discusses new Covid curbsSilence from Orange Order after members attend Tweed’s funeralNI Covid restrictions: Apathy and mixed messages to blame for drop off in wearing of masks, says professorMore than  firefighters tackling industrial blazeNI education welfare officers to go on strike from end of NovemberLatestWhat the papers say – November John SimpsonOpinionHow companies were able to qualy for the Top  for David BrazielOpinionHow firms should cope with events like Covid-Andrew WebbOpinionIs Northern Ireland’s economic recovery built to last Ann McGregor​​​​​​​OpinionIt’s time for Northern Ireland to plan for a more digital future,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

He had  prior convictions for offences including theft and  were for road traffic charges. He also had a conviction from  when he was given a six-year sentence for impeding the apprehension or prosecution of a person for the offence of murder in .His prior offences had a “wide geographical range” around the country.Det Supt O’Leary agreed with Michael O’Higgins SC, for YZ, that the history of the Quinn group was very well known. The company was a very high profile employer on both sides of the border before it ran into dficulty, got into a situation with Anglo Irish Bank and incurred substantial liabilities, Mr O’Higgins said.The insurance company got dragged into that and there were other circumstances arising from the global crash which resulted in the Quinn family losing control of the business.In the aftermath, some local people took sides and there were incidents but “this would appear to be of a dferent order”.Read More‘People don’t care who runs Quinn’s company… things have moved on’‘I will do anything in my power to get those boys out’ – defiant Seán Quinn determined to settle old scoresThreat to Quinn executives won’t be over until the puppet master is finally revealedMr O’Higgins suggested the intention was to remove people from the company to create vacancies for other people. Any benefit that would have flowed from it “was not going to benefit YZ”, who was not going to have any part in the company, he said.Mr O’Higgins suggested there would have been a pyramid of involvement with people at the top who would have benefittedthe venture succeeded.There were people below that who were hired to execute the plan, and lower than that were people who “did the dirty work, the muscle” and that, according to the prosecution, would have been YZ. Det Supt O’Leary agreed. O’Brien, a father-of-three, had amassed  convictions, Dept Supt O’Leary said. His convictions dated back to . In , he was given a suspended sentence for robbing an elderly man in Virginia, Co Cavan, of £,.Giollaíosa Ó Lideadha SC for O’Brien, said his client had had signicant drug addiction issues. He was sentenced in his teens, with no offences for  years until  when his mother died and he got back into drug use. There was a pattern of relatively minor offending to get money to buy drugs.Det Supt O’Leary agreed that O’Brien would also have been at the lowest end of the scale described by Mr O’Higgins.Redmond, a father-of-one, lived with his parents, had lost a brother recently in tragic circumstances and had two surviving siblings.He had only two prior convictions, for possession of a kne and criminal damage, both imposed in the district court. He was put on a peace bond for one and given a suspended sentence on the other.Redmond had found his brother who passed away in his bed, of a massive heart attack, his barrister Michael Bowman SC said, describing the family tragedy.The prosecution’s case would place Redmond at the lower end even of the circumstances of the crimes before the court, he said. He had not displayed any propensity for involvement in offences “even close to this” before.None of the three had any appreciable employment history, Det Supt O’Leary said.In a victim impact statement, read out to the court by Detective Garda Linda Harkin, Mr Lunney said he knew the physical scars and mental trauma of the events of September , , would remain with him and his family for the rest of their lives.He said he thought every day about the effects it had had on his family, who had been “my rock and my refuge”.The anguish his family had had to endure has been of greater torment to him than the physical pain of the attack, he said.He hoped and prayed that they could remain resilient. Mr Lunney said he was also aware of the toll on his work colleagues and said he respected them and thanked them for their courage and fortitude.He would be forever grateful for the raw emotion and solidarity that emerged from a march held after his abduction, as well as the wishes of many friends and strangers.“It has been a long and dficult journey, in this trial,” he said, and he had the utmost respect for the court and everyone involved in ensuring the rule of law was upheld. However, he said he was mindful that the “journey to full accountability” was not yet complete.Mr Lunney said he did not know the accused and did not know the reason they did what they did.“I don’t know why they decided to do what they did. I don’t know them and they don’t know me,” he said.“I am saddened at a human level that they have ruined their own lives with their actions,” he said, and sympathised with their families.He could not fathom “the intent or reasoning that encouraged and enticed them to commit this crime”, he said.“I trust that those involved now realise that there will never be a place in our community for violence or any other form of intimidation,” he said. “I thank the man who found me on the roadside and the others who stopped and attended, who in so doing, saved my le,” he said.He also thanked the doctors and nurses who “nursed me back to health”, and the gardaí and PSNI. Prosecutor Sean Guerin SC asked the court to lt a prohibition on identying YZ in the media. Mr Justice Tony Hunt said the reporting restriction would continue until midnight on December . The three accused were further remanded in custody pending sentence.Related topicsKevin LunneyMore On Kevin Lunney Premium‘People don’t care who runs Quinn’s company… things have moved on’ PremiumThreat to Quinn executives won’t be over until the puppet master is finally revealedUnmask ‘paymaster’ to end Kevin Lunney campaign of violence, urges Mannok director McCartin PremiumMen guilty of Kevin Lunney abduction and torture have links to organised crimeKevin Lunney torture was ‘inflicted with a sense of purpose’, court toldMost ReadDUP critic Guy Spence now a DJ in FalklandsRevealed: East Belfast has the highest Covid- death toll in all of NIDUP’s Frew under fire over meeting with woman who abused Swann onlineOwner of Draperstown sweet firm ‘Greedy Gwin’: ‘I aimed too high and my sweet business turned sour’UDA’s Poppy Day disgrace: Insult as Fisher leads terror group on Remembrance paradeTop VideosPlayWhat happened on day four of Cop  \"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news df .ece AUTOCROP wh dabdccecfccdecfdbb.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news df .ece AUTOCROP wh dabdccecfccdecfdbb.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   \"PlayVideo: Hundreds gather to party in Belfast Holyland area as new term beginsPlayAnti-vaccine passport protest takes place at Belfast City HallLatest Northern IrelandConcern as ICU nurses quit jobs amid mounting crisis at the Belfast Health TrustHundreds of sensitive Belfast Health Trust files are found in desk bought at charity shopExecutive slammed over decisions as it discusses new Covid curbsSilence from Orange Order after members attend Tweed’s funeralNI Covid restrictions: Apathy and mixed messages to blame for drop off in wearing of masks, says professorLatestConcern as ICU nurses quit jobs amid mounting crisis at the Belfast Health TrustHundreds of sensitive Belfast Health Trust files are found in desk bought at charity shopWhat the papers say – November John SimpsonOpinionHow companies were able to qualy for the Top  for David BrazielOpinionHow firms should cope with events like Covid-,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The families are hoping to raise as much money as they can for Foyle Hospice and HURT, an addiction services charity in the city. After the popularity of last year’s lights, which were put up in a bid to cheer everyone up during lockdown, the neighbours decided to go bigger and better this year. People across Derry are heading down to feast their eyes on the amazing winter wonderland display. Laura Meehan, a resident of Racecourse Drive, said she and all the neighbours love the buzz on the street. “There’s always been a couple of houses on the street that have been heavily decorated. Then more and more neighbours asked for theirs to be done. “So, this year, back in January, we all said we would do a big fundraising event this year. There is a donation box in the centre of the street and all the money is counted and split evenly at the end of the night. “You don’t have to pay to see the street, but you can donate in the wee box. We just ask that cars drive slowly because there are kids running around the street. “From five o’clock onwards, the street does not empty but the atmosphere is brilliant. All the neighbours and kids are running around the street. A woman at the top of the street was even making hot chocolates the other night. So many people came down to see the street last year and this year has been really busy already. I think it’s only going to get bigger each year. “This street is the beststreet to live on, everyone is so friendly and looks after each other. It is so lovely and we are so proud.” Residents are askingany companies could please donate selection boxes for when Santa visits throughout December.

David said: “Each winning photographer received their own copy of the calendar and an organic cotton Trek NI beanie hat.“I know the judges found it really tough choosing just  images from those sent in, such was the overall quality of the submissions.  per cent of every sale goes to PIPS charity, a non-profit organisation which provides crisis support for those at risk of suicide or self-harm. David continued: “ was obviously an incredibly dficult year for everyone due to the onset of the coronavirus pandemic and restrictions imposed on everyday le because of it. “Mental health, which was already a major issue for many around the world, was exacerbated further by isolation and loneliness. “PIPS do fantastic work with those suffering from poor mental health, especiallytheyve considered suicide, so we wanted to help support their efforts this time round.” Trek NI is an online resource and eco-friendly brand inspired by Northern Ireland that connects local businesses with a highly-engaged local audience, championing everything Northern Ireland has to offer.

Local actress, Rachael O’Connor, will play the lead alongside popular funny man, William Caulfield, who reprises his role as Dame Nanny Cranny. googletag.cmd.push Karen Hawthorne s as the evil Carabosse. Local actor, Conor O’Kane, will play Prince Charming and Orla Mullan as the Lilac Fairy with Keith Lynch as the loveable sidekick, Pickles. It’s been two years since the city has seen a pantomime performed at Christmas due to Covid restrictions. Rachael O’Connor said she is looking forward to ing to the Derry stage after a long time of restrictions and lockdown. The -year-old said:“Its so nice being back in the rehearsal room again. I did my last show in January . Its been such a long time for us all to get here, but weve got here.” Rachael originally trained for theatre in the Millennium Forum when she was  and at just  years old, she appeared on the Voice UK as the youngest contestant in team Kylie Minogue. Rachael went on to perform with Michael Flatley’s Lord of the Dance on the London Palladium stage. Most recently, Rachael has taken to the stage with legendary band ‘DuranDuran’ as backing vocalist on ious shows such as Isle of Wight Festival and The Jonathan Ross Show. The Derry native played Snow White in  at Millennium Forum and loves to perform to a home crowd. She said: “I loved playing Snow White in Derry last time and its funny because when I was younger, my Granny would have taken me and my cousins every year to the pantomime, it was an annual thing. “I was always jealous of all the children on the stage thinking ‘I wish that was me’ and then here we are. Derry is such a great crowd to perform in front of because everyones so supportive and everyone cheers and getsinvolvedand theyre just so lovely. I do always get nervous, especially on the opening night, just because its your first time doing it in front of a real audience, but at the minute Im more excited than nervous.” The pantomime is set to run  shows throughout the winter season beginning November  and wrapping up on January . Rachael’s co-star, Conor O’Kane, set to play Prince Charming in the production, said it is amazing to be back rehearsing again after such a long time away. The -year-old Derry man said: “This is the biggest show that Ive done sinceCOVID. I think a lot of us are thinking the same, with getting the voices back in gear and getting the body back in gear, but everyone is in the same boat and we are all ready and excited, we’re flying. “Everyone is looking and sounding great. Everyone cannot wait to get back to those local audiences for the first Christmas panto in two years.” Conor is   of The Four Harps and is a co-founder ofGOLEM!a company specialising in repurposing and reimagining original texts. He was also nominated ‘Best Male in a Musical by Off West End for his performance in ‘Miss Nightingale’ at The Vaults in . Conor played alongside Rachael in the  production of Snow White at the Forum and said It is lovely to be back working alongside her and sharing the stage with his niece Olivia.

Rachael O’Connor said she is looking forward to ing to the Derry stage after a long time of restrictions and lockdown. The -year-old said:“Its so nice being back in the rehearsal room again. I did my last show in January .

Derry is such a great crowd to perform in front of because everyones so supportive and everyone cheers and getsinvolvedand theyre just so lovely. I do always get nervous, especially on the opening night, just because its your first time doing it in front of a real audience, but at the minute Im more excited than nervous.” The pantomime is set to run  shows throughout the winter season beginning November  and wrapping up on January .

I think a lot of us are thinking the same, with getting the voices back in gear and getting the body back in gear, but everyone is in the same boat and we are all ready and excited, we’re flying. “Everyone is looking and sounding great. Everyone cannot wait to get back to those local audiences for the first Christmas panto in two years.” Conor is   of The Four Harps and is a co-founder ofGOLEM!a company specialising in repurposing and reimagining original texts.

She co-founded successful online learning company Learning Pool in Derry in . Today, she works extensively with start-ups and scaling tech companies. She is one of the co-founders of cross-border social enterprise and female founder community AwakenHub and she is part of the EU’s flagship EIC Accelerator innovation team. googletag.cmd.push -------------------------------------------- A few weeks ago Digital DNA’s Simon Bailie asked me to write a short piece about Derry for DDNA’s Top Tech Companies in NIreport. Simon asked me to cover the Derry tech scene – how it’s altered in the almost  years I’ve been working in the city and perhaps more importantly, what the missing ingredients are that would make the Maiden City’s tech scene really sing. I enjoyed writing it and was surprised to find that no-one  has written about this. Here’s what I had to say in full. How much has the Derry tech scene changed  I began working in Derry in . I moved from Belfast where I’d been global CFO in one of QUB’s semiconductor IP spinouts.I’d spent a good bit of my time in the early noughties in Silicon Valley and Derry in  couldn’t have been further from San Jose. The only similarity was that the streets were completely deserted by .pm. When I told my friends in Belfast that I was taking a job in Derry they all tried to talk me out of it. I remember trying to recruit a team in  and talent was very thin on the ground. Most of the local workforce were lers in one of the FDIs or they commuted to tech jobs in either Belfast or Letterkenny. The local tech scene back then was dominated by the prominent FDIs Seagate  Allstate , big fish Singularityand a never-ending raft of call centres and it was populated by revered avuncular middle-aged men like Bro McFerran and Dr Alan McClure. Anyone calling the HP or Expedia customer help lines back in the day would’ve been greeted by a Derry accent, way before it was trendy. We started Learning Pool in London in  and quickly moved the company to Derry because it was bootstrap-affordable and because of the ready talent graduating from Magee. We couldn’t afford to hire an experienced team so we recruited new graduates with the right attitude and trained them. We didn’t have an office so we took a few desks in theshockingly haphazard co-working space at the university. Even though the space was supposed to be reserved for new startups, a few companies had been renting in there forever so we ended up with desks dotted here and there in random parts of the floor. No-one in our team could sit together and the co-working space manager constantly shushed us whenever we took phone calls and harped on forever about the washing-up. We had a desktop PC in the corner with a paper notice sellotaped to the top of it which read DO NOT SWITCH OFF  Today there’s a stable of promising scaling tech companies choosing to base themselves in Derry. Established companies likeElemental Software  Newer entrants like medtech company Respiratory Analytics, cyber security companyITUSand caretech challenger startupInCharge. Many companies keep one foot in Derry and the other in Donegal, thus preserving their EU status for access to customers and funding. Catalyst Incopened its doors in  on the historic Fort George site just outside the city and has been a great formal addition to the fabric of the local ecosystem. Other active startup supports likeStartacusand new island of Ireland female founder community AwakenHubare anchored in Derry. Today, the local tech scene is younger, more female, less formal, more global, well educated and informed and definitely ambitious. A lot of newer founders have lived away from Ireland for a while but are electing tohome and settle down, build a business. Catalyst’s Co-Founders programme has uncovered some interesting nascent companies. Some of those new graduates that I recruited back in  or  have gone on to found their own startups. That’s how ecosystems work. The FDIs are still present but they’re less dominant today. They don’t have a lot of employee churn and just tick along in the background, largely behind closed doors. They bring employment to an area of Northern Ireland that badly needs it and they sponsor the odd event and programme. Many of the call centres seem to have been bought over and have disappeared. Innovation and all the interesting stuff happens in the smaller, agile companies around the edges and this is what we need more of. As well as the FDIs we now have the presence of indigenous scaleups like Kainosand FinTru. It would be great to see a few more like these moving in but high quality office space is an issue. Maybe not so important in the future we’re facing post-COVID. The traditional talent pool has extended from the Bann well into Donegal and in Derry I’ve worked beside people who’ve commuted daily from as far afield as Ballycastle and Creeslough. Missing Ingredients If it was Christmas morning and I could have three wishes to improve the tech sector ecosystem in the North West this is what I would wish for: - An ambitious cross-border university named after the late John Hume with campuses in both Derry and Donegaland strong links into the powerful North West diaspora that stretches from Philadelphia to London to Singapore. I’m always impressed by the vibrant startup scene that exists in Letterkenny as a result of the numerous overseas students and researchers who come to LYIT for academic reasons and end up staying. This new university to be fastened at the hip to a well funded and well resourced startup, student and alumni accelerator regime like Oxford University has withOxford Foundrywhich in turn connects firmly into sources of venture finance, a bit likeEDEMin the marina in Valencia - A Derry-Letterkenny- Sligo-Galway Economic Corridor along the Wild Atlantic Way to mirror the Belfast-Dublin corridor that was formally announced in the east of the island last month. This to connect the opportunities that will naturally flow from the new Magee Medical School to the vibrant medtech cluster of companies and investors in Galway and to link in with the newly reinvigorated Western Development Commissionand the string of Atlantic hubs the Irish State has invested in over recent years. I am encouraged by news of a new cross-border scaling hub led by Catalyst Inc  LYIT which will be built in the image of thePortershedGalway model - A focus placed on determining how Derry and indeed all of Northern Ireland can tangibly and quickly benefit from being so close to an EU border in the post-Brexit world. Can Derry compete with Belfast  This was a provocative question posed by Simon in his brief to me. In my view, this is not the right question and shouldn’t be part of anyone’s ambition. Any venture starting out in the new world should instead think about opportunities presented as a result of global changes that the past  months have fast tracked. It’s now genuinely possible to be a global company from Day  and utilise talent from any part of the globe. Barriers no longer exist. Cities and regions need to start thinking this way too. To ask Derry to compete only with Belfast would not be setting a big enough challenge. So, in conclusion,you’re looking for a friendly and affordable university city to start your tech business, where it’s possible to be in both the UK and the EU, an hour from London by air, where   of the population is aged - and is well educated, where government startup funding is readily available, close to some of Europe’s finest beaches, with top class local state schools and a long history and culture … then maybe you should take a look at Derry. And my final call to action, on  April  Jayne Brady started in a brand new post at Belfast City Council as Belfast’s Digital Innovation Commissioner. An engineer and former Venture Capital Partner, in the  months since Jayne started she’s made a massive dference and she represents Belfast at the digital and innovation negotiating tables in both Westminster and Dublin. In truth, although she works for Belfast City Council she does her very best to represent all of Northern Ireland. Isn’t it time we appointed a Digital Innovation Commissioner to do the same and really own this agenda for the NW region of Ireland and its citizens, present and future ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Fitzroys on Bridge Street - extensively damaged.HomePopular city centre restaurant extensively damaged in fire overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  County Derry PostCCTV footage shows iniduals responsible for break-in at Co Derry business overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, nd November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry courthouse at Bishop Street has had its jury cases heard in Coleraine since the start of the Covid- pandemic.Local NewsJustice on its way back to Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, st November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  -year-old journalism student and film maker, Nathan EdgarDerry NewsNew documentary to shed light on Derry charity Foyle Search and Rescue overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Earth Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Earth Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Start-up Launch Pad winners, Paul Stafford and Hayley Quinnell.

Talk, to your friend, your mum, the pregnant lady at parent and toddler - talking to others helps us feel good, it helps to share worries but also smiles too. Maybe you could join a mum-to-be group  . Try and do some exercise, release those feel good endorphins, even it’s a slow walk to the shop because bump is heavy, or try swimming, or pregnancy aerobics. Or combine exercise with meditation and relaxation, try pregnancy yoga or pilates. Butthat all sounds too hard, have a pregnancy massage. . Sleep more - you need it you are growing a baby. . Eat well, food does affect our mood! Yes that does include restaurants and take aways. . Help,you really feel you are struggling talk to your midwe - maybe she can help. . Look at the here and now, look at the world around you, see the beauty in the garden, take a walk in the park or the beach and blow those moody cobwebs away. . Focus on all the good in your le, your friends, family, home, all those lovely baby bits, oh and your growing baby, too, of course. . Feeling stuck, trapped at home, then look about your home - what can you do to make it better for you, clear. away that messy corner, sort out your wardrobe, download and print all those photos from your phone and put them into an album. . Get creative this could be making cards for Christmas , make a family photo collage , or just buy yourself some water paints, pastels, pencils and draw, colour in and enjoy the experience. So, now for the smiles, or shock that people actually did that - maybe even your mum or granny did… just remember don’t you! • If Baby got a temperature, then rub them with alcohol - yes this WAS true. • In  good advice for babies and toddlers, never hug and kiss them, never let them to sit on your lap. . Andyou must kiss them, do this only once on the forehead when you say good night. Shake hands with them in the morning… do not love them too much - you have to prepare them for the real world. • If you are breast feeding, don’t do this when you are angry or you will give baby colic … does make you think how  And don’t even think about breast feeding after nine months as this can cause brain disease in babies and blindness in mothers. • Living in a home that’s a bit small, then invest in a baby cage, this simple cage attaches to the outside of your window - pop baby inside for all the fresh air he or she needs. • As part of infant’s regulation of his bowels and bladder, and a key part of his character building, mothers were instructed to start bowel training their babies at two months of age, holding the baby over the chamber, at the precise same time each day, andusing a soap stick,necessary to provoke a movement. • When a baby is two weeks old put him out of doors for a short time - a half hour to an hour, every day that the weather is pleasan-increasing the time gradually until he is staying out most of the day. No, of course, you don’t have to stay with him! • Crying is good for baby, it means he gets a good exercise as it expands his lungs thoroughly and stimulates vigorous use of his arms and legs.

Reporter: Jenner Grfiths Nov   addthis, I thought no it’s too early, nope Jen don’t write about Christmas yet, it is ONLY November! googletag.cmd.push BUT,I know some of you parents will soon be sayingI’ve done all my Christmas shopping, the adverts are on the TV, the songs are starting to be hummed, the children are starting to practice their Christmas songs and plays and the decorations are in the shops . So, I thought, Jen, sometimes you’ve just go to go with the flow… I had an article all ready for you about ideas for presents and then I thought STOP…what about those who dread Christmas, the cost of it, the feeling of how will I cope with the financial part, the wondering who WILL I borrow the money from to pay for everything  For some Christmas really is like this, me and you, can sit in our warm homes, circling the catalogues, putting things in our internet basket, searching and driving for miles for that present that cost hundreds of pounds whose novelty will have worn off by the new year. But for some families it’s dferent, wondering how do I pay for the oil, the bills, the school pants he needs as he’s grown so much and buy that second hand bike he’s got his heart set on. Me or you might say, just budget, save all year, a little every week and it’ll soon add up but for some it just isn’t that easy. I often think, and maybe we all should, ‘there for the grace of God go I’. So, sorry guys, my first Christmas article is about those less fortunate than us. Rather than circling those presents tonight, rather trying to decide between Marks  Spencers luxury goose or Sainsbury’s Finest three bird roast, think what can you do, actually do, to make a dference, to make Christmas special for others. Charity begins at home As a mum who has been skint, yep that was me, I tried to get things from the charity shop, so could you have a clear out, donate your old toys, or maybe even clothes, give them a wash and hand them in. Oh, but do make sure al the pieces are there, no boy wants a train track that doesn’t join together! Join a toy appeal or create one yourself with family and friends - schools and community centres often do these - just make the call, what do they need  Make a box, a person box for a lady, man or family box for those who may be homeless, may be at a refuge. Items like shampoo, toothbrush might be normal for me and you butyou are living on the streets or had to leave your home quickly these things matter, don’t forget to put a treat in there too though! Foodand the foodbank, millions of people use our essential food banks, simply pop a few extra bits in your trolley and donate, donate donate! Furniture,some of you might be getting a new couch   curtains etc for Christmas, but what are you dong with your old one, do you really have to sell it, do you really need the money, could you donate instead  Lots of charitiesmight know of a family who would love yours. Don’t forget too, our animals in shelters, the dogs found wandering the streets in the cold and wet who no one bothered to look for, the cats too old to be rehoused, the rabbits who simply got forgotten when their owners moved. Animal shelters need your support too, many would love to receive your old blankets, again give them a call and ask do you need anything  Christmas tree, everyone expects to have a Christmas tree, it’s traditional, a home is not home at Christmas without one, but a tree can cost from pound. to pound.could you donatea tree, promise a family a tree, donate your old tree   Presentsyes you can buy to give, presents that can help others too, yes they aren’t for your neighbours over the road or round the corner but they are still your neighbours in the world, check out Oxfam and help a child go to school, or CMBUK and help train a doctor or nurse, or Unicef and help a ‘Mum to be’. But remember,help yourself, don’t be tempted to splurge and spend, spend, spend, that credit card will want paying! Do you really want to be still paying for Christmas in August when you could have had turkey instead of goose, crackers from Asda and been strong enough to stick to your money limit and yes this does mean that the kids get one main present not a bike, phone, tv and computer!! Remember Christmas is about being together, about making memories, smiles, it’s about happy days, love and laughter, it really is that simple, for you, me, the dog in the shelter, for all of us everywhere.

Reporter: Jenner Grfiths Nov   addthis, I thought no it’s too early, nope Jen don’t write about Christmas yet, it is ONLY November! googletag.cmd.push BUT,I know some of you parents will soon be sayingI’ve done all my Christmas shopping, the adverts are on the TV, the songs are starting to be hummed, the children are starting to practice their Christmas songs and plays and the decorations are in the shops . So, I thought, Jen, sometimes you’ve just go to go with the flow… I had an article all ready for you about ideas for presents and then I thought STOP…what about those who dread Christmas, the cost of it, the feeling of how will I cope with the financial part, the wondering who WILL I borrow the money from to pay for everything  For some Christmas really is like this, me and you, can sit in our warm homes, circling the catalogues, putting things in our internet basket, searching and driving for miles for that present that cost hundreds of pounds whose novelty will have worn off by the new year. But for some families it’s dferent, wondering how do I pay for the oil, the bills, the school pants he needs as he’s grown so much and buy that second hand bike he’s got his heart set on. Me or you might say, just budget, save all year, a little every week and it’ll soon add up but for some it just isn’t that easy. I often think, and maybe we all should, ‘there for the grace of God go I’. So, sorry guys, my first Christmas article is about those less fortunate than us. Rather than circling those presents tonight, rather trying to decide between Marks  Spencers luxury goose or Sainsbury’s Finest three bird roast, think what can you do, actually do, to make a dference, to make Christmas special for others. Charity begins at home As a mum who has been skint, yep that was me, I tried to get things from the charity shop, so could you have a clear out, donate your old toys, or maybe even clothes, give them a wash and hand them in. Oh, but do make sure al the pieces are there, no boy wants a train track that doesn’t join together! Join a toy appeal or create one yourself with family and friends - schools and community centres often do these - just make the call, what do they need  Make a box, a person box for a lady, man or family box for those who may be homeless, may be at a refuge. Items like shampoo, toothbrush might be normal for me and you butyou are living on the streets or had to leave your home quickly these things matter, don’t forget to put a treat in there too though! Foodand the foodbank, millions of people use our essential food banks, simply pop a few extra bits in your trolley and donate, donate donate! Furniture,some of you might be getting a new couch   curtains etc for Christmas, but what are you dong with your old one, do you really have to sell it, do you really need the money, could you donate instead  Lots of charitiesmight know of a family who would love yours. Don’t forget too, our animals in shelters, the dogs found wandering the streets in the cold and wet who no one bothered to look for, the cats too old to be rehoused, the rabbits who simply got forgotten when their owners moved. Animal shelters need your support too, many would love to receive your old blankets, again give them a call and ask do you need anything  Christmas tree, everyone expects to have a Christmas tree, it’s traditional, a home is not home at Christmas without one, but a tree can cost from pound. to pound.could you donatea tree, promise a family a tree, donate your old tree   Presentsyes you can buy to give, presents that can help others too, yes they aren’t for your neighbours over the road or round the corner but they are still your neighbours in the world, check out Oxfam and help a child go to school, or CMBUK and help train a doctor or nurse, or Unicef and help a ‘Mum to be’. But remember,help yourself, don’t be tempted to splurge and spend, spend, spend, that credit card will want paying! Do you really want to be still paying for Christmas in August when you could have had turkey instead of goose, crackers from Asda and been strong enough to stick to your money limit and yes this does mean that the kids get one main present not a bike, phone, tv and computer!! Remember Christmas is about being together, about making memories, smiles, it’s about happy days, love and laughter, it really is that simple, for you, me, the dog in the shelter, for all of us everywhere.

Its clothing perfectly suited to the GAA fan looking for something slightly dferent, without club crests and sponsor logos.Fergal, along with his twin brother Fergal and friend Paul Hughes – Chairman of Derrytresk– is happy with how their brand has progressed. Originally, they had planned to launch for Christmas, but a change saw them get the ball rolling in April, in time for the twins th birthday celebrations.“It gave us something to focus on and one of the jumpers has  on the back, to signy the year we were born,” Fergal told the County Derry Post.There was always an interest in designing and a clothing brand was never far from his thoughts. During his playing days, hed never be far away when new kits were being deigned. A retro jersey released as part of Slaughtneils gear range had his fingerprints on it.“We are from a farming background, it is not the sort of thing youd associate us with...getting into fashion,” Fergal jokes.“But, its always something we have been interested in. I just think a lot of the GAA gear is based on playing members and wanted to do something dferent to appeal to our non-playing members as much as players.“A lot of it will carry club badges and sponsor logos, whereas not everybody wants to wear that kind of product to go to games.”Still playing for the clubs recreational team, he coaches the U footballers and hurlers. There is a pride in pulling into Emmet Park and seeing the Gael Foacutersa range, across dferent ages and colours. Interchangeable caps. Beanies. Shorts. Sweatshirts. T-Shirts. Half-zips. From black to white and green to mango, there is something for everyone. “I am not necessarily going to pull on my club gear, but I still want to pull on something that will associate you with the GAA,” he explains of their brands unique selling point.The name – Gael Foacutersa #WeAllBelong – was spun out of that inkling he had all those years ago.“I always had it in my head, thatI ever did start up a brand, that Gael Force would be the name I would go with,” Fergal explains.“We wanted to keep the Irish slant on it as well. It is very important to the club and community.”And so, Gael Foacutersa – True Gael – was born. After some scribbling with the lettering, the logo eventually came to le by accident. “The plan was to launch it on the lead up to Christmas”, Fergal adds. “Then we thought, the idea is there and well get something out there. Me and Francis, it was our th birthday in April, wed give ourselves a date to work to, to have the product launched.“We are very thankful for the support we have got from everybody. You now notice now the orders coming in, even from other counties, so it definitely seems to be going the right way.”Nestled deep within the brand is the importance of knowing that the game is much more than being part of the squad and taking to the field. It is about identity. A sense of belonging and inclusivity. Being part of a community of like-minded people with a mutual love for traditions and heritage.“So much of our young children and adult lives have become about the constant need to train, to diet, to play, to watch, to support, to belong but ultimately to win,” Gael Foacutersa outline in the story on their website.“Gael Foacutersa is about getting away from these pressures and the responsibilities of the game.We want to take it back to the basics. It’s about the enjoyment of it all and putting smiles on peoples faces.“The Gael Foacutersa range offers high-quality, comfortable and eye-catching men’s and ladies leisurewear. It aims to reinforce the customer’s sense of identity. To be more than just about the game. It’s about being part of something bigger.” googletag.cmd.push For the full range, check out their website: www.gaelforsa.ieADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Fitzroys on Bridge Street - extensively damaged.HomePopular city centre restaurant extensively damaged in fire overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  County Derry PostCCTV footage shows iniduals responsible for break-in at Co Derry business overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, nd November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry courthouse at Bishop Street has had its jury cases heard in Coleraine since the start of the Covid- pandemic.Local NewsJustice on its way back to Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, st November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  -year-old journalism student and film maker, Nathan EdgarDerry NewsNew documentary to shed light on Derry charity Foyle Search and Rescue overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Earth Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Earth Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Start-up Launch Pad winners, Paul Stafford and Hayley Quinnell.

This will mean an extra pound. per week to your energy which will amount to paying out pound a year more than Power NI users did  months ago. Power NI has blamed the rise on the increase in global wholesale gas prices but MS Ferguson says that will cut little ice with Derry households already struggling to make ends meet. She said: “News that hard-pressed families are set to be hit with another price hike will come as another huge blow. “As with all such price hikes, those hardest hit by this will be low-paid workers and middle income families. Many of these families are already struggling to make ends meet. “We are in the middle of a cost of living crisis as energy prices soar largely due to global demand issues at the same time as inflation is rising and food and other costs are increasing. “Sinn Feacutein is calling on the British government to remove VAT on energy bills during this global price spike to help support families. “It should also explore a windfall tax on energy generators similar to that introduced in other European states and redirect the money raised towards tackling fuel poverty.” In response, William Steele, director of Power NI customer solutions, said: “We work very hard to keep our prices as low as possible, but regrettably there has been a rapid and sustained increase in wholesale gas prices over recent months. “ Like other suppliers, we have no choice but to pay these increased costs, which feed into the cost of wholesale electricity and have a knock-on effect on our tarfs. “As soon as we see an opportunity to reduce prices, we will do so without delay.

Currently, the minimum wage rates are staggered with ious age groups earning separate levels of pay. Those aged  to  are entitled to pound. an hour,  to -year-olds get pound., those aged  and  receive pound. while workers of the age of  and upwards get paid an hourly rate of pound.. Cllr Harkin insists that minimum wage parity for all ages must be imposed and will call upon the Council to send a message to Derrys young people that they have their backs in their right for equal pay. He said: “If we want young people to have hope, to stay here and to thrive here, we need to shake-up the status quo propped up by corporations and the Stormont Executive. “The political establishment has been quick to ly demonise young people for spreading the covid virus – and some have tried to use young people as fodder for sectarian violence – but not a finger has been lted by Executive parties to challenge rip-off wages paid to young people. “Its unacceptable for - yr-olds to be paid only pound. an hour. Under-s are paid less pound an hour. What kind of message does it send to young people that they dont deserve even the basic minimum wage of pound.  “The cynical politics of ision constantly pursued by both sides of the unionist and nationalist establishment does nothing to help young people. “When it comes to standing up for young people its been blah blah blah from the Executive. “Theres been no anti-poverty strategy. Continued failure to properly expand Magee and create the type of infrastructure Derry and the North West needs. “Theyve done zero to promote voting rights for  and -year-olds. Student demands have been ignored.

Currently, the minimum wage rates are staggered with ious age groups earning separate levels of pay. Those aged  to  are entitled to pound. an hour,  to -year-olds get pound., those aged  and  receive pound. while workers of the age of  and upwards get paid an hourly rate of pound.. Cllr Harkin insists that minimum wage parity for all ages must be imposed and will call upon the Council to send a message to Derrys young people that they have their backs in their right for equal pay. He said: “If we want young people to have hope, to stay here and to thrive here, we need to shake-up the status quo propped up by corporations and the Stormont Executive. “The political establishment has been quick to ly demonise young people for spreading the covid virus – and some have tried to use young people as fodder for sectarian violence – but not a finger has been lted by Executive parties to challenge rip-off wages paid to young people. “Its unacceptable for - yr-olds to be paid only pound. an hour. Under-s are paid less pound an hour. What kind of message does it send to young people that they dont deserve even the basic minimum wage of pound.  “The cynical politics of ision constantly pursued by both sides of the unionist and nationalist establishment does nothing to help young people. “When it comes to standing up for young people its been blah blah blah from the Executive. “Theres been no anti-poverty strategy. Continued failure to properly expand Magee and create the type of infrastructure Derry and the North West needs. “Theyve done zero to promote voting rights for  and -year-olds. Student demands have been ignored. And, egregiously, the Executive has done nothing to challenge rip-off wages paid to young people working in key sectors. “We believe our Council should promote equal pay for equal work and be advocates for our young people, including education about trade union rights. Young workers should receive equal pay for equal work and their contribution throughout the pandemic should be properly acknowledged.”ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Fitzroys on Bridge Street - extensively damaged.HomePopular city centre restaurant extensively damaged in fire overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  County Derry PostCCTV footage shows iniduals responsible for break-in at Co Derry business overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, nd November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry courthouse at Bishop Street has had its jury cases heard in Coleraine since the start of the Covid- pandemic.Local NewsJustice on its way back to Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, st November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  -year-old journalism student and film maker, Nathan EdgarDerry NewsNew documentary to shed light on Derry charity Foyle Search and Rescue overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Earth Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Earth Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Start-up Launch Pad winners, Paul Stafford and Hayley Quinnell.

Available exclusively in Attitude Black paintwork, the new Sport Black Edition brings a distinctive sporty look to Toyota’s fth-generation RAV, and is available in front-wheel-driveguise only.     However, for buyers looking for the added security of an all-wheel-drivedrivetrain in their new RAV, there is the option of AWD in Sol, Sport and Platinum iants, while the entry-level Luna model is FWD only.Petrol Electric PowertrainLike every iant in the RAV range, the Sport Black Edition is powered by a .-litre four-cylinder petrol-electric hybrid powertrain, which produces bhp and Nm of torque and enables the five-seat family SUV to sprint from -km h in just over  seconds. Standard across the entire RAV range is a suite of safety features which offer maximum protection for all occupants, while providing the RAV driver with the latest technology in driver assistance systems.     Collectively called Toyota Safety Sense  , features include Pre-Collision Assistance , Speed Assistance , Lane Keepingand Automatic High Beam Assist.Gracious Exterior, Spacious InteriorThe exterior design of the new RAV is more appealing and less anonymous that its predecessor, and this is gained by way of boxy wheel arches, a squared-off nose with a large grille, and angular edges and creases in the bodywork. I feel that Toyota has done a great job of making the new RAV look and feel more ‘premium’ than ever, while also offering more interior space than any of its predecessors.Cabin quality is exceptional, with sturdy and durable materials used throughout, while overall passenger space is generous in every respect. This has been made possible by placing the front and rear axles mm further apart than before, and even tall adults will be able to sit in the rear seats comfortably, with plenty of legroom and headroom on offer.The RAV’s battery is located under the floor, but its boxy dimensions help to hide it well, with a slightly higher boot floor the only clue to what lies beneath.Compared to its predecessor, the RAV’s boot capacity has grown to -litres , with a massive ,-litres available when the rear seats are folded down.The RAV was awarded a full five stars by Euro NCAP in  and that was thanks in part to an upgrade to the second-generation of Toyota Safety Sense for the latest model.Test CarMy test car was a RAV Sport Black Edition which drew lots of admiring glances due to its terric road presence and distinctive design details.An impressive array of standard equipment includes TEX leather black upholstery with heated front seats, powered driver seat, auto-dimming interior mirror, front and rear parking sensors, rear view camera, auto lights and wipers, LED front light guide with daytime running lights, LED projector headlights, electrically operated boot door, ” Toyota Touch multimedia system, dual zone climate control, rear privacy glass, satellite navigation, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, black headliner cloth, paddle sht, light blue ambient lighting, and illuminated entry along with many more comfort, convenience, safety and infotainment features.As is the case across all models in the RAV line-up, fuel consumption as low as .l km is achievable on a WLTP combined driving cycle, while Co emissions of between  and g kmensures low annual road tax in addition to low overall running costs.Toyota’s advanced hybrid technology ensures that the RAV’s petrol engine and electric motor combine seamlessly to deliver extra performance and outstanding fuel efficiency, while remaining ultra-smooth and extremely quiet when driving in electric mode.Toyota claim that up to % of the time you drive a Toyota Hybrid, you are in electric mode, with the added advantage that you never have to plug the car in to charge the battery.Toyota’s self-charging hybrid harvests the energy normally lost from deceleration and braking into a small battery. This unit doesn’t have enough capacity to propel the RAV alone for any considerable distance, but it does offer the convenience of being able to charge itself without any input from the driver.The RAV sits on Toyota’s New Global Architecture, which is also used in the Toyota Prius, C-HR and Corolla models. It brings big benefits in ride and handling, with more sophisticated suspension than the old model, so the RAV is capable of turning into corners with a surprising amount of poise and precision, with plenty of grip while resisting dramatic levels of body lean.The RAV’s CVTtransmission is smooth and slick in its operation, while a well-insulated cabin ensures that on-road refinement is top class. When travelling through towns and cities at low speed, the RAV’s electric motor is barely audible, with the engine shutting off entirely when stationary in traffic. At motorway cruising speeds, the RAV settles into a quiet hum, with only small amounts of tyre and wind noise getting through to the cabin.Verdict, Cost and WarrantyWith its unique and distinctive modern styling, faultless build quality, impressive tally of standard equipment and frugal petrol electric hybrid technology, the new RAV has all the necessary ingredients to comfortably fulfil the needs of a growing family.The new RAV Sport Black Edition represents great value. The new Toyota RAV is backed by a three-year ,km warranty, along with a five-year ,km warranty on hybrid components.Additionally, a hybrid battery warranty of up to an incredible -years is available upon completing an annual hybrid health check through Toyota’s nationwide dealer network.

Hyundai’s newest offering is an appealing small SUV, which slots into position between the new i and new Kona in terms of its exterior dimensions.  googletag.cmd.push   Hyundai claim that the Bayon is a ‘small on the outside, big on the inside’ urban crossover SUV that is designed to make a lasting impression. Boasting best-in-class safety and connectivity features, the Bayon comes with lots of smart technology as standard.     Eye-Catching ProportionsWith its sharp lines and eye-catching proportions, the new Bayon really stands out from the crowd. Sleek and stylish, it elegantly combines Hyundai’s award-winning SUV heritage with a visually stunning interpretation of Hyundai’s new Sensuous Sportiness design language — defined by the harmony between proportion, architecture, styling and technology.The arrow-shaped headlamps and wide grille harmonise with the sleek air intake band and narrow LED daytime running-lights on top, to give the front a purposeful, unique look. A dynamic shoulder line provides visual drama to the Bayon’s sporty wedge-shaped profile while, at the rear, arrow-shaped LED rear lights are connected by a red accent line. Positioned far out to the sides, the rear lights enhance the visual impression of width.     The new Bayon is shorter, narrower and lower than its Kona sibling, but stands a fraction taller than the i supermini upon which it is based. While the Kona is offered with an all-electric version, the new Bayon is powered solely by a .-litre MPIfour-cylinder petrol engine across all iants.The ingenious MPI system injects fuel at each cylinder, allowing much greater control over how much fuel the engine burns, leading to impressive fuel efficiency.Well-Appointed Trim LevelsThe new Bayon is available in a choice of three trim levels, namely Comfort Plus, Executive and Executive with a two-tone roof. Standard features from entry level include a rear spoiler, roof rails, sports-style driver and passenger front seats, driver seat height adjuster, height and reach adjustable leather-wrapped steering wheel, air-conditioning, auto light control , temporary spare wheel, cargo net, multi- steering wheel controls, central door locking, Bluetooth, DAB radio, cruise control, and a tyre pressure monitoring system, along with a host of safety features for peace-of-mind motoring.Upgrade to the Executive trimand additional standard features include ” alloy wheels, chrome belt line finisher, body coloured bumpers, shark-fin ariel, aluminium foot pedals, heated front seats, heated steering wheel, automatic air-conditioning, automatic window defogging , power-folding electric mirrors, rear privacy glass, auto wipers, remote central locking, voice recognition, Android Auto  Apple CarPlay, ” audio display, .” LCD supervision cluster, USB charger, wireless phone charger, rear parking sensors, and a rear view camera with dynamic guidelines, along with additional safety tech.Test CarMy test car was a new Bayon Executive .litre MPI, which was finished in elegant Aurora Gray Pearl paintwork that compliments its strong SUV design.Producing PSand Nm of torque, the Bayon can reach km h in .-seconds, while ing up to .mpgon a WLTP combined driving cycle.A low Co emission figure of g km translates to annual road tax of just €.On the road is where the new Bayon really excels, with a terric mix of comfort, control, poise and precision on offer. Road imperfections are dealt with swtly, while noises and knocks from the suspension are well isolated from the cabin.For a relatively small car, the Bayon’s motorway refinement and stability are impressive, while the car corners keenly on twisty roads. A precise steering response ensures that the Bayon is a delight to drive around town, while the standard rear parking sensors and rear view camera in my test car made parking a doddle too.The family-friendly cabin space in the new Bayon is impressive, with rear legroom deserving particular praise.Interior storage comprises a of a deep glovebox, front and rear door bins that can accommodate a large bottle, and a flat shelf for a smartphone at the bottom of the well-constructed dashboard.Boot capacity of -litres can be transformed into a ,-litre space when the rear seat backs are folded down, while an intelligent trunk cover can be stowed away safely within the boot when not in use.The new Hyundai Bayon is available in a multitude of stylish exterior colours, along with the option of a two-tone roof and matching door mirror housings in Phantom Black to create a car perfectly matched to inidual taste.

Based on the A-Class of the time, Mercedes-Benz gave its smallest model some SUV flavour with clever body cladding and a raised ride height.     More SUV-Like Than EverLaunched in , the second-generation GLA also shares its DNA with the latest A-Class, but it gained a more traditional SUV shape. Standing cm taller than its predecessor, the new GLA’s wheel arches are more squared-off in shape and are clad in protective black plastic. Its wheelbase has also been increased to create more passenger space, while the wheels are pushed out to each corner, resulting in much shorter front and rear overhangs.     Pitched directly against rivals like the BMW X and Volvo XC hybrids, the new GLA  e uses the same powertrain as the plug-in A-Class— a .-litre petrol engine and bhp electric motor, drawing power from a .kWh battery. The fuel tank in the GLA  e is located ahead of the car’s front axle, which leaves space under the boot to fit the hybrid battery. Importantly, this means that the GLA avoids the awkward box-shaped intrusion into the boot area seen in some plug-in hybrid cars.Specication DetailsThe new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is available in a choice of two generously-equipped specication levels — Progressive and AMG Line — both of which come with standard features such as stylish five-twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, parking sensors with reversing camera, LED high performance headlamps, Light and Sight package, hard-disc navigation, MBUX multimedia system, digital radio, Android Auto, Apple CarPlay, Seat Comfort package with heated front seats, automatic climate control, roof liner in black fabric, Mercedes-Benz emergency call system, galvanised steering-wheel gearsht paddles, Easy-Pack tailgate, Dynamic Select, acoustic ambient protection, Active Lane Keep Assist, and Speed Limit Assist, along with many more comfort, convenience and security features.Additional AMG Line specication includes lowered comfort suspension, AMG body styling, carbon-structure trim, ” AMG -twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, Artico leather Dinamica microfibre black upholstery, and AMG floor mats.Test CarMy GLA  e ‘Progressive’ test car was finished in Night Black paintwith contrasting Macchiato Beige Black Artico leather upholsteryfor maximum impact.With a % battery charge, my test car estimated its own electric range to be km’s. The car defaults to Hybrid mode when started up, so you proceed in zero-emission fashion at speeds of up to km h, as long as the battery has charge and you accelerate gently.When the petrol engine cuts in performance is strong, as it and the electric motor combine their power in a smooth and orderly fashion. With a combined power output of bhp and a mighty Nm of torque, the GLA  e can sprint from -km h in as little as . seconds, and can achieve a top speed of km h .The petrol engine only really makes its presence known when you ask for more performance, while neat handling and sufficient grip from the driven front wheels provides great confidence on the road. The car’s steering is light but direct, and the ride is more than comfortable enough to deal with rutted road surfaces and speed ramps with ease.Cabin space is impressive, with excellent head, leg and elbow room available for all occupants, while a -litre boot capacity will be more than adequate for most families. However, the GLA’s standard split-folding rear seat backs allow for the transportation of larger items when called upon, with up to ,-litres of space on offer in this mode.The cabin of the new GLA certainly feels vastly improved over the original GLA in every respect. This has been made possible by the latest Mercedes-Benz MBUX interior layout, with crisp digital displays replacing the analogue instrument dials and flowing across onto the dashboard.Buttons have been largely replaced by a controller ahead of the gear-lever and voice control, which uses articial intelligence similar to that found in home smart devices to recognise more natural speech and commands. The turbine air vents from the original GLA have been retained, but the dashboard has been slimmed-down for a more spacious feel.VerdictOverall, the new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is a competent all-rounder that offers a decent electric range, low emissions, predictable handling and a luxurious, technology-filled cabin — encased in a stylish and practical premium compact SUV body.

On Saturday night, Derry once again flocked to enjoy a night of the Undertones – but this time it wasn’t just their music - but their big screen debut that was getting the masses excited. The legendary band and their family, friends, and fans gathered to indulge in a celebration of their musical careers in the premier of a fitting tribute documentary, featuring the man who made it all possible – DJ John Peel. The documentary, produced by local man Vinnie Cunningham and directed by Tom Collins, traces the band right back to their first performances in school halls, when the lads had barely swapped their nappy rash for pimples.  Dr. Sid Dempsey, third from right, Head Consultant, Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children with members of the Undertones, Billy Doherty, John and Damien ONeill. Also included are Manus and Majella Martin.  The youngsters from Derry, who supported the Clash on their tour of America, never really appreciated how good they actually were, revealed Damien O’Neill - just one of the frank admissions that litter the documentary. The film is liberally interspersed with old video footage of the band as they bopped from the legendary Casbah to Top of the Pops - and features all the greats from ‘Teenage Kicks’ to ‘My Perfect Cousin’ to ‘It’s Going To Happen’. The fundamental ision between Feargal Sharkey and the rest of the Undertones is very apparent, although John O’Neill maintains that there is no real animosity against the singer who eventually caused the band to split. “The way we see it, he was one of our school friends and we eventually drted apart, the same thing that happens to everyone at some stage,” he said. “We really have no bad feelings towards him.” The banter throughout the showing had the audience in fits of laughter as the boys admitted some of their more embarrassing moments, and some revelations came courtesy of others. Caroline O’Neill certainly dropped husband John in it when she let slip that he had dumped her in the hope that fame and fortune would drive the chicks wild. “He’s going to kill me for saying this,” she said. “But he arrived two days later banging on my door and begging me to take him back.” Not so good-natured abuse The laughs were balanced by some more disturbing highlights of the lestyle that saw the boys also abused and often attacked because of their good fortune. “There were nights when we came out of the Casbah and had to leg it up the street,” admits Damien O’Neill. And Feargal Sharkey spoke of the animosity towards them when they were at home: “It was terrible having to face friends in Derry. You couldn’t buy people a drink or wear fashionable clothes because people thought you were being flash.” The Strand Multiplex was packed full of Derry people who have supported the lads over the last  years, and enjoyed reliving the highs and the lows with them all over again. Paul McCloone who now has the job of filling Feargal’s shoes described the documentary as “brilliant, really enjoyable”. John O’Neill, meanwhile, was about as enthusiastic as John gets: “I think it’s great. The most important thing is that the humour really comes across, and the sense that we were just five ordinary guys that managed to make it big.” The screening was held in aid of the N. Ireland Cancer Unit, and donations on the night, along with the money offered instead of an after show buffet, came to over pound. Manus Martin who lost his own son Anthony to cancer last year expressed his deepest thanks to all involved, particularly Vinnie Cunningham and Tony Collins. Two versions of the film have been compiled and the BBC will broadcast the -minute ‘short version’ by Perfect Cousin Productions Ltd, in association with the BBC, Arts Council and Irish Film Board.

The pandemic isnt over yet. Unfortunately, were going to have to get through at least another winter before we can safely say that its behind us, Varadkar said at the press conference. The situation took a turn for the worse about two or three weeks ago and since then, weve seen rising case numbers, rising hospitalisations and rising ICU numbers.So, were not where we hoped to be or expected to be for  October... were not past the peak of the Delta wave. Later in the press conference, he said the government would be meeting with unions and employer representatives to update the Work Safely Protocol. Well have that done over the next couple of days and essentially what were saying is that a staggered and phasedto the office is possible, he explained. So, people going back to the office for a specic business purpose, like a meeting or a training, for example, or inductions - that is allowed. But certainly people who can work from home and want to continue to work from home, their employer should facilitate that. But bear in mind, there are also people whove been working from home with a laptop on a bed for  months now and they really want to get back to the office. Andthat can be facilitated,they can be in an office on their own or in an office where theyre socially distanced from other people, that should be facilitated too. But the fullto offices as we knew them, that will be next spring, added the Taacutenaiste. The announcement from the Taacutenaiste comes days after Deputy Chief Medical OfficerDr. Ronan Glynn advised the public towork from home where possiblethis autumn and winter.

After continuing with his le, as best he could, he collapsed last year in his garden with back and leg pain. Kevin travelled to Istanbul last month to meet a specialist and will require surgery within a matter of months, which will cost in the region of pound,.

On Friday, June , their  and  U Feacuteile teams will play in a novel charity game, with all the funds going help Kevin and his family. “We are trying to raise as much money for Kevin and his family as possible,” said Philip Muldoon, one of the organisers. “We want the good people off Ballinderry and surrounding areas to come along and donate on the night of the match to keep the date free. “To any business people who would like to sponsor a prize for the raffle in the Bridge Bar afterwards they can do so by contacting myself or Karl Conlan. “Kevin is going to need a lot of help post and pre surgery and this will go a long way to doing that.” To mark the occasion Noel ONeill of Arboe based company ND Sports has made the outstanding gesture of sponsoring a one-off retro top for both teams.

They also provide underage hurling via St Patricks, an amalgamation with their parish neighbours St Colms Drum.When Derry won the All-Ireland title in , the countys most successful era, Richard Ferris was part of the winning formula and scored a goal in their opening round against Down that season. Joe Irwin won an Ulster medal with the county and Eunan Rafferty was also on Derry teams in that era.The clubs recent underage development work has provided Michael Mullan to Derrys Ulster minor winning team of , with Tiarnaacuten McHugh, Dara and Ruairi Rafferty part of the group who repeated the feat two seasons later on their way to the All-Ireland Final.Current senior captain Tiarnaacuten Woods has represented Derry at minor and U level, with McHugh and Ruairi Rafferty – who have played senior hurling with Kevin Lynchs – having also played the wee ball game for the county.On the camogie field, Una Rafferty and Aoe Kelly have represented Derry at minor and U level respectively. It has all comeas a result of the work being done at the club.“It is great to have Richard Ferris back involved again,” Shane adds. “He has set up a winter programme in place for the players in first to fth year , with the older players getting looked after under the senior  with their strength and conditioning.”The current senior group has benefited from the influx of youth as they have one eye on the Derry IFC Quarter-Finals later this month.McGonigle paid tribute to those who have sat on club committees down through the years and it has been bolstered with new blood coming on board in recent years to help with the clubs progression. Another great development has been an influx in new coaches coming forward at primary school level. Every bit helps. Like many other clubs across Ireland, Drumsurn reaches deeper into the locality. They are more than just GAA. Its a social hub that knits everyone together, regardless of age. It offers an identity.On top of their day to day club activities and s. Fitness classes, male and female, are a valuable facet of the club, while they also host Irish dancing and bowls.The club has also recently formed a mental health committee and have put in place a full winter program to complement this initiative. There are also plans for Irish language classes. There is never a dull moment. The clubs heart beats strong.“We as a club are very community focused,” Shane stresses. “In the past year we have brought the Action Cancer big bus for two days and also provided a defibrillator in a cabinet for our communitys use.”Since moving to their current premises, Billy Doran Park, in , they have added a training pitch and a club gym.The Club Committee set out a three-phase ground development plan in . The first phase of a new kitchen plus internal and external toilet blocks was completed in  with the changing rooms refurbished in .Phase , currently going through planning, includes a walking track, new floodlights and ball-wall. It all leads into Phase , a floodlit G pitch.“Our proposed ground developments are going to cost in excess of pound,,” McGonigle points out. “For a club of less than  members, this is a massive undertaking.”Drumsurn have set themselves a target of having phases two and three complete for their Centenary Year in .“Unfortunately, as with many other aspects of le, Covid has put a stop to conventional fundraising activities for the moment,” Shane outlines. “So we decided to set up Drumsurn GAC Competitions as a way of raising some much needed funds.” For more information and details on how to enter Drumsurns competition, visit www.drumsurngaccompetitions  ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Fitzroys on Bridge Street - extensively damaged.HomePopular city centre restaurant extensively damaged in fire overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  County Derry PostCCTV footage shows iniduals responsible for break-in at Co Derry business overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, nd November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry courthouse at Bishop Street has had its jury cases heard in Coleraine since the start of the Covid- pandemic.Local NewsJustice on its way back to Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, st November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  -year-old journalism student and film maker, Nathan EdgarDerry NewsNew documentary to shed light on Derry charity Foyle Search and Rescue overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Earth Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Earth Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Start-up Launch Pad winners, Paul Stafford and Hayley Quinnell.

James McClures th minute goal saw the Loup take a healthy six-point lead into the half time break, after the hosts had cut loose during the second quarter. However, St Patricks would not score for another  minutes, and their opponents used the time wisely, chipping away at the lead, with just the goal separating the sides at the second half water break. The Magherafelt side defeated in tonights Jack Cassidy Cup semi final. Loups composure had deserted them and by the time an Eoghan Hawe free reduced the gap to one on  minutes, the side in red looked the more likely winners. Time was on Rossas side, but just as the tide appeared to be turning, Loup rode the wave and hit back, John McClure tapping over a free with five minutes to go to settle the nerves. Aidan McAlynn then slotted another free, and despite a late Magherafelt onslaught that yielded a Dan Higgins point, the hosts held firm to reach a decider against Dungiven. *Full coverage in Tuesdays County Derry Post.

If the proposed Mid Down College gets the green light, then it will close and become part of the new school.Cllr Walker said he understood the constraints Blackwater was operating under and that there was no room to expand at its Old Belfast Road site, suggesting that it should also relocate to Down Highrsquos current site when it becomes available.The Rowallane politician has again insisted that he supports integrated education and was behind the proposal to create Drumlins Integrated Primary School in Ballynahinch and Killyleagh Primary Schoolrsquos decision several years ago to embrace integrated status.He said he was ldquoin no way attempting to turn the proposed Mid Down College proposal into a political football, branding such a suggestion as ldquoludicrous.Cllr Walker also rejected claims from Rowallane councillor Patrick Brown that the DUP narrative in the post-primary school proposal was ldquoshort-sighted and  in parts and that the steering group behind the new Mid Down College had no intention of taking students away from other schools.Accusing the Alliance man of being ldquodisingenuous, Cllr Walker said his party is not anti-integrated education.In addition, he rejected Cllr Brownrsquos assertion that Newry, Mourne and Down Council did not want to meet with the Mid Down steering group to discuss its proposal.ldquoIt was agreed that steering group members, along with representatives from the other post-primary schools in the area who have concern about the new college proposal, would be asked to meet with a working group comprising elected representatives to outline their respective views, he said.Cllr Walker said that whatever happened moving forward, childrenrsquos education must always come first as they are the future of the district.He continued: ldquoThe bottom line for me is thatthe proposed Mid Down College impacts on existing schools, I will continue to point that out. We need to consider the needs of all our pupils and their respective futures.Cllr Walker added: ldquoI have met with those for and opposed to the new integrated college proposal and am pleased to have done so as it is the right thing to do. The question I have for Cllr Brown is, has he done likewise .prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/17November2021_TUV.jpg","title":"‘Traditional Unionist’  McKee joins TUV weeks after his UUP departure  ","story":"NEWRY, Mourne and Down Council has its first TUV councillor.Harold McKee mdash who recently quit the UUP over concerns about the leadership of the party under Doug Beattie mdash had intended to become an Independent member of the local authority, but has instead joined the TUV.The veteran Mournes councillor and former South Down MLA, says joining Jim Allisterrsquos party presents him with an opportunity to represent the best interests of the people across his electoral area.This week, Cllr McKee has thanked the many people who have wished him well on his departure from the UUP and his political direction into the future.He explained that since announcing his resignation, he received an overwhelming number of positive messages of support on social media and via phone calls.ldquoI would take this opportunity to thank all those who took the time to message and telephone me, not only local people in Newry Mourne and Down, but also across the whole of Northern Ireland, said Cllr McKee.ldquoIt is often the case when a member leaves a political party that they receive offers from other parties to have a chat with members or indeed the leader to discuss potential future membership. Once again, I would thank those from other unionist parties for their words of encouragement in upholding my Christian faith in the political arena and their offers to have a conversation on my political direction.Cllr McKee confirmed that when he left the UUP, he notied the local councilrsquos chief executiveof his intention to become an Independent councillor for the immediate period to allow some time before deciding where his political future lay.He continued: ldquoWhile I had no intention of making a move to any party anytime soon, I was drawn on the basis of many of my messages and phone calls towards Traditional Unionist Voice.ldquoThis led me to read the TUV policies and manestos which, having read, I believe I am very much in agreement. One of the newspaper articles referred to me as a traditional Unionist and to be honest thatrsquos who I am.Cllr McKee said that following discussions with the TUV leader, Jim Allister, during which he set out the importance of his Christian values as a politician, he has taken up the offer of another party much earlier than he had intended.ldquoLike many people across Northern Ireland, I appreciate the strong and principled leadership Jim has offered, particularly in recent days when it has come to the Northern Ireland Protocol which is undermining our position in the UK, he continued.ldquoI feel that the ethos of TUV and the ever-growing number of members joining the party, particularly in the South Down constituency, provides me with an opportunity to represent the best interests of the people of the Mournes.Welcoming Cllr McKee to the party, Mr Allister said he was delighted that he had decided to join the TUV.ldquoHarold is a conviction politician and as such is a good fit with TUV following his principled resignation from the UUP.

The races also had dfering start times with the longer distances starting earlier in the day.Doing laps often keeps the runners compact in terms of marshalling and spectating but it can mean that those doing the longer distances are tested mentally when they see others finishing.It is sometimes hard to carry on for the next loop when you can see others reaching the end of their efforts. It also means where there is a hill or a tricky part of the race, you will see it more than onceyou are doing the marathon or the ultra. The k route was slightly separate but also included a few steep sections so it was not an easy option by any means.Marguerite Robinson had been training hard to regain fitness after a layoff with injury and had hoped to be ready to use her half marathon slot, which was a deferred entry from last yearrsquos event, that was called off due to Covid- restrictions.However, as race day approached, she realised that on this occasion that she might be taking on more than she could chew and certainly more than she would enjoy so she wisely switched to the K.She was easy with her decision once the race got underway and even more so during the last mile when she was running the drag uphill from the gate to the finish. She completed in . and was th female .Declan Teague has been in fine marathon form recently, packing in three such races in short succession from September into October, but this one was notable as it got him to number  in his tally.Unfortunately since his last race, he has had to reduce his training miles due to niggles and he arrived at the start line knowing that he was going to have to dig deep to get round.He was therefore delighted to hook up with Phillip Vint as the race got underway and said that the camaraderie took their mind off the big climbs and got them through the first hour with ease.Phillip was on his way to his th marathon and in his usual understated fashion he was just there to get on with it.The commitment and consistency of these guys has to be admired.As much as Declan was enjoying the company, he urged Phillip to press on to pursue his own pace. Phillip very gradually eased away over the miles ahead and finished a superb th overall in three hours and  minutes.This would be a commendable time on tarmac let alone on an off road event. Declan stuck to his own rhythm and was happy with his time of . which placed him nd out of the  who completed.Clare Carson was also in for the marathon distance and taking it in her stride she dipped in just under the five hours to add another one to the long list that she is accumulating.They all commented that they found the downhills as tough as the ups and the quad muscles had definitely taken a battering, but despite the testing route, it is one they will likely repeat.Stephen Heasley, who was in Tollymore to take part in the ultra distance, reported back that he was a lsquoDNFrsquo. For those of you who are unsure what DNF means, it is short for lsquodid not finishrsquo.Most would assume that this would be a major disappointment.In Stephenrsquos case though, perhaps it would be more accurate to say that he had a change of plan rather than a failure.Although he was finding it tough going, he waited until the end of lap two to call it a day so in fact he completed a marathon while considering his options.For many of us managing to finish a marathon on a good day would be a challenge. To do so on a ldquobad day seems almost a triumph.It was certainly the right decision for Stephen on the day and hopefully he will now take time for recovery before his next escapade.Jonny Holmes had taken part in the NIMAA XC Championships a month ago as a way of trying his hand at cross country running.That event also stood as selection for the NI team for the North South Challenge. Based on the results that day, the Masters Association drew up teams of six plus one reserve for each age group -, -, - and so on.Jonny was duly notied that he was picked to run as reserve in the - category and so he turned up at Queens Playing Fields last Saturday, slightly concerned as to how he would cope given the standard of the runners.He had no need to worry as he paced it well and did himself and the club proud.He was rd in the end and completed the five lap muddy circuit in  odd minutes. He expressed his awe of the standard at the front of the race and felt that it was great to have the experience of being part of such a competitive event.This weekend sees the cross country season continue with a large EDAC squad heading to Comber for the Comber Cup and some juniors travelling to Santry in Dublin for the All-Ireland Even Age Group Championships as part of the Co Down team.

Bobby Dalzell Cup with a comprehensive victory over local rivals Killough at a windswept Ballyhornan on Friday night.Two goals in each half, including a brace from Celtic striker Jay Gibney, was enough to ensure it would be the Hoops who would be contending for this yearrsquos title on December .To both teams credit, the number of supporters that flooded through the gates to watch this spectacle was more than commendable, with hundreds of people in attendance to witness what is historically a feisty encounter between the sides mdash this occasion being no dferent.Killough, donning their new kit, kicked off, but in a matter of moments found themselves defending a free-kick in a dangerous area, although Celtic centre back Gary Carberry saw his effort well saved by lsquokeeper Christopher Mallon.The opening minutes played out to a rapid pace of football, with the wind unsure of which direction to blow resulting in both teams attempting to play on the ground.Killoughrsquos first big opportunity came courtesy of a Connor Kelly free-kick after team-mate Cillian Burns was pulled down by defender Blaine Connolly unfairly.However, Kellyrsquos effort just whisked over the crossbar in what would prove to be a seldom chance for the village side in the opening  minutes.What Celtic seemed to have in their arsenal which Killough lacked was showing clinical precision and accuracy from their set pieces.With seven minutes on the clock, the Hoops would have their first of  corners throughout the match, with the Killough defence failing to clear the danger with any conviction, allowing the ball to float back across the box and into the path of Celtic marksman Jay Gibney.The striker made no mistake with the finish and the deadlock was broken.Referee James McCreesh certainly had his work cut out, as he consistently gave verbal warnings to both teams and their management as he did a commendable job controlling the pace of the contest.However, his patience was tested one too many times and after a quarter of an hour, Killoughrsquos Kevin Groves received the first yellow card of the game for a tackle on Gerard Collins.Celticrsquos Peter Casey struck the resultant free and was unlucky to see his effort kiss the top of the crossbar.The Hoops continued their pressure and were rewarded with a corner. Barry Treacy, whose set piece efforts were fantastic throughout the  minutes, stepped up to strike a low cross into the box for captain Mikey Rice to tap in and double his sidersquos lead.Rice was instrumental for Celtic and deservedly was awarded man of the match for his efforts.A manic couple of minutes ensued after another corner caused Killough problems, the ball this time falling to Casey who saw his left-footed effort crash off the underside of the crossbar and somehow away to safety.Celtic kept their relentless efforts in attack and a moment later they thought they had their third, but their strike was ruled out for offside. Killough then failed to properly dispatch the ball up the pitch, allowing Hoopsrsquo striker Jordan McCoubrey to attack their goal.However, McCoubrey was left frustrated when his appeal for a penalty was waved off by McCreesh.Killoughrsquos Declan Burns received a booking for a hearty tackle on the opposition before team-mate and lsquokeeper Mallon managed to ert the ball away from the net in a dramatic goal line scramble.In what was an admittedly underwhelming performance by Killough, custodian Mallon made a number of inspiring saves throughout the match and kept the final score at a much more respectable tally.Celticrsquos Casey must have thought he had been the subject of a curse, after his third long ranged effort in the space of  minutes struck the woodwork, this time a spectacular  yard effort thumping against the upper left.Killough managed to weather the storm and their best chance of the half came from captain Gareth Georgersquos free-kick which sailed wide of the post before Celticrsquos Connolly picked up a yellow card for a combination of fouls.That signalled the last signicant action of the opening  as Celtic led by two at the half-time interval.Upon the restart, Shaun Megahey managed to sneak past the Killough backline to force a point blank range save from Mallon as changes were made to both sides, including the introduction of Stephen Galbraith for the Hoops.Carberry was the latest entry into the book after dragging down Killoughrsquos Kelly before the village side suffered an injury blow in the form of midfielder Matt McKiernan on the hour mark.The game had settled down at this point, with Killough still deciding whether to stick or twist as they knew they needed a goal, but one wrong move and the game would be put beyond their reach.Mallon continued to impress in goals, with an eye-catching one handed save off a Carberry header, although at the th minute the result was put beyond doubt.A calamity of errors in the Killough defence allowed Gibney to square the ball to substitute Galbraith, who tapped into the open net to completely crush their opponentsrsquo fighting spirit.Killough are known for their resilience and kept fighting to the conclusion, but it was clear that it wouldnrsquot be their day as the clock wound down.Megahey picked up a yellow for the Hoops before his opponents saw a penalty appeal for a hand ball shut down.Tempers continued to flair as Killoughrsquos Ruairi Sharvin added his name to the list of yellow card recipients just before his sidersquos misery compounded when Gibney added Celticrsquos fourth of the match with a neatly struck finish.Killough resorted to shooting from distance but werenrsquot having much luck, with Jack McLoughlinrsquos effort the only to really cause Celtic custodian Nathan Curran to spring into action with a confident one handed save.Groves did manage to loop a headed effort past Curran. However, as per the theme of the match, Celticrsquos defence managed to clear the ball before it could cross the line.McCreesh blew his whistle for the final time to send the Celtic fans into raptures as the players audibly voiced their pleasure at making yet another final.Man of the match and Hoopsrsquo skipper Mikey Rice gave his thoughts on the performance after the contest.ldquoEveryone knows what theyrsquore getting with Celtic Bhoys and Killough, big hits, hard tackles and a great spectacle for the neutral, he said.ldquoYou see the amount of people who came down here, especially for the Newcastle league teams, itrsquos brilliant. It was always going to be a great game and I respect Killough a lot, he continued.ldquoI think there was a few people here watching the match who will be featuring in next weekrsquos semi-final between Dundrum and Ardglass, so hopefully we gave them a wee bit of fear to face us.Celtic Bhoys: N Curran S Megahey, B Connolly, G Carberry M Rice , G Collins, B Treacy, P Casey, J Gibney, J McCoubrey, N Williams-McCabe.Subs: C Kerr, S Galbraith, S McMahon, C McCartan.Killough: C Mallon, S Og Burns, G George , E Gargan, R Sharvin, M McKiernan, D Burns, K Groves, C Burns, C Kelly, J McLoughlin.Subs: D Looney, T McIlhone, L Murphy, R Burns, D Taggart.Yellow cards: K Groves, D Burns, R Sharvin.Corners: Celtic Bhoys , Killough .Offsides: Celtic Bhoys , Killough ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/17November2021_castlewellan.jpg","title":"Lease signing paves way for ambitious investment at Castlewellan Forest Park  ","story":"LOCAL politicians have formally approved an agreement which paves the way for a major multi-million pound investment in Castlewellan Forest Park.Newry, Mourne and Down Council and the Forest Service have signed a draft lease which legally formalises the local authorityrsquos phased takeover of the stunning forest park which attracts tens of thousands of visitors yearly.A pound.m revitalisation project at the park is being backed by the National Lottery Heritage Fund and the local council, with the latter spearheading the ambitious project to signicantly enhance facilities at the sprawling park, with the lottery funding earmarked to restore a number of key features to help maximise its tourism potential.Construction work has already commenced at the Bothy Yard thanks to funding from the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs and the EU.Work on the main restoration project is scheduled to complete by December , with the local authority agreeing a lease for the core areas within the park from the Forest Service until .Proposed work includes new landscape and drainage within The Grange courtyard, a new pedestrian path from the entrance gates to the main car park, a new vehicular road off Castle Avenue to the existing car park.

Mallon eventually pointed in the th minute only for Alana McCrickard to take a pass from Dearbhla Magee and fire over a minute later.Mallon responded with a huge score from play and then a th minute point to level the tie at - eachHowever, Dearbhla Magee gave her side the lead once more with a free after a clever move between Aimee McAleenan and Karen McMullan.But Mallon eventually levelled the tie again with a huge free from  metres in the nd minute and then five minutes from time stepped over a free in the left corner where the m line meets the side-line.It was the toughest angle she had faced, but she scored the point and Portaferry held on for a famous first title.Mallon was the player of the match. Portaferry would not have won without her contribution, having scored all eight points, but they also would not have won without the defensive wall they put in front of Fiona McGarry.Mary Jo Mageean, Dearbhla Coleman and Saoirse Sands smothered everything that the Fontenoys threw at them. But on a day like this, everyone put their shoulder to the wheel and it was enough to break the dam.ldquoIt is very hard to win the first. We have tried very hard over the past few years to win this title and it feels so good to actually get there, said Portaferry team mentor Martin Mallon, who was feeling the relief after the final whistle.ldquoI wonrsquot tell you a lie. We were very anxious coming into this final, all of us. You could see it in our play.Girls were tense and nervous out there and Liatroim took advantage.ldquoThey were always going to give us a real battle and you canrsquot give the likes of Dearbhla Magee an inch. I just donrsquot understand how she didnrsquot get an All-star nomination. She is one of the best players in Ireland, he continued.ldquoI felt thatwe got in front, we wouldnrsquot concede. Our defence has been immense all year. You can talk all you want about Niamhand the forwards, but the defence was absolutely brilliant.ldquoWe are young and we are hungry and we are going to improve more on the back of what we achieved today.Portaferry: F McGarry, C Coleman, A Mallon, MJ Mageean, C Finnegan, D Coleman, C McKenna, S Sands, N Savage, M Fitzsimons, F Toner, C Coleman, C McConnell, E McGrattan, N Mallon .Subs: G McGrattan for C McConnell , E Gallagher for N Savage , M McNally for M Fitzsimons .Liatroim: N OrsquoToole, Aacute OrsquoToole, K McAleenan, D McCabe, O Brown, K McMullan, A Brown, SL Clarke, D Magee , A McCrickard , A McAleenan , E McAleenan, C Davidson, D Brown, N McKibben.Sub: O Blaney for C Davidson .Referee: Paddy Brannigan..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/17November2021_poppy.jpg","title":"Remembrance Sunday in Downpatrick  ","story":"THE future of the Remembrance Sunday commemoration in Downpatrick looks to be secure.Thatrsquos the message from the organisers after an encouraging attendance at Sundayrsquos parade and wreath laying ceremony.The future of the commemoration was in doubt owing to a decline in attendances in recent years.A few weeks ago, Mr Andy Campbell, chairman of the townrsquos Royal British Legion branch, issued an appeal for support and warned that this year parade might be the last in the county town.However, Mr Campbell said he was delighted at the level of support on Sunday, both in the number of people who took part in the parade and also by the attendance at the wreath laying ceremony at the cenotaph.Addressing the gathering from the steps of the cenotaph, he said: ldquoI would like to thank everyone who has come here today to remember those who gave their lives to safeguard our freedom.Afterwards he said: ldquoWe had approximately  people taking part in the parade and another  or so at the cenotaph.

He said \" We’re already ahead of that with this particular virus, the Delta iant” Photo: Jeff Overs BBC PA WireThere have been protests in a number of countries including Austria, Switzerland, Croatia, Italy and the Netherlands at new restrictions in response to sharp rises in cases. In Belfast there was a protest on Saturday .But the UK, which saw pandemic measures eased in the summer, is “already ahead” of such a spike, one expert said.Professor Sir Andrew Pollard, one of those behind the creation of the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine, said it is “unlikely” the UK will see a rise similar to parts of Europe.He told BBC One’s Andrew Marr Show: “We’ve actually had some spreadgoing on since the summer, and so I think it’s unlikely that we’re going to see the very sharp rise in the next few months that’s just been seen. We’re already ahead of that with this particular virus, the Delta iant.”A NHS worker looks for patients at a Covid- pop-up vaccination centre. Scientists are hopeful that the booster jabs rollout and immunity from the summertime spread of the more transmissible Delta coronavirus iant should help Britain escape the surge in infections seen in parts of EuropeProfessor of public health at the University of Edinburgh, Linda Bauld, said while the picture remains “uncertain”, there are a number of factors which could help the UK avoid the situation seen in other countries.She told Sky’s Trevor Phillips On Sunday programme: “We dealt with our Delta wave in the summer and early autumn. We’re still in it of course but not those big rises.“And then the other features are around, unfortunately, because we’ve had high infections in the past, we’ve probably a bit more natural immunity in the population - as in immunity post-infection, particularly for younger groups who’ve not been eligible for vaccines.”The vaccine rollouts are also slightly dferent in that the dosing gap between first and second doses in many of the European countries was smaller than in the UK, she said.But she added there is an element of “grave concern actually in trying to determine whether there are dferences in the situation in Europe, or whether it’s just a matter of time until this faces us here”.Sir Andrew said reaching the point where the virus no longer spreads is “not going to be a thing”, saying the Covid- will be around “for decades”, but he added that vaccines are successfully slowing it down.At Stormont, an SDLP MLA has called on the executive to end the “mixed messaging” and work to implement vaccine certication for Northern Ireland.Matthew O’Toole, whose party was among the first to call for the introduction of a vaccine passport scheme for Northern Ireland, said on Sunday that vaccine certication was one of the ways to ensure a safer Christmas.Mr O’Toole said it would have been better to have introduced the scheme several weeks ago.Earlier this week, a majority of Stormont ministers backed the introduction of a Covid certication scheme, despite DUP opposition.It will see legal enforcement of coronavirus status entry requirements for nightclubs, bars, restaurants and a range of other settings from December .“We were a day late and a dollar short, so we should have moved earlier but the important thing is to get it implemented and implemented in a way that protects the health service but is also as seamless as possible for the businesses affected,” Mr O’Toole told BBC NI’s Sunday Politics programme.Meanwhile in the Republic its chief medical officer has said Ireland still has time to reverse the trajectory of Covid.Dr Tony Holohan called on people to follow the public health advice and asked anyone eligible for a booster to take it.Ireland is currently going through a fourth wave of the pandemic, prompting fears about the capacity of the health system to cope.According to the latest figures, there are  patients in hospitals with the disease, with  in intensive care.——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

In February last year the party’s East Antrim MP Sammy Wilson, whose constituency of Larne would most likely have been linked to Portpatrick in Scotland, said: “The decision to conduct a feasibility study into a bridge link between Northern Ireland and Scotland is something which my party has endorsed for a number of years because we believe it has the potential to further strengthen our economy and the sinews which hold our Union together.”Today the DUP said the plans had been helpful in focusing on NI’s links with GB. DUP MLA and Chair of the Assembly’s Infrastructure Committee Jonathan Buckley told the News Letter: “Our call for a feasibility study into a physical link with Great Britain placed a renewed focus on the importance of our links with the rest of the UK. “The impact of Covid and the unprecedented levels of Government support have clearly impacted upon Government spending and projects across the UK have been reviewed. The Union Connectivity Review remains vitally important however, and there is a continued need to improve links between Northern Ireland and Great Britain. Sea crossings remain some of the most expensive in Europe and improvements to the A are necessary to improve journey times in both directions between Scotland and Northern Ireland.”   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Never mind funding the billions of pounds that it would cost. Sadly, it was the inevitable outcome.“We must now ensure that we focus on improving connectivity between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK and will be asking the Government to invest some of the money that would have been spent to build the bridge, on improving the road system in Scotland, not least the A and the A. It is vital that our transport links with Scotland and England will still feature as prominently in future spending plans to improve connectivity across the United Kingdom.”The recommendation to cancel the project is expected to be confirmed with the publication of Sir Peter Hendy’s Union Connectivity Review.A view from Torr Head on the north Antrim coast looking over the Straits of Moyle towards the tip of the Mull of Kintyre in southwest Scotland which is a distance of  miles at its closest. A major transport connectivity review being led by Sir Peter Hendy was assessing the feasibility of a bridge or tunnel between Northern Ireland and Scotland. Picture date: Monday March , .Ministers asked the transport expert to examine the links between the four nations of the United Kingdom and to recommend projects to improve public transport connections.Parts of the Irish Sea are as deep as m in some parts, meaning it could be dficult to sink support towers into the seabed, while there are also concerns around the fact the area was used as an ammunition dump during the Second World War.A government source told the Sunday : “Hendy has examinedthis is affordable and practical and he concludes it would be technically very challenging.“That’s not to say it won’t become viable at some point, but at the moment it would be very, very dficult and expensive.”An artists impression of how the proposed Celtic Crossing bridge between Northern Ireland and Scotland might look.Two links were suggested for the bridge, either linking Portpatrick with Larne, or near Campbeltown to the Antrim coast.But SDLP Deputy Leader and Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon announced today that she has written to Prime Minister Boris Johnson calling on him to “hand over” the funds for the “failed” bridge.She had previously complained that the UK government had not consulted with her as Infrastructure Minister about the proposals and has consistently called the plans a “Tory vanity project”.She said: “Finally Boris Johnson seems to accept that his vanity project, the Boris Bridge, is not only technically unworkable but is a gross misuse of public money.The SNP’s party’s Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, labelled the plans “daft” but also claimed the money for the bridge “can and should be made available”.Earlier this year, the then cabinet secretary for transport, Michael Matheson, said money for infrastructure improvements in Scotland should go through existing channels and not come from the connectivity review.Ulster University Economist Esmond Birnie said it is impossible to knowNI will ever benefit financially as a result of the plans.“That question is unanswerable,” he told the News Letter. “We don’t know how much it would have cost and how the funding would have been achieved, for example, how much straight from Treasury or how much in effect a deduction from the NI block grant.”He said it was made more complicated because,the UK government was going to spend £bn over  years building the bridge, it cannot be known how much the UK was going to spend in NI over that period, in order to make a comparison with spending plansthey are scrapped.Askedthose behind the proposals had ever been serious about seeing them through, he added: “I’m sure the engineers who advocated the project were convinced that it was do-able and beneficial. It is not for me as an academic economist to speculate about the underlying motivations of some of the politicians.”A spokesman for the Department for Transport spokesman declined to confirm or denythe plans have been scrapped. “We don’t comment on speculation,” he told the News Letter. “The Union Connectivity Review will be published shortly.”He said the Department is not able to confirm what the cost of the feasibility studies have been up until now.Alan Dunlop, an architect in Stirling and visiting professor of Architecture at the University of Liverpool previously said the project was feasible in the technical sense.“I’m disappointed but not surprised,” he told the News Letter today. “Leaked reports in the media a month or so ago confirmed that this would happen. I’m disappointed because I know it can be done, creating a link, bridging the UK with Northern Ireland would be a project fit for the st Century, but politics seems to have scuppered the whole idea. It’s a pity, for the UK government talks a lot about Building Back Better and levelling up but there is no obvious strategy for infrastructure, architecture or the built environment.“This is a project that would have been a world first, nothing like it has been done before and it would help, like Roosevelt’s New Deal put people back to work.”MORE NEWSBurglar stole cash and cheques from church while cleric was preaching to flockChristmas market s to Belfast City Hall: what are opening times and Covid requirements NI High Street Voucher Scheme: How to check balance on spend local card and what to doyou need a refundA message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityHere we break down how Cardf and Vale University Health Board has performed in October .Ambulance response timesCardf and Vale had the highest emergency response rates in October according to the latest Welsh Government NHS Wales Performance data.For the health board,  lsquoredrsquo calls ndash calls which are for immediately le-threatening incidents ndash were received in October, with an emergency response sent out in  of these cases.Of these,  were at the scene to treat the patient within the Welsh Governmentrsquos eight-minute target. This was . per cent of those lsquoredrsquo calls being attended to in the response time - making Cardf and Vale the only health board in Wales to meet the  per cent target.The health board also received, amber - less urgent but still serious - calls and , green calls - cases where a non-emergency response is more appropriate..This October saw the highest number of calls for an ambulance than any other October since the May  period when the data was first made available. It was also the firth month in a row where the daily lsquoredrsquo call average was above  ndash with an average of  lsquoredrsquo calls last month.The Wales-wide statistics report that just  per cent of lsquoredrsquo calls received a response time within eight minutes ndash the lowest since the data was first made available in May . It is down . per cent on September.Darren Hughes, director of the Welsh NHS Confederation, said: ldquoThe pressures the NHS are currently facing, particularly in urgent and emergency care, are worrying for all. Recent figures show the impact that the enormous pressures on the NHS are having on ambulance waits outside of Emergency Departments and how this effects the experience of patients..removeldquoItrsquos important to understand that this is a whole-system issue. There are many factors affecting NHS capacity from staff absences because of Covid or suspected Covid, to more people on wards and in intensive care units needing treatment for Covid and higher demand for other conditions. The social care system is also under unprecedented pressure, meaning the NHS is unable to discharge patients from hospital and therefore has much lower capacity to treat incoming patients.ldquoThe NHS in Wales is working relentlessly to cope with current levels of demand and staff are doing all they can to ensure everyone waiting for care is seen as soon as possible. We thank them and the public for doing all they can to support the NHS.A spokesperson for the Welsh Government said: ldquoThe latest data shows the pressure on our health and care system continues to grow. But our hardworking health and social care staff continue to deliver high quality care when people need it.On the ambulance waits, the spokesperson said: ldquoThe ambulance service in Wales, like the rest of the UK, continues to be under great strain. The number of red calls, which are classed as le-threatening, in October were the highest ever on record. The number of calls in October were also  per cent higher than October last year.ldquoEarlier this year we provided an additional pound million to go towards supporting the transformation of urgent and emergency care services to deliver the right care in the right place, first time.ldquoThe ambulance service has also received funding for the recruitment of the equivalent of  staff.ldquoWe encourage people to consider the best options for care, and not necessarily head to their local emergency department. To get the right care first time, people can also use the online  service and their local pharmacist where appropriate.Emergency Department dataThe figures show , people attended the emergency department at University Hospital of Wales Cardf in October. Of these , - or . per cent - were seen within the four hour target. This puts the health board in the middle of the Welsh statistics.The latest data shows that there were,attendances to all NHS Wales emergency departments in October . This was: . per centlower than the previous month , . per centhigher than in the same month last yearbut . per centlowerthan October .MORE NEWS:The average number of emergency department attendances per day in October  was ,. This was:  fewer attendances per day on average than in the previous month,  more than in the same month in  but  fewer than in October .According to Welsh Government targets,  per cent of patients should spend less than four hours at an emergency department.The latest monthrsquos data shows that . per centof patients in all NHS emergency departments spent less than fourhours in the department from arrival until admission, transfer or discharge. This was: . per cent lower than the previous month, . per cent lower than the same month in , and . per cent lower than the same month in . The  per centtarget continues to be missed.Cancer treatment timesThe Cardf and Vale University Health Board is the third lowest health board in Wales for patients newly diagnosed with cancer starting their first definitive treatment within the first  days after diagnosis.In total  patients in the health board started their first treatment in the month of September, with  within the first  days of being suspected of having cancer. The total percentage is . per cent of patients starting their first treatment within  days. However this, and all of the health boards in Wales, falls below the target of  per cent.Prior to the Covid- pandemic, on average there were just under , patients starting their first definitive treatment per month. This number fell at the start of the pandemic to a low point of  in May  but has generally been on an upward trend since and in recent months has been in-line with or exceeded activity levels for the corresponding months in .In September , , patients newly diagnosed with cancer started their first definitive treatment in the month.This is an increase of . per centfrom August  and an increase of . per centfrom September .The Welsh Government spokesperson said: ldquoIt is encouraging the number of patients newly diagnosed with cancer starting their first definitive treatment and the number of patients informed they did not have cancer have both increased on the previous month.ldquoIn a boost to the diagnosis and treatment of cancer, the health minister today announced more than pound million is to be invested in replacing ageing diagnostic imaging equipment across NHS Wales.ldquoThis will signicantly improve image quality, often resulting in earlier and more accurate diagnosis.ldquoWe have invested an extra pound million this year to transform the delivery of services and tackle waiting times, but because of the ongoing pressures and effects of the pandemic we donrsquot expect to see real progress before the spring. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.
