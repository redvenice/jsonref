Photograph: Dara Mac DonaillThe Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly expressed surprise that higher-grade face masks were not recommended over cloth masks as the more infectious Omicron wave took hold last month.New correspondence released by the Department of Health shows that Mr Donnelly raised concerns with the State’s chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan about the quality of recommended masks in early January as the new Covid-19 variant led to a surge in cases.Mr Donnelly told Dr Holohan in a January 2nd email that he was “somewhat surprised” at the recommendation of an expert advisory group just before Christmas that respirator masks, such as the FFP2 or equivalent mask, were not required for the wider population.“While I accept that there may be barriers to implementation and that some people may find them hard to tolerate, I do not understand why we would not recommend highly effective certified masks,” the minister said in his email released under the Freedom of Information Act.“I believe we must provide clear communications that FFP2 (or equivalent) provide greater protection. People can make their own choices. I’m aware that a number of countries are already recommending medical masks, as opposed to cloth face coverings as the latter are regarded as inferiors.”He pointed to advice on the HSE’s website advising that cloth face masks are “what most people should wear in places where a face mask is required.”Mr Donnelly wrote: “I believe we have a duty to inform people that open-weave cloth coverings provider inferior protection. Given just how transmissible Omicron is, I would like the existing advice to be reconsideredrevisited as a matter of urgency.”Expired legal requirementTen days later, the National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) advised the Government that higher-grade respirator masks may better protect people at higher risk from Covid-19 but stopped short of recommending their use to the public instead of cloth face coverings.Nphet said that medical and respirator masks, if properly worn, would offer greater protection than cloth masks but stressed that all types of masks reduce transmission.Other EU countries such as Germany, Austria and Italy had introduced the use of FFP2 or equivalent masks in public spaces.The legal requirement to wear masks expired on Monday but people are still be advised to continue to wear a mask on public transport and in healthcare settings.Anyone who contracts Covid-19 has to isolate for seven days and, if they are 13 years or older, they should wear a medical grade or FFP2 mask for 10 days.Private nursing homes have been advised by their representative group, Nursing Homes Ireland, to continue to insist on mask wearing for visitors at care homes.The more contagious Omicron variant led to the highest number of Covid-19 infections of any of the five waves to affect the State during the pandemic.More than 500,000 people tested positive through confirmed Covid-19 PCR tests since the start of the year with tens of thousands more reporting positive antigen test results to the HSE.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"nct waiting list eight times higher than pre pandemic figures show","story":"As a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, a four-month deferrment was granted on March 28th, 2020 for cars registered before August 1st, 2016. Photograph: Dara MacDonaillThe number of people on the waiting list for a National Car Test (NCT) appointment is more than eight times higher than it was in the year prior to the Covid-19 pandemic, new figures show.The NCT roadworthiness test is conducted every two years for vehicles between four and nine-years-old. For vehicles 10 years or older, an annual inspection is required.However, as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, a four-month deferment was granted on March 28th, 2020 for cars registered before August 1st, 2016.Applus+, the company which runs the NCT, said coping with demand for testing this year has been “especially challenging” due to the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.“Quarter one each year is the busiest time for the NCT, as the NCT is due on the anniversary of the vehicle’s registration date and most people like to purchase new vehicles at the start of the year,” a spokeswoman said.“This year has been especially challenging with the impact of the Covid Omicron variant, which caused significant absenteeism levels for staff and many customer no-shows or late cancellations.”The NCT test centre network conducts approximately 46,000 tests each week, the spokeswoman said.“At present, we have approximately 8,500 customers waiting for a test appointment. In 2019, for the same period, the numbers waiting for an appointment would have been less than 1,000.”Lead timesHowever, the spokeswoman added that the NCT releases “significant volumes” of booking slots on a weekly basis as they “become certain of staff availability”.“The average lead time for an appointment is 20 days currently, and customers who add themselves to our waiting list, either on line, or through our call centre can expect to receive an appointment within 28 days,” she said.“Before the pandemic occurred, we would normally see the lead time for an appointment to be less than 12 days.”The NCT is also training a new batch of vehicle inspectors and plans to recruit further in April.A spokesman for the Department of Transport reiterated that the first quarter of the year is the busiest time of the year for the service.“Coinciding with this very busy period, is the need to manage the impact of Covid-19 on test centre staff availability. The department understands that all NCT test centres are operational and that the current average waiting time for an NCT test is 20 days,” he added.The spokesman added that appointment slots are released continually, with “many slots” becoming available through cancellations or rescheduling of appointments.“Some customers may only find dates that are beyond the due date for their NCT,” the spokesman said.“If a customer requires an appointment sooner than those available online, they should contact the NCTS directly or place themselves on the priority waiting list online. The NCTS will do its best to accommodate all customers on the priority list within 28 days of application.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"over one third of north s population hold irish passport","story":"Observers have suggested the surge in Irish passport applications, against a decline in British, was due to pragmatism among the North’s unionists since the UK withdrew from the EU.  More than a third of Northern Ireland’s population hold an Irish passport, according to latest official figures.While applications plunged amid overseas travel restrictions during pandemic lockdowns, fresh data from the Department of Foreign Affairs shows numbers rebounding.Already this year, 24,643 people were issued with Irish passports in the North through Northern Ireland Passport Express (NIPX), which is available at post offices in the North. This is more than 400 every day. The figures do not include Irish citizens in the North who apply for their passports directly from Dublin.If the trend continues it suggests more than 150,000 Irish passports would be issued in the North by the year end.This would eclipse, dramatically, the 107,937 issued through NIPX in 2019 – the last full-year figure before coronavirus prevented international travel for most.Issued passports during 2019 in the North soared 27 per cent from the previous year (84,855). This continued a pattern of rising Irish passport applications in the region against declining British applications following Brexit. Official figures show there were 110,506 applications from Northern Ireland for a UK passport in 2019. This was down from 119,298 the previous year, in a continuing 15 per cent slide in such applications from people in the North over a five-year period.LockdownDespite the virus grounding most of the world’s aircraft since the outbreak began, 56,709 Irish passports were issued in the North last year, up almost 16 per cent from 48,911 in 2020, when the first pandemic lockdown was imposed in Ireland.Aggregate figures for the decade 2012 to 2022, to date, show 660,427 Irish passports issued in the North, about 35 per cent of the region’s 1.8 million population. Under the Belfast Agreement, Irish and British governments recognise the birthright of all people in Northern Ireland to identify as either Irish, British or both. There is also a right to dual citizenship and people can carry Irish and British passports. Observers have suggested the surge in Irish passport applications, against a decline in British, is down to increasing pragmatism among the North’s unionists since the United Kingdom withdrew from the European Union. An Irish passport allows them to travel freely within the EU. The Democratic Unionist Party’s Sammy Wilson has previously said he gets “quite a lot” of loyalist voters in his constituency who ask him to sign off on their applications for Irish passports. The East Antrim MP said he encourages constituents going on holidays to opt for an Irish passport as it is a quicker process and negates restrictions imposed on British citizens in the EU as a result of Brexit.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"streets devoid of human interactions due to dominance of vehicles committee told","story":"The Oireachtas committee on transport has heard calls for the introduction of a default speed limit of 30kmh in built-up areas. Photograph: Dara Mac DónaillAn increasing focus on driver safety by car and road designers has had the unintended consequence of making roads less safe for pedestrians and other vulnerable road users, the Oireachtas transport committee has heard.Lorraine D’Arcy, of the School of Transport Engineering, Environment and Planning at TU Dublin, was one of a range of expert speakers who said the State’s default speed limit should be 30kmh in built-up areas.She said practices such as “overdesigning roads to increase driver comfort” and European ratings for cars which place an emphasis on the safety of those in the vehicle “have left communities dealing with an increased threat of larger and faster vehicles on their streets”. Ms D’Arcy said residential streets “used to be places to congregate and play, main streets used to be meeting places and commercial hubs”. She added: “Both are now becoming devoid of human interactions because of the dominance of the private vehicle. This not only has implications for local commerce, but also the health and wellbeing of our population.” Ms D’Arcy said the measurement of safe streets should not be just how many people are killed or injured “but a multi criteria assessment that includes the number of people walking and cycling in an area”. “Currently digital mapping and route-finding apps directed drivers into residential areas for trip-time savings based on current speed limits. Lower speed limits will discourage algorithms from directing traffic into these areas,” she said. Serve to benefitRoad Safety Authority chief executive Sam Waide told the committee that nine out of 10 pedestrians or cyclists would die if hit by a vehicle travelling at 60kmh. However, he said nine out of 10 would live if hit by a vehicle doing 30 kmh. “We must reduce the risks posed to pedestrians and cyclists,” he said. “Urban speed limits should not serve to benefit drivers, but rather benefit active travel and protect pedestrians and cyclists.” The target of introducing a reduced speed default limit in towns and villages is one of the key measures in the first phase of the current road safety strategy, and Mr Waide said the aim was to have it introduced by 2024. Mr Waide said Irish road deaths have declined by almost 70 per cent since 1998 and reducing fatalities and serious injuries by 50 per cent over the next decade was achievable. He also said the authority’s long term target of zero road deaths on the State’s roads by 2050 was achievable. PatchyMuireann O’Dea, of Love 30, a national alliance supporting a default 30kmh speed limit in built-up areas, said reviews have resulted in most local authorities introducing some 30kmh speed limits. “But their introduction has been patchy and inconsistent,” she said. Ms O’Dea said the best way forward was to introduce national legislation mandating a default 30 kmh speed limit in built-up areas. “It will then be up to councils to decide which (if any) roads should have a different speed limit. A default limit does not prevent a higher limit being introduced where it is deemed necessary and safe.” Committee chairman Kieran O’Donnell said there was “a process in play” in that a working group had been set up by the Department of Transport to investigate the issue. He said the committee would write to this group seeking to be involved, while also seeking the involvement of the Love 30 group.

Photograph: Niall CarsonPA Wire Dublin Bay South TD Ivana Bacik is being tipped as the firm favourite to become the next leader of the Labour Party following the shock resignation of Alan Kelly from the post on Wednesday.Mr Kelly said it had been “the best political day of my life” when he became leader and that he had been eager to lead the party into a general election.He spoke of his surprise at learning that he had lost the confidence of his colleagues in the parliamentary party on Tuesday. He acknowledged that there had been concerns about Labour’s polling performance and that the move followed a “number of frank discussions in recent weeks”.Sources said on Wednesday that recent meetings of the parliamentary Labour party discussed issues of culture and unhappiness over a recent appointment made to a backroom position within the party.Mr Kelly’s near two-year period in charge of the party was marked by the high point of Ms Bacik’s success in the Dublin Bay South byelection. The party also secured the election of its Seanad candidates, but he failed to spark a revival in Labour’s standing in the polls.Becoming emotionalSeveral party sources said Ms Bacik is the likely next leader, with one saying she is the “only candidate”. Mr Kelly said that a new leader will take up the reins shortly, and that he will stay on in the interim.Becoming occasionally emotional as he expressed thanks to his family and co-workers, Mr Kelly said that the party had not got the “bounce” he had hoped for in the past two years and that he felt restricted in his capacity as leader during the pandemic.“It is also a reality that it had been hard for us, as a party, very much associated with the term 2011-2016 and for those of us involved in that government, to move on, and I think it’s time now we did,” he said.He promised to back the new leader, and said that while he was saddened by the decision, “I must respect it”. Flanked by the full parliamentary Labour party, he said he had “no interest in a rancorous or isive debate”."},{"url":null,"title":"miriam lord emotions run high as labour assassins decommission ak 47","story":"Labour Party leader Alan Kelly announces his resignation on Wednesday.  Photograph: Alan Betson Wearing their glummest “this hurts us more than it hurts you” expressions, Alan Kelly’s solicitous assassins walked him out to the microphone, silently surrounding him while he announced his resignation as leader of the Labour Party.There was no way out for Alan Kelly.“Once the lads came to me, I think, within seconds I said: ‘Yeah, let’s just work this through.’”So, “the lads” had come for him. That’s heavy-duty stuff.The shock resignation on Wednesday night was one of the strangest sign-offs ever witnessed in Leinster House. When deputy Kelly appeared as usual at Leaders’ Questions, nobody suspected it would be his last. Or that there was a reason for the discernibly stricken faces of Duncan Smith and Seán Sherlock sitting directly – and clearly uncomfortably – behind him.It is why Kelly suddenly seemed on the verge of breaking down in the middle of asking the Taoiseach about the Russian ambassador. There was something about the unexpected pause followed by this deep, shuddering intake and powerful exhalation of breath which made people look up take notice.The irony of Kelly urging the Government to expel Yury Filatov while he had just been expelled from the leadership of his own party was lost.But that was all. Clues after the event always seem so obvious. Alan’s final question to the Taoiseach, leader to leader, was about the possible amalgamation of the GAA, the Ladies Gaelic Football Association and the Camogie Association.If, as he hopes, it happens, “will the Government give them a few bob?” Given all the issues, domestic and international, he could have raised, this was the one he chose to go out on. He even managed to mention his local GAA club (Portroe in Tipperary) where his daughter plays both codes.Lighthearted banterDeputy Kelly clearly enjoyed putting the question to Micheál Martin and they had some lighthearted banter, even if an amused Ceann Comhairle wondered about its relevance to the subject of promised legislation.Another clue after the event. A strange valedictory choice, but then, very little seems straightforward about the manner of Alan Kelly’s departure. Yet.It was mid-afternoon before word leaked that the politician known as AK-47 had been decommissioned. Labour had managed to keep this news under wraps – no small achievement in the Leinster House gossip sieve, even for a parliamentary party so shrunken in size there aren’t that many people left to spill the beans.Journalists, blindsided by the development, scrambled for the backstory.But they weren’t the only ones caught on the hop. “This was a surprise to me,” admitted Alan, who sounded both shocked and upset at what was happening.Did he leave of his own accord or was he pushed? Why did he go? Who did the pushing? Why now?And the biggest conundrum of all, the one which had everyone baffled. Was brash Alan “power is a drug” AK-47 Kelly really going quietly? Like, really?Yes, he was, officially confirming his resignation at a hastily convened press conference on the Leinster House plinth in the sympathetic presence of his concerned colleagues who took him out. There, standing broken-hearted in the middle of their Do Not Escape Doughnut, he said he was resigning as leader of the Labour Party because they told him to go.He didn’t want to go but he “accepted the decision immediately” after the unnamed “lads” arrived to tell him they had lost “collective confidence” in his leadership.Division bellsAs the Dáil’s ision bells rang out, they weren’t only tolling for the Wednesday night votes. Kelly was deeply upset. His voice began to waver from the moment he began talking, buckling when he spoke of his lifelong involvement “literally” with Labour.“Becoming leader of the Labour Party was the best day of my life,” he declared, voice cracking again. The people who ousted him looked so distraught one had to wonder why they got rid of him in such a speedy and clinical fashion.Throughout his highly emotional speech, Kelly kept referring to his uncomfortable-looking party colleagues as “lads” and to the journalists as “lads”, as if this was some minor little hiccup on the road to oblivion. Sure, he was going for a few pints with his colleagues later on, he revealed.First round on AK-47. “Here’s your pints, lads, and I’ve put those knives you stabbed me in the back with on the tray as well.”Alan’s “fantastic” wife, Regina, was there to support him. “She would be fantastic, lads, she’s from Kerry.” He broke down again while talking about his family and his political team. They weren’t present. “They would have been up here with me if this had happened tomorrow,” he ruefully sighed. But the lads didn’t allow their departing leader the small luxury of timing and softening his departure.All we know is that Kelly didn’t want to go but he went when he was politely asked. He feels hard done by and wanted to lead the party into the next election. He is very sad, but accepts his fate. Why? What did the lads bring him to make him capitulate so easily, particularly when he so patently did not want to go anywhere?Earlier in the afternoon, the talk in the Dáil was all about the war in Ukraine and rising inflation here.“Breaking news!” barked Mick Barry, who has a flair for the dramatic, although we’re fairly full up on that particular front at the moment.No big news there, indicated the Taoiseach. “I said that this morning.”Magnificent impressionIt certainly came as news to the socialist TD for Cork North Central, who declared he’d only found out in the last hour. “Wow! Wow!” marvelled Mick, doing a magnificent impression of president Mary McAleese when she heard Queen Elizabeth saying her few words in Irish at a State banquet in Dublin Castle.But not so fast with your 5.8 per cent, Mick.If the Taoiseach wanted news, his colleague Richard Boyd Barrett had a fresh gobbet to impart.“Yeah, well, what is breaking news as well as that is . . .” the war in Ukraine and the sanctions are likely to produce an additional 4 per cent inflation on top of the current rate. “On top of that, right? So we’re looking at potentially up to 9 per cent inflation now.”Any more breaking news?“Hold me beer,” is probably what Alan Kelly wanted to shout as he sat alone in the Dáil chamber listening to Boyd Barrett and Barry trade revelations. He was, after all, nursing some big news of his own.It took a few hours for a tearful Kelly to confirm his news.And so it was, with Leinster House lit up in the blue-and-yellow national colours of Ukraine, the county colours of Tipperary, Alan Kelly began caretaking duties until a successor is selected.“So, lads, Leo will be taking questions from me tomorrow in the Dáil.” No doubt this time the lads will turn out in force to support him.Our own Harry McGee tweeted: “The whole scene reminded you of Nabokov’s famous story: Invitation to a Beheading.”And People Before ProfitSolidarity’s Paul Murphy graciously tweeted: “Nice to get some good news in a generally pretty grim situation.”"},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Decades of progress overshadowed by Putin crackdowns and confrontation with WestRussia\u0026rsquos land of the midnight sun said to have inspired creator of Chanel No. 5Atomic icebreakers and floating power plants to help Kremlin develop Arctic shipping routeMinority nations feel squeeze as Putin\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquopower vertical\u0026rsquo crushes republics\u0026rsquo autonomyHistory of bloodshed and tragedy haunts stunning region shared by Muslims and ChristiansOil wealth and new mosque and churches help keep Tatarstan on Kremlin\u0027s sideOfficials claim West wants to \u0026lsquoGermanise\u0026rsquo and instil special identity in strategic regionNato monitors heavily armed Kaliningrad as locals long for borders to reopenAttack on renowned Memorial rights group deepens opposition anger and international alarmSaint Petersburg Letter: Russia\u0026rsquos old imperial capital celebrates 200 years since birth of Crime and Punishment creatorEnergy giant hopes vast forests will offset carbon costs and ease green transitionCircassian heritage trampled and property rows continue as Winter Olympics city boomsKremlin criticised as most Russians reject vaccination and hospitals face huge strainKremlin changes tack on global warming and looks to vast forests to offset emissionsRussia and Japan co-operate on Sakhalin despite row over nearby Kuril islandsIndustry and struggling communities fear wildlife support could stifle Far East developmentCity with echoes of San Francisco is thrillingly original, yet tarnished by graft and neglectGrowing energy, security and diplomatic links between Moscow and Beijing worry WestDecembrist rebels and their aristocratic wives embraced \u0026lsquoreal Russia\u0026rsquo in Siberian exileFears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo roleInside Russia: More protests planned as officials reject calls to address e-voting complaintsMoscow Letter: Poet\u0026rsquos statue has been a magnet for generations of Russian dissentersOn the eve of an expected sham election, many of Putin\u0026rsquos political opponents are already jailed or dead"},{"url":null,"title":"young africans","story":"Authors are tackling topics from transgender rights to Islamic extremism, and picking up plenty of awardsAbout 2.4 million forced to leave their homes during 13-year-long war with Boko HaramTom Saater has a rags to riches story and a unique insight into Nigeria\u0026rsquos biggest cityIn one of the world\u0026rsquos most dangerous places to attend school, teachers lead lessons and the students comeAfrican country\u0026rsquos tech innovators call for international investment and domestic supportYoung Nigerians dance out onto world stage with pride, confidence and high ambitionWomen-led organisation aims to stop atrocities of dictatorship from reoccurringIn the Gambia, a flourishing comedy scene is used to convey serious messagesStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"west clinging delusion survival can bought cheap","story":"Vladimir Putin’s criminally obscene invasion of Ukraine has changed everything.

It will require us to relearn strategies, tactics and virtues at odds with the hyper-emotional performative stupidity and instant gratification of the Twitter era. Our elites will need to reprogramme themselves psychologically, economically and militarily, read some history, become more serious and austere, and knuckle down for a lengthy fight.I’m not sure they are ready for the challenges ahead. So far, while the West has successfully launched an economic blitzkrieg on Russia, hammering it far more comprehensively than expected, Putin hasn’t retaliated with counter-sanctions and export restrictions. He may yet decide to do so, cutting off energy, fertiliser or precious metal supplies. Such a move would be suicidal for his regime, but would wreak devastation in the West, forcing the imposition of rationing, three-day weeks and speed limits as we scramble to find new sources of oil and gas.But even without an actual embargo, Europe and Britain are already facing an energy shock similar to that caused by the 1973 Arab oil crisis, the 1979 Iranian revolution or the 1990 First Gulf War. Household energy bills could hit £3,000 a year when the next price cap is set, and the price of petrol is rocketing: a recession is no longer inconceivable. Coming so soon after the damage and higher inflationary pressures caused by Covid, tens of millions of people face gradual impoverishment. The political consequences could be severe.Yet all of this pales in comparison with the dawning realisation that we are about to return to the nuclear anxiety that gripped a generation of children between the 1960s and 1980s. The chance of an atomic Armageddon – either because of a calamitous miscalculation by an unstable, desperate Putin, or indirectly if a collapse of the Russian regime triggers a fire sale of weaponry – while still low, is the highest it has been since before the Reagan-Gorbachev Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty was signed in 1987.Russia is merely the first of the authoritarian states to openly declare its hand: there will be more wars, invasions and egregious violations of sovereignty. A nuclear Iran would surely launch a calamitous attack on Israel or the Gulf China might in time seek to invade Taiwan North Korea is run by a madman nuclear Pakistan may one day go rogue, and so on.One significant consequence of this abrupt shift in the world order is that the post-Cold War peace idend will no longer pay out. We will need to spend more on defence. We must turbocharge our economic growth with supply-side reforms, not just to bolster living standards but also to compensate for the costs of deglobalisation and to generate the resources required to fight authoritarian powers. We will require a sensible energy policy: like in the 1970s, we have been caught out, this time by our idiotic decision, driven by green zealots, to shut down domestic production of oil and gas without building the nuclear capacity required to supplement renewables.The greatest immediate change will need to come in defence expenditure. The Integrated Review needs itself to be immediately reviewed. The Nato target of 2 per cent of GDP is fine in peacetime, but laughably low when a new iron curtain is descending on Europe and we need to deter, contain and frighten rogue regimes worldwide.The peace idend after the collapse of the USSR was worth at least 2 per cent of GDP. Britain’s defence spending was around 7 per cent of a much smaller GDP in the 1950s, and remained around 4-5 per cent between the late 1960s and late 1980s. Boris Johnson will need to bite the bullet: we must urgently increase spending back to 3 per cent of GDP, and conceivably to 3.5 per cent if we want to be Europe’s leading military power. I don’t say this with any relish: I’m not a militarist. But there are no other responsible options, and increased spending will also have to be accompanied by radical procurement reform to ensure billions aren’t wasted.Britain’s peace idend has been spent more than once, primarily on pensions and the NHS. With the tax burden already at an all-time high, the economy cannot take VAT going from 20 to 25 per cent, or an extra £40 billion increase in national insurance. This would condemn us to a zero-growth economy, which would be morally and geopolitically indefensible.The post-Blairite era of social-democratic largesse must end: the state needs to refocus on its core function of defending lives, liberty and property. We require less redistribution, and enhanced resilience. This implies large spending cuts. The social care plan will need to be abandoned, the pensions triple-lock axed, the NHS reformed and numerous wasteful subsidies, pseudo-levelling-up policies and other programmes and handouts ended.We have prevented the free market from supplying cheap energy, so the state will have to foot a huge bill. Britain needs at least five more Hinkley Point C-style nuclear power plants, at a cost of £110 billion. The best way to pay for this is to scrap HS2, write off the cash already spent and sell off all its land and assets. Uneconomic grand projets are an obsolete self-indulgence at a time of war.Yes, Russia is staggeringly weak, a decaying nation with a population much less than half that of the US, and a GDP far lower than that of New York state. But it has nuclear weapons and needs to be deterred and eventually defeated. We must also send a signal to China, a country that is immensely richer and more sophisticated than the Soviet Union ever was, that the West is serious once more. This is a new Cold War, and we must urgently contain the authoritarian powers at war with liberal democracy.More from NewsPolitics latest news: UK has only approved a ‘few hundred’ visas for Ukrainian refugees, minister suggestsRadio and TV station in Kyiv hit by Russian strikes after night of bombingUkraine-Russia morning briefing: Five key developments as Putin\u0026#39s forces take strategic cityI was targeted by Russia’s wartime propaganda machine in Syria.

In return for not involving themselves in the Russian autocrat’s political agenda, the oligarchs are, by and large, allowed to pursue their commercial interests without undue interference from the Kremlin.Thus, high-profile oligarchs of the ilk of Roman Abramovich, the multi-billionaire owner of Chelsea football club (now up for sale), who previously served as governor of the remote Russian region of Chukotka, have been able to carry on generating wealth, confident in the knowledge that they have the Kremlin’s backing.This elite group, though, is also well aware of the risks they run if they are foolhardy enough to involve themselves in Russian politics. Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who was believed at one point to be the country’s wealthiest man, discovered this to his cost when he made the mistake of taking Mr Putin to task over rampant corruption in the highest echelons of the Russian government.Back in the summer of 2001, when I first met Mr Khodorkovsky in Moscow, he came across as a friendly and energetic inidual who had a genuine interest in promoting Russian democracy. When I subsequently saw him again at the end of last year, he seemed nervous and introverted, wary of making eye contact, presumably the result of the years he spent in a remote Russian penal colony for daring to challenge Mr Putin’s regime.Other oligarchs who have crossed swords with Russia’s megalomaniacal leader have not been so lucky. Boris Berezovsky, a former business associate of Mr Abramovich who fled to London after becoming a vocal critic of Mr Putin, was found dead in mysterious circumstances at his Berkshire home in 2013 – a death his supporters still insist was the work of Russian security agents.Given the very well-documented perils of crossing Mr Putin, therefore, it has been surprising to see prominent Russian oligarchs appearing to take issue with his decision to invade Ukraine.By far the most high-profile oligarch to break ranks has been Mikhail Fridman, one of Russia’s richest men, who was born in the Ukrainian city of Lviv. In a letter to his staff, he wrote: “I am deeply attached to Ukrainian and Russian peoples and see the current conflict as a tragedy for them both.” He declined to comment further, saying that to do so would place his employees in Russia and Ukraine at risk.Mr Khodorkovsky, who has mainly kept his silence since being released in 2013, showed no such reticence in a rare public appearance, denouncing the Russian leader as a “madman”, insisting: “We are not dealing with a sane person.”Even Mr Abramovich, long regarded in Western circles as a Putin loyalist, may not be all that happy with the situation in Ukraine – although it was his daughter Sofia who posted an anti-Putin meme on social media.If Mr Abramovich has not directly criticised the Kremlin over Ukraine, his prominent position has seen him undertaking an unofficial mediation role. A supporter of the campaign against anti-Semitism, Mr Abramovich reportedly enjoys the trust of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, some of whose Jewish ancestors were murdered in the Holocaust.In a week when Russian forces saw fit to bomb the site of Kyiv’s Babyn Yar Holocaust memorial, which marks where the Nazis massacred 34,000 Jews, Mr Abramovich’s spokesman confirmed that he was asked by Ukraine for his help in achieving a peaceful resolution, and that he has been attempting to do so.While Mr Putin still shows no inclination to pull back from his murderous assault on Ukraine, Mr Abramovich’s quiet diplomacy suggests that, at least as far as some Russian oligarchs are concerned, they have more to offer than simply helping to prop up Mr Putin’s tyrannical regime – a consideration Western leaders might want to take into account as they weigh their next round of Russian sanctions.With their vast wealth and close ties to the Kremlin, Russia’s army of oligarchs is an obvious target as the West seeks – quite justifiably – to inflict maximum damage on Russia for its unprovoked assault on Ukraine.This, according to Forbes, has led Russia’s 116 billionaires to lose more than $126 billion between them since the conflict began – losses that will undoubtedly cause many oligarchs to question their unwavering loyalty to the Kremlin.Certainly, with their country facing financial ruin, the oligarchs are better placed than most Russians to ask, either openly or in private, whether Russia’s interests continue to be best served by having Mr Putin remain in power.More from NewsPolitics latest news: UK has only approved a ‘few hundred’ visas for Ukrainian refugees, minister suggestsRadio and TV station in Kyiv hit by Russian strikes after night of bombingUkraine-Russia morning briefing: Five key developments as Putin\u0026#39s forces take strategic cityI was targeted by Russia’s wartime propaganda machine in Syria.

The Commons Science Committee discussed which was the best measure of the death toll from the pandemic as many indicators show the UK has fared worse than most comparable nations. Ed Humpherson, the head of the Office for Statistics Regulation, was grilled on which of the data was the best measure of Covid deaths. Labour MP Graham Stringer suggested a lower measure of less than , deaths for which Covid- is the only cause listed on the death certicate could be the best measure.This measure has been highlighted by lockdown sceptics to play down the true impact of the pandemic.  Mr Humpherson told MPs: “I so dislike that figure I’m not going to repeat it back. “There is a figure which has been circulating which is based on the number of cases where the only cause listed on the death certicate was Covid. “Butyou look at the all of the death certicates where is Covid is listed as the underlying cause that’s ,. “That the smaller number is highly misleading because it’s taking a very small subset of those death certicates where Covid is listed as the underlying cause.” How Britain measures deaths has been the subject of some debate.

It has been pointed out that some of these deaths would have been caused by something  and the virus would have only been incidental to the death.

Tory ministers reformed the system of payments between separated partners in . There is now more focus on asking parents to agree payments - usually from men to women - privately with no state involvement. This was meant to improve take-up of child maintenance payments, getting kids more cash. Yet there has been “no clear change in the overall number of effective child maintenance arrangements”, the National Audit Officerevealed. There has in fact been “an increase in the number of parents with no child maintenance arrangement at all.”  Britain has .million separated families, % of which pay or receive no child maintenance. Some % have a “family-based arrangement”, a private agreement between separated parents. Only % use a statutory arrangement which is managed by the Department for Work and Pensions . While family-based arrangements have risen from % of families since , statutory arrangements have fallen more dramatically from %. The NAO said the  shake-up was meant to come with a wider reforms which are “yet to emerge as envisioned”.  The gross cost to taxpayers has fallen by £m and enforcement and compliance have both improved. But “it can still take years” before rogue parents pay arrears, the NAO said - with the average debt building up to £, by the time enforcement is complete. More than half of parents in the Collect  Pay system run by the DWP either don’t pay, pay less than they should, or pay late. NAO chief Gareth Davies said: Government has succeeded in its goal of reducing both its involvement in child maintenance and the cost to the taxpayer. “But its reforms have not increased the number of effective maintenance arrangements across society. “Many separated parents are still left without the maintenance payments they are due. “Welfare and child maintenance rules need to align much better to support governmentaposs wider objectives of addressing poverty and helping people into work. Public Accounts Committee chair Meg Hillier said: “Progress has been made in reducing costs to the taxpayer, with fewer parents using the government’s Child Maintenance Service and instead opting for private arrangements. “However, the bottom line is that too many children are suffering by not getting the financial support they deserve. “Across society, the number of families with effective child maintenance arrangements in place has remained stubbornly static.” A DWP spokesperson said: “The CMS puts children first – in the last  months a record £ billion was collected and arranged through the service. “Child maintenance payments help lt around , children out of poverty each year. “More than a third of separated parents make their own arrangements without any government support which is better for families and the taxpayer, allowing CMS to focus on supporting parents where that arrangement wouldn’t work or those who won’t pay.” Chair of Families Need Fathers, Paul O’Callaghan, said: “Children need the love and care and financial support of both parents. “The NAO report is a damning indictment on the failure of the Government to create legislation that does more good than harm. “Tens of thousands of parents are falling behind with their child maintenance payments, not because they won’t pay, but because they can’t.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Conservative PartyNational Audit OfficeDepartment for Work and PensionsGareth DaviesMeg HillierChildcarePolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Activists have braved four named storms in a bid to drum up support for the city councillor, who has vowed to press the Government over its Levelling Up plans. Keir Starmer, who has visited the seat several times on the campaign trail, has been enjoying a boost in the polls after the Prime Ministeraposs popularity was damaged by rule-busting parties at Downing Street during lockdown and Tory sleaze.Most recent polls put Labour between four and six percentage points ahead of the Conservatives.

The leader of Birmingham City Councilaposs Conservative group has stood for the seat in every election since . Labour insiders still nervous after losing the Red Wall seat of Hartlepool admit turnout in the constituency, which has historically been very low in the area, and a large number of independent candidates makes the result hard to predict.

We’ve had two bids for levelling up funding rejected by the Tory government, yet Bromsgrove, one of the richest areas in the country, has secured millions. “This area has been ignored by the Tories for too long, and I hope to be a strong voice for Erdington and will challenge the Government on lack of investment and regional health inequalities,I am fortunate enough to be elected this Thursday.” Tory MPs called for Ms Hamilton to be suspended on the eve of the by-election after comments she made at a  event were unearthed by GB News. She was recorded as saying: “The postal vote is the way some of our ethnic minority communities actually lock it down. Because what they do is whole families just have the postal vote.“Whoever comes in says hold this one, tick, postal vote goes back, and in one household we can have eight votes and it’s locked down.” She also said: “You talk about the bullet or the vote, I’m not sure, although I believe in the vote, and I believe in our right to use that vote or destroy that vote, I’m not sure that we will get what we really deserve in this country using the vote.“But I don’t knowwe are a strong enough group to get what we want to getwe have an uprising.

There is no suggestion of any wrongdoing by Ms Chernukhin, who is a British citizen and has been legally entitled to make political donations since .The Mirror understands the first payment was for a table at the party’s notorious Black and White Ball fundraiser, where wealthy benefactors can rub shoulders with senior ministers and MPs while Boris Johnson rattles his donation tin to bolster party coffers.The second donation is understood to be a successful bid in the event’s auction, where the party sells access to cabinet ministers to the highest bidder.Ms Chernukhin has repeatedly paid for access to successive Prime Ministers ministers in the auction, including a cosy night out with Theresa May and a tennis match with Boris Johnson.Last yearaposs event saw an hour playing cricket with Rishi Sunak sold for £, - while a karaoke session with Foreign Secretary Liz Truss raised £,, though it’s not currently known what Ms Chernukhin’s cash bought her.In total Ms Chernukhin has given almost £ million to the party - and is the biggest female political donor in British history.

Ukraine will prove the fatal, final mistake by a fascistic gangster who egotistically believed his own invincible propaganda after strategic triumphs in Crimea and Syria, and the  Trump and Brexit blows delivered to the US and UK. Vlad the Invader’s twitchy finger on the nuclear trigger and the offer of Potemkin negotiations are both signs even he fears this is an impending personal Armageddon. This is fuelled by brave Ukrainians fighting heroically and Russians courageously protesting “No to War”, which is inspiring resistance around the world. Supplying anti-tank, helicopter and aircraft missiles strengthens defenders and weakens attackers already suffering punishing losses. Britain, the rest of Europe and the US finally uniting over economic and cultural sanctions will eventually bankrupt the Putin machine and perhaps drive a deep wedge between the tyrant and his billionaire cronies who enjoy opulent luxury wherever they please.  And China abstaining instead of vetoing a UN Security Council motion by the US condemning the brutal invasion emphasised Putin’s isolation, as a new ally quickly distanced itself from an ageing, deranged dictator. The bloody conflict could still belong: reducing Ukrainian neighbourhoods to rubble, inflicting unbearable heartache and costing countless lives. What is becoming clearer, however, is that Putin is also likely to be one of the victims. But let’s not buy charlatan Boris Johnson’s propaganda that he is suddenly an international statesman, a Prime Minister orchestrating the resistance. Johnson let Putin walk all over him and Britain, with oligarchs smirking unconcerned whenever ruling Conservatives, reliant on Russian-linked money, talked tough then acted soft.Charismatic, cool-headed, defiant Ukrainian Volodymyr Zelensky is what a real leader looks and sounds like. Germany’s centre-Left Olaf Scholz is also rising to the occasion, standing up to Putin at considerable financial expense. A European Union that Johnson ripped Britain from as part of a career move was firmer on sanctions until shamed Johnson started running to catch up. Locking out Ukrainian refugees fleeing terror unless they apply to be fruit pickers is disgraceful and inhuman, when Poland, Romania and Hungary open their borders. Why not seize the spacious British properties of Russian oligarchs to house Putin’s casualties  I’ve watched and known Johnson for longer than the  years Putin has misruled Russia. So I’m aware of the cynicism of the great charlatan. From coronavirus to Brexit, our daily politics newsletter is there to guide you these turbulent times. The newsletter is sent out twice daily with the latest UK  world politics news, along with leading opinion and analysis.You can sign up here.  The first casualty of war is Partygate, with Johnson relieved that the shells and missiles are effectively providing a smokescreen. If he’s hit by a fine, the PM will pray it is today. Now wouldn’t be the moment to remove a lawbreaker in Downing Street, his apologists will argue. They’d be wrong, of course. Chamberlain was dumped by MPs to be replaced by Churchill during the Second World War then, before Japan finally surrendered, the country swapped Churchill for Attlee. Labour leader Keir Starmer will inevitably receive less airtime than the PM but should have calculated that he must be constructively critical rather than mercilessly pummelling the Tory rogue.

Jordan had always wanted to live in Australia, with his family saying he was living his dream and was very happy, reported NorthWalesLive. On the day of the tragedy, in February , Jordan had been out with his friends watching a surfing competition before going out for drinks. They were walking back towards the hotel where one of the group, Mitchell Phillpotts was staying, when Jordan and Mr Phillpots decided to climb to the top of a church. Speaking during the hearing Mr Phillpotts said that he couldnapost say how the decision came about to climb the building but said that Jordan climbed on to the roof of a small building next door to the church, before they both made their way to the roof of the church. He told of how the pair climbed up together and stepped over a skylight on their way up before sitting at the top of the building for around  minutes . He said: He started to follow me back down. On the way back down, I stepped over the skylight as we had done on the way up. I donapost remember hearing anything, we were just talking at the time and then I didnapost hear him talking anymore. I turned around and he had fallen through the skylight. I donapost remember hearing glass break. Mr Phillpotts broke the door to the church to help Jordan who was on the ground unresponsive, before shouting to a friend to call the emergency services. Jordan was pronounced dead at the scene and the postmortem, carried out in Australia before his body was repatriated, showed that he sustained multiple injuries. In a statement read out during the inquest Jordanaposs mother, Jill Mawson, called her son as an amazing person who could was always full of energy and enthusiasm. She said: We want to remember our Jordan, not for how he died but for how he lived. He loved le and was an amazing son, grandson, brother, nephew, partner and friend. He was loved and adored by all who were lucky to know him. Jordan was so full of energy and enthusiasm and had a zest for adventure - he was happiest when climbing mountains, surfing and snowboarding. He loved getting to know people and had a genuine interest in peopleaposs lives and loved listening to peoples stories. His main goal was always to help anyone who needed help and support and he showered us all with his love. His smile could light up a room and his kindness and ability to see the best in everyone is what we are most proud of. He will always be our shining star and the love for our boy is forever strong. Acting senior coroner Katie Sutherland concluded that Jordan had died as the result of a tragic accident and went on to say that his death had been both unexpected and unintended. Ms Sutherland said: It brings home how tragic some things can end up. Jordan had clearly been living his best le and doing that he wanted to do. These are very tragic circumstances.After his death a Gofundme page was set up by his sister, Alicia Baker, along with the Jordan Baker Foundation with the idea of making a positive dference in peopleaposs lives.More than £, was raised in Jordanaposs memory through the site.An Instagram page - JB Travelling Tributes - was also set up with the family encouraging anyone that was influenced by Jordan to write his initials or a tribute to him on a rock, pebble, shell or leaf and leave it in a location while on a hike, visiting a beach, seeing a new city or travelling somewhere new. The picture of the tribute would then be added to the Instagram page to inspire others to travel and enjoy le in the way that Jordan did.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Inquests\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Annabelle, five, went to Waterworld in Stoke-on-Trent as an early birthday treat with her family on Sunday.Ashley and Jessica Curwood splashed out £ on tickets, £. on parking, and £. on a locker after travelling from their Nottinghamshire home, StokeonTrentLive reports. They claim Annabelle suffered sore eyes and chesty coughs within  minutes of getting into the water due to the chlorine levels. They say other families had similar complaints. Waterworld has claimed that there were no health and safety breaches.  The family say they arrived at the Festival Park attraction at am and got into the water at .am. Ashley, aged , said: “Our eyes were stinging really badly and there were quite a few people coughing. We looked at the leguards and their eyes looked like they were streaming. They were going in the first aid box and getting the eyewash out to wash their eyes. “I spoke to one of them and asked what was happening. They said something had happened with one of the pumps and there was too much chlorine in the water.  “Your eyes always sting when you go to a swimming pool but this was quite extreme. You were constantly rubbing your eyes. We had to go and wash them out with water. It was mainly my daughter we were worried about.” Ashley added: “We were advised to go out of the pool for half an hour, wash our eyes out, and try not to go under the water. We tried to carry on but it was getting quite bad. “Our daughter started coughing a lot and she said her chest was hurting. She went and sat on the side, I got her a drink of water. She was upset and didn’t want to go back into the water. “I spoke to a member of staff at around pm and they said we had been in here for a few hours so they couldnapost do anything about it in terms of a refund. He said they could offer us some mini-golf tickets or change our pass so we could stay all day.“I spoke to my we and my daughter but she didn’t want to stay in the pool. We said we will do mini-golf. But when we got changed and everything my daughter said she didn’t want to do that, she wanted to go home. We told them we didn’t want to do it anymore. We were told it was either mini-golf or tickets to come back another day. We didn’t want to come back. I’m not happy about it.The couple later called NHS  and Annabelle was advised to go to AE.Ashley added: “My we was in there for about three-and-a-half hours which was longer than you got in the pool. They said she was not in any danger but they confirmed it was aposchlorine gas poisoningapos. “We have to watch her for the next few days and make sure her breathing is fine and that she is not coughing up blood.” Ashley has made a complaint to Stoke-on-Trent City Councilaposs trading standards.He said: “As soon as we got her away from it she was feeling fine. I am massively disappointed with the company. “We had an hour in the pool and the rest of the time we were out washing our eyes. “If they had just apologised, here is your money back, and we hope you come back again we probably would have. “The main thing I wanted was my money back, it’s not cheap. It cost around £ to go there. £. for parking and then £. for a locker. “It takes about  minutes for us to get there. I said we don’t fancy coming back, it’s not a two minute drive for us. I’ve emailed the website to ask how I can make a formal complaint.” Waterworld has been operating for  years and had , customers on Sunday. A Waterworld spokesman told StokeonTrentLive: All pool tests and operational plantroom procedures were followed and adhered to fully, as is the norm. There were no breaches in any health and safety protocols. As a business, we ensure our customers are dealt with in a fair manner. We do our best to make sure all customers leave with a smile. We believe the manager on duty did all he could to address the situation and offer a remedy. The Mirror has contacted Waterworld for a statement.

The snap, taken in , will go on display at Kensington Palace from Friday , as part of a major new exhibition titled Le Through A Royal Lens, exploring the British Royal Family’s enduring relationship with the camera.The striking black and white portrait showing the Princess reserved, stoic and looking away from the viewer, comes from a sitting commissioned by the National Portrait Gallery. While several photographs from this shoot were acquired for their collection, this portrait was retained by Bailey for his archive and has never been seen in public before.Several established royal photographers were suggested to the Princess for the commission, but experts say her choice of David Bailey’s bold minimalism reflected her desire to establish a new photographic identity for herself.She was only the second member of the Royal Family to sit for Bailey, the first being Lord Snowdon – husband of Princess Margaret, and himself a renowned photographer – in .Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm. Click here to sign up .The image of him smoking a cigar also features in the exhibition, and secured Bailey’s place in popular culture as a central figure of Swinging Sixties London. Postponed from its original opening in , Le Through a Royal Lens will see some of the most iconic royal photographs ever taken go on show alongside a host of images providing a glimpse of the Royal Family off duty.  From the stf formality of the Victorian era, through the high glamour of Cecil Beaton’s photographs of Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother, to the relaxed informality of the digital age. The David Bailey image of Diana is on loan from The Princess Diana Museum. Lord Snowdon’s iconic photograph of Princess Margaret wearing the Poltimore Tiara – designed by royal jeweller Garrard in  and worn by the Princess on her wedding day in  - in the bathtub at their home in Kensington Palace also features in the exhibition.  Elsewhere in the display, iconic magazine photoshoots including the Duke of Cambridge’s cover photo in Attitude Magazine and the Duchess of Cambridge’s centenary issue of British Vogue in  will explore how photography and image remain central to the public’s perception of the modern Royal Family today.

Putin raised the awful spectre of nuclear confrontation because he’s losing, or at least not winning as easily as he expected. His calamitous miscalculation in invading Ukraine is backfiring badly now, and the world is uniting against him. He faces a battle at home too, as anti-war protests swell in Moscow and other cities. The pressure on Putin must be intensied, never relaxed, until he has withdrawn the last of his forces from the country he attacked.  And then he must face judgement. He must be held to account for an unforgivable assault that will cost many lives on both sides, including civilians. Many more are being forced to flee their homes in terror. Britain has sent military equipment and is picking up speed on sanctions but much more can be done to help Ukraine. Oligarchs close to Putin must be pursued relentlessly. And we should take in our share of Ukrainian refugees.

According to royal historian and close friend Hugo Vickers, she has a aposfavourite questionapos to ask when sheaposs taking part in royal duties.In an interview with the Express, he revealed itaposs Her Majesty aposs sneaky way of catching people out.He said: She hears everything, sees everything. She is completely on the ball. Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm. Click here to sign up.And she quite enjoys catching people out. I think she and Prince Philip enjoyed that enormously.One of her favourite questions, which she asks with good theatrical timing, is ‘Are you sure ’ – well, you’d better be’. The royal expert also commented on the Queen’s “extraordinary memory and how she often recalls remarkable anecdotes when she talks to people.He noted how she is able to seamlessly move from one conversation to the next, and said: “When she says these things, when she answers these questions, she’s very often moving on to the next person. “And it’s kind of a side which comes, she just drops it to you and by that stage she’s moved on. “She’s got a very good memory. You can’t catch her out. Her random access to facts and anecdotes and stories and things is quite extraordinary. But he added that he hasn’t seen or talked to her for about three years: I haven’t even seen her since that Commonwealth observance — that famous one with the Duke and Duchess of Sussex. The last time I saw her. Vickers, who knows Her Majesty personally, helped plan the Queen’s last three jubilees and is helping to promote the Platinum Jubilee after she became the first monarch to mark a seven-decade reign. To pay tribute to the occasion the government has approved an extended bank holiday weekend in June.The celebrations will include a huge concert put on by the BBC live from Buckingham Palace and will feature performances by some of the biggest names in entertainment.

So why does the British public not know more about them  Caitlin Davies’ new book Queens of the Underworld looks to shed light on the leading gangland figures considered neither “real women” nor “real criminals”. Yet, as these dramatic extracts reveal, they could all give the men a run for their money... sometimes literally. Queens of the Underworld by Caitlin Davies is published by The History Press, £, hardback  ebook. Smash  grab gang left people stupefied At am on  August , a car carrying four men stopped a policeman in Merton, Surrey, and asked directions to a chemist shop. Shortly afterwards, local residents heard three bangs, followed by a crash and the sound of splintering glass. The gang drove off with stolen cameras, the police took chase, but the raiders escaped. Most dramatic of all – the driver was a woman. “A girl motor bandit with an Eton crop is setting Scotland Yard a big problem,” reported the local paper. It wasn’t her first strike. The day before, a “good-looking” girl had made a daring daylight raid on a house a few miles away. More raids followed. The most daring took place one day at am in London’s Bond Street, when Lilian Rose Goldstein drove towards Cartier jewellers, suddenly blared her horn and swung the car on to the pavement.  The door attendant jumped back, and Lilian slammed the car’s nose against the door. Her male accomplice Ruby Spark, a thief known as Rubberface, was following behind. He swung his vehicle on to the pavement, and appeared through a hole in the car’s roof. He smashed the shop window, grabbed £, of jewellery and watches – equivalent to just over £million today – and sped off. Lilian, having caused the distraction, had edged her way through the crowd and was making her way home. The pair’s raids worked because passers-by would be so dumbfounded to see a woman, they would only jerk to le once the gang had sped away. Flying glass was an occupational hazard, and Ruby began carrying bulldog clips to hold the gashes shut until Lilian could stitch them up. She sterilised them in boiling water then wrapped them in a handkerchief. She also suggested Ruby disguise himself by putting pieces of rubber in his cheeks, hence his nickname. Smuggler’s pirate firefight before Swiss watches raid In , a gang of smugglers were sailing along the south-eastern coast of France in an ex-Royal Navy launch. At the helm was Noreen Harbord, an Englishwoman in her mid-s, wearing slacks and a jersey, with a . Colt revolver strapped to her waist. As the boat neared the village of Bandol, a pirate ship came into view. Noreen’s crew got their rles ready. “If there was going to be any monkey business,” she later explained, “I decided we would fight it out.”There was a burst of machine-gun fire and a few moments later, the hull was hit.Noreen hoisted the Red Ensign flag to show the vessel was British, but the pirates pulled alongside, and one leapt on to the deck. “Don’t you know we are a British ship ” Noreen yelled in Italian. “What do you mean by firing at us ” The pirate laughed: “Yes, a British ship, a British smuggling ship. And you are the Queen of the Smugglers.”Her reputation had preceded her – even with these pirates, hundreds of miles from home. A year later, she arrived in her Chrysler at Newhaven on the Sussex coast, and customs officers were in for a shock. She didn’t look like a criminal she was a former debutante, one who might slip a bottle of scent into her glove department, but certainly not thousands of Swiss watches. Yet they soon found , of them hidden in secret compartments inside her car. Despite being caught, she insisted she knew nothing about it and was “absolutely horried”, saying: “I am going to marry the Governor of Tangier next week, then you will not be able to search my belongings as I will have a diplomatic passport.” She mixed with “the best people”, she explained, “and when I go racing at Ascot I am photographed”. She would “never be mixed up with smuggling”. The haul of Swiss watches was found at around pm, and an hour-and-a-half later Noreen and the customs officers retired to a public house where they drank “for some time”. Noreen enjoyed several gins and then drove them all  miles to Croydon, where the formal interview began at pm and lasted until am. It did not go well. “I spat like an alley cat. I felt asI had a pack of hounds after me,” she said. She’d also threatened one officer, saying: “If you twist anything I said when drunk, I’ll get one of my boys to give you the biggest hiding yet.” Noreen had dropped her mask – she wasn’t an innocent lady traveller, but the leader of an international smuggling gang. In , she was charged with attempting to smuggle the watches, valued at £,. She was also charged with attempting to import nearly , watches. Noreen’s lawyer pleaded his client was an innocent woman and had been used unwittingly by men - namely a “kingpin” named “Freddy”. It worked. The Queen of the Smugglers was sentenced to just  months in prison. According to the press, Noreen was unfazed. “I am just one of those people who do the most outrageous things,” she said, before asking: “Which is the best women’s prison – Aylesbury or Holloway ”  How a torn glove spelled the end for notorious burglar Zoe Progl was a professional crook for  years once stealing £, worth of furs in a night. After breaking into a flat in London’s St John’s Wood and stealing a fur stole, Tfany jewellery and a fat wad of notes, she was arrested and bailed. But “Blonde Mickie”, as she was known by the press, saw it as a licence to carry on with her grafting. It would turn out to be her downfall – after she set her sights on a Brighton mansion one night in . She forced open the door. Diamonds were a girl’s best friend, she reasoned, and she wanted some new ones. In the master bedroom, she found some choice items of “tom” – tomfoolery or jewellery – carelessly dropped on a dressing table: rings, bracelets and brooches worth thousands. Zoe could immediately tellan item was genuine and she’d recently stolen a diamond ring from a Mayfair apartment worth around £, the average annual wage for a woman at the time.  She gathered up the jewellery on the dressing table and put it in her handbag. She might keep a piece as a souvenir to attach to her own gold charm bracelet, which now had pieces lted from England’s stateliest homes. Zoe, who later married Roy Bowman, pictured, let herself out and ed to London. But a few days later, the Flying Squad arrived at her Clapham flat, and Progl learned that she had made a serious mistake. When breaking into the Regency flat, she’d torn a finger of her nylon glove. Zoe had left a fingerprint, and Scotland Yard caught Britain’s top female burglar red-handed.

She was flung around  yards due to the impactLily in hospital after her horric road injuryByNatasha Wynarczyk:,  Mar |commentsA schoolgirl lies bandaged and broken on a hospital trolley after being hit by a car at mph – but fortunately she is in the safe hands of London’s Major Trauma Network.These are the top doctors working across four hospitals in the capital whose minute-by-minute decisions help save the lives of people like -year-old Lily Bannister.Here, we follow her journey – filmed in TV series Emergency – from the scene of the accident to recovery... July At .pm Kate Mellor, , answered the door to a policeman who said her daughter had been struck by a car.Lily was crossing the road after leaving the park with friends when she was hit by a vehicle being driven at mph. She was flung around  yards due to the impact. Kate, from Southampton, recalls: “Every emotion you could think of, I was feeling it. My heart was going a thousand miles an hour.” Lily had two seizures at the scene, so she was airlted to St George’s Hospital in South London for tests.  There she was put into an induced coma while medics tried to establish the extent of her injuries. X-rays and CT scans revealed Lily’s skull was fractured and she had a small bleed on the brain, which had caused her seizures, as well as a badly broken left hip, shoulder and wrist. At that point Kate did not knowLily had brain damage – a “terrying” possibility, she says. She adds: “She was in a really bad way. Lily was taken to intensive care and there were so many tubes coming out of her, and she was covered in cuts and bruises. It was so scary.” July  While Lily was in intensive care, a team of orthopaedic surgeons led by consultant Omar Sabri planned surgery on her broken hip and pelvis. Lily’s small size and the placement of her injury meant the two-hour operation ended up being more complicated than the doctors had initially believed it would be. Mr Sabri and his team wanted to treat her hip fracture by fixing screws to a plate to bring the bones together, but they had to go with the “Plan B” of using screws alone.  Dr Emmett O’Flaherty, one of the senior doctors involved in Lily’s operation, says: “She had a general anaesthetic, and then we made an incision over the side of her hip. The fracture was set and pinned in place and held with screws. “Surgery was done using X-ray guidance so we could see that the screws were going into the bone correctly. This is important, asyou don’t get things back to exactly how they were patients can end up with one leg longer than the other.” Lily spent one more night in intensive care before moving to another ward. Thankfully, doctors from the neurology department were able to tell her mum Kate and dad Clark Bannister that Lily was not suffering from brain damage. July  A week after her successful operation, Lily started physiotherapy to get her moving again. Acute paediatric occupational therapist Amy Willis worked on Lily’s rehabilitation. Amy says: “As she couldn’t bear weight yet, our goals were to get her up and out of bed to help her be as independent as possible. “This mainly involved getting her to sit up from lying down, then transferring her to a wheelchair, a commode or shower chair.  “She was finding it painful due to her many fractures, and getting a lot of headache, dizziness and nausea, so we had to spend a long time getting Lily to practice sitting up in and out of our sessions. “But once it clicked she just flew, and was discharged relatively quickly.” A week after her first physiotherapy session, Lily left St George’s in her wheelchair. Proud mum Kate says: “Everyone was saying that Lily had just healed so incredibly well.” October  Around six weeks after Lily was discharged from hospital her shoulder and wrist injuries fully healed. Her hip was slowly getting better, and she only needed two further physiotherapy sessions at a local hospital. Instead of further sessions there, Lily had a routine of daily movement at home such as gently riding an exercise bike. By the end of October Lily no longer needed to use her wheelchair.  And now, aside from some pain when she runs about, Lily is back to her normal self. Kate describes it as a “miracle recovery”. She adds: “I can’t believe how lucky Lily has been – there’s so many things that could have happened to her which would have left her with lelong problems. “If she’d banged her head a dferent way, she could have lost the ability to walk completely. “She’s absolutely fine now. It’s incredible. You wouldn’t know she’d had an accident that bad.”  Kate says Emergency showcases the “fantastic” work of dedicated NHS staff in our hospitals. She adds: “It’s a great show. I was really apprehensive about seeing Lily in that state again, but it’s been handled so well.“Emergency shows how clever the NHS staff really are and what they can do. We are so grateful for everything they did for Lily.” Emergency, Channel , pm, tomorrow night, with all episodes on All  Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON NHSChannel HospitalsDaily Mirror,callToAction:ltpgtGet weekly highlights from Mirror editor Alison Phillips direct to your emaillt pgt,buttonText:,contentId:,newsletterImage:https:i-prod.mirror article.ece ALTERNATES sd _AlisonHeaderFinal.png,endpointUrl:https:response.pure interface list.php,profile:Reach_Mirror,isPureNewsLetter:true,pureMailingListId:Mirror - Alisons Newsletter,isDoubleOptIn:,newsletterSiteName:Mirror\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get weekly highlights from Mirror editor Alison Phillips direct to your emailInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

After a milder week with the mercury rising during the day widespread freezing temperatures are set to hit in mid March.Brits will need to wrap up warm as a apossnowbombapos is expected to bring as much as four inches of snow an hour for parts of central and northern Scotland, according to weather maps for March .There will also be flurries theof the country continuing for over a week with more than  centimetres falling on March , as the cold snap sweeps in from Scandinavia and across the North Sea in what is dubbed the “beast from the east”. It will also be bitterly cold with -C temperatures on March  in Scotland and it will drop below zero for the whole country. Polar winds are currently causing icy temperatures across Eastern Europe which is making conditions worse for the thousands of refugees who are fleeing Ukraine following the Russian invasion.BBC weather forecaster Chris Fawkes said: “Looking at the weather charts for next week and the area of high pressure starts to slip across Scandinavia and into west Russia.“What happens is that we start to develop easterly winds so the should be a fair amount of dry weather and sunshine but cold winds will develop as the week goes by.”  Before that looking to the end of this week it is set to be milder and wet. Met Office forecaster Clare Nasir, looking at Thursday, said:A windy start to the day across eastern Scotland from clearer skies across Shetland, even some sunshine before we see some clouds and rain. Patchy rain for eastern Scotland and then this band of persistent rain particularly on the upfloats of the higher ground.  By this point you can see some drier weather coming in across the south east of Northern Ireland, west Wales, the west country eventually seeing even some brighter weather and certainly some slices of sunshine for the south east of England.

Over the course of two skin-crawling days, bats living in his attic were found trapped in the spideraposs web just beneath the entrance of their roost. The first bat was immobilised with its baby limbs pinned to its body. It appeared shrivelled and discoloured from the deadly arachnid eating its remains.  A second bat, which appeared to be an adult was also captured and trapped in the web but it was still alive. Fortunately, the adult bat was rescued and released. Scientists say the eight-legged terror, which can grow up to millimetres and is the size of a small fingernail - has a taste for protected Pipistrelle bats. A study of the horrying event was published by scientists from the National University of Ireland Galway in the international journal Ecosphere and is titled Webslinger Versus Dark Knight.  Dr John Dunbar, Irish research council post-doctoral fellow at the venom systems lab, and lead author of the study said the spider would not eat the entire bat. He added the arachnid would instead feed off it until it is full. The noble  widow spiders contain a fast-acting neurotoxic venom with a similar composition to true black widows. Dr Dunbar explained: In this case, bats being vertebrate, the spideraposs venom possess a powerful neurotoxin and this enables this to take down vertebrate prey. This venom can cause neuromuscular paralysis which is how they can occasionally feed on small reptiles and mammals.  According to scientists, spiders have also been known to feast on lizards in Ireland. Noble  widows are one of three  widows that are likely to be found in or around UK homes. They are the largest of these three species, with males typically growing to body s of up to mm and females up to mm. Noble  widows are not native to the UK, are thought to have arrived in the late s from the Canary Islands in banana boxes. They can be seen throughout the year but are most often seen between July and November. Noble spiders are not aggressive towards people, and generally don’t bite unless roughly handled or defending themselves. The bite can feel similar to a wasp sting, and in rare cases, a person can feel very unwell.

Pendleton Together sent a scandalous letter to tenants at the nine council-owned blocks it manages in Greater Manchester with top tips for keeping warm. Advice included wearing layers and maybe wear a hat and glovesyou still feel cold and avoiding alcohol which can give you a  feeling of warmth when youaposre actually cold. Salford residents were also told to have warming food and hot drinks and stay as active as you can in the letter that was sent in December amid freezing temperatures, reports Manchester Evening News. The housing association apologised to any resident who felt uncomfortable or patronised following the letter which came to light at a council scrutiny meeting on Monday.  Councillors had met to discuss a .% rent increase for the blocks but the focus soon shted to the letter with many expressing their outrage. Conservative Darren Ward, one of two councillors who called in the decision to increase the rent, brought the letter to the committeeaposs attention. He said that it was ridiculous and unacceptable to increase the rent under the current circumstances. Labour Councillor Tony Davies also criticised the letter and said that asking people to wear layers indoors was condescending. I just found it incredibly, incredibly condescending, he added. Labouraposs Lewis Nelson said that he thought it was shameful that residents were being told to wear hats and gloves inside. He added that it sounded like the Pendleton residents were being spoken to astheyaposre aposthickapos. I think itaposs quite clear that housing providers in Salford should not talk to their residents in that way, he added. Councillor Kate Lewis said: As a socialist, I find it really quite offensive. Theyaposre talking to people like they donapost understand. City Mayor Paul Dennett stood by increasing the rents in the Pendleton blocks by .%. But he did not hold back in criticising the letter sent to residents by Pendleton Together, which the council entered into an FPI contract with. Mr Dennett said: That letter that was referred to, with gloves and hats, is absolutely scandalous. I will act on that information as soon as I have seen a copy of that letter. The Mayor added that the tips were not acceptable and pledged to speak to Pendleton Together about his concerns.

The Christian period sees people go without something they love for  days to represent the  days Jesus spent fasting in the desert.Traditionally Lent begins on Ash Wednesday, the day after Shrove Tuesday, or Pancake Day as it is more commonly known. It ends on Holy Thursday evening, before the Evening Mass of the Lordaposs Supper. During these  days, some might give up smoking or drinking, watching television or eating junk food.But the Queenaposs one vice she goes without for Lent is something many of us might also consider giving up - chocolate.Former royal chef, Darren McGrady revealed that the Queen is actually quite the chocoholic, which is why she chooses this particular treat for Lent.  Speaking to OK Magazine, the chef, who worked for the royals for  years, said: Her Majesty loves chocolate, but particularly dark chocolate. She gives it up for Lent and then looks forward to tucking into her favourite Bendicks Bittermints. He continued to say that once Lent was over, boxes of the Queenaposs favourite chocolate would be provided for everyone to have a nibble on. And these arenapost the only chocolate treats that are enjoyed over the Easter weekend, the team in the kitchen at Windsor Castle also make their own Easter eggs too. Those for the adults would be decorated in pretty sugared flowers and placed on the table, so people could break off pieces, explained McGrady. There were no Easter egg hunts back then but we’d make special novelty eggs for the children.  McGrady went on to share a hilarious memory of one particular chocolate egg that he made - back when Prince William was just a young boy. The egg was based around the Hickory Dickory Dock nursery rhyme, with a clock on top striking one and a sugared mouse peeking out of a hole. He added: We sent it up to the nursery on the silver tray, but  minutes later the Footman brought it back. Read more He said, aposNanny asked me tothis. Prince William has just stood on a chair and bitten the mouse’s head off, frightening Beatrice and Eugenie.apos We had to quickly make another mouse, pop it in the hole and send it back to the nursery.

Tracey Hewitt said that she was bigger than average from a young age, and bullying from other children hardened her skin to criticism.Her weight gain accelerated due to a late pregnancy at  and a drinking habit which came afterwards.After reaching st lbs, Traceyaposs doctors told her that her weight was impacting her health. Mum-of-one Tracey said: I was coming home from work and falling asleep instantly, I was just so tired all the time. I went to a doctor and she said my weight was making it dficult for me to breathe. She said I could do with losing  pounds. I thought she was a cheeky b***h.  Former hairdresser Tracey did not plan to follow the doctoraposs advice, but her mum told her to do so for the sake of her daughter, and the two signed up for Slimming World. Three weeks later, Traceyaposs mum died from complications with the chemotherapy for breast cancer and Tracey knew that she had to follow her motheraposs advice. I thought about giving up, but I knew I had to get myself healthy for both my baby girl and my mum, the -year-old said. After spending years ignoring bullies, Tracey genuinely did not realise that there was a problem with her nutrition and fitness. I honestly didnapost realise I was where I was, she said. I was swimming every week and my job meant I was on my feet all the time, I thought I was active. It was my portion sizes that were the biggest problem - I never had a sweet tooth but I was piling my dinners onto my plate.  Tracey says that at her heaviest, she drank no water, had toast and tea for breakfast, a sandwich, crisps and biscuits for lunch, chicken, salad and chips for dinner, and plenty of wine every evening. As well as Slimming World, Tracey joined aposClubberciseapos classes, that recreate nights of clubbing to help dance the weight away. When I first started I couldnapost even lt my feet up properly, she said. I went on my own and just stood at the back. The coach, Aleasha, was so kind to me. She put me on a nutrition course and helped me gain confidence. Iaposm so much mentally and physically tougher now. I stay behind for extra classes all the time. Tracey lost another two and a half stone with Clubbercise and her continued Slimming World program.  From the beginning of her weight loss journey four years ago, Tracey has dropped around  stone and has gone from a dress size  to size . Tracey now drinks two litres of water a day, a bagel or poached eggs for breakfast, tuna pasta for lunch, and gammon, mashed potatoes and vegetables for dinner, and goes to the gym three times a week. My le has definitely changed, she said.  I have more knowledge which can help my family to make better choices. I am physically stronger. I love exercise, because even at my biggest, I still swam and went to the gym, but god, my energy and stamina is something  now. I actually like being me now. I like what I see.

Maria and Michael Spressler were dining out at The Lobster House in Cape May, New Jersey, in the US, on their th anniversary - as had been their annual tradition since  - when they made the lucky find. Michael said the last clam in their usual appetiser had felt a little dferent than the others. Speaking about the meal on President’s Day weekend, he said he had been down to the th one, which he had picked up on the fork. It had seemed a bit heavier than usual, he said, but he didn’t think anything of it.  But when he started to eat it, he realised something was in his mouth.“I actually thought one of my teeth broke,” he told local news outletKYW-TV .Lucky for Michael, he was mistaken, with the object in his mouth actually being a pearl. “He’s eaten dozens and dozens of clams and we’ve never found anything like that so it was pretty exciting,” Maria said.  While the . millimetre pearl could be worth thousands of dollars, the couple did not plan to sell it. Instead, Maria said she would like to have it set into a nice piece of jewellery. “It’s a beautul remembrance of that day and what we have is so special,” she said. The restaurant shared the news about the lucky find on social media, and cleared up a common misconception - that pearls only came from oysters.  “Bothproduce pearls,” they wrote, adding that mussels do too. “It’s the bivalve’s reaction to debris or grit.” Sarah Stadnicar, a Lobster House employee, said she had never seen anything like it herself. “I have worked here for around  years now and I’ve never heard of someone finding one in one of our oysters or clamshells,” she said.

What do you think about the Bluetooth logo  Let us know in the comments...Bluetooth was designed to allow data to be passed from one device to another at a short-range without a physical connection, and the name was inspired by King Haraldaposs ability to uny two nations. At first, Bluetooth wasnapost meant to mean anything more than a title for an internal code while the technology was being developed.

Shoppers are instead advised to store dairy products at the back of the fridge where itaposs the coldest, so as to get the maximum shelf le. Although milk can be frozen, the bottle should only be three-quarters full so as to allow for expansion once itaposs inside the freezer. And when it comes to ensuring bread lasts for longer, shoppers are encouraged to buy whole loaves rather than sliced, wrapping these in reusable cotton bags which they should then store in an airtight kitchen container. Meanwhile, Clarke claims open avocados should be kept inside a Tupperware container with a slice of onion, with this measure stopping the avocado from turning brown. Bananas need to be wrapped up in tin foil or a beeswax wrap to preserve freshness, while berries should be washed in a water and vinegar solution before being placed in the fridge. Clarke continues to advise that tomatoes are stored on the kitchen countertop, not inside the fridge, while she claims that cake will retain its moistnessstored with a slice of bread placed on top of it. Shoppers are also advised to have a specic eat me fridge shelf for food that they know will go off, allowing you to focus your attention on products that need to be consumed first.Clarke adds thatyou know you wonapost get around to eating a product before it goes bad, you could always consider giving it away through the OLIO app, where half the food added is requested by other users in just  minutes or less.

For example, ‘I’m going to bed’.  ‘To’ can also be used to indicate a relationship between words, like having something that belongs ‘to’ you. However ‘too’, which the artist should have written, is used as a synonym for ‘besides,’ ‘in addition,’ ‘also,’ or ‘as well’. So in the case of “in time, this tooshall pass”, ‘too’ would be the correct form of the word. ‘Too’ can also be used to show that something is excessive, likea grammar lesson is ‘too hard’ to understand.  Users in the comments quickly reacted to the tattoo nightmare, with one commenting “I would simply be: upset” and another replying with a tongue-in-cheek “I would be to”. Another user added: “Iaposm trying to resist the urge to chase this person down with my blue pencil and make editorial corrections.” Whilst some users were kinder about the artist’s handiwork, writing “the artwork and lettering is nice - shame about the spelling.” Others were unimpressed by not only the artist’s grammar skills, but their handwriting too, pointing out that one of the ‘I’s in the phrase had not been dotted. One user said: “Never mind the fact that the too is missing an o, that handwriting is atrocious”.

Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. Chloe, who is from Australia, shared a video in which she explained she was blonde for years before her boyfriend at the time convinced her to dye her hair brown. But after hating the way her brown locks looked, Chloe headed back to the hairdressers to get them to bleach her tresses back to blonde again - which is where everything went wrong.In the video, which was posted on her @chloejade account, the woman revealed: This was me a few years ago. White blonde, quite happy with my hair, and everything.Stupid me decided to get a boyfriend who convinced me to go chocolate brown. It was at this point in time I realised he was just trying to sabotage me [because of how bad it looked].I rushed into the hairdresser to get back to my desired colour. I told them the situation and they said it was fine. As I was sitting at the basin they said my colour had lted better than they thought it would, and there was way less breakage than they had assumed. They then said aposWeaposre going to send you home with your hair in a bun and a treatment [on it] as we donapost want to put too much heat on itapos, and said I should come back for a trim in a week. When I got home, I realised this was why. Chloe then shared pictures of her hair after the bleach, which was severely damaged and was much shorter than it had been before the dye job - as her hair had broken during the process. The woman added in the caption that the salon still made her pay for her hair disaster. And in the comments, people were quick to inform Chloe that the hairdresser should have known what would happen. One person said: That’s on the salon not telling you the truth, they should have left it for a month before trying to correct it. While another added: As a hairdresser, it makes me so mad to see this happen to people.

The baby was born in a makesht maternity ward set up in a Kyiv bunker as war in Ukraine continuesA father holds his newborn baby in the basement of a maternity hospital being used as a bomb shelter Image: ROMAN PILIPEY EPA-EFE REX ShutterstockByJason BeattieHead of politicsBen GlazeDeputy Political Editor:,  Mar Updated:,  Mar |comments Amid the carnage of war, a young father cradles his newborn son in his arms.The look on his face is one of complete devotion. The maternity unit was a makesht ward hastily set up in a dingy Kyiv bunker.Outside is the shelling, death and destruction brought on this boy’s country by the blood-stained hands of Vladimir Putin.But not even the atrocities of conflict would prevent this father from experiencing that most precious of moments: holding your infant child for the first time. To have brought le into the world when so many are dying around you will have made this small act of humanity all the more poignant. For most parents this will have been a time of unparalleled joy.Follow the latest updates from Ukraine in our live blog  You ask yourself all the familiar questions: Will they take after their mother or father  What will they be like when they grow up  This young father will not even knowhis family will survive Putin’s slaughter. But there is no stronger symbol of hope than the arrival of a new le. Today, Russia’s foreign minister warned World War Three “will be nuclear, and devastating” as Kremlin forces closed in on Kyiv Sergei Lavrov issued the chilling threat as Vladimir Putin’s troops encircled the Ukrainian capital and paratroopers landed in the north eastern city of Kharkiv. President Volodymyr Zelensky said the invaders “have an order to erase our history, erase our country, erase us all”.  NATO bolstered air defences on the alliance’s eastern flank as tensions mounted. US F- Lightning II stealth fighter jets were deployed to Lithuania, while E-A Sentry Airborne Warning and Control System spy planes flew sorties over eastern Europe.Western leaders fear thatPutin’s military overruns Ukraine, he could quickly target Baltic states which form part of the -member NATO alliance. Veteran diplomat Mr Lavrov warned of escalation between Russia and NATO, claiming “a Third World War will be nuclear, and devastating”.Kyiv is braced for Russian forces to lay siege to the city after they failed to conquer the country in a week.  A -mile long convoy thought to include , Kremlin troops was edging closer to Kyiv tonight. Residents fear soldiers will try to starve them into submission. Soldiers have already entered Ukraine’s second city, Kharkiv, following days of intensive bombardment. A Russian-fired cruise missile struck a local council building, according to the region’s deputy governor - hours after paratroopers landed in the city earlier today. A rocket reportedly struck a regional police department building and part of Karazin University. At least  people were killed and  wounded in shelling, according to the city’s mayor.Mr Zellensky said: “Russian forces have today cruelly targeted Kharkiv with artillery fire.“This is a peaceful place, peaceful suburbs … the Russians knew where they were shooting.”  Authorities were examining reports of a possible Russian rocket attack or artillery fire on the airport at Ukraine’s Black Sea port city of Odessa. Latest intelligence suggested Russian forces had moved into the centre of Kherson in south Ukraine. Reports claimed it was completely surrounded, and Ukrainian officials insisted the battle was continuing. But the Russian defence ministry said: “Negotiations are ongoing between the Russian command, the administration of the city and the region to address issues of maintaining the ing of social infrastructure facilities, ensuring law and order and the safety of the population.” Mr Zelensky said a missile strike which hit a Holocaust memorial in Kyiv was “beyond humanity”. The Babyn Yar memorial commemorates the massacre of more than , Jews by Nazi troops in Kyiv during the Second World War.  “Such a missile strike shows that for many people in Russia our Kyiv is completely foreign. They know nothing about our capital, about our history,” Mr Zelensky said. “But they have an order to erase our history, erase our country, erase us all.” Eyewitnesses told of desperate scenes at Dnipro railway station as people tried to flee. Crowds packed onto station steps, in ticket halls and on s - surging forward when trains arrived as they battled to squeeze aboard. But, eight days after they launched their offensive, Russian commanders were assessing their lack of progress and why they failed to meet their initial objectives. Mr Zelensky claimed nearly , Russian troops had been killed in the first week of the invasion - though the Russian defence ministry put its death toll at , with , wounded.  More than  Russian soldiers have been taken captive by Ukrainian forces, according to the Ukrainian defence ministry. A spokesman also claimed  Russian tanks,  planes,  armoured vehicles and  helicopters had been destroyed. Western military experts believe Moscow is now focusing on aerial and artillery bombardment of cities rather than the kind of lightning, mobilised, armoured advances originally planned by the Kremlin.Defence Secretary Ben Wallace feared Moscow would now “carpet-bomb cities - indiscriminately in some cases”. He added: “What you have seen is the Russian pause on the outskirts and then ruthlessly pummel these cities with artillery and then hope to break the city.” The Cabinet Minister praised Ukrainian resistance for slowing the Russian advance. “The Russians are considerably behind their schedule, by days not hours, and that leads to stresses on their logistical supply chains,” said Mr Wallace. “That’s why you have seen some of these columns fairly grind to a halt. “They have also been surprised by the strength of the Ukrainian resistance.”  More than , civilians have died since the invasion began, according to Ukraine’s state emergency service - though the death toll has not been independently veried.Mr Zelensky and Boris Johnson spoke by phone, with the Prime Minister condemning the “abhorrent attacks on Ukraine in the recent hours and days”, No said.The Ukrainian leader said defensive aid sent by the UK “had been vital in holding back Russian forces”, Downing Street added. The PM promised further support and weapons for forces resisting Moscow’s onslaught.  Kyiv’s mayor Vitali Klitschko and his brother Wladimir - both former world heavyweight boxing champions - called for more help from allies so Ukraine could defend itself. Wladimir said: “It’s never enough. “There’s huge demand because infrastructure is partially destroyed by the shelling that is happening all over the country in the dferent cities. “It’s absolutely not enough and we definitely need to support and help - financial support, military equipment support, medical support.” His brother added: “Everyone has to be involved. It’s war not against Ukraine, it’s war againstcivilians and it’s war against democracy. “We need support - support from the whole world.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Roman AbramovichBoris JohnsonBen WallaceVladimir PutinBlack SeaNatoWorld War PoliticsRussia Ukraine warDaily MirrorOn Instagram\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

While one woman has been trying to make the most of her situation by spending time with her aposdysalapos extended family, her mother-in-law has not been holding up her side of the bargain and has been criticising her for the smallest of things.Venting to Reddit, the woman explained how her mother-in-law has been pressuring her to rehome her beloved dog because his is too big. She said: Our dog happened to be bigger than we thought heaposd be when we picked him up. to our TeamDogs newsletter for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories.  He is still medium size, but on the larger side. He is about kg and  inches at the shoulder at -months-old - and very fluffy, which adds some size on him. This was unexpected but no real issue - after all, I grew up with a doberman and dog sat for a German shepherd and a golden retriever. We live five minutes away from a huge park and I like dog training. Itaposs no big deal. But my mother-in-law does not approve of his size. While her mother-in-law admits to liking the dog because he is fluffy and adorable, she doubts the womanaposs ability to care of a larger breed. She added: We take our dog and her dogs for walks together. She makes comments like aposHeaposs nice, but heaposs so bigapos and aposIf only he were a little smaller.apos At one point, when a chihuahua walked past, she said Thataposs the sort of size dog I thought would be good for you! I try to ignore her.  On our fourth walk together, and fth day of having the dog, she starts saying aposWhy donapost you just rehome him  No one would blame you, heaposs so much bigger than you expectedapos. No mother-in-law, I am not going to give up the dog we just got who is still settling in because you donapost think we can handle him. For what itaposs worth, he is well behaved for a -month-old. And regardless, we have had him for five days - thataposs no time for him to settle in, let alone do any real training. Snapping at her mother-in-law, the woman said she will not be giving up her dog and explained how she is well versed at looking after larger breeds. I suggested that maybe sheaposd like to rehome her dogs because she obviously canapost keep them under control, she said. She ended up storming off leaving her partner and mother-in-law to walk her dogs alone - but later messaged to apologise for her actions, admitting her reaction was childish.  However, this only encouraged her mother-in-law to reveal what she truly thinks about her - and her oversized dog is only the start. Relaying her mother-in-lawaposs message, the woman was told: You only want to hear what you want to hear. I want the best for you but you stomping off like a princess and leaving my son embarrassed and looking all over the park for you is just childish, he doesn’t deserve this. I know how much he bends over backwards to try to make you happy, as do I, maybe itaposs time to grow up and step up  I’m sorrythis is upsetting you, and no I’m not being nasty, it’s just that you have needed to be told some home truths for a while now. You are quite entitled at times and unappreciative of what you have - maybe itaposs time to look forward, pull your weight and get on with le.Unbeknown to the mother-in-law, her son cheated on her at the start of their relationship and she only found out when she happened to cross paths with the other woman four years later. She also discovered her partner has been complaining about her to his mum in recent weeks, saying she doesnapost do anything around the house and leaves all the cooking, cleaning and childcare to him. In response to her mother-in-lawaposs message, the woman vented:He works full time, makes dinner, and takes my daughter to her other parentaposs. I do literally everything  - cleaning, tidying, laundry, raising the child, as well as being in college and working on getting into university. But hey, sometimes I leave the dishes in the sink and that means I am lazy and entitled. Sorry I struggle to appreciate your son considering he lied to me for years. It is something we are actively working on to get past. Of course, she doesnapost have the full details of what happened because itaposs none of her business.

The US model, from Calornia, met her retired lieutenant colonel boyfriend, from Texas, in February  at the Galaxy Fest sci-fi convention in Colorado.Despite their  year age dference, the pair immediately hit it off due to their shared interest incosplay, sci-fi and comic books.They soon began dating but not everyone in their lives were supportive of their new relationship at first. Kataposs mum shared her doubts of Robaposs intentions but has since taken a liking to him after the coupleaposs two years together.  The model told how the pair fell in love after we went out on our first date. For Rob it was my geeky personality and for me it was that he could make me laugh effortlessly - weaposre both naturally silly people, she added. My family was not so keen on me and Rob being together, especially at first. My mum said he was closer to her age and that he just wanted me because Iaposm young and eventually he will get tired of me. It was hurtful, but things have changed in the past two years and she seems okay with it now. They met recently and she even hugged him which was a big moment.  When Kat and Rob are affectionate with each other in public, strangers sometimes stare and whisper about the couple when they think they arenapost looking. And scepticism about their love isnapost just confined to the outside world. The couple have people online commenting on pictures of them together, calling their relationship disgusting and even telling Kat that she should leave Rob and try dating someone younger. Kat said there are distinct advantages to being with an older man that strangers simply do not understand. Notably, Rob is mature, emotionally stable and knows what he wants in le. He is also able to provide for the couple financially, allowing Kat to avoid spending her s living with her parents.  Kat said that Rob also always steals the show with his charm when they meet with friends or go out. There are lots of benefits to being in an age gap relationship. Rob has plenty of le experience, he knows what he wants, and is responsible, she said. Being with someone older often means that you are with someone both more emotionally and financially stable and can avoid living in your parentaposs basement. When we are out, I notice people staring and whispering about us. I certainly notice it more than Rob does. Online we always get comments about his age and people asking why Iaposm with an old man. Women often comment about it being disgusting. They say that aposhe just likes young womenapos and say that aposwhen I get tired of the old man I should try someone youngapos.  Age certainly doesnapost define the love we share. Rob has two kids from previous marriages and with him having sole custody over his six-year-old, it does affect our ability to go and do things as a couple. But I share an amazing love with both his six-year-old and eighteen-year-old so there are no issues there. Kat is eager to let the world know that age should not define any relationship and hopes to eventually marry Rob, despite not particularly believing in the institution itself. Some people are sceptical about being with someone a lot older or younger than themselves, but you might be missing out on the best thing in your le, she said.  A lot of the time you can find stability with a person that is more mature. Eventually we want to get married even though we both donapost believe in the institution of marriage. There are benefits to doing so and we both plan on being with each other for the rest of our lives, so why not.

But by the time I was on the case, the disease was spreading closer to home # in forests near Loch Carron, Ross and Cromarty.Phytophthora, ominously meaning #plant destroyer#, is a genus of fungus-like organisms containing around  known species with a worldwide distribution.The genus, which includes the pathogens that cause potato blight and sudden oak death, has been responsible for massive crop failures, economic loss and environmental damage.Phytophthora are called #fungus-like# since they behave like fungi but dfer from them, and from all animals and plants, in several key features of their reproduction and chemical makeup.This places them in an ill-defined group of misfits called protists, which also includes amoebae, kelp and slime moulds.Phytophthora pluvialis was discovered in Oregon USA in , where it resides in soil and watercourses, and mainly infects Douglas fir.Its recognition in Cornwall during  was the first identication of this particular Phytophthora species in Europe.Thought to have arrived here on imported live plants, its spores germinate in water and can be spread, for instance, on shoes, tyres and animal paws.The pathogen infects a iety of trees, including western hemlock, Douglas fir and several pine species, causing needle shedding, shoot dieback and lesions on the branches, trunks and roots of infected trees.Forestry and Land Scotland and its policy section Scottish Forestry took rapid action # surveillance to detect infected forests, restrictions on the movement of timber and trees, and asking the public to report suspicious tree lesions.But since the European climate is ideal for P pluvialis to thrive, and its favoured trees are commonly grown here, like so many other plant pathogens, it seems likely that this one is here to stay for the long term.Forestry and Land Scotland asks foresters and the public to be vigilant for signs of Phytophthora pluvialis.Anyone who thinks they might have spotted signs of the disease should report it using the online TreeAlert system on the on www.forestresearch.gov.uk website."},{"url":null,"title":"kilberry loop sportive announced","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowThe popular Kilberry Loop Sportive will take place on Saturday August  this year.Organised by Mid Argyll Triathlon and Cycle Club and local man John Hardie, the -mile open road event starts and finishes in Tarbert.Registered as an event with British Cycling, the fun, friendly Kilberry Loop Sportive is targeted at every level of cyclist.

This is particularly good advice for anyone with a veg plot.A sowing plan of what seeds and how many to sow each month is key to successful growing and means you won#t be throwing out unwanted seedlings and that your flower and veg beds will be full all year round.A word of warning about sowing direct into the ground at this time of year there may be a few sunny days to enjoy outside but the soil can still be chilly, making germination and survival hard.Sowing indoors is a better option. Not only does it provide a warm environment for germination, but seeds and seedlings are easier to protect from pests. If you can find some environmentally sound sowing trays and containers, rather than using plastic, that#s even better. Paper and cardboard pots can be packed snugly in a tray which avoids over handling and makes them easy to water.Small seeds should be scattered sparingly on the surface of compost filled seed trays then covered with a sprinkling of sieved compost. If the seeds are big enough to handle, you can sow them inidually into cm pots. The quantity should be according to the instructions specied on the seed packet, but usually for small seeds between five and  seeds per pot. For plants that grow long roots, such as peas or beans, you can put them into a compost filled cardboard toilet roll tube and, once ready, they can be planted outside, tube and all.Most seeds will germinate and grow in a warm setting such as a greenhouse, cold frame or on a sunny windowsill. You should keep them damp by using a mist spray to start with before moving onto a watering can with a fine rose nozzle.Once the seedlings have grown their second pair of leaves and before they get too squashed in seed trays or pots, pot them on into small pots. Simply ease out a clump of seedlings with an old cutlery fork or dibber and # handling only the leaves to avoid damaging delicate stems and roots # gently tease them apart. Drop inidual seedlings into a five-centimetre compost filled newspaper pot ensuring the lower leaves are above the compost level. Once you see roots appearing from the bottom of the pot, it’s time to pot on to a bigger pot before planting outside once the weather and soil warms up.If you are growing your own veg, now is a good time to sow first early potatoes. These can be planted from mid-March, however planting times will y across the country according to temperature and risk of frost. Early potatoes grow well in the ground and in containers such as potato grow bags or old compost bags. You should plant your chitted potatoes with the shoots facing upwards in soil with plenty of well-rotted organic matter, approximately cms deep and cms apart.Once stems are about cms tall, they will need earthing up by drawing soil around them to create a cm high ridge, to protect against frost and keep growing potatoes covered. Good ieties of early potatoes are: Swt # good for containers, white skinned and white fleshed Annabelle # nutty flavour with firm waxy yellow flesh and Maris Bard # white flesh with good #new potato# flavour and drought resistance.Spring seems tantalisingly close in March, particularly as work in the garden starts to get going again.According to the Royal Horticultural Society, spring usually arrives by mid-March and the frequent sunny days provide the opportunity for an increasing range of gardening tasks. It#s time to get busy preparing seed beds, sowing seed, cutting back winter shrubs and generally tidying up around the garden.Top three jobs in March:PICS:Once the seedlings have grown their second pair of leaves and before they get too squashed in seed trays or pots, pot them on into small pots. no_aGardening_March"},{"url":null,"title":"council backs argyll events in covid recovery","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowCowal Highland Gathering is to receive a £, grant from Argyll and Bute Council as it prepares to take place in person for the first time in three years.The event, at Dunoon Stadium in August, had to take place virtually in  and  due to the Covid- pandemic.But preparations are being made for the  event to take place from August -, and it is the only event recommended to receive more than £, from round four of the council’s strategic events and festivalsfund.The Mull Rally has been recommended to receive £,, Mull of Kintyre Music and Arts Festival is earmarked for £, and the Tiree Wave Classic is in line for £,.Seven other events across Argyll and Bute are recommended to receive smaller grants.Councillors approved the recommended grant awards at the virtual meeting of the authority’s policy and resources committee on February .Eleven events across culture, sport and the arts will receive support totalling £, from round four of the council#s fund.The total budget available for   is more than £,.Councillors agreed to make remaining SEF funds, estimated to be £,, available to apply for.Receiving £, grant awards are Jura Music Festival, the Gathering of Cowal Clans and Helensburgh Winter Festival.The Highlands and Islands Music and Dance Festival will get £,, West Highland Yachting Week £, and Inveraray Highland Games £,.Tarbert Seafood Festival has also been recommended for £, despite being £ over the  per cent criteria.The report says it is felt this #does not prejudice the other applications# and the funding is available.Councillor Robin Currie, policy lead for economic growth said: #Events and festivals have played an important part in the economic health of Argyll and Bute in past years.

the same with modern housing – probably less stock to suit the demands that exist in the town at the moment – however, it is really important any proposed build be sensitive in design to suit this

Thursday, Ofgem announced that from April the energy price cap would rise  per cent to £, – that is an extra £ households will have to find just to keep their homes warm and the lights on.Forthcoming increases to the interest rate and rises in National Insurance payments will exacerbate the situation.It is heart-breaking. I have had food bank helpers in tears saying we can#t wait another year for the Right to Food to kick in. People need help now.Food bank volunteers need assurance that the invaluable support they provide in their communities will end one day, when wages and benefits are adequate enough for proud families to be able to stop using the food banks.New statistics show rising homelessness across Scotland. Food bank use is soaring. Illnesses of the past like rickets and malnutrition have reappeared.In a rich nation like Scotland, in the st century, this is appalling.

Avoid plantingthe ground is frozen or extremely waterlogged.Your planting hole should be no deeper than the roots, but at least three times the diameter of the root ball.It#s a good idea to soak bare-rooted trees for about  minutes before planting.Place the tree in the planting hole so the first flare of roots on the stem are level with the soil surface. If you plant the tree too deep, it can result in rot and disease.You may need to insert a stake for top heavy or larger trees. Refill the planting hole, firm gently and water in.Drought stress is common in newly-planted trees so make sure you keep watering throughout the growing season. The quantity required will y with soil type, but  to  litres per square metre – four to six watering cans – each week in dry weather will do the trick.If you are growing your own vegetables, now is a good time to sow lettuce seeds – both under cover and outside.If you start now, it will give you a continuous supply that can be harvested throughout the year.Sow in modules or fibre pots under cover to have lettuces ready to plant outside in four to six weeks. You can also sow outdoors, but use cloches or small poly tunnels until next month when the soil has warmed up. They will also provide your lettuce seedlings with protection from birds and slugs.Good ieties to start now include cut-and-come again Salad Bowl – oak leaved, high yield with green and red ieties a cos such as Lobjoits Green – dense, crisp heads with self folding leaves or the small butterhead Tom Thumb – perfect for growing in small spaces, it matures early and has a mild taste.Prepare for spring by carrying out basic maintenance.As the Royal Horticultural Society says, this month there are signs of the approaching spring, with bulbs appearing and wildle waking up as light levels and temperatures increase.There#s plenty to do indoors this month to prepare for the season ahead.Outdoors, as the garden comes to le, it#s time to prune shrubs and climbers, such as wisteria, as well as evergreen hedges."},{"url":null,"title":"driver woes derail oban golfer bobs title bid","story":"The honorary Machrihanish Golf Club member finished tied in ninth place at the Ras al Khaimah Classic on the final leg of the DP World Tour#s Desert Swing, building on his solid performance over the same course the previous week.After carding an almost flawless opening round of  on Thursday, Robert suffered a cruel piece of bad luck before his Friday round after the face of his driver cracked during his warm up on the practise range.Speaking after carding a  on Saturday, following his  on Friday, Robert said he struggled with his replacement driver.#Unfortunately, my driver cracked on Friday morning and I#ve not got the perfect replacement but no-one does,# said the left-hander.#Off the tee, I#m trying to find my golf ball.

Why There have been many attempts by faithful people to explain unbearable tragedies with faith in a loving God. Few are convincing – at least at the time.For me, the love that people give to one another is God reflected in human goodness.Living by faith is not easy. Sometimes it means being assailed by doubts and I believe we must be honest about our questions.After all, did not Jesus say: #The truth will set you free.# When those most bitter and painful tragedies strike us down, faith can be a consolation – sometimes the only consolation – even as at the time it is tested to breaking point."},{"url":null,"title":"town causes to land co op cash","story":"Thanks to Co-op members choosing the supermarket#s own-branded products and services, over £ million has been raised for more than , causes since .Each year, members are encouraged to pick a local cause in their community that supports access to food, mental wellbeing support or opportunities for young people, helping to build stronger, more resilient communities across the UK.In Tarbert, Fèis an Tairbeirt, Tarbert Soccer Centre and Tarbert After School Care are to receive grants and, in Mid Argyll, Argyll and Bute Befrienders, Mid-Argyll Transport Volunteers and Mid Argyll Multiple Sclerosis Centre will benefit.#We know that this year is going to be another incredibly challenging year for local causes and communities,# said Rebecca Birkbeck, director of community and membership at the Co-op.#With the cost of living rising dramatically already this year, charities are likely to bear the brunt of people being more conscious about their spending.#At the Co-op, we work hard to bring people together to ‘co-operate for a fairer world’.

The mine was finally rediscovered by HMS Bicester early last week.Bad weather made it impossible for the crew of the Bicester to attach a surface riser to it and the mine was left to a Navy ing team to bring it up.Led by Lt Adrian Dann, the four-man Northern Diving Team from Faslane finally pinpointed the mine on Tuesday morning and brought it up later that day.The two-tonne mine is currently lying on the New Quay waiting to be picked up by the mine laying team from Cromby, Fe.FIFTY YEARS AGOCampbeltown churchgoers, in common with other congregations throughout the country, are being asked to sign petition forms calling for an end to public filth in television and literature.Already many people, including non-churchgoers, have appended their names to the forms which are also in several businesses in the town.The forms are headed: ‘Petition for public decency.’It states: ‘Being concerned about the effect on society – particularly on the young – and of the increasing exploitation of sex, the public portrayal of intimate or unnatural sexual behaviour and violence and brutality, we the undersigned call upon Her Majesty’s government: to note the concern of the public about this matter. to ensure that the law as regards of sanity stops this public affront and is so designed as to be an effective instrument for the maintenance of public decency.Some church congregations in the town have already begun signing the petition and others planned to follow suit in the near future.All of Campbeltown’s ministers are in agreement that the obscenities on television and in literature are going too far, and hope that the petition has the desired effect.The Reverend James W Hood, of Lorne Street Church, commented yesterday: ‘I think it is perfectly right that the church should be given the opportunity of speaking its mind.’SEVENTY YEARS AGOThe majesty and pomp of King George VI#s funeral procession through London, and later its journey to Windsor Castle, was seen and heard by people in Campbeltown and Tarbert on Friday, in the history-making experimental television broadcast.In both places, reception was remarkably clear and those who were privileged to see it saw this royal journey of dignied and poignant pageantry in a much greater detail than the vast crowds in London and Windsor.At both places, the sets, with -inch screens, were shown by radio dealers to parties of friends.Mr Anthony P MacGrory, Campbeltown town councillor and housing convener, had his set installed in the radio showroom of his firm’s shop in Main Street.At Tarbert, the set there was arranged by Mr Douglas C Smith, Electrical and Radio Engineer, Harbour Street.Earlier last month, Mr Smith informed us that he was getting surprisingly good results from the test from the Scottish television station at Kirk o’ Shotts – the Scottish station which is using only low power transmission.Scottish TV reception of this historical occasion was the previous day viewed with serious misgivings and doubts by BBC experts, who pointed out that the Kirk o’ Shotts station was not due to open until March  and that this is the first-ever television radio link up, connecting Scotland to London, through Manchester, was merely an experiment and the Scottish transmitters were still undergoing adjustment.So, until the TV programme went onto the air on Saturday, the BBC could give no guarantee that the venture would be successful.It was a great success and thousands of Scots over a wide area, from Dumfries to Aberdeen, saw clear pictures of the funeral processions.At Campbeltown and Tarbert, the pictures were almost as clear as everyone was looking at them on the cinema screen, the detail in some of the pictures being unbelievably perfect.One local businessman, who saw it, described it as ‘uncanny’.But, throughout the years, this has been the descriptive of all great inventions when they first made their impact on the public mind.It was a pity, of course, that this great moment in Scottish television progress should have been heralded in with such a sad event as the funeral of our King.Considering that Kintyre was not regarded as a good reception area and that this  miles relay was the longest ever attempted by the BBC, the result was truly amazing and will no doubt mean the booking of many orders from this part of the country.Already, Mr McGrory has been receiving enquiries from ious parts of Argyll.We were privileged to see the screening in Mr MacGrory’s premises that afternoon. The scenes from Paddington to Windsor were impressive, especially the arrival at Windsor and the unforgettable journey to St George’s Chapel.To those people in Kintyre, so far from the television network, it must have been an unforgettable experience to have this outstanding London ceremonial brought hundreds of miles to before their eyes and to be taken in imagination straight to Windsor to

he had “begun to have suspicions about [his former partner] seeing another man”.Ms Craig added that the woman had denied starting a new relationship and Givan had “lost his temper after seeing her in

in urban areas or at the edge of woodland.The kestrel is a medium-size bird that is slightly smaller than a feral pigeon. Males have a chestnut-brown back, light brown chest with black spots, and a prominent grey-blue head and tail, whilst females are unormly brown. Like most members of the falcon family, the kestrel is equipped with black eyes. The purpose of this is to reduce the amount of glare entering the bird’s eye and improves vision, especially in bright light.Kestrels are mostly distinguished by their typical hunting technique, hovering -m above the ground, either by flying into the wind and using its fanned tail and pointy wings to hold position, or by soaring using the lt caused by a ridge or a similar obstacle. The bird keeps its eyes constantly fixed on the ground and, when it eventually spots prey, it swoops down and kills using the side of the beak rather than using talons like hawks do.The kestrel’s hunting skills are enhanced by incredible eyesight. These birds can see ultraviolet colour that is invisible to the human eye! This means they can easily locate their prey by detecting a rodent’s urine trail, which shines brightly in ultraviolet.Apart from watching kestrels in the air, they can also be seen perched on a tree branch, fences, lampposts or wires.These birds mainly feed on field voles, which constitute most of their diet, but can also take mice, shrews, small birds and occasionally worms or large insects .Kestrels do not build nests but instead they lay eggs in natural cavities such as holes in trees or cracks in clfs. If you live in the countryside, a good way of encouraging kestrels to the area is to put up nest boxes for them. Each bird species has dferent requirements when it comes to nest boxes, so it is worth researching online as to what the right measurements should be. Feel free to get in touch with myself as well!With just a little bit of patience, kestrels can be easily spotted. Once you have learned their hover style, you will not mistake it for anything ! Another good tip for looking for kestrels is to remember that they are birds of habit –you saw them perched on a tree in the local park, try going there again at a similar time, there is a huge chance they will be around!In East Lothian, I have two favourite kestrel spots: one is in Musselburgh Lagoons and the other one at The Grove. I visit those places fairly frequently at dferent times of the day to give myself a greater chance of photographing the birds in dferent light, but it is worth remembering that birds are most active at dawn and dusk.So far, I have found kestrels surprisingly relaxed with my presence however, I would not feel confident to say whether all kestrels are like this orI have been lucky. The rule of the thumb is to remain respectful of an animal’s space and never to disturb them I always move slowly when taking steps towards an animal and never in a straight line, so it does not feel challenged. After each step, I remain in the same position for quite some time before taking a further step – this way an animal can get used to me and stops treating me as a threat. I always use this approach, no matter which animal I photograph.As spring is just around the corner and soon wildle will be in full swing, I wish you all good luck in wildle spotting!If you would like to share some wildle sightings with me or want to know more about kestrels, please get in touch:www.zanslenswww.facebook zanslenswww zans_lens"},{"url":null,"title":"lothian-buses-x5-service-soon-return-east-lothian","story":"Lothian Buses suspended the X service, which links North Berwick, Dirleton, Aberlady, Gullane and Longniddry with the capital, almost two years ago at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic.Craig Hoy, South Scotland MSP, has repeatedly called in recent months for the service to be reinstated.He handed over a petition, which was signed by more than , people, calling for the service to be brought back to the bus company.Mr Hoy, who is also a councillor for the Haddington and Lammermuir ward on East Lothian Council, was pleased to say the bid for the service toseemed to be heading in the right direction.Nigel Serafini, the interim chief executive of Lothian Buses, wrote to the politician to update him on the situation.He said: “We are only just covering existing service levels but with an uplt of new recruits due to begin in the business shortly, we are hopeful that we will soon be in a position to announce a date for theof the service.“This does however critically hinge on no further outbreaks or changes to guidance in the coming weeks.“As always, we continue to review our network provision and remain committed to restoring services where circumstances allow.”In the absence of the X, people commuting into Edinburgh on the bus can face an extra hour being added on to their journey as they travel through Musselburgh and Portobello towards the city centre.In contrast, after passing through Longniddry, the X heads onto the A and into the capital.Mr Hoy welcomed the latest development and was keen to see further progress being made.He said: “I am pleased that Lothian Buses have now responded to the petition calling for the reinstatement of the X service, and I am delighted that they are looking at providing a date for theof the service ‘soon’.“The X bus was a popular service in the local community providing a direct and convenient route into the centre of Edinburgh in under an hour.”"},{"url":null,"title":"new-kitchen-cliff-top-cafe-given-go-ahead-along-electric-bike-rental-firm-site","story":"Drt cafe, east of North Berwick, was launched by husband-and-we Stuart and Jo McNicol, of adjacent Castleton Farm, in .And despite the Covid- pandemic, it has gone from strength to strength, welcoming thousands of visitors each year.Now the farm has been granted planning permission for  ‘modular buildings’ which will be used as a bakery for the cafe, as well creating farm offices and providing a home to an electric bike rental firm.Like Drt, e-bike company Ez-Riders has been described by planners as a farm ersication project which will generate new tourism and visitors to the area.Granting approval for the additional buildings in the farmyard, planning officers said that the application had received one objection from the Architectural Heritage Society of Scotland.Drt cafe has picturesque views of the Bass Rock from the clf edge.

As a result, some of the nation’s fish and chip shops are now struggling for survival.As they are not protected by the energy price cap, chip shops are now facing huge rises in energy costs. Some members of NFFF have reported electricity bills going up from £ to £, a month.The NFFF is urging the government to reconsider its planned  per cent increase on VAT in April, which is an added concern for the industry.The spiralling costs hitting fish and chip shops include a  per cent rise in the cost of cod since October,  per cent rise in the cost of haddock in the last year,  per cent rise in the cost of mushy peas, and  per cent rise in the cost of batter.Industry leaders now say that chip shops will have to raise prices to survive but many could be forced out of business.In , East Coast was crowned one of the UK’s  Best Fish  Chip Takeaways for the second year running – the only chippy in Edinburgh and the Lothians to make the list.The accolade followed an extensive search by trade publication Fry Magazine to find the chippies serving up the finest fish suppers amid the ongoing challenges of the Covid- pandemic.Mr Crolla runs the Musselburgh takeaway and restaurant with his we Katia, and his family have been serving the local community for nearly  years.He said: “By teaming up with the National Federation of Fish Friers we hope to do our bit by encouraging people to support their local fish and chip shop around Scotland during these extremely challenging times.“Our family has been proudly serving the local community with quality fish and chips for nearly  years, but the spiralling costs battering our industry are putting all that at risk.“We won’t compromise on quality, but these external factors will inevitably mean a rise in costs for us and our customers.”Andrew Crook, president of the NFFF, added: “We are in unprecedented times where we are seeing high levels of inflation, and food inflation is even higher.“Most of the supplies we use in the fish and chip industry have increased drastically in price and we are expecting this to continue for some considerable time.“Other products are simply not available, and we have seen suppliers move away from the sector.“Fish and chip shops like East Coast in Musselburgh do feel the effect of these increases more than most cuisines as our margins are much tighter.

Musselburgh is one of  golf courses to have hosted the oldest golf championship in the world, which this year celebrates its own milestone with The th Open Championship being held at St Andrews in July.To mark the th anniversary of golf at Musselburgh, Musselburgh Old Course Golf Club– which later this month celebrates the th year of its re-founding in  – is hosting a series of events across , ending with a gala dinner in the town in September.This Saturday, members of MOCGC will contest the club’s th Anniversary Stroke-play Championship. On July , more than  golf clubs and foundations from across Scotland have been invited to participate in an -hole tournament on the Old Course.Sir John Foulis of Ravelston’s game  years ago was referenced in The Golf Book Of East Lothian, compiled and documented by John Kerr, M.A, F.R.S.E, F.S.A.Scot, the Minister of Dirleton, which was published in .Golf may have been played by royalty at Musselburgh even earlier than . Mary Queen of Scots was reported on her indictment in  to have played golf ‘at Seton’, most likely at Musselburgh, while her son King James VI was also reported to have played golf there.Musselburgh’s Old Course has left a “lasting legacy” on golf in many factors. The accepted diameter of a golf holewas the width of the piece of drainpipe used at Musselburgh to cut the holes. This was adopted by The Royal and Ancient Golf Club in  as the official measurement requirement for all golf holes, as they standardised the rules of golf.The Old Course is also regarded as the birthplace of competitive women’s golf. As early as , the local fishwives were reported to have indulged in golf on their days off. In , the club that later became Royal Musselburgh sponsored a women’s golf competition on New Year’s Day with prizes – a fishing basket and silk handkerchiefs.Perhaps the most famous of the many golfing families to have been based at Musselburgh were the Park family. Willie Park Senior, born in Wallyford, was the first winner of The Open in , and went on to win it a further three times. His brother Mungo won the first Open Championship played at Musselburgh in , while Willie Park Junior was a two-time winner, including in , the final year that Musselburgh hosted The Open.Steven Hill, captain of Musselburgh Old Course Golf Club, said the anniversary was “a momentous day” for everyone connected with the course, adding: “To be captain of our club in this historic year is a tremendous honour for me.“While our club only dates back  years, in that time we have helped to restore the Old Course to its former glory. The history of Musselburgh Links is precious – the members of our club recognise our role as protectors of this ancient course, and hold its traditions very dear to our hearts, including continuing to play hickory golf here.“We are immensely proud that Musselburgh is one of only  courses in the UK to have hosted The Open and it is fitting that, in the same year when The th Open Championship is played at St Andrews, our course can also celebrate a signicant milestone.“Most of our members grew up playing on the Old Course. In this anniversary year, we want to secure a lasting legacy for golf here by encouraging the next generation of local golfers to experience Musselburgh Links and become part of its future. We also welcome visitors from across the world to visit and join us in our celebrations.”Angela Howe, director at The RA World Golf Museum, said: “The Open has been played at some of the world’s most historic golf courses and Musselburgh is undoubtedly one of them. As one of the three prestigious venues, with Prestwick and St Andrews, which played host to the early days of The Open and the home course of the great Park family among others, it has a rich golfing heritage. It’s wonderful to see this remarkable milestone being celebrated in such fitting style throughout the year.”Michael Beamish, captain of the Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers, said: “The Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers has written records stretching back more than  years. Originally based in Leith and, since , at Muirfield, the club grew and flourished during the period when Musselburgh Links was its home.“Musselburgh Links was the home of The Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers from  until . In , The Honourable Company built a clubhouse in Golf Place at the west end of the Links and throughout this period both the town and the nine-hole course played a leading role in the development of the rapidly growing game of golf. Musselburgh and the Links have a long, important and distinguished history and deserve the title ‘The Cradle of Golf.’“The Honourable Company would like to congratulate the clubs at Musselburgh Links and the affiliates involved in managing and maintaining the course, enjoyleisure and East Lothian Council, for such a wonderful golfing legacy, and send very best wishes for the th anniversary celebrations.”John McMillan, Provost of East Lothian, said: “The Old Course has a very special place in both East Lothian and Scottish golfing history. Ever since March , the course has been recognised as a wonderful place to play golf and the fact that it is one of only  venues to have hosted The Open is testament to that.“We are very proud of the fact that East Lothian is Scotland’s Golf Coast, with an unparalleled selection of courses, including the Old Course, which golfers continue to enjoy to this day.“I’m delighted that the council and enjoyleisure are working with Musselburgh Old Course Golf Club in celebrating this remarkable milestone and I’d like to congratulate all involved as their plans take shape for a year of celebration.”Bill Axon, chief executive of enjoyleisure, said: “We’re delighted to be marking this signicant milestone in Musselburgh Links’ history, in conjunction with Musselburgh Old Course Golf Club, Musselburgh Links Ladies Golf Club and East Lothian Council.“It’s an absolute joy to be able to provide public access to this magnicent course witnessing children take their first drive engaging with locals on their ,th round and welcoming international enthusiasts eager to tick off another majestic round on an historic Open Championship course from their bucket list.“Musselburgh Links is truly the people’s golf course which is enjoyed by all ages and abilities.”"},{"url":null,"title":"celebrity-conservationist-backs-petition-remove-bird-netting-north-berwick-tesco","story":"The supermarket giants had implemented the netting to the exterior of the building to protect customers from pigeon droppings.The petition has reached more than  signatures in little over a day as the community has come together to protect the local bird population.: More than  people sign online petition to remove bird netting from North Berwick TescoHouse martins are a protected species by law and interfering with their nests is a punishable offence, but many conservationists worry that preventative measures such as these risk the future of the species.Mr Packham said on Twitter: \"Hello Tesco, we’ve been here before haven’t we \"Please fast track the solution which was to take down the nets , put up cameras and screens in the store and show your customers that you care about birds in the bioersity crisis we sadly find ourselves in.\"Hello @Tesco we’ve been here before haven’t we   Please fast track the solution which was to take down the nets , put up cameras and screens in the store and show your customers that you care about birds in the bioersity crisis we sadly find ourselves in .

I still loved the pursuit but I’d been doing it for a long time and I was stuck in a bit of a rut.  “The tandem feels a lot like the team pursuit – you’re working as a pair and you have to work so closely together which is what I grew up doing in the pursuit.” Holl was paired with Unwin, who is visually impaired and was also a new recruit to the sport having come through their talent identication programme the previous year, with the improvement of the duo dramatic. Having been selected for the  Para-Cycling Road World Championships only days before the event, the pair went on to win gold, resulting in their selection for the Tokyo Paralympics. It was, admits, Holl, quite a whirlwind but the Stirling rider and her English partner made the most of the opportunity, winning silver in the road race and bronze in the inidual pursuit in Tokyo. It was, admits Holl, not the year she’d expected but she has relished every minute of the new direction of her career, with the pair’s success ensuring Holl will continue as a pilot for the foreseeable future, as well as continuing riding able-bodied races, which is why her schedule at the weekend’s Nationals is quite so packed. Holl also has her eyes set on this summer’s Commonwealth Games and getting some hands on silverware for Team Scotland, with potential riding partners being either Aileen McGlynn, the ultra-experienced rider who has seven Paralympic medals to her name or Libby Clegg, the former para-sprinter who has only recently switched to para-cycling but has been tipped for big things. And Holl admits making her Commonwealth Games debut in Birmingham is front and centre of her mind over the coming months. “I’m definitely planning on doing some able-bodied racing this year and I’m also focusing on the big para races,” she says. “It would be huge to be at the Commonwealth Games – I remember watching Gold Coast and thinking how much I’d love to be there so to have the chance to be in the team and wear Scotland kit would be incredible.” Also in action will be a number of Scots who have their eyes on national titles. Olympic champion Jack Carlin is one of the star names on the start list, with silver medallist from Tokyo, Neah Evans also riding. Lusia Steele has established herself as Scotland’s strongest female sprinter while on the men’s side, John Archibald, Jonny Wale and Lewis Stewart are worth looking out for. Others to watch are British Hour Record holder Dan Bigham and Commonwealth champion, Charlie Tanfield. "},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/13531610.jpg?type=article-full","title":"world-book-day-2022-easy-costumes-adults-teachers","story":"Depending on how organised you are, people either spend weeks preparing a costume or frantically search through their wardrobe before the school run.Whether youre a parent or teacher, weve put together a list of last-minute and easy costume ideas to help you out.Not only this, its better for the environment to use what is already in your drawers compared to buying a completely new outfit each year.Four school class pictures from previous World Book Day events in Watford.

Over the past week,  cases were recorded, bringing the case total since the pandemic began to ,.Following a meeting of the Orkney Local Emergency Co-ordination Group , on Monday morning, vice-chair of the group and corporate director Neighbourhood Services and Infrastructure, Hayley Green, said:“As the UK and Scottish Governments move forward with their plans for ‘living safely with COVID’, which includes a lessening and doing away with restrictions depending on whether you are north or south of the border, we, in Orkney, are facing something of a dilemma given that we are behind the curve.“We are seeing very high rates of transmission, and this is impacting heavily across our services – most notably within the care sector and our schools and nurseries – but really most areas are now being affected given the level of positive cases and the requirement for isolation.“We have reached the point in schools and nurseries whereby we have exhausted supply staff as a contingency and middle and senior staff, including head teachers, who were helping to keep classes open by teaching themselves or taking on janitorial or cleaning duties for example, are now also off due to COVID and other sickness.“Not only are children off due to catching the virus, but others are having to stay home due to a lack of staff – this is having a negative knock-on effect on working parents who are having to either work from homethat is possible or take time off when it is not.“It has also become apparent that we are now witnessing children in schools who have become infected for a second time.”The council stressed that schools are trying to ensure remote learning can be provided when possible – and there are enough staff to make it happen.Within adult care services, many are now feeling the impact and as a result two of our older people’s day care services on the Mainland will be closed from Wednesday as staff are deployed to assist within residential care homes. Those affected are being informed. There are further staffing challenges in adult social work and Occupational Therapy.Ms Green continued: “The closure of any service is as a last resort, but we have no choice to ensure we can safely manage to run our residential care facilities. The situation will be monitored closely and as soon as we are in a position to reopen safely then we will let everyone know.“Our care staff and the families of residents have done an outstanding job in keeping this virus at bay and out with our care facilities up until recent times but given the widespread transmission and the reduction in restrictions it has meant it was almost inevitable that this was going to happen at some point.”Staffing challenges are also being felt across the Leisure and Culture service, with some gym and swimming pool sessions and exercise classes being cancelled. The council-run St Magnus Café, Community Centre, and Town Hall have also been affected by closures and reduced opening hours.A plan has been agreed to ensure some level of service continues at the popular cafe during this challenging period and is being trialled this weekuntil the end of March, opening from .-. Monday-Friday with an amended menu.Given the infection levels, the council will be maintaining all current related COVID  restrictions for the time being, including working from homeyou can, and this will be reviewed again during March.A spokeswoman for NHS Orkney added: “We praise the community for their continued, regular use of lateral flow tests and urge everyone to continue using these. Particularly before meeting up with family, friends, travelling and attending events.“Logging lateral flow results is just as important and we ask you all to log both negative and positive results. When a positive lateral flow test is logged you will then receive information on isolation etc.“We’re continuing to ask all NHSO health care staff to continue with lateral flow testing when coming to work and this will be in place for the time being.”You can log your results by visiting: www.gov.uk report-covid-resultcopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This can not be allowed to happen, Russian trade is not welcome in our waters.#This is an insult to the Ukraine, to its people and to all Ukrainians living in the UK. We must not support Russian-owned trade vessels in any capacity. Help by signing this petition to put a stop to Russian owned vessels docking at UK ports now.#Amid calls for the vessel to be refused access, and for key services such as tugs and pilotage to be refused, Orkney Islands Council said: #As a council we are in an extremely dficult position. We recognise the strength of feeling around this — feelings that we share — but we are bound by our legal obligations to accept the vessel, until such a time as the UK Government tells us otherwise.#We have sought urgent advice from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, who have told us that the current sanctions do not cover this operation.#We continue dialogue both with elected representatives and Government departments on this situation as we seek to clary what possible further action can be taken.#The petition can be found here.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This stems from the  Harbours Act which states that any harbour may be open to all for the shipping of goods.“But in my view is this is so very dferent. Can you imagine Churchill complying with Victorian legislation and allowing a vessel owned by a hostile nation into the Flow “We have a proud maritime history in Orkney, and we should play our part and issue an immediate ban on all Russian vessels entering our harbours. This would be a peaceful but very effective act.”Councillor Sankey intends to liaise with OIC officers, his councillor colleagues and politicians early next week to see how this visit can be stopped. He says he can’t condone OIC services of any type assisting the vessel.“Whilst we may by law have to allow access, there’s no law that says our pilot boats and tugs should be used, and I’m deeply unhappy about our harbour assets helping a Russian ship under current circumstances,” adds Councillor Sankey.In a statement provided to The Orcadian on Saturday, Orkney Islands Council said the authority is an “extremely dficult position.”A spokeswoman said: ”We recognise the strength of feeling around this — feelings that we share —  but we are bound by our legal obligations to accept the vessel, until such a time as the UK Government tells us otherwise.“We have sought urgent advice from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, who have told us that the current sanctions do not cover this operation.”We continue dialogue both with elected representatives and Government departments on this situation as we seek to clary what possible further action can be taken.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

While most children aged  to  will have mild diseasethey contract COVID-, some may experience symptoms which last longer than just a few days. Vaccination of children in this age group has been shown to help prevent the small number of hospitalisations and intensive care admissions that can occur in this age group. It has also been shown to help provide short-term protection against non-severe disease. Dr Jillian Johnston, Joint Interim Assistant Director in Health Protection at the PHA, said: “We know the COVID risk for young children is less than for older people, but we also know the vaccine is very safe, has already been used extensively around the world, and there is no evidence that it causes any long term issues. When you look at the risk of COVID- against the risk of the vaccine, it’s more beneficial for children to receive the vaccine. It not only boosts the child’s immunity against the risk of severe disease, but helps protect more vulnerable or older family members in advance of any potential future wave of COVID-.” A new specially-designed children’s formulation of the Pfizer BioNTech COVID- vaccine has been approved for this age group and it’s given at a lower dose compared with that used in iniduals aged  and above . Like all children’s vaccines, this approval was given following a robust review of data showing that it is safe and effective to use in this cohort. Clinical trials have shown that this vaccine was highly effective at preventing COVID- in children, protecting them and also reducing the chance that they transmit the virus to others, including family members who may be more susceptible to severe consequences of the infection. Dr Johnston continued by saying: “In Northern Ireland, childhood vaccination programmes have consistently achieved high coverage and we hope that parents will be supportive of this roll out and get their child vaccinated. Vaccination is the most important thing we can do to protect ourselves and our children against ill-health. Evenyour child has already had COVID-, it is still important to get them vaccinated, as being fully-vaccinated can offer them the best protection from the virus and severe disease.” From Wednesday  March  you can make an appointment for your child at a children’s vaccination clinic in your local Health and Social Care Trust using the online booking system at:covid-.hscni.net get-vaccinated. You may be able to attend without an appointment. Dr Johnston concluded: “COVID- has not gone away. Getting vaccinated provides the best protection for both the child and their family. Children will need two doses of the vaccine, usually  weeks apart, to get longer-lasting protection. If your child has tested positive for COVID-, you should normally wait  weeks from the test for your child to have their first or second vaccine.” For further information for parents on the COVID- vaccine for  to  year olds visitpha.site all-s Or to find out where your nearest COVID- vaccine clinic is, visitvaccinations.covid-.hscni.net location-search"},{"url":null,"title":"alliance tops donations thanks to ex members legacy","story":"Enter your code here\" required\"\"The access code entered is not valid.

Craig Harkness, Ross Connolly and Darren Cassells on the wings were making super tackles when required, while Andrew Mullholand kept the opposition outside the circle.Bangor won a short corner, but Ballynahinch kept the ball out and go on the attack. Leslie Harrison found Alex Millar and he passed the ball to Hugo Melville who attacked up the right hand side before being stopped in his tracks.Before the end of the first quarter Bangor ed to the lsquoHinch circle and took the lead with a tap-in at the back post.With both sides now settled in, the second quarter was full of end to end action. Matthew Martin made a break through the Bangor defence and passed the ball to forward Jason Campbell who won a short corner. Bangor were able to stop the Hinch drag flick from the top of the circle.With Bangor on the front foot and looking to increase their lead they applied the pressure on lsquoHinch.

This was a warning sign of things to come as just moments later McCoubrey managed to put the ball into the net courtesy of the outside of his right boot after a scramble in the box.Again, Carryduff showed their resilience and still relied on their counterattacks, the latest coming from captain Conway, although his misjudged pass denied team-mate David Quigley a chance at goal.The pressure would continue to mount on the Carryduff back line and soon it was - as McCoubrey registered his second of the match mdash albeit through an unorthodox but neat finish.Celtic defender Blaine Connolly saw his effort fantastically thwarted by Carryduff lsquokeeper Leggett, who pounced to the bottom right corner of his net with a strong outstretched arm to deny further punishment.The weather began to give its input into the game as temperatures ped bitterly and the wind began to blow harshly at intervals.Although this cannot be cited as the determining factor in this contest by any stretch of the imagination, it certainly played its part when Carryduffrsquos Emmet Curran saw his through ball carried beyond its intended target.Carryduff did manufacture a rare breakaway and it looked asstriker Jonathan Wilkinson would open the away sidersquos account when a pass from midfield left him with just lsquokeeper Curran to beat.However, an impressive last-ditch tackle from defender Gary Carberry allowed the Celtic number five to hook the ball to safety, thus further frustrating the opposition.Celticrsquos Shaun Megahey saw his left-footed effort saved before Carryduffrsquos Joseph McBrien swept up the loose ball and in the last notable action of the half, Conway witnessed his lowly struck effort palmed away from danger by the Hoopsrsquo number one.As the second half kicked off, the home side showed no signs of relenting as they pushed for more goals.Conaill Kerr saw his point-blank effort superbly saved from six yards by lsquokeeper Leggett, who, despite the score line, made numerous contributions to prevent his side conceding into double figures.This over-eagerness from the hosts would cost them as they were caught short at the back, leaving Raymond Grant unmarked  yards from goal.The striker quickly picked his spot and unleashed a lovely curled effort into the top right hand corner to get his side off the mark.Unfortunately for Carryduff, this was as good as it got as Celtic replied almost immediately with McMahon grabbing his second of the matchafter rounding the lsquokeeper for an easy tap in.Things went from bad to worse for the away team when Stephen Galbraith slipped a pass into the path of team-mate Conaill Kerr, who made no mistake with his finish in the one-on-one scenario.At this point Carryduff were aiming for damage limitation but Celtic smelt blood. McMahon completed his hat-trick with an eye-catching acrobatic effort before McCoubrey, tapped in his third of the day.Hoops defender Carberry picked up a yellow card after some unsavoury words with the official and captain Michael Rice was left red-faced after midfielder Curran knocked the ball between his legs, but the home outfit didnrsquot let that deter them from their onslaught.Carberry atoned for his booking in the form of a late header from a Galbraith corner delivery to round off the scoring at -.After the match, hat-trick hero Sean McMahon gave his thoughts on his sidersquos resounding victory.ldquoIt was a good performance, he said. ldquoWe knew they only had  players so we had a good chance of winning but you have to play the  minutes and make sure you get the victory at the end of the day.ldquoWersquove put pressure on the league leaders, itrsquos good to score three goals but the main thing is to get the three points.He added: ldquoI donrsquot usually score headers so thatrsquos my pick of the goals for me.Celtic Bhoys: N Curran, S Megahey, B Connolly, R Fitzpatrick, G Carberry, M Rice , B Treacy, C McCartan, S McMahon, J McCoubrey, C Kerr.

There is a need for an overall plan for this town.ldquoThe whole place is badly run down and has probably never been at a lower ebb. Killyleagh is a ghost town now. We need some new source of employment and a marina linked to a hotel would be a big boost.DOWNPATRICK ndash Councillors targeting Downpatrickrsquos arts centre for closure may be prevented from carrying out their plans by the terms of the buildingrsquos lease.The -year lease on the building, which was agreed when the council took over the former Town Hall from Lord Dunleath, does not enable the council to sell the property andit is closed for more than  months the building will revert to its original owner.Under the terms agreed, the council took over the building on the basis it would be used solely for the purpose outlined in Article  of the Recreation and Youth Services Order.ldquoThis paragraph specically empowers councils to provide facilities for ldquorecreational, social, physical and cultural activities.The lease on the arts centre states that the owner, Lord Dunleath, would enforce his right to take back the building within  monthsits uses were outside the terms of that clause.This means that several years of council investment, eighteen months worth of running costs, and a pound, grant from the Department of Education would be wasted.DUNDRUM ndash Crisis-threatened Dundrum Regatta has been saved from collapse after villagers rallied to a special meeting last week.The Regatta, one of the oldest summer festivals in Northern Ireland, looked doomed earlier this month but an appeal by organisers has attracted increased community support and ensure the eventrsquos future.The special meeting was called after just five people attended the organising committeersquos annual meeting earlier this month.It was immediately adjourned and an appeal issued to villages to support the reconvened meeting, held in St Donardrsquos hall on Tuesday night.Committee chairman, Mr Paddy Cunningham said: ldquoI was very pleased to see the turnout had increased signicantly and we were able to proceed with the business of organising this yearrsquos Regatta..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Jimmy\u0027s 10k back  ","story":"ONE of the most prestigious races in the local running calendar is ing to the streets of Downpatrick after an absence of three years.Jimmyrsquos K, organised by East Down Athletic Club and supported by MB McGrady  Co, Chartered Accountants, will take place on Sunday, March .Given that it will be the opening race of the  K Grand Prix, and one of the first road running fixtures of the Athletics NI calendar, organisers are expecting a packed entry list.Jimmyrsquos K was last raced in Downpatrick in .

Improved disabled access is also part of the investment plan which will result in a number of paths being widened.Council officials say the planned improvements are essential for local people who are increasingly using the trails as part of their daily routine and commute.Since the start of the Covid pandemic, there has been a major increase in the number of people walking along the banks of the Quoile with this set to increase over the spring and summer.Council chairwoman Cathy Mason and Downpatrick councillors Oonagh Hanlon and Gareth Sharvin are delighted with the master plan and the benefit that it will provide for the town, its residents and visitors.Cllr Mason said due to Covid- restrictions, many areas across the district have experienced an increased use of outdoor spaces.ldquoThis has been so important for the health and wellbeing of residents and visitors to our area, she continued.ldquoThe Quoile in particular has been extremely busy with families and friends using the location for running, walking, cycling or simply meeting up with each other. The need for good quality outdoor space has never been as important.Cllr Hanlon said she was ldquoexcited to see the first phase of the local authorityrsquos Covid recovery scheme being rolled out.ldquoI am pleased the work will include enhancing boardwalks and paths at Jane Shore with improved disability access in particular at the gates which will be of particular interest to local anglers who have lobbied for better access, she said.ldquoThis work is vital in enhancing the tourist and heritage offerings we have locally and create better linkages to the town centre.Cllr Sharvin said the joint local authority and government department investment will signicantly improve access along the Janes Shore area and help disabled anglers in particular who have highlighted with him the challenges they face of accessing the walkway.ldquoThe planned improvements will enable everyone to enjoy the uniqueness of the Quoile area as a recreational and tourism asset, he said.Cllr Sharvin said work to resurface the footpath, replace wooden fencing and walking boards, in tandem with the provision of new accessibility gates and cutting back trees and hedging will make a major dference.He said the foliage will be cut back next month and when that is completed, it is hoped that work on the other planned improvements will get underway.The Quoile Angling Club is holding its annual meeting in Murphyrsquos bar, Downpatrick, on March  at pm..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Preservation order put on hold pending planning application  ","story":"A DECISION to make a preservation order to protect trees at the centre of the Exploris Ropebridge car park project in Portaferry has been put on hold.The Department of Infrastructureconfirmed this week that it will wait for the outcome of a planning application before it decides what to do with the trees that local people are campaigning to save.Ards and North Down Borough Council lodged a planning application with its own planning department last December  to gain permission to build an extended car and coach on its own land near the popular visitor venue.The project has been controversial since local conservationists discovered last year that in order to build the car-park, nine mature protected trees would need to be removed.It was later confirmed that the council did not have the authority to remove the trees under a permitted development and needed to apply for planning permission for the car-park which should have been competed by next month.The Portaferry Stop The Trees campaign gathered more than , names in opposition to the trees cull and even offered the council an alternative design which would have saved the trees but resulted in less parking spaces. The design was rejected by the council.The campaign started last May when contractors turned up with equipment and portacabins and marked the trees for felling.Local resident Lily Devlin noticed the development and started the campaign, first rallying support via her Facebook page, and then starting an online petition.Speaking on behalf of the Save the Trees Campaign group, Cathie McKimm said: ldquoThe council got this wrong from the beginning.ldquoWe now have a situation where the council are applying for planning permission for a project they have already appointed contractors for and the project has increased by almost % in cost.ldquoIn bringing in experts to late at a huge cost to the ratepayer to fix the many mistakes theyrsquove made, including failing to include a drainage system in a flood risk area, the council are now having to contribute more than pound, to this scheme and growing, whereas before they were only contributing approximately pound, for the same scheme. ldquoGiven all the conflicts of interest that the council now have we do not believe they can assess this planning application objectively, and believe that the Department of Infrastructure needs to call it in and conduct a full investigation about how this has been handled.A council spokesman confirmed that a planning application for the project would follow regulations which apply to all councils throughout Northern Ireland in making its decision.He said: ldquoThe council will let matters follow due process, mindful of the procedures put in place by the Department for such planning applications.He also confirmed that the project, which was planned as a local tourism boost, had increased in costs.ldquoThe council has applied for and obtained funding of pound, towards the project. At the start of the regeneration scheme, the proposed costs were circa pound,, he said.ldquoHowever, with the passage of time, increased construction costs and refinement of the scheme , the costs were last estimated at circa pound, which was agreed by council in October .A DfI spokesperson confirmed it had initially considered making a preservation order on the trees.He added: ldquoHowever, on January  , the council confirmed that it had instead opted to submit a planning application. This was lodged on December  to the Planning Service of the council. The necessity of whether it is expedient to complete the process of making a TPO is on hold pending the outcome of the planning application..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Smell wind of change as lambs leap around fields  ","story":"IT is spring again in Lecale and new le abounds in the fields. Daffodils are peaking out of the ground, the weather is softening, and the feast of St Brigidrsquos Day , February , has passed.This can mean only one thing ndash lambs! In fact, lambs have been born in our practice since before Christmas. But the majority will be coming to a field near you over the next few weeks.Now, modern flocks have a lot of sheep in them. Indeed, there are about five million sheep in Ireland overall. Thatrsquos one for every man, woman and child.Our domestic sheepis descended from a primitive European ancestor, today found mainly in Corsica. In the past it was common for sheep to havejust one lamb. But today, thanks to better feeding, shelter and shepherding, it is possible for sheep to have twins, triplets and even quads!This abundance can come with problems though. Whata sheep doesnrsquot have enough milk to feed this many lambs  Well, farmers have come up with a number of solutions.The first is lsquopet lambsrsquo. These lambs are hand reared. They are fed with a bottle using condensed milk from commercial suppliers. Or the milk can be taken from another ewe who is producing a lot.As anyone with a baby will tell you, this solution is labour intensive and will keep the shepherd working around the clock. But they are dedicated, and they do it! It is not always sustainable in the long run. Another solution is fostering.Lamb fostering is where a ewe adopts the lamb from another ewe. The reasons for fostering can be manold. A lack of milk is one of the major reasons. The ewe may not want to take on another lamb, not recognising it as her own, but shepherds have adapted one of naturersquos many wonders to encourage it to happen.They use a technique called olfactory imprinting. Have you ever wondered how a ewe can recognise her own lamb in a flock of hundreds  One reason is that, just after birth, the ewe learns the smell of her newborn. This is what olfactory imprinting means.Shepherds can take advantage of this amazing process by rubbing some of the birthing fluid of the newborn lamb into the wool of the lamb to be fostered. The ewe will then accept the lamb as one of her own, and feed and care for it. The lives of many lambs are saved in this way.So when you next look at the fields of Lecale, check out the sheep and seeyou can tell them apart. Evenyou canrsquot, their mums can!.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Ulster Aviation Society left ‘dismayed’ over council at Festival of Flight decision  ","story":"THE decision by Newry, Mourne and Down Council to cancel this summerrsquos international Festival of Flight in Newcastle was taken without consulting one of its key partners, it has emerged.Last weekrsquos decision to pull the plug on the event mdash which was last held in  mdash was taken in secret during a meeting of the local authorityrsquos Enterprise, Tourist and Regeneration Committee.It is understood that no contact was made with the Ulster Aviation Society which has played a major role since the inaugural festival and described its disappointment at the cancellation decision.Regularly attracting in the region of , people to the resort in the summer, the flagship tourist event has been a major success for over a decade.Council officials say that due to the challenges in planning such a major festival, securing commitments from participants and with the uncertainty caused to date by the pandemic, organising this yearrsquos event would not be possible.Some councillors believe that given the local authorityrsquos St Patrickrsquos Day parades in Downpatrick and Newry are set to go ahead next month and with the further easing of Covid regulations, some form of airshow could have been organised for Newcastle this summer.This week, Slieve Croob councillor Alan Lewis urging the council to confirm that next yearrsquos festival will go ahead.The Ulster Aviation Society said it was ldquodisappointed and dismayed about the cancellation of the airshow and the fact that the organisation had not been consulted.Society chairman Ray Burrows said it was ldquoastonishing that the event had been ldquoshot down in secret, with no reasonable explanation.Mournes councillor Willie Clarke has urged the local council to ldquograsp the opportunity and organise an alternative event, suggesting a large scale festival that incorporates and builds on the most popular elements of the Festival of Flight.He is keen to see an event showcasing the regionrsquos ldquooutstanding food and drink offering with Newcastle a designated venue for arts, culture and music events to create opportunities showcasing the entrepreneurial spirit and pioneering innovation of the district.Mr Burrows said while these were ldquoall excellent suggestions, he said as elements in addition to, or within, the Festival of Flight, surely not as a replacement for it.He continued: ldquoThat said, we would be pleased indeed to meet with the council or the mayor to discuss the matter. We want to help Newcastle demonstrate in a powerful, popular way how important our aviation future and heritage are to Northern Ireland.ldquoThatrsquos exactly what did in recent years, before Covid.ldquoWe [the UAS] had probably the most popular exhibition within the ground-based event and thousands of parents have brought their children for photographs in our Spitfire and our Alouette helicopter, at no charge.Mr Burrows suggested that unless the councilrsquos decision is reversed, or at least re-assessed, he expects there will be tremendous disappointment from the public.The international festival was cancelled in  because of bad weather and in  and last year because of the Covid- pandemic it was also grounded.Urging the local authority to confirm that it will be chocks away for next summerrsquos Festival of Flight, Cllr Lewis said that for the past two years, the organisation has been unable to deliver a tourism events programme due to the impact of Covid-.ldquoAlthough the possible impact of future Covid iants is dficult to predict, it is hoped that larger scale events can resume this summer. This will be a welcome boost to residents and the local trade and hospitality sectors, he continued.ldquoCouncil research indicates that almost poundm was generated in  for the district as a direct result of tourism events. Therefore, it is bitterly disappointing that this yearrsquos Festival of Flight will not be going ahead.Cllr Lewis said the income that it would have generated would be a welcome boost to traders in the town and benefit the collective tourism industry across South Down.He continued: ldquoWe must not underestimate the huge draw of this annual festival. I note that council officers have said that throughout this past  months they had continued to engage with key stakeholders including the RAF.ldquoIt was advised that due to challenges planning the festival, securing air assets and the uncertainty of the pandemic that it has not been possible to host the festival of flight this year.Cllr Lewis revealed that he has been contacted by many aviation enthusiasts who are bitterly disappointed that the festival wonrsquot go ahead.He added: ldquoI fail to see how the event couldnrsquot have at least been planned for later in the year, now that we know the majority of restrictions are to be lted. I am asking the council to alleviate fears by confirming that the Festival of Flight hasnrsquot be shelved.

Teaching, and hence learning, relies on communication, the essential verbal and non-verbal communication between child and teacher cannot take place behind a mask. All those non-verbal cues which teachers use to gauge understanding are being lost.A child’s capacity to express feelings and emotions is being affected by being masked. Some children cannot make eye contact and can’t sleep, clear signs of psychological distress and of course, impacting on their capacity to learn. Referrals to schools’ counselling services have rocketed.How can it be healthy for a child to wear a mask six or seven hours per day How can we justy a measure which has no benefit to children and accept the damage to their education, mental health and social development It is long past the time to end this abuse of our children.Hugh McCarthy, , Newtownabbey——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Prior to being in Lurgan, the organisation’s administrative base was located in Dublin and Belfast.The Royal Black moved out of Brownlow House in  to temporary premises in Loughgall, beside the Museum of Orange Heritage at Sloan’s House.Now, the institution is looking forward to taking up residence in their own purpose-built administrative centre.“The opening of our new headquarters will be a landmark day in the history of the Royal Black Institution,” said Rev Anderson.“This project has been one of the biggest and most important ever undertaken by the Imperial Grand Black Chapter of the British Commonwealth.“The need for our own headquarters was discussed and agreed in , we purchased the Loughgall building in , renovation work began in May , and I’m delighted to say we’re ready to cut the ribbon on Saturday, April .“It has been a long road to get to this point, and there have been many challenges along the way. “We had originally hoped to open the building in , so that the unveiling would form part of our celebrations for the centenary of Northern Ireland. However, the Covid pandemic wreaked havoc with our work schedule. But we were fairly relaxed about the delay as our focus was always about completing the building to a high standard rather than rushing to a completion date.“There are so many people to thank for all their hard work but I would like to take this opportunity to pay special tribute to the contractors, Weir Bros Construction, for their professionalism and attention to detail, and to our own clerk of works, Edgar Patterson, and quantity surveyor, Keith Anderson, and the entire Royal Black HQ project team, for their passion, commitment and expertise over the last few years.“Thanks to the efforts of everyone involved, we now have modern headquarters from which we can proudly maintain our stand for the Reformed Faith and strengthen our Christian and charitable outreach.”The building itself has an interesting history. At one stage it was a public house known as the Rock Tavern. Afterwards, a temperance advocate, Cecilia Cope, turned it into a coffee house. A later inhabitant was Field Marshal Sir Gerald Templer, a senior British Army officer and former chief of the Imperial General Staff, who fought in both world wars. In more recent times it housed a popular antiques business.The grand opening will also include the opening of a ‘Leaders’ Legacy’ exhibition on the lives of past sovereign grand masters, and the unveiling and dedication of a bust of Sir Norman Stronge.

There is a coastal walk, chance to go fishing, surfing and views of Tusker Rock.For those owners who may not yet have ventured to the beach with their pups or are concerned about behaviour while at the beach, Wood Green’s dog behaviour and training specialist, Wendy Kruger, has provided some tips to prepare your dog for the beach.• Ensure your dog’s microchip and collar tag details are up to date – just in case.• Get used to checking ground surface temperatures before you take your dog out, as dry sand can be too hot for dogs’ paws on sunny days. To check the ground temperature, place the back of your hand on the ground. If its too hot to hold comfortably for five seconds, it’s too hot for dogs’ paws..remove• Practise basic, reward-based training when out and about to help your dog to maintain focus and engagement on walks.• Recall is also an area that needs particular attention. Evenyour dog has a great recall at home, its not something that can be guaranteed in unfamiliar environments with exciting new distractions. Games with toys are a fantastic way to help your dog engage with you when there are other distractions around. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Women are more likely to ditch their partner than their pet, found a poll for nationwide pet retailer Jollyes. Asked about their relationship with their partner and their pet and which one they would ditch first,  per cent said they would ditch their partner against  per cent who would ditch their pet. Men were more loyal to their partners, with  per cent saying they would ditch their pet and  per cent saying they would ditch their partner. Overall,  per cent would ditch their partner first and  per cent said the pet would go first. The study was carried out by Jollyes to gauge humans’ attitudes to romance and relationships as it launches the search on social media for a canine couple to take part in a romantic dinner for two at its doggy dates diner, “C’est Jollyes”, open for one day only on  February at its Runcorn store in Cheshire . Two dogs will get the chance to enjoy a three course dinner featuring a menu from Jollyes Artisan Lestage range including angus beef with sweet potato, venison and salmon, and duck with sweet potato. The survey showed some big dferences in attitudes to pets and partners around the UK. People in North East England were more likely to ditch their partnerover their pet, followed by London , Northern Ireland , South West . [See table in editor’s notes below for regional breakdown.] Owners were asked what they loved most about their pets, with loyalty, unconditional love, loving nature, affection and a warm heart among the qualities cited. No matter how much love an animal gives, most pet ownerswould prefer a romantic Valentine’s night with their partner than one spent with their pet. Of male respondents,  per cent chose a night with their partner, compared with  per cent of female respondents. The figures were broadly similar across the country. Among the other popular traits cited by pet owners were: “they are so loyal and loving. And cute!” “unconditional love and loyalty” “they comfort me when I’m feeling blue” “doesnt argue or answer back” “they always cheer me up” “waggy tail and warm heart” and “her loving nature, always there for me when I need her”. One said: “Sometimes playful, sometimes cuddly, intelligent, independent, sometimes dangerous. All rather like my partner really.” Not everyone was totally enamoured with their pet. One said: “Nothing, it hates me, only loves my we”. And not all pets’ traits would make for a romantic night out – one said: “hassle free”, another said “doesn’t answer back” and one said “it’s a tortoise and he’s as indferent to use as we are to him”. Phil Turner-Naylor, head of marketing at Jollyes, said: “We’re known as a nation of animal lovers and this goes to prove it. When it comes to relationships, a lot people would choose their pet over their partner. “The good news for romantics though is that a big majority choose people over pets. What it does show, especially for men, is that partners have to work hard to keep the romance going or they might find themselves in the dog house. Women are looking for a romantic night with their partner on Valentine’s, butthe men don’t get it right, they had better watch out.”  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_fcaffadccbdfcfcff   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_caead   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1645089617694.jpg--1_700_people_apply_for_a_life_less_ordinary_with_stena_line.jpg?164508961700","title":"  people apply for a life less ordinary with stena line ","story":"Ferry company Stena Line has been overwhelmed with the positive response from the public to its recent recruitment campaign ‘A Le Less Ordinary’, which aims to fill  vacant positions onboard its Irish Sea ferries. , applications were received from people across the UK and Republic of Ireland. The campaign promoted the unique nature of le onboard, with % time-off providing the perfect work-le balance for people wanting to live and work onboard for either a one or two-week sht and then spend equal time off. The positions available are part of the Onboard Sales and Servicesteam, with vacancies for service assistants and chefs. With January being the traditional time of the year when many people look for a new career, Stena Line had hoped for a favourable response but even the most optimistic of predictions could not have expected it to be so over-subscribed. Stena Line has now undertaken the initial stage of the selection process and, for the first-time, is hosting two Open Days for prospective candidates on Monday th February, where they will get a chance to meet members of Stena Line’s crews. The Open Days are taking place in Belfast and Birkenhead with the latter being held onboard one of Stena Line’s newest ferries, Stena Edda, giving candidates a chance to get a first-hand taste of le onboard on the Irish Sea. Stephen Bryden, Stena Line’s Head of Onboard Sales and Services, commented on the success of the campaign: “I am astonished by the public’s response to the A Le Less Ordinary recruitment campaign. We have never received so many applications. It really goes to show how many people are attracted to a le at sea with a company like Stena Line. Now our HR team has the challenge of how to sort and interview so many applicants, but that is a nice challenge to have.

While most children aged  to  will have mild diseasethey contract COVID-, some may experience symptoms which last longer than just a few days. Vaccination of children in this age group has been shown to help prevent the small number of hospitalisations and intensive care admissions that can occur in this age group. It has also been shown to help provide short-term protection against non-severe disease. Dr Jillian Johnston, Joint Interim Assistant Director in Health Protection at the PHA, said: “We know the COVID risk for young children is less than for older people, but we also know the vaccine is very safe, has already been used extensively around the world, and there is no evidence that it causes any long term issues. When you look at the risk of COVID- against the risk of the vaccine, it’s more beneficial for children to receive the vaccine. It not only boosts the child’s immunity against the risk of severe disease, but helps protect more vulnerable or older family members in advance of any potential future wave of COVID-.” A new specially-designed children’s formulation of the Pfizer BioNTech COVID- vaccine has been approved for this age group and it’s given at a lower dose compared with that used in iniduals aged  and above . Like all children’s vaccines, this approval was given following a robust review of data showing that it is safe and effective to use in this cohort. Clinical trials have shown that this vaccine was highly effective at preventing COVID- in children, protecting them and also reducing the chance that they transmit the virus to others, including family members who may be more susceptible to severe consequences of the infection. Dr Johnston continued by saying: “In Northern Ireland, childhood vaccination programmes have consistently achieved high coverage and we hope that parents will be supportive of this roll out and get their child vaccinated. Vaccination is the most important thing we can do to protect ourselves and our children against ill-health. Evenyour child has already had COVID-, it is still important to get them vaccinated, as being fully-vaccinated can offer them the best protection from the virus and severe disease.” From Wednesday  March  you can make an appointment for your child at a children’s vaccination clinic in your local Health and Social Care Trust using the online booking system at:covid-.hscni.net get-vaccinated. You may be able to attend without an appointment. Dr Johnston concluded: “COVID- has not gone away. Getting vaccinated provides the best protection for both the child and their family. Children will need two doses of the vaccine, usually  weeks apart, to get longer-lasting protection. If your child has tested positive for COVID-, you should normally wait  weeks from the test for your child to have their first or second vaccine.” For further information for parents on the COVID- vaccine for  to  year olds visitpha.site all-s Or to find out where your nearest COVID- vaccine clinic is, visitvaccinations.covid-.hscni.net location-search  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_afbcfbfaaeefe   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_fbbbafbecacfefbc   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
