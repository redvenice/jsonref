Mr Ashley pictured at Wembley Stadium last month\u0027The rationale for tying these companies together is clearly compelling. If the coup fails, he will surely launch a takeover.\u0027If it succeeds he will be able to tie up the operational side and shore up finances from his own resources. Whether this boardroom coup fails or not, there is surely only one outcome from all of this: Mike Ashley will get what he wants.\u0027In January, Mr Ashley teamed up with fellow shareholder Landmark to eject Debenhams chairman Sir Ian Cheshire and chief executive Sergio Bucher from the board.The shock announcement comes just days after Debenhams issued its latest profit warning.It warned that trading headwinds, efforts to put the group on a secure financial footing and macroeconomic uncertainties are hitting the company hard.The profit alert was the fourth in just over a year.Meanwhile shares in Sports Direct slipped as much as 2.6 per cent on Friday.Laith Khalaf, analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \u0027Such an unnecessary change of CEO looks somewhat disrespectful to other shareholders of Sports Direct, but then those who hold the stock must surely have already come to terms with Mike Ashley\u0027s unorthodox style.\u0027          Mr Ashley owns just under 30 per cent of Debenhams through Sports Direct, the retail firm\u0027s largest shareholder (stock image)"},{"url":null,"title":"Margaret Thatcher dropped plans sack Sir Geoffrey Howe year turned her","story":"    Margaret Thatcher, pictured in June 1989, dropped secret plans to sack Sir Geoffrey Howe from her Cabinet more than a year before he effectively forced her resignationDuring the so-called ‘Madrid ambush’ in June 1989, Sir Geoffrey and Mr Lawson threatened to quit if Mrs Thatcher did not give a fixed date for when Britain would join the European Union’s Exchange Rate Mechanism. Theresa May secretly promises Remain rebels they WILL be...Liz Truss attacks PM for allowing \u0027monster of the hard...Share this article"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/22/16/4F4E843200000578-6086447-image-a-20_1534950891895.jpg","title":"Motorist wins landmark case against council poorly signed traffic camera raking 100k week","story":"Emma Bartholomew has won a landmark case against a council raking in over £100k-a-week from a new a new traffic enforcement cameraA motorist has won a landmark case against a council raking in over £100,000-a-week from a new traffic enforcement camera.Emma Bartholomew successfully appealed against a £65 fine after her mother made a left turn at a junction in Hackney, East London.She took the council to a tribunal who ruled the new signs banning the left turn at certain times of the day were \u0027inadequate\u0027.Since being installed more than 20,000 people have been hit with penalty charge notices raking in £14,000 a day for the council.Emma has now encouraged other motorists hit with the fine from Hackney Council to consider launching an appeal.\u0027I was able to argue my case that the signs at the junction are not clear and confusing for motorists,\u0027 said Emma.\u0027I am pleased the tribunal ruled in my favour and I think others who have fallen foul of the camera and been sent fines should consider making an appeal.\u0027Last June Hackney Council banned drivers from turning left at a junction in the hope of reducing air pollution at a nearby school.The traffic enforcement camera has reaped close to £1m in just nine months for the council making it one of the most profitable in the UK.

Dame Kelly was responding to a tweet by Good Morning Britain in support of Martina Navratilova who had suggested that trans women who competed in women\u0027s sports were \u0027cheating\u0027 because of a biological advantage          Trans cyclist Rachel McKinnon calls out Holmes\u0027 sponsors Garmin and Specialized for supporting and suggests they drop her for not holding the same values          McKinnon, who also has academic pursuits, is one of a few transgender world champions across the sporting world. She achieved a 2018 UCI Masters Track Cycling gold medal at a competition in Los AngelesShe wrote on Twitter: ‘So hey Specialized and Garmin have you been following how your athlete Kelly Holmes has been extremely transphobic lately on Twitter?’ She added: ‘Specialized, you have a trans athlete. Garmin, you cool with this?’Miss McKinnon urged the companies to ‘take a stand’ as Dame Kelly was ‘trying to ban trans women from competing in women’s sport’ in breach of International Olympic Committee (IOC) policy.Miss McKinnon has argued that since IOC rules introduced in 2003 allowed trans women to compete, ‘not a single trans athlete has even qualified for the Olympics, let alone won a medal’.           Holmes responded to the criticism by saying she felt strongly about competitive sports, and wanted evidence there was no disadvantage before she would back downCycling specialists Specialized said it would investigate Dame Kelly’s comments, posting on Twitter: ‘Thanks for flagging this, Rachel. This is not representative of our brand values.’Dame Kelly, who won gold in the 800m and 1,500m running events in the 2004 Olympics, hit back – telling Miss McKinnon that involving her sponsors was ‘going about this in the wrong way’. In a tweet, she questioned why she had been blocked by a fellow athlete ‘if this subject is open to debate’.She added: ‘Calling me transphobic is just ridiculous – far from it. I have an opinion you don’t like... that’s that!’ Dame Kelly has lent her support to the Fair Play for Women campaign, which insists that female athletes are at a clear disadvantage against trans rivals.Tennis star Miss Navratilova has already clashed with Miss McKinnon in a row over male-born transgender athletes competing against biological women, branding it ‘cheating’.The Wimbledon champion and LGBT campaigner deplored the ‘tyranny’ of transgender activists who ‘denounce anyone who argues against them’.Miss Navratilova – who faced abuse and prejudice after coming out as gay in 1981 – accused Canadian Miss McKinnon of sending ‘bullying tweets’, and said her views had now ‘strengthened’.Long distance runner Miss Radcliffe has said tighter rules need to be applied if transgender women are to compete. IOC guidelines say transgender women must suppress testosterone levels for at least 12 months before they compete.She told the BBC: ‘People will manipulate this if there is an opening there to make money and win medals and we’ve seen the lengths people go to, the lengths Russia went to cheat in sport.’    Sharron Davies says the argument about trans women competing in female events is simply a matter of ‘biology’.The former Olympic swimmer, 56, claimed it was unfair to compete against those ‘who were born into a male body with all the advantages that will bring’.She told Radio 4’s Today programme that simple biology meant a transgender competitor would have a better ‘red blood cell count, increased lung capacity, better hand-eye co-ordination, longer limbs, denser bones, leaner muscle, bigger hearts’. Miss Davies, pictured, added: ‘Take swimming. Michael Phelps has got size 15 feet, your average female has size five or six feet, so if we were to move a man into swimming they would totally dominate all the women’s events.’ "},{"url":null,"title":"May urges EU leaders help persuade MPs Brexit deal","story":"Theresa May was in Grimsby today begging Brussels for concessions on the Irish border backstop and warned MPs who sink her deal there may be no Brexit at all if they do  The EU\u0027s chief Brexit negotiator outlined his position on Twitter.

Mistress: Shanann believed that Watts was having an affair long before that day, but it had been confirmed by a recent credit card charge (Watts and his mistress Nichol Kessinger above in July)\u0027She started crying a bit and was like, What\u0027s wrong? What\u0027s wrong with mommy?\u0027Watts then dragged Shanann down the stairs, at which point the couple\u0027s other daughter Celeste was woken up and began running around the house with her sister.Shanann\u0027ds body was then loaded into Watts\u0027 truck with her two daughters, who spent an hour in the vehicle with their dead mother\u0027s body.\u0027Daddy, it smells,\u0027 said Bella during the drive.Once Watts arrived at his work site, he took Shanann\u0027s body out of the car and then returned to kill Celeste.He smothered Celeste with a New York Yankees blanket while choking her neck and then tossed her body in an oil tank.Bella sat silently and watched as her father killed her little sister.When he returned from dumping Celeste, Bella asked quietly: \u0027Is the same thing gonna happen to me as Cece?\u0027Watts said he was not sure if he told her \u0027yes\u0027 or not at the time.She put up a fight while he began to smother her in the same manner as her sister, making grunting noises and screaming out just before she died: \u0027Daddy, no!\u0027Celeste was able to fit into the opening in the oil tank but Bella had to be manipulated said Watts, who next went about burying his wife Shanann.He raked away some weeds but then dumped the rake when it broke, before putting her and his unborn son Nico in a shallow grave.Watts then went home, where he tossed the Yankees blanket and his clothes in a neighborhood dumpster.He said there was no master plan and he is still not certain how he managed to act normal around people after these events transpired in early August.Watts also said he did not even try to think up an alibi at any point.\u0027I had no time to really have a thought that was my own,\u0027 he explained that day.One of the key reasons for Watts\u0027 rage and anger towards his wife was her decision to cut ties with his parents after an incident that occurred a few weeks before the murders.Shanann declared that his parents could no longer see the girls after his mother served ice cream with peanuts at a party, despite his daughter\u0027s allergy to nuts.\u0027I don’t know if that had something to do with it... that something inside me just triggered it and then it just like, all that pent up from the wedding and everything,\u0027 said Watts.\u0027It’s like a long fuse that finally just went to its end.\u0027Watts said that he regretted the way he came to treat his family after he began dating Shanann, and revealed only his grandmother came to his wedding.He said that he entered a guilty plea because he did not want to make his attorneys lie for the two to four years a trial would take to run its course.\u0027They would’ve done anything I told them to do... I don’t see how they can do that,\u0027 said Watts.\u0027Like, you know, that’s what attorneys do... you know, like, they take their defendant and they say hey, like, what happened, okay we’ll go with that story.\u0027When Watts was asked to go in for a polygraph test just days after Shanann and the girls were reported missing he said that he knew he was not walking out that day.Jail was rough for him in Colorado he told the officials that day, saying that other inmates would scream out ways for him to take his own life.In his final days before being transferred to his current prison, Watts actually believed that he was going to die.He also found God.\u0027I never knew I could have a relationship with God like I do now...it’s like the amazing grace with all of this, but I just wish nobody had to pay any kind of price for this...I know there is a purpose for everybody, I just hope I can find mine.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"Oxford University suspends jihad supporting student trying recruit extreme Islamist group","story":"Asked about his recruitment success he said: ‘There’s a few I’m trying to convince.

Photograph: Dave MeehanThe Bringing an electric scooter into The  newsroom generated the same level of excitement as a Chopper bicycle might have done in an Irish school yard in the 1970s.Almost instantly, a small crowd formed around it as otherwise serious-minded people begged for a go on it.Other similarly serious-minded people looked suspiciously at the scooter, a child’s toy re-imagined for an adult world, and appeared hamstrung by the self-doubt and seriousness which frequently curse grown-ups.But whether they wanted a go or wanted to pour scorn on it, what everyone really wanted to do was talk about what is clearly becoming the next big thing in Irish commuting.And it wasn’t just in the newsroom that the scooter attracted interest. In shops, pharmacies, lifts and on the street people approached the little machine armed with questions and curiosity.How much does it cost? How fast does it go? What’s the range? Do you feel stupid? Is it legal?Widespread useMore than 2,000 electric scooters are now regularly travelling the roads of Dublin – a fraction of the number to be found in US and European cities – and while the scooter clearly rekindles childhood memories in virtually everybody who sees it, it has the potential to do so much more than that.They are a novel, yet obvious, solution to the chronic and worsening congestion of our towns and cities and while they will not take people great distances, they will get them short distances almost effortlessly, involving as they do no pedalling.Scooters are also unlikely to fall victim to thieves, because they can be folded up in less than 15 seconds and brought anywhere, avoiding the need to leave them locked up in public.In recent weeks, scooters have attracted some scepticism in the corridors of power with dark mutterings about a need to regulate them so users don’t abuse the power they have by taking them onto footpaths or the road lanes normally reserved for bikes and buses.There is a danger officialdom might tie itself in knots over something which is nothing more than a handier and more relaxed alternative to a bicycle.But what’s it like to ride on the streets of Dublin during rush hour?Riding experienceInitially it is terrifying – but after maybe 90 seconds that fear dissipates and it is not unlike riding a bike.It is steady over potholes and maintaining balance is effortless.The top speed of the scooter loaned to The  by Ciaran Hughes of gyrowheel.ie was 30kmh.While that might sound fast, it was considerably slower than many of the cyclists we met along the north quays on Friday morning.A 3km journey from the Phoenix Park to College Green at the height of rush hour was completed in just under 10 minutes and because the small motor did all the work, the distance was covered without some much as a single drop of sweat being lost en route.Downsides included problems making hand signals while staying upright and the lack of suspension, which meant a short trip over cobblestones almost caused fillings to become dislodged.The absence of suspension aside, the ease of use is another one of the electric scooter’s great downsides.Riding a bicycle will enhance a person’s fitness as will walking but scooting – while not as sedentary a means of commuting as driving a car – will not get the heart racing.What it will do though is enable someone get through the city centre at rush hour faster and with a whole lot less stress than someone in a car.The charger is the same size as a laptop’s and the battery will go from almost empty to full in around three hours.At 12kg, the scooter is also sufficiently lightweight and compact to be carried into shops and onto public transport or taxis and would quite happily live in the boot of a car when not in use.The big question is, however, if our towns and cities would be better places to live and work if more people were to abandon their cars and take to their scooters and the unequivocal answer has to be yes.They may not be the jetpacks we were promised we would have but scooters are, at least, a start."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3819333.1552073525!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"eu s barnier says britain can exit customs union unilaterally","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tEuropean Union’s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier sent a series of messages on Twitter following a meeting with ambassadors from 27 EU states. File photograph: ReutersIn a last-minute bid to break the deadlock in Brexit talks the EU has offered the UK a new package of reassurances about the Northern Ireland backstop’s exit mechanisms. Among these is an acknowledgment by the EU of a right to withdraw unilaterally from an all-UK customs union, the central element of the latest backstop proposals in the Northern Ireland protocol, but only as long as the UK maintains Northern Ireland-specific measures.The move, which would effectively return the backstop provisions to their original version, would almost certainly necessitate the imposition of border controls down the Irish Sea to maintain the integrity of the EU single market. It is likely to face strong opposition from unionists who see any kind of economic controls or checks as a threat to the constitutional integrity of the UK.The backstop is an insurance policy by which the frictionless border in Ireland is to be maintained in the event that future relationship talks between the EU and UK do not produce an alternative arrangement that also meets the “purposes” of the backstop.Announcing the package by Twitter on Friday night following a meeting with EU ambassadors, EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier said that the union would be willing also to give legally binding effect to previous assurances given in January about its temporary nature and the willingness of the EU to engage urgently and in good faith during the transition process on talks on a future relationship. He points to provisions in the arbitration clause in the Withdrawal Agreement which can be triggered if a deadlock is reached over the ending of the backstop. It also “gives to the UK a right to a proportionate suspension of its obligations under the backstop, as a last resort, if the EU breaches its best endeavoursgood faith obligations to negotiate alternative solutions.”“This will render best endeavourgood faith obligations even more actionable by an arbitration panel,” Mr Barnier said.Mr Barnier’s proposals, which maintain the Withdrawal Agreement untouched, is an attempt to provide the necessary reassurances sought by UK attorney general Geoffrey Cox to allow him to revise his hostile legal assessment of the backstop exit provisions. Mr Cox’s legal opinion is seen as key to swaying wavering backbenchers in favour of the Withdrawal Agreement in the Commons “meaningful vote” on Tuesday.Mr Cox’s visit to Brussels earlier this week had been “difficult” by all accounts and there were increased fears in recent days that prime minister Theresa May would not be able to rally sufficient support for the Tuesday vote. Friday’s speech by the prime minister in Grimsby was seen as an attempt pre-emptively to blame the EU for the expected failure of the talks.‘Poisoned’UK foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt, in an interview on the Today programme, joined the blame game warning that relations with the EU would be “poisoned for many years to come” if Brussels failed to budge. Brussels was not amused.Whether the Barnier offer will however be sufficient for angry Brexiteers is not certain. Much of the package, not least the Northern Ireland-only customs union provisions, represents previously rejected proposals. Or, like the emphasis on independent arbitration, fall short of assuring the UK that it will have an independent right to break from the backstop.The initial response from the UK side was dismissive. Brexit secretary Stephen Barclay tweeted: “With a very real deadline looming, now is not the time to rerun old arguments The UK has put forward clear proposals. We now need to agree a balanced solution that can work for both sides.”The DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds said the proposal from Mr Barnier was “neither realistic nor sensible”. “It disrespects the constitutional and economic integrity of the United Kingdom. This is an attempt to get ahead of a possible blame game and appear positive when in reality it is going backwards to something rejected a year ago,” he added. Mr Dodds cited Theresa May to say that no British prime minister “could sign up to an arrangement which annexes Northern Ireland from the rest of the United Kingdom”. “Whilst the European Union has spoken often about their value of the peace process in Northern Ireland, this proposal demonstrates that they have a one-sided approach and a lack of understanding about the isions in Northern Ireland,” he said. “Just as nationalists and republicans oppose a new North-South border, unionists oppose any new east-west border which would place a new barrier between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom,” said Mr Dodds. “We need to work for a sensible deal which can work for everyone in Northern Ireland. It is possible but there must be less intransigence in Brussels,” he added.Talks will continue in Brussels over the weekend at official level with Mr Cox and Mr Barclay expected to return on Sunday.Should their discussions prove fruitful Mrs May is expected to travel to Brussels early on Monday morning to give her imprimatur to any deal. She needs to table proposals in the Commons by early afternoon.“Technical” discussions between EU and UK officials Sabine Weyand and Ollie Robbins will also be continuing in Brussels over the weekend.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Christopher FurlongPA Wire Talks between EU and UK officials are continuing in Brussels this weekend but there is little optimism that a breakthrough is imminent in advance of next week’s crucial vote on the withdrawal treaty in the House of Commons.The EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, who is on a private visit to Dublin this weekend, will meet Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney for discussions on Brexit, but senior Irish Government sources were downbeat on chances of progress.Sources in Dublin and Brussels said they expected the focus to move next week to preventing a no-deal Brexit at the end of March, most likely through an extension of article 50.An offer by Mr Barnier on Friday to make clear that the UK could decide to leave the EU customs union unilaterally – as long as Northern Ireland remained in the backstop to avoid a hard border – was immediately rejected by the DUP.The backstop is the guarantee to maintain an open border in Ireland if the future EU-UK trade deal requires Border checks.However, it is hugely unpopular among Tory MPs who have already once voted against the withdrawal treaty which contains the backstop because it threatens to keep the UK in the EU customs union.‘Blame game’The DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds said the proposal from Mr Barnier was “neither realistic nor sensible”.“It disrespects the constitutional and economic integrity of the United Kingdom. This is an attempt to get ahead of a possible blame game and appear positive when in reality it is going backwards to something rejected a year ago,” he added.Brexit secretary Stephen Barclay also dismissed the EU proposal, saying: “With a very real deadline looming, now is not the time to rerun old arguments.”The prime minister, Theresa May, has already rejected a Northern Ireland-only backstop on the grounds that it would create a border in the Irish Sea.Speaking on Friday in the Lincolnshire coastal town of Grimsby, which voted heavily to leave the EU in 2016, the prime minister urged the EU to make the concessions needed to persuade MPs to vote for her Brexit deal next Tuesday.“My message to them is: now is the moment for us to act,” she said. “It needs just one more push, to address the final specific concerns of our parliament.”Earlier, Mr Varadkar said the UK should be offering Ireland and the EU compromises on the withdrawal treaty rather than seeking them ahead of next week’s vote.“What was agreed was already a compromise – they have failed to secure ratification of this so it should be a question of what they are now willing to offer us, rather then the opposite.”The Taoiseach added: “We were, and remain, happy to apply the backstop only to Northern Ireland if they want to go back to that.

At the third attempt, following that meeting with Coveney, she issued a full apology saying she was “profoundly sorry” for her comments.The contretemps wasn’t mentioned at the embassy.Remaining countiesCharles and Camilla remain as enchanted as ever with Ireland and are regular visitors here since Queen Elizabeth’s historic trip in 2011.“I must say, I’m slightly amazed to find that we’ve managed to visit 15 counties already. I am quite determined before I drop dead and finally lose my marbles that I should get around the remaining 17,” said Charles.The Duchess of Cornwall, wearing a groovy, full-length, green-beaded Kaftan which was a gift from the King of Morocco, told officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs they had “wonderfully alluring accents” and she can’t wait to visit Ireland again in May.UK politicians at the bash in Belgravia were led by Theresa May’s chief of staff Gavin Barwell and her unofficial deputy David Lidington. Both are intimately involved in the Brexit talks, with Lidington holding the additional position of Head of Being Nice to the Irish (in public at least).Tom Watson, the dramatically slimmed-down Labour deputy leader, was looking pleased as punch now that he has established an alternative power base to Jeremy Corbyn within the party.John Bercow, speaker of the House of Commons, was in great form, no doubt looking forward to another week of nearly meaningful drama in Westminster.Actor Kenneth Branagh (who gets younger every year) sat next to Camilla and she kissed him as she left.Cork’s own Fiona Shaw – who regularly rubs shoulders with the royals – was also there as was Adrian Dunbar, who read Derek Mahon’s poem, Everything is Going to be Alright (very appropriate for the times we live in, if not necessarily a guide to the future):“The sun rises in spite of everything and the far cities are beautiful and bright. I lie here in a riot of sunlight watching the day break and the clouds flying. Everything is going to be all right.”Dunbar’s reading was part of a performance of words and music put together by Philip King and featured a harpist, a piper and a singer in a green dress. According to our man in the black tie with the canapés and small sherry, “it was all a bit like a posh Feis”.‘A pretty serious time’These are difficult times in the relationship between Ireland and the UK.The Tánaiste recognised this during his speech at ambassador Adrian O’Neill’s reception to mark St Patrick’s Day. Or “St Patrick’s Season” as Prince Charles, with a smile, more accurately noted.“It is both a privilege and a pleasure to be with all of you this evening to celebrate the British-Irish relationship in all of its depth, richness and complexity” at what was “a pretty serious time for everybody” said Simon Coveney.Everybody looked suitably grave as he continued: “All of us here this evening understand that it’s not exactly a time of plain sailing in this relationship. There are some big issues at stake.”“Some are asking the question: Is there a way through or can Ireland mount a comeback in the Six Nations?”He looked towards some of the guests from Northern Ireland – Nigel Dodds of the DUP, independent Unionist Lady Sylvia Hermon and Sinn Féin’s Michelle O’Neill.“I think perhaps that question is one to which Nigel, Sylvia, Michelle and I can probably agree the answer.”He recalled Queen Elizabeth’s visit to Ireland and a personal family moment which happened at the end of her tour of Cork’s English Market. “She turned to me and said ‘I’m going to cross the road and I’m going to meet the public’ and I turned to her security detail and I said ‘Is that OK?’ and she took me by the arm and said ‘I’m going to cross the road’.”Which she did.“And there was about 1,000 people on the other side and the first person she randomly chose to meet and greet was my grandmother.”Coveney said it was a total fluke but everyone accused him of organising it. When Prince Charles visited Cork last year, he also met Coveney’s 99-year-old grandmother, who raised her family in London.“Some of them are still the most English people I know, one of whom even voted for Brexit – the one I have a difficult relationship with – but he means well.”Metabolic political testingShould the Taoiseach’s personal stock continue to fall in the wake of his disappointing satisfaction rating in this week’s opinion poll, fitness fan Leo Varadkar might conclude that the decline set in around the time he was told his 40-year-old body has a metabolic age of 53.He was clearly quite shocked when the news was broken to him on RTÉ’s Operation Transformation programme last month. Leo is into exercise and eating well and he looks very trim and the picture of health.On the other hand, some of his less svelte political colleagues in Leinster House were hugely cheered by this turn of events.But Peter Fitzpatrick, Leo’s former colleague who left the parliamentary party last year over Fine Gael’s stance on abortion, is not one to rub the Taoiseach’s nose in it.On Tuesday, the Independent TD for Louth was on Michael Reade’s radio show on LMFM to talk about the Oireachtas gym, which he uses once a week.“I am not ashamed to say that I like to look after myself. I went and I done that metabolic test that Leo Varadkar done. Leo Varadkar is a 40-year-old man. The next thing, he has the body of a 53-year-old man” said the former manager of the Louth senior football team.“I’m 56, coming on 57. Smith’s Chemist in Dundalk there recently done a free test for anybody in the area. Myself and my wife went one Saturday afternoon. I went in and I didn’t know what to expect. I walked to the door, I could barely get in the door because me head was that big – they told me I’d a metabolic body of a 41-year-old man.”Not only that, but his wife, who is the same age as him, “walked in with a 41-year-old body as well”.Reade was intrigued. But what about the Taoiseach – isn’t he a very fit guy too? He goes to the gym and runs marathons and all that sort of stuff.Peter wasn’t about to throw any credit in that direction.“”Well, in fairness, I give him 10 out of 10,” sniffed the TD. “He’s the best person I’ve come across on social media – I don’t know how he does everything because he seems to be involved in everything.”Then Peter quickly moved on to say what he had started to say, and was obviously determined to say, before the interviewer cut in with his observations about the Taoiseach’s fitness level.“Listen, and I’m not trying to scaremonger: There’s a TD in the area at the moment and I spoke to that person recently – he’s 61 years of age. He went in and got the same test done as I did and he walked out and he told me he had the body of a 85-year-old person.”And who might that be, Peter? He didn’t name anybody, leaving it up to the voters to figure it out for themselves. It wasn’t too difficult.There are four other TDs in Louth. One is a woman (Sinn Féin’s Imelda Munster). That leaves Gerry Adams (SF) Fergus O’Dowd (FG), and Declan Breathnach (FF). Gerry has passed the 70 mark so he can be ruled out. The youthful looking Fergus, from the Drogheda end of the constituency, is the same age. So that leaves Breathnach, who is based in Dundalk.We contacted Declan to find out if he is the decrepit TD who is only trotting after Peter in the metabolics stakes.“It certainly isn’t me. Sure I’m only 60. My money is on Fergus O’Dowd” he insisted. “Anyway, it’s the brain that matters. You’re as young as you feel.”On the subject of metabolics and Peter Fitzpatrick, Declan, who is Fianna Fáil’s spokesman on cross-Border co-operation had this to say: “It would be great if he engaged his body with the people of Louth as much as he moves it in the gym. Maybe Peter is hoping I might fall off my perch and give him a better chance of re-election.”Donkeys and elevensesWe hear some of Shane Ross’s cabinet colleagues were less than pleased when they heard about his “donkey” outburst in the Dáil on Thursday.Hence his swift apology.He seemed particularly irritated by Sinn Féin’s Imelda Munster and her Brexit related questions, although their testy exchanges are par for the course.But Shane, aka Winston Churchtown, was stung by her criticisms of him at the previous week’s Transport Committee meeting when she expressed her incredulity that he was unable to attend due to non-specific “pressure of work”.It was reported in this column that she subsequently saw him taking a topical issue in the Dáil while the committee was still in progress and witnessed him afterwards greeting a party of schoolchildren on a tour of Leinster House.Fianna Fáil’s Robert Troy speculated that he was probably in the Member’s Bar enjoying his elevenses that morning.Which turned out to be true.In the Dáil, Winston told Imelda her performance wasn’t a patch on the contributions from two of her colleagues who were like “thoroughbreds” while she was “like a donkey at the last race, at the last fence”. Out of earshot, near the Ceann Comhairle’s desk, he then accused her of telling this column about his “elevenses”.However, let she who is without sin cast the first stone.Imelda was caught out herself, at the same meeting she excoriated the minister for missing. The Louth TD, along with colleagues, posed some tough questions about the rural transport system to witness Anne Graham, chief executive of the National Transport Authority.As the meeting drew to a close, Anne Graham said to the chairman: “I can deal with Deputy Munster’s questions, if you like.”But Imelda, having kicked up quite a fuss when asking them, had already left.The Chairman was quite keen for this to be noted on the record."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3819561.1552075767!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"technical solution could be piloted during post brexit transition period","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritain’s prime minister, Theresa May, on Friday when she called on the European Union for “one more push” to strike a compromise on Brexit. Photograph: Christopher FurlongAFPGetty ImagesTechnical solutions could prevent a hard border after Brexit if there was more trust and goodwill between Britain and the European Union, Westminster’s Northern Ireland Affairs Committee has claimed. The committee’s report on the Northern Ireland backstop concludes that a technical solution could be designed, trialled and piloted within the 21-month transition period after Britain leaves the EU.“Time is running out to reach common ground. There should be no attempt to use the Border as a lever or as a way of securing political advantage,” the committee’s chairman, Conservative MP Andrew Murrison, said. “Mistrust over the backstop protocol has been heightened by lack of clarity on what exactly constitutes a ‘hard border’. My committee is calling for clarification of the term in a legally explicit way to ensure both parties share the same understanding of how the backstop can be avoided. My committee took good evidence to suggest that technical and systems-based solutions to ensure the border looks and feels as it does today are doable, but they require trust and goodwill.”AgainstTwo members of the committee, Independent Unionist Sylvia Hermon and Labour’s John Grogan, voted against adopting the report. The members who voted in favour were the DUP’s Ian Paisley, Jim Shannon and Gregory Campbell, Labour’s Kate Hoey and Conservatives Nigel Mills and Maria Caulfield.The EU has dismissed proposals for a purely technical solution to the Border as untested and critics have described such ideas as “unicorns”. The report acknowledges that such solutions are not in place on any border anywhere in the world.“This is not a simple, quick-fix solution and implementing it in Northern Ireland would represent a world-first. The balance of the evidence suggests that, far from being a ‘unicorn’, such a solution is possible and that it could be designed, trialled and piloted within the 21-month implementation period, which would be a substantial achievement. The key obstacle is the lack of trust and goodwill between negotiating parties rather than the absence of systems and technologies. It is not a promising start for the next phase, the determination of the future trading relationship,” it says.StrugglingThe report is published as British and EU negotiators are struggling to reach agreement on changes to the backstop ahead of next Tuesday’s House of Commons vote on the Brexit deal. Speaking in Grimsby on Friday, the prime minister. Theresa May, said the changes she was seeking did not diminish her government’s determination to ensure that the Border remained open.“The BelfastGood Friday agreement was a landmark achievement for the UK government, the Irish Government, and the political parties in Northern Ireland. It brought peace to our country after many years of tragedy. The people of Northern Ireland are our people and their security and well-being is our security and well-being,” she said.“But just as MPs will face a big choice next week, the EU has to make a choice too. We are both participants in this process. It is in the European interest for the UK to leave with a deal.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

He feels any UK extension would have to be conditional on a satisfactory explanation from May  as to what she will do with the extra time. Photograph: Reuters The prospect that the UK will seek an extension to the Brexit negotiation process, whether or not a deal can be sealed by British prime minister Theresa May in the next few days, has risen significantly.Ambassadors from the other 27 EU states have begun to consider the ramifications of what will be far from an automatic process. An extension under article 50 prior to the UK’s departure may be requested by the UK, but an extension and its duration must be approved unanimously by the 27 – the simple act of the House of Commons next week demanding more time will not make it happen. Under one scenario, the process is likely to be straightforward and uncontentious. Should May secure support for the withdrawal agreement and seek time to pass the implementing legislation – what has been called a “technical” extension – then approval from the 27 is likely to be easily forthcoming. However, what makes ambassadors and EU leaders nervous is the likelihood of a demand from the UK in the event of May being defeated of more time either to renegotiate a deal or to put the issue to a second popular ballot. France’s President Emmanuel Macron has publicly made clear what many leaders feel, that such an extension would have to be conditional on a satisfactory explanation from May – who is increasingly distrusted in Europe – as to what she will do with the extra time, and that it will result in a definitive decision about UK membership one way or another. Such an assurance will be far from easy as May has clearly not got control of her parliament. And leaders have seen how MPs have been willing to run down the clock to defer decisions, and fear that an extension will simply allow further indefinite prevarication. Financial yearThere are different views about how long any conditional extension might be, with most, including Ireland, favouring only two to three months, while Germany is reported to have suggested nine months to the end of the financial year. A suggestion for a 21-month extension – effectively to the end of and replacing transition – is reported to have been floated by European Commission secretary general Martyn Selmayr, but is widely seen as a ploy to scare Brexiteers into voting for the withdrawal agreement for fear that Brexit might be indefinitely postponed. One major complicating factor is the European Parliament elections due on May 23rd. The prospect of having to contest these if the UK is still a member, if only to elect very temporary members, fills British politicians with dread – not least because the board could potentially be swept by Brexit-supporting candidates, further destabilising the mainstream parties and injecting a dangerous new dynamic into the incomplete Brexit process. Should the UK’s extension to article 50 last beyond May 23rd, or more significantly July 1st, the treaty requires that MEP elections take place in the UK. It is argued by some that were these not to take place the new parliament – which will meet for the first time on July 2nd – might be deemed by the courts to be improperly constituted, and if so its acts might all be declared illegal.Yet while all are agreed that the elections are mandatory for the UK if it is still a member, the legal services of the EU institutions have come to a common, less cataclysmic interpretation. They agree that to suggest that one member state should be able hold the parliament hostage by refusing to conduct elections would be so absurd as to be legally unarguable. British limboThat means crucial early tasks for MEPs – such as approving a European Commission president and interrogating a new batch of nominated commissioners – should be able to carry on uninterrupted despite the British limbo. Ultimately, however, the courts would almost certainly be asked to decide the issue, if only by disgruntled voters in the UK deprived of their vote. Former Ukip leader Nigel Farrage is said to already have briefed his lawyers. Should the UK decide not to contest the polls, it is likely that after July 2nd the commission would, as the defender of the treaty, be under an obligation to take infringement proceedings to prove the UK was responsible for depriving citizens of their rights. Some have argued the alternative to the UK conducting elections would be for the British government to simply nominate people to fill the vacancies, as happens at present in the gap between new states joining, most recently with Croatia, and the next European election. Not so, say EU lawyers.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches. See more here.

With more than 31,000 images posted, residents say Rue Crémieux, in the 12th arrondissement, near the Bastille, is becoming “the most Instagrammed street in Paris”.Antoine, a member of a neighbourhood association lobbying for gates to protect their privacy, said: “It may be a photographer’s paradise but for us it’s turned into hell here. At weekends we often get 200 people outside our windows. Our dining table is beside the window, and there are people just outside taking photos — rappers who take two hours to film a video under our windows or hen parties with people screaming for an hour. Frankly, it wears you down.”Alexandra, a student, said she went to Rue Crémieux to pose after seeing it on social media. “Influencers come here, they give the name of the street, so people following them also come.”A woman takes a photo of the colourful houses in Rue Crémieux where residents have asked for gates to be installed to keep tourists awayAnother young woman, Françoise, who also came to take photos, said most of those taking selfies did not realise how they were invading other people’s privacy. “The houses here are very different from most Paris architecture, so it’s unusual and interesting, but you tend to forget that there are actually people living here and it can be annoying for them.”Anne, another resident, said she did not mind a small number of people posing in the narrow street, but it had got out of hand. “Hundreds come every Saturday and Sunday and they seem to think it’s a public space and they don’t have to respect our privacy.”Antoine added: “It’s not too bad on weekdays when it’s mainly tourists who aren’t too annoying, but when the crowds come in at the weekend it gets unbearable.”A woman limbers up in a doorway on Rue Crémieux He puts up barricade tape every day to keep people away from his pastel blue house. Antoine and other members of the residents’ association have approached the 12th arrondissement town hall. “We want them to close the street, at least at the weekend and in the evening after a certain time. This is something that is done in private streets in Paris that have gates.”It is unclear if the local authorities will agree to turn Rue Crémieux into a gated community, however.

Once detected, separate instruments will define whether it sits in the so-called Goldilocks Zone, neither too hot, nor too cold for liquid water to form.Finally, researchers will study the chemical make up of the atmosphere, hunting for signs of gases like methane which could indicate that life is thriving on the surface.Mr Skidmore said: “Work to discover Earth-like planets around other stars may eventually lead to us answering the question of whether extra-terrestrial life exists.”Astronomers have so far found over 3,000 planets beyond our Solar System, but none, as yet, has been shown to be truly Earth-like in terms of its size and distance from a Sun similar to our own.  The new observatory, which launches in 2026, will be able to go further, looking not just for the planets themselves, but also evidence of life. The project is led by the European Space Agency but the suite of instruments will be designed by the University of Warwick.Professor Don Pollacco, University of Warwick, which leads the PLATO Science Management Consortium, said: “These planets will be close enough to facilitate a historic search for signs of life in their atmospheres using the next generation of large telescopes. “For the first time we will start to understand if life exists beyond the solar system.”The UK Space Agency also announced a further £7 million funding for a space weather mission to learn more about the dangers posed by the solar wind.The Solar wind Magnetosphere Ionosphere Link Explorer (Smile) mission will study the powerful ejections from the Sun which interact with the Earth\u0027s magnetosphere, and can potentially crippled satellites, power grids and communications networks.Space tourism: 10 ways you can leave planet EarthRecent research by Oxford University suggested that an intense solar storm could leave Britain with £16 billion worth of damage. The most severe incident - known as ‘the Carrington Event’ - happened in 1859, shorting  circuits, starting fires and causing the Northern Lights to dance in the sky as far south as Hawaii.In 1989, a geomagnetic disturbance caused a voltage collapse of Canada’s Hydro-Québec power grid, leaving six million inhabitants without power for nine hours and in 2005, X-rays from a solar flare disrupted the GPS system for about 10 minutesThe new UK funding will be used to develop a Soft X-ray Imager instrument, which will be designed by University of Leicester, University College London and the Open University, ahead of launch in 2023.Prof Graziella Branduardi-Raymont, Smile mission Co-Principal Investigator at UCL Mullard Space Science Laboratory, said: “Space weather remains one of the biggest risks facing humanity and Smile will make a fundamental contribution in furthering our scientific understanding to help mitigate it.”Professor Paul Monks, Pro-Vice-Chancellor and Head of College of Science and Engineering, University of Leicester, added: “SXI will be the first instrument to provide true global imaging of the solar wind exchange process within the magnetosphere. “The results of which will have meaningful implications for safeguarding our environment on Earth.”Announcing the funding at the start of British Science Week, Mr Skidmore added: “These two exciting space missions are brilliant examples of the UK’s space industry’s innovation and expertise.“Space weather – such as solar wind – is a potential threat to our communications systems here on Earth so this research examining how the wind interacts with our planet’s electromagnetic system.”Please review our commenting policyActor Jussie Smollett indicted on 16 counts after being accused of staging racist attack on himselfMargaret Thatcher\u0026#39s fascination with alternative medicine revealed in correspondence with Barbara CartlandArchive papers reveal Margaret Thatcher\u0026#39s dismay at Nigel Lawson\u0026#39s threat to resignMedical equipment and internet fails as Venezuela is plunged into darkness during blackoutWill ministers\u0026#39 new legal duty of care on tech giants protect children from online harms?Exclusive: Jeremy Corbyn warned 10 Labour frontbenchers could quit if he backs second referendumExclusive: Social media firms to be placed under statutory duty of care  to protect children from online harmsDeutschland 86 review: the hit Eighties geopolitics drama is back and still a glorious treatSinging \u0026#39I Vow To Thee My Country\u0026#39 makes inner city pupils feel proud to be British, says headteacherComment: You need to be relentless to crack down on violent crime Celebrity Apprentice for Comic Relief episode 2 recap: Rachel Johnson\u0026#39s bullish as balloons burst -

I knew that a whale had come and taken me and I I instinctively held my breath, assuming that it would e down again and spit me out somewhere in the depths of the Indian Ocean.”Mr Schimpf had been snorkeling with two colleagues some 25 nautical miles off the coast near Port Elizabeth Harbour.Rainer Schimpf in the ocean with the Bryde\u0026#39s Whale The experienced marine conservationist and photographer was attempting to film a sardine run, when gannets, penguins, seals, dolphins, whales and sharks work together to gather the fish into bait balls.Keen to get the best shots, he had plunged into the centre of a swirling ball of fish.When the sea suddenly churned up, the group realised that something strange was happening.Out of the darkness loomed a Bryde’s Whale, shooting up from the depths, jaws wide open. In that split second Mr Schimpf found himself wedged, head first, inside the mammal’s mouth.“I felt enormous pressure around my waist which is when I guess the whale realized his mistake,” he added.“As the the whale turned sideways, he opened his mouth slightly to release me and I was washed out, together with what felt like tons of water, of his mouth, while the whale himself was swallowing all the fish in his throat.”Watching from a nearby boat were Heinz Toperczer, a photographer and Silke Schimpf, Mr Schimpf’s wife, who were forced to watch on in horror as events unfolded.As the ordeal lasted just 1.8 seconds, they did not register what happened until Mr Schimpf was back up and out of the water, still clutching his underwater camera.“Silke saw there was a foreign object in the whale but it was only when I popped up by the boat she realised it was me,” Mr Schimpf added.Rainer Schimpf, 51, has worked as a e tour operator in South Africa for over 15 yearsIncredibly, the experience barely knocked the wind out of him and after checking he had no injuries, he ed back into the water in search of the bait ball.“On our return in the evening Heinz checked his images and it was only once I saw them that I realized just how lucky I was to be looking at them,” he added.“Seconds decide if you become prey, seconds decide your survival and seconds are all that counts.”Mr Schimpf said it was “definitely not an attack,” adding: “It was It was going for the fish and I happened to be in the wrong spot.“I was collateral damage and I’m sure it was as frightening for the whale as it was for me.”Bryde’s Whales can reach lengths of up to 55 ft and weigh up to 30 tons.They hunt krill, shrimp, crabs, herring, mackerel, sardines and anchovies amongst other fish, lunging towards large swarms of prey and skimming the water surface for food.They live in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans and can be found traveling alone or in small groups of up to four.Jonah and the whale is one of the most well-known biblical tales. The prophet defies God and is swallowed by a whale in a violent storm.Whilst inside the whale, Jonah repents and is returned  to the shore.Actor Jussie Smollett indicted on 16 counts after being accused of staging racist attack on himselfArchive papers reveal Margaret Thatcher\u0026#39s dismay at Nigel Lawson\u0026#39s threat to resignMargaret Thatcher\u0026#39s fascination with alternative medicine revealed in correspondence with Barbara CartlandMedical equipment and internet fails as Venezuela is plunged into darkness during blackoutDeutschland 86 review: the hit Eighties geopolitics drama is back and still a glorious treatWill ministers\u0026#39 new legal duty of care on tech giants protect children from online harms?Exclusive: Jeremy Corbyn warned 10 Labour frontbenchers could quit if he backs second referendumExclusive: Social media firms to be placed under statutory duty of care  to protect children from online harmsSinging \u0026#39I Vow To Thee My Country\u0026#39 makes inner city pupils feel proud to be British, says headteacherComment: You need to be relentless to crack down on violent crime Celebrity Apprentice for Comic Relief episode 2 recap: Rachel Johnson\u0026#39s bullish as balloons burst -

Most were friendly\u0026nbspand willing to have a chat, and several shared stories. One, though, stood out resolutely as always not wanting to know.\u0026nbspWhile I knew left-wing MPs and was able to share a cup of tea or a beer with them, Jeremy Corbyn remained aloof. Attempts to engage with him came to nought.\u0026nbspIt wasn’t personal. I checked with colleagues and journalists at other papers, and he would not talk to them either.

The group lists its purpose as the following: “To increase awareness of issues surrounding the dairy industry and focus on economic issues affecting the dairy industry and producers.”It’s a memory that has stayed. Talk to business people and they cite their fear of John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor. Corbyn, they dismiss as lacking the intellect and robustness of his lieutenant. But that’s the point, as Bower makes clear –\u0026nbspCorbyn is the leader, the orchestrator, the politician who has travelled a long, singular road to the top. He may not have the academic qualifications, he may seem to lack gravitas and at times appear woolly. He is undoubtedly surrounded by people sharper and brighter than he is, like McDonnell. None of it matters. They answer to him.\u0026nbspThere is a fascinating section in Bower’s book that focuses on Corbyn’s economic beliefs. What makes it especially interesting is because it’s rare for Corbyn to expound on domestic policy –\u0026nbsphe’s much more at home discussing a conflict between socialist rebels and an incumbent administration in some far-flung territory.\u0026nbspCorbyn believes that the UK wealthy do not pay enough tax. Writes Bower, he would like a return to the James Callaghan era, when the country’s richest paid a top rate of 98 per cent tax on income. Bower tries to counter that with the correct assertion that the top 1 per cent of British taxpayers already contribute 27 per cent of the nation’s income tax take, and the top 10 per cent pay 59 per cent a higher proportion than the richest 10 per cent of Germany’s population pay.\u0026nbspSuch comparisons almost certainly count for little with Corbyn –\u0026nbspthe man who would rather sit on his own reading the Morning Star is not going to be easily persuaded, not least with a glance in the direction of what he must regard as the loathsomely financially corrupt and socially unjust Germany.\u0026nbspLikewise, when Corbyn proposed “people’s quantitative easing”, the printing by the Bank of England of new money sufficient to meet the government’s requirements he brushed aside the possibility that this would lead to hyperinflation, and repetition of what occurred in Weimar Germany in the 1920s, Zimbabwe after 2010, and more recently, Venezuela. He simply did not want to listen.\u0026nbspJeremy Corbyn should realise Labour’s heartlands want a Final SaySimilarly, he would like to recreate a new national investment bank pumping hundreds of millions of pounds into Britain’s motor industry. The route to prosperity “is a collective process between workers, public investment and services, and yes, often innovative and creative iniduals”. You can feel the hesitancy and reluctance accompanying the citation of that last grouping.\u0026nbspIt is true that in the 1970s, Britain did make cars. But the sector now is a shadow of its former self. Worse, Nissan will not be using Sunderland to manufacture its new X-Trail SUV, and Honda in Swindon has signalled its intention to shut completely.\u0026nbspIt’s as if Corbyn has failed to register the onset of globalisation, the closure of factories across the land caused by cheaper labour and greater productivity elsewhere, and the fact that a large measure of what success Britain has achieved economically in the last few decades is down to the growth of the City of London and financial services.\u0026nbspIn his eyes, the City was to blame for the crisis of 2008 and its aftermath. That may be so but he chooses to discount the explosion in jobs in finance and the success it enjoyed before and since. Indeed, without the City, the UK would be in far worse shape.\u0026nbspBut the rose-tinted spectacles of this class warrior only see romance in metal-bashing and the honest sweat and toil of the shop floor. Quite how he intends to deal with the advent of the likes of artificial intelligence, robots and 3D printing is not clear.Reading Bower, you’re left in no doubt that Corbyn wants to turn the clock back, that his solution to those problematic examples and awkward developments that upset his path is merely to ignore them. This makes him very dangerous indeed, hard to reason with, oblivious to criticism and\u0026nbspset in his ways. It’s a troubling account, one that should give every entrepreneur pause and anyone who works in business pause. I want to scream and tell Corbyn to follow current events in Venezuela, and examine the chaos and strife that have befallen that country. I would, I fear, be wasting my time.\u0026nbspChris Blackhurst is a former editor of The Independent, and director of C|T|F Partners, the campaigns, strategic, crisis and reputational, and communications advisory firmWe’ll tell you what’s true.

A street is marked “dark @ night” and another “hangout spot”. The groups are identifying what’s already available in neighbourhoods and what is desirable. It is part of the social action lab, a project with the British Council and the University of Central Lancashire to encourage Preston residents to become more active within their communities by offering them seed funding to develop projects.\u0026nbspThe social action lab, which brings together artists, community activists and residents, is exactly the kind of thing Ruth Heritage hoped to support in Preston when she opened the People’s Production Lab in November 2017. The next step is to turn the many businesses and artists\u0026nbspworking within the Lab into a cooperative, owned and run by the people who work there, to make it sustainable.\u0026nbspThe design secrets of the UK’s biggest cooperativeCould co-operative shops be the answer to expensive organic foods?Preston has become a testing ground for a new way to run a local economy. The “Preston model” is rooted in the development of cooperatives, or businesses owned by workers, rather than shareholders in remote locations looking to extract value with stocks and idends.Cooperative startups have been shown to be more resilient during times of economic stress. While 44 per cent of new businesses survive their early years, 80 per cent of cooperatives go on to thrive, according to a 2018 report on the cooperative economy by Cooperatives UK.\u0026nbspPreston Council has just announced up to £1m in funding to support the development of cooperatives in the area. The funding will come from Preston City Council, the University of Central Lancashire and the Open Society Foundations, which was started by hedge fund billionaire George Soros. It will create 10 new cooperatives, owned and run by workers in Preston, building on the work of community businesses with ambitions to become cooperatives, like the People’s Production Lab and others.\u0026nbsp“We want to provide equitable employment for graduates in the first instance,” says Mark Porter, a senior lecturer in web design at the University of Central Lancashire who is starting a cooperative called Preston Digital Foundation.\u0026nbspMr Porter believes working at the People’s Production Lab will provide the basis for cooperation between cooperatives, one of the seven basic principles of working in this way. “Our next steps are to complete the registration process to get the coop up and running in time for summer and the next cohort of graduates and enable us to start generating revenue.”Heritage started producing and commissioning arts and culture in Preston a decade ago under the name They Eat Culture. She began to imagine a fully-equipped creative space for the people of Preston, where digital businesses and artists could share resources and work together. In 2017, Michael Conlon, the manager of a local construction firm, suggested Heritage take on the multi-storey building at 55 Guildhall Street in the town centre. The building, previously used as offices by Lancashire County Council, had been empty since the departure of a faith school.\u0026nbspWithin a year, Heritage and They Eat Culture have transformed the commercial building into creative spaces. Peering through the windows, I see white walls of former corporate spaces\u0026nbspfilled with equipment for a\u0026nbspwood shop and tool library, a co-working space with desks and chairs donated by a local solicitor, a hack space with 3D printers and a sound studio with a green screen for video work. Art hangs from a washing line from the ceiling of one of the offices\u0026nbsp– now a screen printing studio. In the hallway, Heritage gets inside a makeshift photo-booth that went on tour with accompanying interview cards saying “talk to me about crime” and “talk to me about loneliness”.“There are artists studios and shared spaces in Preston, but we’re trying to evolve a way of creating shared facilities that people can use rather than inidual spaces,” Heritage says.Anthony King runs a startup screen printing studio called Priestown Press from the People’s Production Lab. “I was out of work for quite a while after some surgery,” King says. “My wife suggested I get back into art. The Lab has allowed us to expand and have the space to be artists. It’s subsidised, so it’s beneficial for artists who are struggling. There aren’t that many in Preston.”Priestown Press prints garments for street artists in Preston and London. Through the social action lab, King has been working on turning the studio into a community resource and a place for art therapy.\u0026nbsp“It’s evolving into a social enterprise,” King says. “Especially for mental health, art can be very therapeutic. Suicide is on the rise among men and younger people, so if we can do projects that get kids doing things, rather than keeping themselves to themselves, then it can only help.”Tom Stables is the chair of Digital Lancashire, a non-profit organisation that supports the digital economy in Lancashire. Stables says the area is already home to multiple agencies, software houses and creative enterprises. Digital Lancashire has worked with accountants and TV companies, helping them develop their digital clientele and acquire funding to expand.\u0026nbspStables is considering basing Digital Lancashire within the People’s Production Lab where it can nurture partnerships with other businesses. “Having the People’s Production Lab on our doorstep is terrific,” he says. “As well as being a place that our board meet, a number of our members have the space to grow and thrive.”Heritage talks breathlessly of plans for live storytelling projects, comedy programmes developing new talent, a community culture guide and a vegan pop-up experience. “I want there to be a lot of action on the ground,” she says. “Preston has been held back by being off the beaten track and by not having relationships with central government but the tide is turning. The time is now.”We’ll tell you what’s true. You can form your own view.At The Independent, no one tells us what to write.

Such an unnecessary change of CEO looks somewhat disrespectful to other shareholders of Sports Direct, but then, those who hold the stock must surely have already come to terms with Mike Ashley’s unorthodox style.”On Tuesday,\u0026nbspDebenhams\u0026nbspissued its fourth profit warning in quick succession.In February, the chain\u0026nbspreceived a £40m cash injection from lenders, allowing it to pursue long-term refinancing.However, on Tuesday, the group said “this process is likely to be disruptive to our business in the coming months”.Meanwhile, like-for-like sales in the first 18 weeks of the financial year dropped by 5.7 per cent, with UK sales down 6.2 per cent.We’ll tell you what’s true.

Norway has sought to project an image as a responsible environmental steward while pumping millions of barrels of oil and gas.Catherine Howarth, chief executive of ShareAction, said Norway\u0027s announcement showed that investors are growing impatient\u0026nbspwith oil exploration companies.Institutional investors are withdrawing their capital from oil and gas companies on the grounds that quicker-than-expected growth in clean energy and associated regulation is making oil and gas business models highly vulnerable.This announcement will put pressure on investors to ramp up their engagement with integrated oil majors ahead of the AGM season.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

He also called for the ouster of all but one of the Debenhams’\u0026nbspboard, with finance chief\u0026nbspChris Wootton stepping up to become acting chief executive.The\u0026nbspDebenhams\u0026nbspshares shot up\u0026nbspbefore falling back to trade 13 per cent higher at 3.5p, still a tiny fraction of their peak of £2 back in 2006.Sports Direct, which owns 30 per cent of Debenhams, said it would provide more detail on its rationale for the radical shake-up in due course.Under the proposals, Mike Ashley would take executive control of Debenhams, without having to stump up the cash to buy the 70 per cent of shares that Sports Direct does not own.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.

Such an unnecessary change of CEO looks somewhat disrespectful to other shareholders of Sports Direct, but then, those who hold the stock must surely have already come to terms with Mike Ashley’s unorthodox style.”On Tuesday,\u0026nbspDebenhams\u0026nbspissued its fourth profit warning in quick succession.In February, the chain\u0026nbspreceived a £40m cash injection from lenders, allowing it to pursue long-term refinancing.However, on Tuesday, the group said “this process is likely to be disruptive to our business in the coming months”.Meanwhile, like-for-like sales in the first 18 weeks of the financial year dropped by 5.7 per cent, with UK sales down 6.2 per cent.We’ll tell you what’s true.

They killed many of the 123 British soldiers and 42 Royal Ulster Constabulary police who died there\u0026nbspbetween 1970 and 1997. Described by British home secretary Mervyn Rees as “bandit country”, the area\u0026nbspwas so dangerous for British forces personnel that they only travelled by helicopter. \u0026nbspBritain Before Brexit: a portrait of Northern IrelandThose lethal wires linked to explosives are long gone thanks to the Good Friday Agreement (GFA) of 1998, but in a broader sense the 310-mile-long border that ides Northern Ireland from the Irish Republic itself constitutes a trip wire which, if touched or interfered with in any way, has the capacity to trigger a political explosion that could end 20 years of peace.\u0026nbspThe removal of the physical border with its hundreds of blocked and cratered roads and blown bridges, channelling traffic through a few heavily guarded military checkpoints, was an essential part of the GFA.Protestants and Catholics, unionists and nationalist communities, which each make up about half of the 1.9 million population of Northern Ireland, could choose to be British or Irish without either being able to dominate the other. A stable balance of power between the two was held in place by an elaborate structure of institutions and laws negotiated by the leading nationalist and unionist parties of the day and buttressed by the British and Irish governments\u0026nbspacting in cooperation along with the EU.\u0026nbspThis structure has maintained a hard-won peace for over two decades, but it is now crumbling under the impact of Brexit. The referendum of 2016 opened the way for – indeed made it difficult to avoid – the resurrection of the border as an international frontier between an Irish Republic as a member of the EU, with all its rules and regulations, and the UK determined to be outside it.\u0026nbspThe radicalism and gravity of what is proposed by the Brexiteers is masked by mumbo-jumbo about “backstops”, “hard borders”\u0026nbspand “max fac” (maximum facilitation) borders that will somehow be automatically monitored by technical gadgetry which, though\u0026nbspyet to be invented, will apparently be sure to make any human presence unnecessary.The debate about the “backstop”\u0026nbspin the UK ignores the political and demographic realities on the ground in Northern Ireland.Ryanair boss calls May and Corbyn ‘idiots’ and demands end to BrexitThe threat to a hard border is often portrayed as coming from dissident Republican groups that never accepted the GFA.But these are small, fragmented, under surveillance by MI5 and lack popular nationalist support. More likely are spontaneous protests by farmers and local people on the border determined to prevent an international frontier once again cutting through their neighbourhoods.\u0026nbspAll this stuff about bar codes and cameras is nonsense because only the good guys will obey them.\u0026nbspMuch of the border runs through land populated (on both sides) by a majority of Catholics and nationalists.\u0026nbspAny new barrier would probably in practice require the deployment of military force.After all, the EU is like a club which requires porters at the door to keep non-members out\u0026nbsp– or ensure that, if they do enter, they abide by the club’s rules and regulations. In the case of\u0026nbspNorthern Ireland, s at the gate would be customs and other regulatory officials, but these could not be stationed there in the face of local nationalist opposition without police protection and the police would not come without the deployment of the British Army, which\u0026nbspwould presumably operate from a network of fortified positions,\u0026nbsppotentially even\u0026nbspblocking many of the 300 roads crossing the border – as they did in the past.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbspThe “backstop” is portrayed as an insurance policy under which all of the UK would remain in the customs union if the UK and EU cannot agree some other way of avoiding a “hard border”. But the latter could not be recreated without reigniting the Northern Ireland conflict, something that neither nationalists nor unionists want to happen, but that might be brought about by the momentum of events, just\u0026nbspas it was in Northern Ireland in 1968-69.\u0026nbspSome supporters of Brexit argue naively that the UK government could solve the problem by allowing almost free passage of people and vehicles and relying on cooperation and goodwill to ensure that their passage, and the goods they carry, will be registered electronically.Feeney is scathing about such plans, saying: “All this stuff about bar codes and cameras is nonsense because only the good guys will obey them. The rest would cross the border from Cavan and Monaghan where there are no bar codes or anything else.”Cheap but illegal Brazilian beef and American chicken would thus flood out of the UK and into the EU through the unguarded Northern Ireland breach in its defences. The EU could not permit a trade deal with the\u0026nbspUK that allowed Northern Ireland to become a smugglers’ paradise.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.

For its devoted fans it has a symbolic value totally unrelated to its workability, its true cost or the glaring self-interest of its proposers, whereas non-believers see nothing but a deranged and costly vanity project.brexit is like a sitcom where at the start of the episode the main character tells a casual lie about being able to skye to impress someone and now they\u0027re at the end of the episode in a plane about to jumpBrexit is like if Farage \u0026amp Johnson said “May we make you an *amazing* apple crumble?” \u0026amp then 18 months later handed you a leaking bag of maggots \u0026amp offal.

Total constitutional constipation. Ironically Brexit also sounds like a constipation relief medicine.But the problem of the Irish border is not primarily about trade and commerce, important though these may be.What is really at issue here – and the “backstop” is unwittingly at the centre of this – is the shifting balance of power between the Catholics and Protestants on the island of\u0026nbspIreland.\u0026nbspBrexit may be isive in England but is even more so in Northern Ireland because it plugs into the 400-year struggle between the two communities, a historic confrontation which over the last hundred years has\u0026nbspgained its most visible expression in the island’s partition.\u0026nbspMany observers in Northern Ireland are frightened by the seeming carelessness with which the British government and the Conservative Party have presided over the rebirth of\u0026nbspthe Irish Question. They appear to ignore its toxic legacy as an issue that has bedevilled British politics from the First Home Rule Bill in 1886 until the partition of Ireland in 1921, and again during the 30-year conflict from the first Catholic civil rights march in 1968 to the GFA in 1998. \u0026nbspThe latter agreement was under pressure but was working until the Brexit vote in the UK reopened old issues and old wounds. Northern Ireland voted Remain by 56 to 44 per cent but sectarian isions have widened.Why looming collapse of cash as a means of payment is a Brexit issueJust how bad tends to be underestimated in Westminster because British politicians, aside from Tony Blair, have traditionally had a blind spot about Ireland until things go irredeemably wrong and it is too late to do anything about them. The same is largely true of the British media according to commentators in Belfast.“Those that covered the conflict 20 years ago catch on pretty quickly about what is happening here,” one local journalist told me. “Those that are here for the first time are completely bewildered because they don’t know what happened in the past.”\u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspPeople who live in Northern Ireland have an acute sense of how problems that had been neutered, though\u0026nbspnot resolved, by the GFA are stirring into life.“I am grappling with the idea of a hard border which I would call a Second Partition of Ireland,” says Tom Hartley, a Sinn Fein veteran and former lord mayor of Belfast. He is baffled by British actions that appear so much against their interests, saying that “they had parked the Irish problem, but now Ireland has moved once again into the centre of British politics”.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.

Neither the nationalist community nor Sinn Fein, which has won more than two-thirds of the nationalist vote in Northern Ireland in recent elections, wants to go back to war.Nationalists have done well out of the peace. Catholics\u0026nbspno longer face religious discrimination when it comes to jobs, housing and justice, as they did in 1968.Irish TV host tears up as she lists Troubles victims in Brexit warningSinn Fein are conscious that demographically the nationalist community is growing faster than the loyalist one:\u0026nbspalready 51 per cent of school children are Catholics compared to 37 per cent who are Protestants. Within two years, the Catholics may be the majority of the voting population, though this does not necessarily guarantee political power.I lived in Belfast between 1972 and 1975 writing a PhD about Joe Devlin, the northern nationalist leader in the first decades of the 20th century, at the Institute of Irish Studies which was part\u0026nbspof Queens University. These were the worst years of the Troubles. In 1972 alone some 479 people were killed, including 135 soldiers, and 4,876 were injured.Everybody in Northern Ireland has a lot to lose and not a lot to gain, but some of the most important struts of the agreement that established long term peace have been cut away by the British government in pursuit of BrexitI got used to the sounds of bombs and gunfire and the sectarian geography of Belfast became imprinted on my brain. Along with the rest of the population, I automatically calculated the real proximity of danger without giving the matter much thought.I once showed a visiting American publisher around the city and, years later, he told me that he had been struck by one moment during our tour when he had queried me about the route we were taking, saying: “I thought you said this street was dangerous?” And I had replied, as if stating the obvious: “No, I said that that side of the street was dangerous, but the side we are on is safe.”\u0026nbspAlmost everything is safe in Belfast today, though the sectarian boundaries are largely the same as they were 50 years ago.I drove through the site of Harland and Wolff shipyard that at its peak employed 35,000 men, almost all Protestants from east Belfast. Today it is the site of the Titanic exhibition which is, along with other developments, dwarfed by the enormous yellow gantry crane marked H \u0026amp W in giant letters. Housing is, and has always been, segregated in Belfast and east Belfast remains a Protestant stronghold, aside from a small Republican nationalist enclave called Short Strand pressed up against the Lagan river. It is protected by one of the many peace lines or walls in the city topped by metal staves.“They got higher when the Protestants discovered catapults,” said a local observer, who pointed to the grills over the windows and the slates on the roofs that look normal but are made out of metal so they do not break when stones hurled over the peace wall hit them.\u0026nbspI once had a shabby flat off the Antrim Road in north Belfast, but I could not remember the name of the street. This used to be a particularly murderous part of Belfast because of the jigsaw puzzle of Protestant and Catholic districts permanently engaged in low level war against each other, most often in the shape of tit-for-tat or retaliatory killings.“Get your retaliation in first,” was an old Belfast joke, though retaliation was not necessarily local. If a Catholic was killed in Short Strand where the Catholics were weak and outnumbered, then the retaliatory killing of a Protestant might be arranged from Ardoyne, where the Catholics were strong and well organised.Likewise, if a Protestant UDR (Ulster Defence Regiment) soldier was shot by the IRA in County Fermanagh 70 miles to the west, there might be a tit-for-tat revenge murder of a Catholic in Belfast.\u0026nbspPeace may have come but militant commemorative murals showing fallen heroes and historic scenes on the side walls of houses are repainted every few years.“The Republican ones became rather ethereal a few years ago, but now they are showing more guns,” commented a friend. One enormous mural on a wall in the Ardoyne shows a wounded James Connolly, the socialist leader, in the GPO in Dublin during the Easter Rising in 1916. \u0026nbspDerry Girls and MPs stage Northern Ireland abortion protestWhy abortion remains illegal in Northern IrelandMPs urge government to redraft new domestic abuse billElaborate\u0026nbspcommemorative shrines to fallen Republican martyrs, who died fighting the British security forces, are common all over west Belfast, the political heart of the northern nationalist community. But the British Army fortresses in the area have all gone, the places where they once stood used for public housing or community centres. The Falls Road, which\u0026nbspused to be one of the world’s most menacing streets, looks spruce and cheerful with fewer closed shops than most British cities.I had mostly lived close to Queens University during my three years in Belfast, but when I went back the houses along University Road had been demolished, which was no great loss, and replaced with better looking buildings. The pub where I used to drink, the Club Bar, had been replaced, so far as I could see, by a small Tesco store.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCould Belfast and Northern Ireland go back to the three-cornered battle between Protestants, Catholics and the British security forces which I had witnessed?Everybody in Northern Ireland has a lot to lose and not a lot to gain, but some of the most important struts of the agreement\u0026nbspthat established long-term peace have been cut away by the British government in pursuit of Brexit or because some in its ranks see the GFA as a Labour project that mistakenly diluted British control over Northern Ireland. \u0026nbspThe bits of the GFA that have been abandoned are important.\u0026nbspThe British government is meant to be neutral between unionists and nationalists so as to enable it to play a mediating role between the two communities. David Cameron and later Theresa May have shown their support for the unionists, a bias that became total when Ms May\u0026nbspbecame reliant on the DUP for her parliamentary majority.Similarly, the British and Irish governments were supposed to cooperate if local power sharing arrangements failed, as they have\u0026nbspbut the government has shown increasing hostility to the nationalists in the north and to any role by the Dublin government.The most destabilising factor in Northern Ireland today is the British government itself.We’ll tell you what’s true.

Norway has sought to project an image as a responsible environmental steward while pumping millions of barrels of oil and gas.Catherine Howarth, chief executive of ShareAction, said Norway\u0027s announcement showed that investors are growing impatient\u0026nbspwith oil exploration companies.Institutional investors are withdrawing their capital from oil and gas companies on the grounds that quicker-than-expected growth in clean energy and associated regulation is making oil and gas business models highly vulnerable.This announcement will put pressure on investors to ramp up their engagement with integrated oil majors ahead of the AGM season.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

With a TV turned off, it is easier to see dust or fingerprints on the screen – especially when the screen is large.Efforts to minimise the visual impact of wires trailing behind the TV have also been made previously, with high-end sets now shipping with Samsung\u0027s OneConnect box.Galaxy Fold: Samsung plans two more foldable phonesIt works by combining all the wires into one cable that can be threaded relatively tidily up to the TV.\u0026nbspSamsung already makes use of wireless power technology in some of its devices, including its flagship range of Galaxy S10 smartphones.There is no word yet on when a wireless television\u0026nbspmight be released and Samsung does not comment on rumours surrounding unreleased products.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It is now\u0026nbspcounting on SpaceX and Boeing to start launching astronauts this year.\u0026nbspFriday morning’s splashdown was the final hurdle of SpaceX’s six-day test flight.Minutes earlier, Crew Dragon deployed its four parachutes successfully.“Everything happened just perfectly, right on time the way that we expected it to,” Benjamin Reed, SpaceX\u0026nbspdirector of crew mission management, said in a live stream from California.The test mission was a crucial milestone in a government programme that paves the way for SpaceX’s first crewed test flight. The flight is due to take place in July with astronauts Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken.SpaceX launches historic test flight for future manned missions“This really is an American achievement that s many generations of Nasa administrators and over a decade of work by the Nasa team,” said Nasa\u0026nbspadministrator Jim Bridenstine after the splash-down.Steve\u0026nbspStich, also from Nasa, said: “The vehicle is doing well. The recovery crews are out.”A boat was ready in the area where Dragon hit the Atlantic and was set to lift our the 16ft spacecraft using a crane. It will reach land with the craft on Sunday.The first-of-a-kind mission brought 400lbs of test equipment to the space station, including a dummy named Ripley fitted with sensors around its head, neck, and spine to monitor how a flight would feel for a human.The space station’s three-member crew greeted the capsule last Sunday, with US\u0026nbspastronaut Anne McClain and Canadian astronaut David Saint-Jacques entering Crew Dragon’s cabin to carry out air quality tests and inspections.Nasa\u0026nbsphas awarded SpaceX and Boeing Co a total of $6.8bn (£5bn) to build competing rocket and capsule systems to launch astronauts into orbit from American soil, something not possible since the US Space Shuttle was retired from service in 2011.The launch systems are aimed at ending US\u0026nbspreliance on Russian Soyuz rockets for $80m-per-seat rides to the $100bn\u0026nbsporbital research laboratory, which flies about 250 miles above earth.Bridenstine told Reuters the cost per seat on the Boeing or SpaceX systems would be lower than for the shuttle or Soyuz.Privately owned SpaceX was founded in 2002 by Elon Musk, who is also a co-founder of electric car maker Tesla.Additional reporting by agenciesBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It’s aiming for a morning splashdown in the Atlantic off Florida’s coast, the final hurdle of the six-day test flight. Saturday’s launch and Sunday’s docking were spot on.\u0026nbspNASA astronauts have been stuck riding Russian rockets since space shuttles retired eight years ago. NASA is counting on SpaceX and Boeing to start launching astronauts this year. SpaceX is aiming for summer.(For context, there\u0027s no way the US can do this at the moment: its hope was always the Space Shuttle programme, so when that was cancelled it was left without a way of travelling up and down. Now it has to rely on the Russian space agency, which it pays to take astronauts to the ISS.\u0026nbspIf this works, it could change all that, by completing a plan to let private US companies build the rockets and capsules that will allow them to fly to space again. So it\u0027s a big day for Nasa and space travel generally, as well as SpaceX.)We\u0027re not going to\u0026nbspsee\u0026nbspevery part of the mission because of a communications blackout.

But how do you get one?\u0026nbspAt the very least, you need to consider the following tips: \u0027Be discreet what\u0027s on tour stays on tour. Become familiar with shared understanding of anecdote, caricature, stereotype and jokes.\u0027Google them and look on\u0026nbspYouTube, if this is not your culture. For example, you may hear terms like this: Pond life  (string players).\u0026nbspGypos\u0026nbsp(short for gypsies)  violinists specifically\u0027.Ms\u0026nbspCarpos-Young\u0026nbspadded that\u0026nbspthe orchestra might be referred to as the boys and that the brass section were known as pub-goers.The conservatoire\u0026nbspdismissed her after students took offence at\u0026nbspthe comments.But the musician said the notes\u0026nbspwere meant to reflect\u0026nbspwhat they could expect in the real world and the tribunal judge appeared to agree, saying that her\u0026nbspwords had been taken out of context and were ironic in tone.I am pleased to have won so comprehensively, Ms Carpos-Young said after the ruling.\u0026nbspThe Royal Academy of Music have not once apologised. What foolish people to have wasted so much money on such an ill-advised course.\u0026nbspThe discriminatory decision to dismiss me has wasted a huge amount of money and was an incompetent attempt to enforce an unlawful process.Shamefully, this difficult year in legal battle has been entirely unnecessary.Some conservatoire students\u0026nbsphad described her comments as shameful\u0026nbspstereotyping and an\u0026nbspopen letter calling for a student-led working group on ersity was signed by 58 people\u0026nbspin the wake of\u0026nbspthe controversy.The knock-on effect of the weak decision-making by the senior management has been reputational harm to the Academy, and ironically this is what they were hoping to avoid, Ms Carpos-Young said.\u0026nbspIt is a matter of great personal sadness that I have had to bring the Royal Academy of Music to court, simply to ensure that those within it are acting fairly, honestly and with due regard for the law.I hope this case will warn other employers off arbitrary dismissals.The Independent\u0026nbsphas contacted The Royal Academy of Music for comment.Additional reporting by agenciesWe’ll tell you what’s true.

The UK has put forward clear new proposals. We now need to agree a balanced solution that can work for both sides.”The offer by Mr Barnier for a unilateral exit for Great Britain, but not Northern Ireland effectively lets the UK revert to the original EU plan for the backstop – which would have put customs checks on the Irish sea between Northern Ireland and the mainland.PM says Brexit could be cancelled in last-ditch plea to MPs- liveTheresa May should be offering Brexit concessions to EU, says Irish PMMay says \u0027we may never leave the EU\u0027 if MPs reject her Brexit dealThat plan was scrapped for\u0026nbspthe current UK-wide backstop after months of lobbying by the British side, but when it was taken back to MPs, they rejected that too – with Brexiteers worried that it would trap the UK inside a customs union with the EU.Michel Barnier laid out the proposals in a series of tweets on Friday afternoon – an unusual move but one which came after Ms May’s speech which challenged the EU to give ground.“The EU commits to give UK the option to exit the single customs territory unilaterally, while the other elements of the backstop must be maintained to avoid a hard border. UK will not be forced into a customs union against its will,” he said.He added that the\u0026nbsparbitration panel already included in the withdrawal agreement can,\u0026nbsp“under Article 178 of the withdrawal agreement, give the UK the right to a proportionate suspension of its obligations under the backstop, as a last resort, if EU breaches its best endeavoursgood faith obligations to negotiate alternative solutions”.Gentiloni: \u0027Brexit biggest mistake by a European country since war’He said the bloc would also “give legal force to all commitments from the January letter from the European Council president and European Commission president through joint interpretative statement”.“The EU will continue working intensively over the coming days to ensure that the UK leaves the EU with an agreement,” he concluded.In her speech in Grimsby on Friday, the prime minister turned her fire on European leaders demanding they make a move to get the Brexit negotiations moving again.She said: “European leaders tell me they worry that time is running out, and that we only have one chance to get it right. My message to them is: now is the moment for us to act.“We have worked hard together over two years on the deal. It is a comprehensive deal that provides for an orderly exit from the EU, and that sets a platform for an ambitious future relationship.“It needs just one more push, to address the final specific concerns of our parliament. So let’s not hold back. Let’s do what is necessary for MPs to back the deal on Tuesday.”On that day the House of Commons will again vote on Ms May’s Brexit deal – after rejecting it last time by a historic margin of defeat. If the agreement is rejected again the government has promised to give MPs votes on whether to rule out a no-deal Brexit, and whether to extend article 50. These votes are expected on Wednesday and Thursday of this week respectively.Polling commissioned by The  and conducted by Ipsos MRBI shows Northern Irish votes overwhelmingly reject a hard Brexit, and that 67 per cent think the DUP is doing a bad job of representing Northern Ireland in\u0026nbspWestminster.\u0026nbsp69 per cent of Northern Irish people – including 57 of those with a protestant background, say they are dissatisfied with DUP leader Arlene Foster. Notably, more voters favour checks on goods between Great Britain and Northern Ireland than do\u0026nbspchecks at the Irish border.Irish prime minister Leo Varadkar\u0026nbspsaid on Friday morning that it should be Theresa May offering the UK concessions if she wanted changes to the withdrawal agreement. He said talks were really “a question of what they are willing to offer us” and that he withdrawal agreement as it stood was “already a compromise” that had taken a year and a half to negotiate.We’ll tell you what’s true.

There can be no more playing for time.”EU says Britain can leave backstop but Northern Ireland must stayHowever, he also insisted Labour was not “obsessed” by Brexit like other parties – pointing to poverty and climate change as the issues that really matter.Created with Sketch.Brexit deal vote: Opposing groups of protesters gather by parliament Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.An anti-Brexit protester adjusts her pro-EU wig A message to Jeremy Corbyn in support of a people’s voteA mock Titanic captained by Theresa May heads towards an iceberg in a stunt by campaigning group AvaazProtesters of opposing sides are in close contact outside of parliamentPaintings of Theresa May and Jeremy CorbynFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside parliamentA pro-Brexit protester in Parliament SquareOpposing protesters share the space outside parliamentAnti-Brexit protesters stand on Westminster BridgeFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside parliamentAnti-Brexit protesters demonstrate outside the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester sets up outside parliamentAn anti-Brexit protester waves an EU flag on Westminster BridgeProtesters of opposing sides demonstrate outside parliamentProtesters of opposing sides stand near parliamentAn anti-Brexit protester adjusts her pro-EU wig A message to Jeremy Corbyn in support of a people’s voteA mock Titanic captained by Theresa May heads towards an iceberg in a stunt by campaigning group AvaazProtesters of opposing sides are in close contact outside of parliamentPaintings of Theresa May and Jeremy CorbynFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside parliamentA pro-Brexit protester in Parliament SquareOpposing protesters share the space outside parliamentAnti-Brexit protesters stand on Westminster BridgeFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside parliamentAnti-Brexit protesters demonstrate outside the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester sets up outside parliamentAn anti-Brexit protester waves an EU flag on Westminster BridgeProtesters of opposing sides demonstrate outside parliamentProtesters of opposing sides stand near parliament“Turn on the news at the moment and you’ll hear endlessly about constitutional issues. Brexit. Independence. It borders on the obsessive,” he told a conference in Dundee.“You don’t hear so much about the children arriving hungry to school or how the teachers at one nursery have had to arrange for Tesco and Greggs to donate their leftovers so they can feed the kids.”On climate change, Mr Corbyn said: “Fundamentally the destruction of our climate is a class issue.“It’s working class communities that suffer the worst pollution and the worst air quality. It’s working class people who will lose their jobs as resources run dry.“And it’s working class people who will be left behind as the rich escape rising sea levels.”Theresa May should be offering Brexit concessions to EU, says Irish PMMay says ‘we may never leave the EU’ if MPs reject her Brexit dealWhy can’t EU and UK find a solution to the Irish backstop controversy?Strip Home Office of immigration policy post-Brexit, report suggestsGordon Brown calls for year-long Brexit delayNevertheless, the dismissal of Brexit as for “obsessives” will alarm Labour MPs desperate for Mr Corbyn to swing indisputably behind the campaign for a Final Say referendum.He made only a passing reference to backing “a public vote to prevent disaster”, while insisting: “We favour a general election. We’ll push for our alternative plan.”The government is braced for another heavy defeat on Tuesday, having failed to win concessions from the EU to solve the Irish border controversy.MPs have then been promised a vote to veto a no-deal Brexit and, after doing that, a vote to delay it by extending the Article 50 process beyond 29 March.If the Commons rejects all options next week, it could leave space for the prime minister to have a third go at passing her deal – particularly if the alternative is a long delay imposed by Brussels.We’ll tell you what’s true.

Political editor Joe Watts explain whyClick to followIndy PoliticsGeoffrey Cox has found himself in the growing dictionary of BrexitismsThere was a bizarre moment in the Commons on Thursday when MPs appeared more concerned with an item of Tudor attire that covered a man’s dignity, than they were with governing the country.The codpiece, as modelled by Henry VIII in almost any portrait, is a sort of upturned pouch designed to shield and also draw attention to a gentleman’s crotch.But the word’s vague similarity\u0026nbspto\u0026nbspattorney general Geoffrey Cox’s surname\u0026nbspand to a particular legal device, means it has now entered the growing dictionary of Brexitisms that afflicts our news copy.Phrases such as “the Malthouse compromise”, “the Brady amendment”, “Canada plus, plus, plus”, “Maximum Facilitation”, “Max Fac 2”, \u0026nbsp“the backstop” and “the backstop to the backstop” will now be joined by “Cox’s codpiece”.It manifested out of Cox’s efforts to secure a new addition to Theresa May’s withdrawal agreement – he wants to use a legal instrument to create\u0026nbspa legally binding way for the UK government to say it wants Britain to leave the dreaded “backstop”\u0026nbsp(an arrangement the UK could otherwise be trapped in indefinitely if it fails to secure a future trade deal with the EU by 2020).Created with Sketch.

Total constitutional constipation. Ironically Brexit also sounds like a constipation relief medicine.But the device he is seeking to use is in legal circles called a codicil – which no-one really knew how to say beyond a courtroom until this month – and so it was replaced with “codpiece”.The phrase finally sealed its place in the Brexit dictionary when the man himself told MPs on Thursday: “It is government policy to achieve the necessary change in the backstopBrexit department’s top civil servant to retire just as UK to leave EU“That is government policy, that is the subject of the discussions that we are having. I would say that it has come to be called ‘Cox’s codpiece’. What I am concerned to ensure is that what is inside the codpiece is in full working order.”A canny way for the attorney general to avoid answering what had actually been quite a difficult question on the government’s approach.The problem for Mr Cox is that as far as anyone can tell at this point, it does not look like his negotiations to secure a codicil or an addendum or an annexe or anything else to\u0026nbspthe agreement are going anywhere.The EU – which is adamant that the backstop in its current form should remain untouched – said that there is no solution to the impasse in sight.If Cox cannot achieve an adequate change, the government will\u0026nbspnot get the support of Tory MPs and the DUP, and the government’s deal falls.The irony maybe that, given the intransigence in Brussels, whatever the attorney general does come back with in a bid to convince Tory Eurosceptics, may represent an altogether different item of biblical attire.

But given parliament looks set to extend Article 50, there’ll be further opportunities to secure support for Labour’s alternative Brexit deal.“This would bring the country together and defend jobs, rights and our security.”Labour’s David Lammy, a supporter of the anti-Brexit group Best for Britain, said: “It’s become clear today that there is no majority in the house for May’s deal, but also that Labour’s alternative plan cannot command a majority either.“In the key votes ahead of us we must extend Article 50 to take a catastrophic no deal off the table and use that time to put this decision back to the people to decide if they back the government’s botched Brexit deal or staying in our current EU deal.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

He said the UK had made no offer and should change its approach.Ms May has been unable to get the deal she negotiated through parliament because of concerns about it from all sides. She wants the EU to change aspects of the withdrawal agreement to make it more palatable to hard Brexiteers within her party.But speaking in Dublin the taoiseach\u0026nbspsaid the withdrawal agreement as it stood was “already a compromise” that had taken a year and a half to negotiate.“We’ve already agreed to a review clause so I think we have made a lot of compromises and what’s not evident is what the UK government is offering the EU and Ireland should they wish us to make any further compromises, we receive no offer as to what they would give us in return for any changes,” he said.Belgium tells companies to halt exports to UK after Brexit“It would require a change of approach by the UK government to understand that Brexit is a problem of their creation, what was agreed is already a compromise. They failed to secure ratification of this so it should be a question of what they are willing to offer us.”EU leaders have previously suggested the\u0026nbspgovernment should soften Brexit by renegotiating the future relationship, in order to gain Labour votes to pass the plan. Theresa May has rejected this approach – which would be likely to enrage hard Brexiteers in her party.The prime minister wants legally binding changes to water down the Irish border backstop. Her negotiators, who have been shuttling between Brussels and London all week, have reportedly proposed a new system that could end the backstop early if both sides do not endeavour to replace it with new arrangements.\u0026nbspMs May herself gave a speech in Grimsby on Friday afternoon, calling for “one more push” from the EU to get her deal over the line. The same day, foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt said people would blame the EU if it\u0026nbspdid not make concessions for the UK.\u0026nbspEU diplomats willing to comment on the talks have spoken of their frustration with the UK’s approach.“We are expecting a blame game after she loses the second ‘meaningful vote’ next week, so it looks like she is already preparing the ground for this,” one EU diplomat said.Meanwhile Mr Varadkar’s deputy Simon Coveney warned the prime minister not to listen to hard Brexiteers in her party.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.French gendarmes arrive for evacuation as prison guards block the entrance to the penitentiary center of Alencon, in Conde-sur-Sarthe, northwestern France, two days after a prison inmate seriously wounded two guards in a knife attack before being detained in a police raid. - The prison of Alencon  Conde-sur-Sarthe, where two guards were seriously stabbed on March 5 by a radicalized detainee, was blocked again on March 7 by about a hundred prison guards.

But we are still asking the SMEs and all other parties to wait. Do the necessary export to your customers before 29 March,” he told Belgian business newspaper De Tijd.Mr Vanderwaeren said larger industries “such as pharmaceutical companies and car manufacturers” had been “storing stock in the UK for months” to avoid having to get parts through after Brexit but that the vast majority of businesses were not well prepared with just weeks to go.Belgium’s main port of Zeebrugge is expected to have to deal with around a million additional import declarations and 4.5 million extra export declarations once the UK leaves the single market and customs union.Huge queues for Eurostar passengers after no-deal border checks trialThe warning follows chaos and hours of delays at Calais and the Eurostar terminal in Paris after French customs officers carried out a trial of the sort of checks they would have to impose under a no-deal Brexit.The customs chief also warned that many small businesses that dealt with the UK were simply not prepared to export and that it would be better for them to pause operations.“Our customs authority has written letters to some 20,000 companies that trade with the UK telling them they have to apply for an EORI number, which is necessary to be able to import and export,” Mr\u0026nbspVanderwaeren told the newspaper.“But today, three weeks before the Brexit, customs received only 4,700 positive answers. Customs has even set up a call centre that answers questions and calls companies to get them to register for customs licences.”France, the Netherlands\u0026nbspand Belgium have all hired hundreds of extra customs officers to deal with the potential disruption caused by the UK’s decision.Unless Article 50 is extended or revoked, Britain is set to leave on 29 March. If Theresa May’s Brexit deal is approved by MPs, the UK will enter a transition period and little will change immediately – but there are few signs the government has the numbers in the House of Commons to get it approved.If there is no extension of revocation and no transition period, the UK will crash out and the expected chaos at ports and airports will materialise.Created with Sketch.

The only other time it has been evoked by the British government was during a bitter dispute over the nationalisation of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company by Iran in the 1950s in a chain of events which ended with the overthrow of a progressive democratically elected government by Britain and the US.Created with Sketch.Revolution in Iran: in pictures Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A demonstration against the Shah in 1979Armed women on guard in one of the main squares in Tehran at the beginning of the Iranian RevolutionDemonstrators hold a poster of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, in January 1979, in Tehran, during a demonstration against the ShahIranian rebels pose with a U.S. flag they bayonetted upside down on trees at Sultanabad Garrison northeast of Tehran on February 12 2019A gun battle in Khorramshahr during the revolution, 1979Ayatollah Khomeini\u0027s supporters demonstrate in the streets of Tehran against the Shah among tear gas.

They are carrying posters of the Ayatollah Khomeini, the Iranian religious and political leaderThe Foreign Office has stated that Mr Hunt’s declaration of diplomatic protection was the first time it had occurred in “recent memory” but has not provided details of its previous use.The official response, so far, from the Iranian government has been from the country’s ambassador to the UK, Hamid Baeidinejad, who said in a tweet that the British move “contravenes int’l law”, adding that “Govts may only exercise such protection for own nationals.“As UK Govt is acutely aware, Iran does not recognize dual nationality. Irrespective of UK residency, Ms Zaghari thus remains Iranian.”The ambassador, who is not regarded as a hardliner, was restating the Iranian government’s position on dual nationality and his message is being seen by diplomats as measured and non-aggressive.But there are rising internal tensions in Iran. Donald Trump’s jettisoning of Iran’s nuclear agreement with international powers, and re-imposition of sanctions, has led to severe economic problems in the country, strengthening the hands of the conservatives who have long opposed the deal.Iran foreign minister Zarif back at work after withdrawing resignationThe isions led to the temporary resignation of the foreign minister,\u0026nbspMohammad Javad Zarif, who was the chief architect of the deal from the Iranian side. He has since stayed in his post for the time being, after President Rouhani refused to accept his resignation.British officials have privately stressed that there had been no liaison with the Rouhani government before the announcement of diplomatic protection. The decision was taken, Mr Hunt said, to demonstrate “to the whole world that Nazanin is innocent and the UK will not stand by when one of its citizens is treated so unjustly”.Diplomatic protection raises Ms Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s situation from a consular to a state-to-state issue and also opens the door for legal action, with the possibility of compensation if it is proved that she has been mistreated.Any case would be dealt with by the International Court of Justice in The Hague. But senior British officials wanted to stress that there is no desire to go down the legal route for the time being.“We are puzzled as to why this is being done, at this time. The UK knows that there are people in Iran in responsible positions who have been trying hard to resolve this matter. Jeremy Hunt has said this himself to a lot of people, we know,” said an adviser to the Rouhani government.Mossadeq, pictured in 1951 (Getty)“It is difficult to know what this will achieve in trying to get her released. But we know that some people (hardliners) are saying this is an attempt at outside interference which must be resisted. The tactic the British are using has bad colonial meaning, especially in Iran –\u0026nbspthis is unfortunate.”Diplomatic protection was exercised by Britain for employees of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company after it became the Anglo-Persian Oil Company – which later became British Petroleum and then BP – and was nationalised by the Iranian government of Mohammed Mossadeq. The government in London took the measure after failing in a case disputing the nationalisation at the International Court in The Hague.Mr Mossadeq, democratically elected, was subsequently overthrown by a coup organised by MI6 and the CIA, codenamed Operation Ajax. Many of his supporters were tortured and his closest associate, the foreign minister Hossein Fatemi, was executed by a military court of the\u0026nbspshah of Iran whose position had been strengthened by London and Washington.In December 1953, Mr Mossadeq was sentenced to three years solitary confinement by a military court, which rejected the death sentence sought by prosecutors, supposedly at the instigation of the shah and his western advisers. The former prime minister was, however, kept under house arrest until his death in 1967.Mr Mossadeq’s funeral was forbidden by the shah’s regime and he was buried at his home. He had wished to be laid to rest in a public cemetery among victims of political violence and state oppression.We’ll tell you what’s true.

Local people know their areas best.So we want communities to come forward with their own proposals for how this money should be spent to achieve the best outcomes.These will be ambitious plans that help support local economies to create more good jobs. From transport projects that will make it easier to get around, to digital connectivity to make doing business more efficient – the Stronger Towns Fund will help local communities to improve their areas and people’s lives at the same time.The UK’s towns have a great history, huge potential and – with the right help – a bright future ahead of them.Brexit was a call for change, and I have heard it loud and clear.

We’re having to stem the enthusiasm there.“Two or three more would be as much as we could manage I think [to avoid destabilising the Conservatives].”The comment come as leaders of The Independent Groupprepare for exploratory talks with the Electoral Commission tomorrow to step up plans to become a fully fledged political party.Separately Labour began moves to boot ex-Labour MPs among TIG such as Luciana Berger off their seats in cross-party select cmmittees.TiG leader Chuka Umunna last month said the breakaway group hope to become a registered political party by the end of the year.But this could now be brought forward given the interest from other Tory and Labour MPs and polling which shows a staggering level of support for the new group.Ex-Labour MP Chris Leslie told The Sun: “The public deserve a better choice than Corbyn or an ever more right-wing Tory Party.“With politics this broken, we must urgently explore a new alternative for people at the ballot box.”So far, each of the  TIG MPs have defected from either Labour or the Conservatives and decided to sit as ‘Independents’ in their constituencies.Under Commission rules a new party has to provide information about its finances and constitution and to appoint people to the roles of party leader, treasurer and nominating officer. Crucially it would also be able to accept much larger donations – allowing it to run electoral campaigns."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/NINTCHDBPICT000469203357.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"jacob ress mogg people have spoken on brexit","story":"Regardless of the constitutional norms or their previous votes or statements, the diehards of the Brussels Brigade blithely believe they can keep the United ­Kingdom shackled to the European Union.Three constitutional perversions have been used in this effort.The relationship between Government and Parliament is now disordered, with the House of Commons trying to do Ministers’ jobs.Collective responsibility has been abandoned so no one knows which minister speaks authoritatively for the Government’s position and, worst of all, the Referendum result, where .million people decided that we should leave, is put at nothing by the extremist ­Remainers.Next week will see this come to a head as there will be a series of Parliamentary votes to determine the future of Brexit.First, there will be another vote on Mrs May’s deal.In its current form this is unlikely to pass because of the backstop which ides the United Kingdom between Northern Ireland and Great Britain and could leave us indefinitely as a vassal state, where we have a mutual ­obligation to a superior state.Assuming this fails, then the second event would be a vote to stop a No Deal Brexit.Clearly some politicians have short memories because in ,  members of Parliament out of  voted for the law that led to March  being the date of departure, regardless of a deal or not.Cabinet ministers, who are now ­abandoning collective responsibility, voted for it, the Labour leadership voted for it, even Yvette Cooper voted for it.Yet these same people now pretend that such an outcome is an unimaginable ­horror.Even though removing the possibility of No Deal weakens the Government’s ­negotiating position and contradicts the law of the land, such a motion could pass but in itself would have no legal effect.This leaves the third vote on the issue of seeking an ­extension to our ­membership of the European Union.As yet it is unclear whatof time would be requested or what the purpose of such an extension would be.These key questions are left unanswered because the extreme Remainers do not just want an extension — they want ­reversal and see this as a first step.It is worth remembering that those who love the European Union prefer it to democracy and always have done.This is why so many other votes have been ignored in the past and why ­referendums are now so unpopular with the European elite.The Government has so far meekly accepted these developments, although Attorney General Geoffrey Cox is trying to achieve some apparently minor changes to the backstop.Instead the Government must reassert the constitutional norms.If the House of Commons will not accept the ordinary relationship between it and the Executive, then a vote of ­confidence ought to take place. If Theresa May were to win such a vote for a second time then there is no ­obligation for the Government to follow mere motions of the Commons.Similarly, ­ministers who cannot support Government policy are entitled to leave the Government, as the honourable recent example of George Eustice shows.Naturally, the Government must prove that it is committed to the referendum result, for that is the authoritative ­constitutional voice.No responsible government ought to allow the constitution to be subverted because of its own weaknesses. The ­conventions are there for good ­reasons and,ignored, confidence in the system that has served well for ­centuries will be damaged — with ­consequences that could include the rise of extremist parties. Failure to deliver Brexit would be a gt to Tommy Robinson.Fortunately, it is in the power of the Government, and especially of Mrs May, to deliver Brexit.  Votes in the House of Commons cannot override the law.If they could we would have arbitrary government and the law says we leave at the end of this month.The Prime Minister could simply refuse to ask for an extension or to move the ­Statutory Instrument that is needed to change the date. Mrs May may choose to fulfil or to break her promises to the electorate and will be held to account accordingly.Eurosceptics must similarly be guided by the electorate — it is our duty and obligation to those who trusted that the vote in  would be decisive and would be implemented.This makes it necessary to vote against the current deal as well as efforts to move the date beyond March .The people have spoken.

But Nato is responsible for the peace and freedom. And prosperity hasn’t found its way to, say, Greece, or the vast numbers condemned by the euro to unemployment.And it’s hard to swallow anyway from a man whose economy is flat-lining and his cities under siege from enraged, ­yellow-vested anti-EU protesters.Macron admits the EU has problems and speaks of the “European trap”. But, incredibly, it turns out this trap is “NOT being part of the European Union”.

All forbidden under the new rules.The Farmdrop episode is an early sign that there is more to the crackdown on so-called “junk food” than we have been led to believe.Last year, the Government proposed a ban on junk food adverts on television before pm, a ban on junk food being displayed at the entrance of shops or at the end of supermarket aisles, and a ban on junk food being sold at a discount.But junk food has no legal definition. It is a pejorative term used by campaigners such as chef Jamie Oliver to push their nanny state agenda.In practice, the legislation will apply to all food or drink considered to be high in fat, salt or sugar— and that includes the kind of food your grandmother would have approved of, such as butter and jam.The official definition of HFSS was drawn up over a decade ago, when Tony Blair banned junk food advertising on children’s television.A system was devised in which food products were given a mark out of , with points added for “negative” nutrients — such as saturated fat, sugar and sodium — and points subtracted for “positive” nutrients such as fruit, vegetables, protein and fibre.Calories are also counted as negative nutrients. If a food gets more than four points, it is classed as HFSS and cannot be advertised on children’s TV.The system was never intended to be a measure of “junk food” or “unhealthy food”. It was only supposed to distinguish “less healthy” food from “more healthy” food for the purposes of encouraging children to eat better.Nevertheless, the system has since been adopted by the Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, for his ban on junk food advertising on public transport.It could also soon be used to decide which products can be advertised before pm, which products can be included in discount deals and which products can be displayed in prominent areas of shops.In reality, the system sets the bar for “healthy food” so high that it condemns hundreds of everyday products as junk.Nearly all bacon, burgers, sweets, crisps, desserts and biscuits fail the test, but other products classied as HFSS include ketchup, mayonnaise , jam, honey, Marmite, soy sauce, mustard, gravy, stock cubes, butter and olive oil.I have never met anyone who thinks that raisins, sultanas, hummus, walnuts, pesto, olive bread, dressed salads and tomato soup are unhealthy, yet all would be covered by the Government’s proposed bans.So too would dried fruit, cereal bars, margarine, most tinned fruit, most yoghurts, nearly all cheese , many pasta sauces and one in four sandwiches.Asthis system were not puritanical enough, Public Health England is in the process of making it even harder for food and drink to be classed as “more healthy”.A new version will soon come into effect that will classy all yoghurt drinks, a quarter of pasta brands, a quarter of noodle brands, most high-fibre breakfast cereals,  per cent of coffee and  per cent of fruit juice and smoothies as HFSS.This will leave the Government in the absurd position of officially advising people to drink pure orange juice as one of their five a day while banning adverts for it because it is junk.Some snacks Public Health England recommends as part of its £.million ChangeLe campaign will be classied as HFSS, as will most of the soft drinks that have been reformulated with less sugar.Under pressure from the Government, and to the fury of many loyal customers, brands such as Irn-Bru and Lucozade have had their sugar content cut dramatically, and yet they will face severe restrictions on price and promotion under the Government’s plans.Looking at the range of food and drink products that are classied as HFSS, it becomes clear that what is being proposed is not so much a crackdown on junk food as a crackdown on food in general, with exemptions for raw ingredients and health food.Politicians and the public have been sold a pig in a poke by those who campaign against the meaningless category of “junk food”.When askedthey agree with a ban on junk food adverts that are targeted at children, most people say they do, but that is not what is being proposed.If they were asked whether they would support a ban on olive oil being advertised during the Channel  News, they might take a dferent view.We are sleep-walking into legislation that is far more extensive than most of us realise.Hysterical claims about junk food have been used as cover for tobacco-style regulation being rolled out across the food supply.The nation’s biggest and most important industry could soon be banned from advertising most of its products during daytime television, costing broadcasters tens of millions of pounds and lowering the quality of programming.The ban on HFSS products being positioned at the entrance, checkout and end of aisle will cause shopkeepers all kinds of headaches, and the ban on discounts, such as buy-one-get-one-free, could cost consumers hundreds of pounds a year.Surely a rethink is in order Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But he needs to remember who he is — and stop talking out of his backside.It is not the job of the Royals, living an immensely privileged le on taxpayers’ money and goodwill, to preach vacuous politics to children.We don’t know, though we can guess, where Harry gets hollow profundities such as “every blade of grass, ray of sun and raindrop is crucial to our survival”. But at least that does no actual harm.Unlike telling kids the media “distorts the truth”, “tries to manipulate the power of positive thinking” and should be ignored. Or to imply the young generation are morally superior to those who, for example, fought the war or suffered the bleak economic hardships since.If he wants to be a social justice warrior regurgitating fashionable conspiracy theories and hippie banalities, so be it.But we can’t help feeling Harry and Meghan are riding for a fall.LABOUR, to its shame, is finally being investigated for illegal anti-Jewish racism by the very equalities body it once set up.Only the BNP merited a similar probe.The Equality and Human Rights ­Commission suspects Corbyn’s mob “discriminated against people because of ethnicity and religious beliefs”.Decent members will be horried, says Labour MP Ruth Smeeth.Indeed they will. But in a snap election they will still campaign to put the anti-Semites’ chief in Downing Street.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The EU thinks, with justication, that MPs won’t allow No Deal so it feels under no pressure to make signicant concessions.Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief negotiator, is telling the UK thatit doesn’t like the backstop, it can have a Northern Ireland-only version of it — which the UK has already rejected. One minister fully briefed on the negotiations tells me: “We’re at ‘what the hell do we do ’ time.”But without a change to the backstop, Theresa May’s deal is going down to another heavy defeat on Tuesday.That won’t be the end of the matter, though. For the very next day Parliament will vote against leaving on March  with No Deal. Parliament will then almost certainly vote to request an extension to Article , the two-year process for leaving the EU.At this moment, the UK would be in the EU’s hands. As one weary No source admits: “They’d be in a position of being able to dictate terms.”It would be up to the EU to decide whether to grant an extension, how long it would be for and what conditions would be attached to it. How humiliating: This country’s future would be being determined in Brussels, not Westminster.The EU would almost certainly grant an extension. But what terms it would come with remains to be seen.What should worry those MPs who are voting against Mrs May’s deal because it is not a clean enough Brexit, is what Parliament would do with this extension. I understand that unless the Government indicates that it will allow the Commons to vote on ious Brexit options, an amendment will be tacked on to the extension vote to ensure that “indicative votes” are held.These votes would be on March  and the Commons would move to bind the Government to negotiate what it wants it to.Ministers would have to report back regularly to the Commons on the progress they are making. Mrs May might be in office, but she would not be in power. It is inevitable that the Brexit the Commons would mandate would be softer than Mrs May’s deal.So why, then, are so many Brexiteers not voting for her deal  Well, the problem is that many of them regard it as so flawed that they have no desire to rescue it. They would, in the words of one Cabinet minister: “Rather their hands be clean of all this.”But this isn’t PRACTICAL POLITICS. If Brexiteers won’t back Mrs May’s deal, then Brexit is ONLY GOING TO GET SOFTER.Is there any hope of avoiding this crisis  Today, it looks unlikely. But the DUP does want a deal.While they won’t accept the backstop as it currently is and were, in the words of one source, “not entirely happy” with the proposal Geoffrey Cox took to Brussels, they are eager for an agreement.If progress on the backstop was combined with a commitment from Mrs May that she would step down before phase two of the negotiations, then the deal might pass.I understand that a leading Brexiteer backbencher conveyed this message to influential figures in the Government this week. One normally loyal minister tells me: “If there’s nothing , that is the thing that has to work.”One outcome next week would avoid a crisis: Some progress on the backstop, Mrs May’s deal passing and a new PM coming in to do the next phase of the negotiations. All other roads lead to crisis.But right now, that is where we are headed.LABOUR will, officially, back a second referendum next week.But with as many as  Labour MPs opposed to the idea, it isn’t going to pass the Commons.Jeremy Corbyn has never been enthusiastic about a second referendum – he only backed one to prevent more defections to The Independent Group of MPs.Once he has gone through the motions of supporting one, he will feel free to pivot to other options.This was demonstrated by the fact he had a meeting with the Norway Plus group of MPs this week, who want the UK to stay in the EU single market.A soft Brexit has an obvious appeal for Corbyn. It would offer a solution to the issue while splitting the Tory Party.IT is now looking increasingly likely that the UK won’t be able to get anything on the backstop.“The EU are just not budging,” one of those intimately involved in the negotiations tells me.Bringing back a pretty much unchanged deal for a vote on Tuesday would lead to a heavy defeat for the Government, and probably by a three-figure margin.But there is another option being discussed in government. Gavin Barwell, the Prime Minister’s chief of staff, told ministers this week that one option was to bring to the Commons the proposal that the UK has taken to Brussels. The idea would then be to try to win a vote on that, to prove to the EU that such a change would get the deal through.Right now, one Downing Street source says, there is a “chicken and egg problem” as the EU doesn’t think that what the UK is proposing would get the deal through the Commons, and so doesn’t see the point in engaging with it.Some in government think that doing this would offer a way out of the votes on No Deal and an extension that threaten to create the bitterest Tory split yet over Europe.This strategy is not without risks. It isn’t certain that the Government would win this vote. There is also a danger that holding a vote on a proposal that has been rejected by the EU would end up looking absurd.But walking into a vote knowing that you are going to lose heavily is rarely a sensible governing strategy.ON Wednesday, Alan Duncan urged the Prime Minister’s chief of staff, Gavin Barwell, to have the Government whip against No DealMrs May’s deal is defeated next week.Duncan warned of an eruption from the “moderate” wing of the partythis didn’t happen. Barwell pointed out that Leave ministers have accepted a lot of compromises over the past few years.The exchange demonstrated how dficult the next week will be for the Tories. The votes that would follow Mrs May’s deal failing would make every previous Tory argument over Europe look like small beer.I understand the Government is looking to contain the row through a motion that would say the UK would not leave on March  without a deal, but would try to make clear that it was still an option after that.AS Mrs May was saying there was “no direct correlation between certain crimes and police numbers”, a leaflet from the Tories’ mayoral candidate Shaun Bailey was dropping on London doormats declaring thatthe party took City Hall they would hire , more police “Helping to bring an end to rising crime”.This pledge shows the position the Government has got itself into is politically preposterous.What is needed is more police to deal with the current crisis, then action to stop children from being drawn into these gangs.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Craig Courtice, who supports both Bristol City and Leeds United, was given a refund by the officials and was told his ticket was no longer valid. The -year-old from south Bristol said he has not been to a game for years as he mostly watched matches on television. But his love of the Yorkshire team as well as his local side means he has found himself barred from this Saturdays big game, following a review by both clubs of who had bought tickets for the game.  The match is the first complete sell-out of the season for Bristol City, as they face up to promotion favourites Leeds United in Citys battle to maintain their own play-off spot, reported Bristol Live.There has been isolated incidents of disorder at Bristol City vs Leeds United matches in previous seasons as Leeds fans were seen getting tickets in the three sides of the ground that were for Bristol City fans. Therefore this time, both clubs are determined to comply with league rules that no away fans should be in the home fans areas of the ground.   That meant City provided a list of people who bought tickets when they went on general sale online, who had never bought tickets online for Bristol City matches before. Mr Courtice, who last went to Ashton Gate stadium in the s, came up on that list. When that list was sent to Leeds United to cross-reference with their database, Mr Courtices name appeared as someone who was recorded as having been to a match at Elland Road before. Mr Courtice told Bristol Live: I am from Stockwood, I am a Bristol fan, and I am also a fan of Leeds United. But I havent seen Leeds since God knows when, for years and years. He explained that he bought the tickets as a celebration for being discharged from hospital after having surgery. I got a ticket at Dolman Stand - I was really lucky because there were only  tickets left at the time I bought one, he said. “I wanted to take my daughter, as she is a big Bristol City fan, but when I went back to get another they’d sold out.   Mr Courtice said he couldn’t understand why, or even how, his unusual dual support for both teams was an issue. He said that, sitting in among the City fans in the Dolman Stand, he would be cheering on Bristol City. “If Leeds scored I wouldn’t do anything. If Bristol City scored I’d applaud them. “I just thoughtthey had any evidence of me being a hooligan, or being involved in any kind of trouble before, then fair enough. But I haven’t been to a football match in years. I just watch it and support them from my armchair usually. “I couldn’t work it out. I did tweet something about the fact I’d got a ticket, so maybe they saw that.He suspected that Bristol City had researched his Twitter profile after he replied to a tweet from Leeds Uniteds official account saying I will be at Ashton Gate on Saturday but in with the City fans I will have to be discreet.A spokersperson from Bristol City confirmed it was not about the tweet however a cross-reference check of names showed that Mr Courtices name was not on Citys but was on Leeds Uniteds. “Our head of safety and security received credible intelligence that several hundred Leeds United supporters had managed to purchase tickets in the home end of Ashton Gate. “We provided a list of people who had never purchased tickets here before at Ashton Gate to Leeds United. They then cross referenced this with their database of supporters. “Once Leeds United had confirmed these people were on their database a decision was made to revoke all tickets attached to those bookings in accordance with English Football Leagueregulations. “The decision to revoke tickets for any match is not one which is taken lightly and we only do this once we have positive confirmation from the opposing club that iniduals are indeed on their database,” she added. Scores of tickets have been revoked this week following that review and on Friday went back on sale at Ashton Gate - but only to season tickets and Forever Bristol members.

You know what, I feel using terms like “minority ethnic” to describe people are just as isive. They have become an acceptable way of reminding people that they are dferent, not the norm and by extension less than what is considered the mainstream.  BAME and BME are politically correct acronyms that sprung up in recent years to allow politicians, squeamish about using the word black, to have a get out of jail free card. But can you tell me what it actually means  Is it Black and Minority Ethnic  If so, where do Asian people fit into this description. Or is it Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic. In this case, who are the minority ethnic people that we are constantly trying to point to as being dferent  You come from the party of Anne Marie Morris, the Conservative MP who in  used the N-word in during a discussion about Brexit and Boris Johnson who has referred to black people as “piccaninnies” and having “watermelon smiles”.

That means the other provisions would have to stay - a move critics say will ide Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK. Furious Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay hit back on Twitter within minutes, tweeting: With a very real deadline looming, now is not the time to rerun old arguments. The UK has put forward clear new proposals. We now need to agree a balanced solution that can work for both sides.  A DUP source tonight said they would not back any deal which saw a customs border established in the Irish Sea. Weve been clear from the very start, anything which would see Northern Ireland treated separately from the UK will not get our support and we will be reiterating that to the PM A Tory Brexiteer told the Financial Times: Do they think we are stupid  Tory MP Paul Masterson tweeted: An exclusively NI backstop would be far more unacceptable. Round in circles we go.   And its something the current draft enables anyway . So we now have the EU presenting old solutions it knows we wont accept, which is exactly what its been criticising UK for doing. Askedthey had any reaction to the EUs offer, a Brexiteer source said: Not really. They’re laughable. We laugh at them. Mr Barnier issued the ultimatum as he slammed the blame game just hours after Theresa May appeared to blame the EU in a major speech. Mrs May urged EU leaders to make just one more push and her Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned them not to inject poison into the UK-EU relationship. But Mr Barnier told reporters in Brussels: The EU stands united. We are not interested in the blame game. We are still working.  It came as Theresa May attempted to pin the blame for the Brexit chaos on the EU, Jeremy Corbyn and anyone  except herself. The Prime Minister warned wavering MPs the UK could stay in the EUthey rejected her deal again on Tuesday. She told workers in Grimsby: “If MPs reject the deal, nothing is certain. It would be at a moment of crisis. “MPs would immediately be faced with another choice - either we leave the EU with no deal on March  or we delay Brexit and carry on arguing about it.” But despite warning that no-deal would fire consequences she refused to say she would whip her MPs to vote against ither deal fails to pass. Despite weeks of heated negotiations Mrs May did not reveal any substantial changes to the Irish backstop. Speaking directly to EU leaders she urged hem to back the changes she needs to appease the DUP and her own back bench MPs. “My message to them is: now is the moment for us to act,” she said. Instead I’m the face of a second historic defeat she said attempted to pay the blame the deal’s likely failure on Jeremy Corbyn. She said that the Labour leader was “not really interested in finding a solution” - instead accusing him of trying to stop Brexit happening. She added: “I have repeatedly offered him another meeting to follow it up. “In , after multiple requests from my office, he has offered just one hour over the last five weeks when our teams could meet. “And we now know why. “Because despite his promise at the last election to deliver Brexit, he now supports holding a isive second referendum that would take the UK right back to square one. “If we go down that road, we might never leave the EU at all.” "},{"url":null,"title":"international womens day think women","story":"NewsopinionOn International Womens Day, think about the women you dont hear fromWe hear from men all the time.

When Karen Bradley first says that British soldiers who shot unarmed civilians were following orders, then that she doesnt think that, and finally that she doesnt even believe herself, an observer from out of space could be forgiven for thinking that,she was the best person we could find to juggle with highly-explosive Northern Irish sensitivities, the whole species is heading for the blender.Were you to inform E.T. that Andrea Leadsom thinks British Muslims are the concern of the Foreign Office and Amber Rudd implies darker-skinned people are that way because of marker pens, hed be on his spaceship and getting to a safe distance before you could add that Katie Prices highly-monetised balloon boobs have somehow landed her poundm in debt.Butyou despair of the quality of womanhood in general, you are forgetting something. Because just as they have throughout human history, the women who grab our attention do so because when theres something wrong with them. Rudd is stuck in the s, Leadsom is so th century she lacks only a crinoline and marriageable daughters, and Bradley, plainly, is a malware-infected bot.Theresa May is in the news not because shes spent  years holding her self-immolating party together and dealing with the most dficult political crisis of our letimes, but because men arent happy with how shes doing it. Hillary Clinton is a prominent failure, rather than a ceiling-smashing lawyer who came within a whisker of the White House and was considered such a threat by the men of Russia and Wikileaks that they conspired against her personally with a man who lived in a golden phallus. Oprah Winfrey is fat. Ivanka Trump says stupid things. Angela Merkel isnt much of a looker. Name me ONE GUY about whom you could say all that. But the fact womanhood is a mixed-ability class is not in itself reason to despair. Masculinity has its fair share of fat, stupid, ugly people who do things wrong all the time, and unlike women they rarely apologise for it.Trump expressed no regret for employing criminals, praising Nazis or groping women. Putin murders his critics rather than listen to them. Kim Jong-Un never worries about the size of his cheese-saturated, un-fatshamed bum.We hear from men all the time. We hear from prominent women, too, about apologies, hopes, and good ideas that, very shortly, a man will re-announce like it was his all along. We do not hear from the others.  If human beings were left to procreate naturally, the world would be about % female. Instead its .%.Thats million women. Missing, presumed dead.They are missing because they were aborted for not being boys, killed after birth for the same reason, denied health care, refused education, raped, murdered, brutalised, and left to die from disease and malnutrition. They include Jodie Chesney, stabbed to death on a park bench aged  in an apparently motiveless attack, as well as females who die in childbirth, women killed for the concept of male honour, and teens in cars crashed at speed by men to prove their masculinity. Then there are invisible women who survived long enough to live unnoticed in slums, refugee camps, mud huts, multi-occupancy housing, brothels, massage parlours, prisons and in ordinary streets behind ordinary doors where it is perfectly ordinary for them to suffer and die. Those with better luck get to go to school, except when they have periods and they stay at home. They get to have jobs, so long as they dont ask for too much money and dont mind getting laid off before men. They get to fall in love, so long as they dont complain too much when he mistreats her. And in many countries they get to enjoy all of that for longer and die a little later. The country I live in is better to women than most. Women text to let their mums know they got home without being raped, those who use their legal rights to get better treatment are considered unemployable or unmarriageable, and girls are bullied into sending naked pictures to boys who share them with their friends. Vaginas are stretchy, guys, but not THAT stretchy.Females here are told they dress wrong, think wrong, talk wrong, interrupt wrong, and work wrong. About all a female can be guaranteed to get praised for is dancing in her knickers, a fact which makes me want to stowaway on the first space ship that lingers too long over its crop circle. But dealing with all that for centuries has done something rather brilliant.In much the same way as the women who survive infancy can expect to live longer than men, it has bred a super-race. Women who run countries, corporations, and the international economy as easily as they can run a tap. And millions more who run their homes and lives just as well, but a lot more quietly.For years the only women who succeeded were superior beings, and in their wake have come more who learned by example. Those who tried to have it all, and mostly managed it, have been replaced by women for whom the definition of all has expanded like the Kardashian empire, which turned one instance of sexual exploitation into a billion-dollar female powerhouse.So successful have women been that those born with male genitalia now wish to be reclassied as female. Put aside whatever thoughts you have on the social, physical or cultural acceptability of that - for the first time humans are campaigning NOT to be men.We should be delighted that a woman in Karen Bradleys position is such a remarkable idiot. It at least proves that were used to brilliant women. If we are noticing women who arent up to the standards we expect of frontline troops, it proves women have set a high standard. We are now arguing about a woman presenter on Question Time, a pregnant princess with opinions, pink power tools and period poverty. When I was growing up not a single one of those things existed in the national consciousness or had any hope of doing so.Even better, we are noticing the women who have never been noticed before. The superwomen will have to fix that problem, too, because the guys sure havent got very far. The presence of a few idiots does not mean womanhood is regressing. It means more of us really do enjoy equal opportunities, oies arent holding so many people back, and were judging women on their ability rather than their knickers. Besides, being a moron never stopped a man. Stop the spaceship, I want to get off. Theres work to do.

The Labour MP took to Twitter to share her thoughts after it was confirmed Begum, , had lost her third child since fleeing to Syria aged .The jihadi bride had pleaded that her son, Jarrah, be allowed to grow up in the UK with her after he was born in a refugee camp last month. However, Home Secretary Sajid Javid revoked her citizenship, after warning he would do so for ing jihadis and their backers whenever he can. Abbott wrote on Twitter: It is against international law to make someone stateless, and now an innocent child has died as a result of a British woman being stripped of her citizenship. This is callous and inhumane. However, despite the Shadow Home Secretarys comments she was blasted for using the childs death for political point scoring. One commenter said: The death of any child is exceptionally sad , however to look for political gain is just depressing,   Another added: Its not Britains fault the children died as sad as it is its the mothers responsibility for choosing her path. To turn a babys death into political point scoring now thats callous and inhumane. Yet, Abbotts comments were echoed by Dal Babu, a former politan Police chief superintendent and friend of the Begum family. He told BBCs Newsnight: The family reached out to the Home Office and requested help. The Home Office sent a reply and said Youve come to the wrong department, you need to speak to Foreign and Commonwealth Office. There was no attempt to help by the Home Office. What we have here is a totally innocent child, whatever you may think of Shamimas shortcomings, the mistakes she made as a -year-old child when she was groomed on our watch. We failed to safeguard her and now we have failed, as a country, to safeguard a child - a totally innocent British subject.   He added that he believed the decision regarding Ms Begums citizenship should be urgently reviewed. Mr Javid, when asked whether there was any plan for Ms Begums son, had previously told the Commons Home Affairs Committee it would be incredibly dficult for the Government to facilitate theof a child from Syria. If it is possible somehow for a British child to be brought to a place where there is a British consular presence, the closest place - it might be Turkey for example - in those circumstances I guess potentially it is possible to arrange for some sort of help with the consent of the parent, he added.  Inside Syria, whether in a camp or maybe somewhere , there is no British consular presence. A Government spokesman said: The death of any child is tragic and deeply distressing for the family. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office has consistently advised against travel to Syria since April . The Government will continue to do whatever we can to prevent people from being drawn into terrorism and travelling to dangerous conflict zones.

It was a time when community was everything, housewives proudly competed to scrub their doorsteps clean and children turned derelict houses into playgrounds.In a new memoir, Cobbled Streets  Penny Sweets, she remembers how people made the best of what little they had and tells stories of family, friendship and getting through the hard times with a healthy dose of Geordie humour...When I was around five years old I looked at a photo of my parents in their wedding gear. “Where was I ” “You weren’t here yet.” Fern Britton: ‘Take every challenge – you’ll only be doing the ironing otherwise!’ Whatever did they mean, how could they be somewhere without me  This was disgraceful. But I was there alright. The receipt for Mam’s wedding ring, purchased at The Northern Goldsmiths, Westgate Road, Newcastle upon Tyne, price pound, is dated September  . I was born on February  . I never understood why being a single mother was frowned upon but a couple, like my parents, who had married while the bride was pregnant was acceptable. In those days it was necessary for every houseproud housewe to “donkey stone the front step”. In other words, they scrubbed it clean on their hands and knees, bucket at the side, before a yellow rubbing stone was applied. You weren’t allowed to step on it when it was newly done. The fanlight received the same diligent attention – apparently, a dirty step and fanlight meant you had a dirty home. Folks really took a pride in their meagre dwelling places.   The women were regularly seen out on the street, wearing Paisley pinnies with scarves tied with a knot at the front, covering their hair curlers , sweeping their part of the path. Of course, this was also an excuse to gossip . They would stand around gassing about this one or that one: “Who does she think she is, the cat’s mother ” “Aye, man, aal fur coat and nee knickers!” I enjoyed listening to tales of local characters. There was the rat catcher who called in at the pubs, went into the cellars and placed a lantern with a kipper over the top. He hid in the corner until the rat came snfing, then grabbed it with his bare hands and chucked it in a hessian sack. The charge to the publican was dfor a little rat and dfor a large one.  If the payment wasn’t given, the catcher tipped them all out on to the bar counter – “Here then, have your rats back!” Sure enough, this would clear the place. The chimney sweep was a favourite of mine. A father-and-son team visited homes in the area. To me, it was fascinating how they carried a long fabric bag, unravelled it and inside were all these poles and a huge circular brush. The bag doubled as a cover to protect flooring and half-covered the fireplace. The sweep slotted all the poles together and the fabulous brush was the crown. This snake of a man went up the chimney and then the excitement began. I ran outside and half the street was shygathered around our back door in the lane. Everyone knew which house the sweep was working in, so word got around. Then the long-awaited event happened: the brush burst forth from the chimney pot, doing its pirouette. A massive cheer would go up. Folks were easily pleased in those days! I never understood why everyone did their washing on Mondays and placed it on long lines, criss-crossed over the lane. This was the day the coal van called so the women ran out with their props held aloft to allow it through.  Woe betide any driver who didn’t give a warning and sailed through those white sheets. Angry females would beat the side of the lorry. The women were also out in forceus kids decided on a game of “Run Through”. It was a great feeling to charge into the freshly laundered cotton and feel the flap on our faces. I wonder now how any of those women got any work done between attending to us and the coal men. There was generally a woman in the street ready to organise a trip out. The bus would be booked and everyone paid their share. Once on the beach, a plateau of sand was made and a tablecloth placed over the top. The sandwiches were usually egg and tomato. Us kids referred to them as “soggies” – by the time you got there, the tomato had soaked into the egg and bread – or “sand sandwiches”. Women enjoyed playing darts in the pub and had their own teams. Folks would sing around the piano and continue singing up the street after closing time.  After a while chatting outside someone’s home, a suggestion was made to continue inside. The rug was rolled back and they danced and sang until the early hours. This was a time when folks didn’t rely on TV or digital devices for entertainment and storytelling was a staple of the community. I liked nothing better than listening to the adults having a chinwag about the good old days, sharing family stories and gossiping. The walls of the haberdashery store were lined with wooden doors with glass  and tiny little drawers which held ribbons, buttons and metal zips.  Women who wanted to knit a jumper asked at the wool shopthey could buy a ball a week – “Put the balls away”. This meant they had worked out how many were needed, then collected one a week, paying as they knitted. Folks couldn’t afford to buy everything at once. Tobacconists sold single cigarettes to those who couldn’t afford the pack. The winters in Benwell were usually severe but none more so than when the snow of  arrived. As homes had no central heating, snow covered the rooftops. From this, icicles up to a couple of feet long spiked down.  I was aware of those big buggers staring down at me as I knocked on a friend’s door.“Are yi comin’ oot ter play ” “Nah, me Mam says the snow’s too bad.” weather conditions than mine. I was generally the last one playing out while others were long since by the fire.Sometimes, the slam of the door was enough to send the whole lot thundering down. But it wasn’t so bad then as I had a free ice lolly. Back home, a bucket was kept next to the back door so that ash could be sprinkled to guide the way to the outside toilet – “the netty”. The seat would be covered in ice, so unless you wanted to slide about mid-pee, the surface needed to be scraped off.  In summer, the danger was sitting on the woodworm holes: the preparation to kill them was smelly and would be transferred to the backs of your legs. If I banged on the seat, little worms would pop their heads out and I was waiting with a pin to try and stick one. Many of the flats and houses in the West End had long since been deemed unfit for human habitation but landlords were still able to rent out to folks who couldn’t afford a better place. A five-year-old lad called Larry had a younger brother of three, who was playing in the lane. The lad bumped into a backyard wall, the whole lot came tumbling down and killed him. When police arrived, they knocked down  walls in the lane using a wooden clothes prop. Cobbled Streets  Penny Sweets by Yvonne Young is out now at pound. from John Blake Publishing.

The site is believed to be run by Igreja Adventista Remanescente de Laodiceia, a religious community of about  people in the capital city of Brasilia, an ongoing investigation revealed. The labourers, found working in dangerous conditions for little to no pay, are members of the cult and have not asked for help. Labour inspector Rodrigo Ramos told the Thomson Reuters Foundation: We observed that there is strong psychological coercion. [The followers] believe they work for their own spiritual salvation. They think the world is nearing its end, and that they can be saved [by staying] in this community.   Last year, Brazilian officials have successfully found  suspected slaves labouring for a single religious organisation. However they struggled to stop the abuse as some of the suspected slaves refused to be rescue. According to Ramos, the leaders of the Brasilia cult were enriching themselves off the work done by their followers. People sold bread, crops, books and sheets that were all made within the community, but they received less than the minimum wage for their labour. Its reported they had to pay for food, clothing and their lodgings. Officials said some of the machinery employed have put workers lives at risk. The Federal Public Prosecutor wrote in a statement that workers slept in makesht tents or in other degrading conditions. A room housing dangerous pesticides was separated from an area where workers slept by a improvised wall made of cardboard. We could smell the products [from where workers slept], said Ramos.   State officials seized ledgers and documents containing payments and expenditures for each person who was in the cult. Leaders of the church will face charges for keeping workers in slavery-like conditions and will have to pay compensation to those harmed by their practicesfound guilty, said Ramos. According to local police, two women were rescued from Igreja Adventista Remanescente de Laodiceia after being kept imprisoned as domestic labourer last December. Police then received new reports of abuses that triggered the current operation. It bears emphasizing that the operation does not mean to interfere in the religious beliefs of any citizen. But it is a duty of the state to act positively so that workers have their fundamental rights secured, the prosecutors office said.

It was written by head teachers’ campaign group Worth Less  and has gone out across  local authority areas.   The note states that since  state school funding has been slashed by % in real terms, with cuts of % for sixth form and post- pupils. The letter adds: “These issues... are common features across our education system.

The One Direction star, , who is backing the Mirror’s campaign to tackle the kne epidemic, added: “It was one of the scariest things I’ve been through.” The star added that it has inspired him to raise awareness of the dangers of carrying a blade. The One Direction singer talked of his ordeal – when a huge hunting weapon was pointed in his face – as he backed the Mirror’s End the Kne Epidemic campaign. Liam has called on the Government to act, and said: “It’s fantastic the Mirror is involved in this.” Talking candidly about being mugged as a lad while growing up in Wolverhampton, he said: “It was one of the scariest things I have ever been through in my le. “I was lucky, but so many aren’t... Something needs to be done. We’ve reached unprecedented levels of people losing their lives.”   Liam, , told how he and a friend were lured to a remote spot in Bilston, a town roughly three miles from the centre of Wolverhampton, and then set upon. He said: “This ft  guy says ‘I will tell you the truth, lads, you’ve been brought here today to get jacked’. My le flashed before my eyes. “He pulled out a massive hunting kne and I felt my heart in my throat. It was really scary. “He was pointing the kne in our faces, then sharpening the blade with a stick and making up raps. “We ended up giving him what we had in our wallets. Eventually we just legged it and jumped on the nearest bus even though we didn’t know where it was going.” When he got home, he was too nervous to tell his parents about the mugging, a fact that he still regrets. Liam has urged children affected by kne crime to open up to loved ones.   He said: “I didn’t want my parents to know how far I was from my home... It’s important that you tell someonesomething like that happens to you. They can help. “Two weeks after I was robbed at knepoint, I saw the guy again in town and had to run again.” Liam knows others have been far less fortunate than he was. He said: “I often talk to my friend who was with me at the time, saying ‘we are so lucky to be here’. “There are a lot of people who aren’t that lucky.” He added his ordeal taught him “not to take stupid risks”. He said: “We were bored kids with nothing to do. We went along with it and I ended up in the worst situation in my le.” His experience explains why he is so passionate about urging people not to carry a weapon. He said: “You pick up that blade and it’s the biggest risk you are taking in your le.” Our campaign is demanding action on police numbers, youth services and education – and the appointment of a kne crime tsar.  He said peer pressure is a huge reason why youths carry weapons, as well as the fact that many are from deprived areas. Liam has urged the Government to address the issues head on. He said: “We need a kne crime tsar... someone who can partner up with schools and the police – give them the powers they need. We’ve lost , officers in recent years.” Liam, who has a one-year-old son with pop star Cheryl, said becoming a dad has spurred him on to try to make a dference. He added: “I think there’s a lot of myth around it, that it’s just London that has a problem. It’s not – a lot of the bigger cities have increasing problems, in particular my home town of Wolverhampton.”  Kne crime in the West Midlands has risen % since . Liam said the Government must do more to equip teachers with the skills to identy children at risk of being lured into carrying knives. He added: “It’s really important that parents are talking to their kids, and that schools are running programmes with people who have been affected by kne crime.  “We need more Government-run programmes. If a parent or teacher [suspects] a kid could be in trouble, they need to let them know what they are getting themselves into. “It’s not just the le you are taking, you are going to take away from your own le. You will end up in prison. There are better ways to do things – you have to reach and ask for the right help.” Shadow Home Secretary Diane Abbott: Cut crocodile tears and hand out vital cash Since the beginning of this year  teenagers have been kned to death. We know violent crime has spiralled under this Government. Offences involving a kne or sharp instrument have risen for the fourth year running.So, when Theresa May got up at PMQs this week to express her concern about the most recent victims, she stands accused of crocodile tears. If she was concerned about the epidemic, she would not have tried to evade responsibility by pretending cuts in police numbers have no relationship to rising levels of violent crime. The slaughter on our streets is a consequence of Tory austerity. It is not just the , police officers taken off the street. The PM needs to stop shedding her crocodile tears. No one is interested in more summits and reviews. The public needs her to make funding available for police, the youth service and other public services that are essential in the fight against kne crime.

He then dumped him naked in a hole behind a dry stone wall and left him to suffocate under a mound of soil.  Darren was found by a passing hiker walking along a coastal path. He was pulled to the surface, but had already suffered severe brain damage and he died  days later in hospital. It emerged Spottiswood, of South Shields near Newcastle-upon-Tyne was running a drug trafficking racket and wrongly believed Darren had betrayed his operation to a rival dealer. This week the victims fiancee Donna Churchill spoke for the first time about the tragedy after Spottiswood was jailed for le for murder.  Spottiswoods girlfriend Lucy Burn, , was jailed for  months after admitting assisting an offender. She was cleared of murder. Miss Churchill, , of Sunderland said: The whole thing was heartbreaking but that chilling picture of them together almost killed me. I felt sick to my stomach at the sight of it. Darren looks absolutely tiny next to his hulking boss. My Darren didn’t stand a chance against him that night. I’d never liked the way Spotty treated Darren and never really understood why Darren stayed involved with him or continued working as a trainee mechanic at the garage Spotty owned.  All it took was a message from him to completely change Darren’s mood. He spoke to him like dirt and gave him all the awful jobs he didn’t want to do himself. I begged Darren to cut ties, but he wouldn’t. Shortly before he was murdered, we’d had a bit of an argument about it and I’d told him to leave because I didn’t want him around my kids. My heart ached but I couldn’t condone something illegal going on under my roof. He was brilliant with my children, which made my decision even harder. When I met Spotty I hated him instantly, so I asked Darren to come back to my house where I felt he belonged.  But Darren told me he couldn’t, and his eyes were filled with sadness. I knew he feared Spotty but couldn’t understand why. Something was holding him back.” Newcastle Crown Court was told the killing occurred in July  after Darren had joined Spottiswood and Burn for a weekend away at Cresswell Towers Caravan Park. A “heated argument” broke out during which Spottiswood choked Mr Bonner and then believing he was dead, loaded him into the back of a van before dumping him in the shallow grave he had dug nearby. Mr Bonner was found lying in the foetal position with a broad ligature mark around his neck and his body was covered with bruises, scratches and  blows from a ‘rod-shaped weapon’ on his back.  Miss Churchill said: Darren had tried to call me before he went away but I’d been with friends and missed it. I was sick of hearing about Spotty anyway, so I was partly glad I didn’t have to listen to anything more about it. Two days later though, I still hadn’t spoken to him and began to feel uneasy. Just then, I spotted two men walking across the car park towards me. One of them was carrying a folder and when I spotted the words ‘serious crimes unit’ and I had a gut feeling something was terribly wrong. I remember my mouth going dry as they walked in and watched as they approached my boss. Then, I was called over and taken into a back room where they told me they had bad news about Darren. As soon as they said it, I told them Spotty was responsible for whatever had happened. I just knew. I just cannot comprehend the circumstances in which he’d been discovered. It seemed so sick to imagine that he’d been buried alive. He was treated like an animal.  Spottiswood, who denied murder, told the court he had killed Darren in self-defence but ordering him to serve a minimum of  years in jail, Judge Stephen Ashurst told him: Mr Bonner died an untimely, violent and undignied death. He wanted to fit in and belong. He was much-loved and looking forward to the future but by your actions, he was deprived at such a young age of making something of his le. Detective Chief Inspector Andy Fairlamb of Northumbria Police, said: The fact that Darren was left in such a critical condition, barely breathing and lying in a shallow grave, absolutely shows how truly cold and despicable Spottiswood is.

The Duchess of Sussex, wearing a pound Azzura black and white mini dress from Reiss, said shed seen a Netflix documentary about feminism where shed heard the expression. She said: I loved that. So boy or girl, whatever it is, we hope that thats the case. Meghan has joined a  of female thought leaders at Kings College London brought together by The Queens Commonwealth Trust - of which she has today become vice-president. Meghan, talking about a range of issues that affect women, has said that from the young age of  she knew she wanted to do something about inequality and sexism. The Duchess has also spoken of the importance of access to education for young girls, arguing it really does solve so many of the world’s problems. She talked about how vital it is to de-stigmatise menstruation in communities, saying its  per cent of the population thats affected by something that can also end up creating the most beautul thing in the world. And Meghan said its important for men to understand they can be feminists as well and be part of the conversation, adding my husband certainly is. The -year-old also revealed during the discussion that she does not look at Twitter, saying: I don’t look at it. Sorry no. For me that is my personal preference. Those joining the Duchess for the chat include Annie Lennox and former prime minister of Australia Julia Gillard.  Meghan has been described by the s host as a royal not afraid to embrace full-on feminism. Asked how her pregnancy was going, she said: Very well. Its funny, Id actually been joking these past few weeks Id seen this documentary on Netflix about feminism and one of the things they said during pregnancy was I feel the embryonic kicking of feminism. I loved that. So boy or girl, whatever it is, we hope that thats the case.   The group today are talking about the positive opportunities that come when women are given wider access and equal opportunities. Annie Lennox is founder of The Circle, an organisation supporting and empowering womens lives around the world, while Ms Gillard is chairwoman of the Global Institute for Womens Leadership at Kings College London, which is hosting the event. Other members of the  include Adwoa Aboah, who set up the open social discussion  Gurls Talk and Chrisann Jarrett, founder of the equal access to higher education campaign Let Us Learn. Also on the  is Angeline Murimirwa, executive director of the Campaign for Female Education in Africa and co-founder of Cama, a pan-African network of young female leaders. The  is chaired by Anne McElvoy, senior editor of The Economist and columnist with the Evening Standard.   Asked about her own personal journey, Meghan said: “At the age of  I had seen a commercial at the time that I thought to be very sexist. Truth be told, at , I didnt even know what sexism meant. I just knew that something struck me internally that was telling me it was wrong, and I knew that it was wrong. She said she used that as her moral compass, adding: It really set up the trajectory for me to say,there was a wrong,there is a lack of justice, and there is an inequality, then someone needs to do something. And why not me  Once I became old enough to travel, specically to developing countries and see what was happening abroad, I think for me what really resonated was the lack of education for girls, and how that has a ripple effect on so many things, she said today. Meghan added: It really does solve so many of the world’s problems when a girl has access to education. You look at it and you can say, here are the vulnerabilities and the challenges that come about when they don’t have access to education, she continued. Early childhood marriage, susceptibility to trafficking, modern slavery, all of that. But equally look at all the positives that come out of it when you do have access to education for young girls. How it affects the economic development, the GDP. Billions of dollars on the table are lost by girls being pulled out of education.   Meghan spoke about work in India she did a few years ago with a grassroots organisation trying to de-stigmatise menstruation. She said: Giving them access to be able to get these products, but in the same construct having these women mobilised to set up microfinance to sell these pads and other things that are needed to other women in the community. So again it feels like its one issue but it ends up solving so many. Because when you see how many girls are hindered and taken out of school simply because theyre ashamed about going through that transition in le, or because no-one wants to talk to them about it because they dont have what they need and theyre using old rags - literally. Which of course is propelling disease and so many other symptoms that come from this. At the end of the day, we are doing our part just to normalise the conversation. Thats the first step. Because again this is  per cent of the population thats affected by something that can also end up creating the most beautul thing in the world. So its a strange one that its ended up becoming so stigmatised. Remember its also in our own communities that its happening, and the only way we sht that is by talking about it which is why the work you do with Gurls Talk is so important.  Meghan has today become vice-president of the Queens Commonwealth Trust, the organisation has announced. The Duchess has joined her husband Harry, who is president, at the body, while the Queen is its patron. In this new role, the Duchess will highlight the trusts partnerships with young people across the Commonwealth, and in particular its work supporting women and girls, the trust said in a statement. The announcement was made a few hours before the discussion , organised by the Trust, of leading feminists and national figures to mark International Womens Day. Nicola Brentnall, the Trusts chief executive, said: We are particularly delighted that the first opportunity of formally working together with Her Royal Highness comes on International Womens Day. This squares perfectly with our focus on amplying the work and contribution of those furthest away from power. Women across the Commonwealth and the globe often face the biggest impediments to success. So we are delighted to have our vice-presidents support in helping others to overcome those obstacles.  Today Meghan told the  she felt privileged to have her role. She said: And I think, you know, looking at my role, and Im very very privileged to have now with the QCT, just expands that  to be able to go to  Commonwealth countries and do this level of work all across the globe because again, it is about global feminism, it is about a parity and equality for all of us. It started at , but still feels like its just beginning. Meghan has made womens empowerment a key part of her campaigning work and during her recent tour of Morocco with the Duke told a group of female executives and entrepreneurs: Women have to challenge everywhere in the world.

Sally Grfiths, from the Wirral, is so dismayed by the unsightly object she is considering leaving the home she has lived in for the past  years. The -year-old was horried last week when she woke to discover the new addition outside her front gate - and the mum-of-three is flabbergasted that nobody asked her permission.She told the Liverpool Echo : I cant sleep at night anymore. Its affecting so many parts of my le. Its so tall I feel threatened by it.I feel like its going to fall on me, every time it gets windy, I see the thing shaking - it could snap. I was up at am this morning worried about it.   Ms Grfiths said when men in hi-vis came last Thursday, she assumed they were carrying out gas works. A notice about the pole had been put up on a road sign across the road - but it had the incorrect street name, and caused confusion. She complained to BT after the work had been done, but is yet to hear back. The painter and decorator said: I didnt think anything of it because we had a blackout a couple of weeks ago here, so it could have been the gas. According to Ms Grfiths, there are plenty of other places it could have been safely erected nearby, and that the roads and pavement in the New Brighton area were already narrow enough without further obstructions. Staff and visitors parking to use the nearby health centres mean the road is already congested, and cars are often forced to drive onto the kerb to give way or reverse, she said.   The road cant take it, she added. It will be a problem for wheelchairs and the elderly, and a problem at night time as visibility around here is not good. We just dont know why theyve put it there. People dont know what to do anymore. We are fed up - defeated it shows no respect for the public at all. Im thinking of moving its depressed me that much. Im already starting to hate the area. Id like to be listened to as a resident, and to get that pole removed. Ms Grfiths said she and other residents had been in touch with local ward Councillor Pat Hackett, who has been very helpful.   Cllr Hackett said: [BT] need to ensure they consult more before they install this large piece of street equipment, we know it provides a great service, but it needs to be placed in a position that does not intrude or impinge on residents quality of le by obstructing pedestrians and access to the entrance of this property. At the very least they only had to have a chat by going around and speaking to the local community before they installed it, which would have helped everybody concerned. BT dont require local authority approval to erect telegraph poles. A spokesman for BT Openreach said: “We’re going to take a closer look at this, in light of the concerns raised by people living nearby. Updating or installing new infrastructure can be a challenging and complex task at times, but we always try and carry out our work sensitively and with minimal disruption to the local community.” "},{"url":null,"title":"mum wins landmark case over","story":"NewsMum wins landmark case over baffling road sign that made council £k a weekEmma Bartholomews mum was fined at a notoriously baffling no left turn sign that has made a council nearly £millionShareByTalia Shadwell:,  MAR NewsReporter Emma Bartholomew took on Hackney Council over her mums fine and won\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA mum-of-three has won a landmark case against a council over a fine at a baffling no left turn sign that has made the authority over poundmillion. And Emma Bartholomews triumph could open the floodgates to similar cases over inadequate road sign claims at other spots bringing in cash for councils. When Emmas mum was fined by Hackney Council at the confusing bend, she decided to take on the East London local authority.The Hackney Gazette journalist noted it had made more than pound million in the nine months since the cameras had been installed.  She decided to help her mum appeal the ticket after her mum was stung with a fine while she was on her way to perform an act of generosity. Emmas mum had been dropping off clothing donations to St Josephs Hospice in Mare St for its charity jumble sale when she was snapped, she said. Rather than have her mum pay the pound fine, Emma decided it was time to do something about the notorious fine spot. She said her mum had no idea about the camera. An independent adjudicator ultimately agreed with the mother-daugter duo that the signs at the turn from Mare St into Richmond Rd were inadequate.  But Emmas mum risked being slapped with an even bigger fine by taking the council on after it initially rejected their request to overturn the fine. By appealing the pound discount charge, Emmas mum faced it growing to poundshe lost the case. But the tribunal agreed with the pair and overturned Emmas mums fine. Sean Stanton-Dunne of London Tribunals told the Gazette he had come across the case at least five times. He said each time “sent a clear message” to the council the signs in Mare Street were “inadequate.”Allowing the appeal, Mr Stanton-Dunne said: “The no left turn sign is positioned beyond the traffic lights so that it may not be clearly seen before the lights.   The lights are in front of the sign and so risk causing an obstructed view from car level in the left hand lane. “There is an advance warning sign further back from the lights but this is tilted at an angle so that it does not directly face the approaching motorist.” However he does not have the power to force changes. The signs are supposed to warn vehicles they can can no longer turn left into Richmond Road between am and am, and pm and pm, from Monday to Saturday. The change was made last June due to the street outside London Fields Primary School being made a school street in an effort to reduce air pollution. But the stretch has subsequently become a cash cow the local council.   Figures revealed by the Gazette showed Hackney Council was raking in pound, a day from the spot, with almost , people hit by penalty charge noticessince its installation. Just  people, or  per cent of all those issued with a PCN, appealed to the independent adjudicator, where a third won. Just , of the the , notices motorists have tried to appeal in the last nine months have been cancelled. But the council reportedly did not agree with the ruling, with a spokesman telling the Gazette they believe the Department of Transport-approved signs go over and above the requirements for a restriction of this type. A spokesperson added: “Nonetheless we always remain open to making further improvements, and will be inviting an adjudicator to visit Richmond Road so that we can discuss any concerns they may have, and agree how to address them for the benefit of motorists.” But the reporter who took on the council doesnt think her battle ends here. She has pointed out the local authority says the sign adheres to DoT guidelines. She told the Mirror she has no answers yet on whether they will change the signs to make it less confusing. Obviously I think they should, but there doesnt seem to be any authority who can make them do that. Theyve changed the signs once already after some people got hit with more than  tickets when it was first introduced. They obviously havent yet done enough to make the sign visible enough - and the adjudicator agreed with me. Emma pointed outthe scheme is supposed to be for the benefit of the local school:I do wonder why its still in force on a Saturday from am to am and pm to pm, when the school is closed. It does seem to indicate that theyre happy with the situation as it is and the phenomenal amount of money the sign is racking up.

It can revolutionise how a company works in so many areas, from more efficient front line production to improved data analysis.

So to help, Yorkshire Bank’s Group Business Banking Director, Gavin Opperman, is here to answer your questions... Q How can small businesses reduce costs associated with new technology  A Every small business needs technology to support them to make their business more efficient. Technology is moving faster than human skills are, which is why it is necessary for small businesses to weigh up exactly what piece of technology they want to own, its longevity and whether its development can be outsourced. Q Is understanding the latest technology essential for all small businesses  A Most small businesses will need to adopt some level of technology to make their business run efficiently. However,small businesses get caught up in the technology race too much they can move away from their core business. Remember to find a balance between what is needed and how to make the businessoptimally. Q What technology should small businesses be looking out for  A Every small business is dferent. There’s a number of exhibitions that they can attend to see what technology is most suited to them.

We can introduce small businesses to experts in our portfolio who can advise on the latest products and services available. Q Many small businesses are hindered by time and internal resources – how can they still embrace new technology  A The biggest challenge Yorkshire Bank has identied with small businesses is the skills shortage, which puts pressure on internal resources. A lot of universities are developing skills in technology, but it’s how small businesses can retain the talent within that. The aim would be to keep the intellectual property within \u2028the region, so small businesses can embrace new technology without added time or training.Find out more about a business bank that works for you at YBonline business"},{"url":null,"title":"residents shock 50m long crack","story":"NewsResidents shock as m long crack appears just METRES away from homesShocking images show a -metre-long crack along the coast of Hornsea, YorkshireShareCommentsByTrudi DavidsonTfany Lo:,  MAR Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video huge-m-cracks-hornsea-clf-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News ,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News ,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true\"\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailHomeowners in a Yorkshire town are worried clfs could fall onto people on the beach below after an enormous crack appeared. The  metre-long rupture is the worst seen at the clftop Longbeach Leisure Park in Hornsea and six holiday homes have already been relocated. Dramatic images show the crack, which is a result of coastal erosion. Holiday home owner Mark Mattison, , said: Its the biggest crack I have even seen and I have been here since . I think the government, the council or whoever is involved, should put some defences up.   Although Mr Mattison said theres a warden on site to monitor the situation, he fears it could be a risk for people on the beach, according to Hull Live.He continued: Yesterday, there were students down there doing coastal erosion studies and there were a lot of dog walkers. If it does go, obviously there could be tragic circumstances. A little bit went down at the back end of yesterday. Little bits go all the time. Another holiday home owner, Mervin Bryan, , said: This is the worst crack I have seen here. “We walk our dogs towards Mappleton quite a lot and have seen the deterioration right along, it’s really coming down.   The holiday caravans nearest to the new rupture in the Eastfield area of the site will have to be relocated, which takes the total number of relocations up to  so far this year. Longbeach Leisure Park manager Chris Wilson said the biggest single loss of clf edge, recorded in , was a width of . metres. He admitted that the -metre crack was more dramatic than anything they have had in recent years. The holiday caravans nearest to the new rupture, in the Eastfield area of the site, will now be re-located, taking the total number of relocations to  so far this year. He said: The last couple of months has been the worst period of erosion in recent years. Certainly a talking point has been the hot summer of last year thats dried out all the clay.   East Riding councillor Barbara Jefferson has raised the issue with the council and has been told officials visited the site recently to look at erosion and discuss health and safety issues. Its said East Ridings coastal engineers will visit the site to assess the rupture. A council spokesman says: “While the existing coastal defences in Hornsea protect part of the Longbeach site from erosion, to the south of these defences, the coast is eroding at a rate of approximately . metres a year, with a maximum inidual loss of . metres. “Over time, this erosion, which is monitored regularly, has resulted in the need to relocate or remove caravan pitches from the site.” The council has been working with landowners in the affected area to ensure the risks to people are minimised. Visitors to the coast are urged to keep away from clf edges and the bottom of clfs.

Scott Wilkinson, , was battered to death with a plank of wood by brothers Lenny and Shane Crawt, aged  and  at the time, and their then -year-old cousin Charlie Smith. The Crawt brothers, now  and , were found guilty of murder and Smith, , was found guilty of manslaughter at Guildford Crown Court on March . The -year-old was murdered during a nighttime fishing expedition on Donkey Island, near his home in Walton-on-Thames, Surrey, in July, .   He suffered fatal brain injuries when the three young men brutally assaulted him with a piece of wood. The jury heard how the Crawt brothers and their cousin Smith had been camping on the island. They fled to nearby Grovelands Park after the incident and met a gang of youths they knew. According to Surrey Police, one of the three said: I wouldnt say anythingI was you because we killed someone tonight. Smith told an old school friend that he was on the run for murder.   Detective Inspector Paddy Mayers, who led the investigation, said: This was a vicious and senseless attack on Scott Wilkinson who after the attack was left alone to die. His injuries were so serious that they were not survivable. Shane Crawt, Lenny Crawt and Charlie Smith thought they had got away with it and even boasted about what they had done. They then denied their involvement before blaming each other, putting Scotts family through a distressing trial where they had to listen to graphic detail to what Scott had gone through.   DI Mayers said the trio had never shown any remorse for what they have done. After the verdict, Scotts family shared a heart-wrenching tribute. They said: We have such fond memories of Scott which include him misbehaving with his brother Shaun when they were children much to the consternation of his mother Janet and humorous delight of his father David. Fishing was a family hobby which brought us all together. It created shared experiences during long summer holidays, adventurous trips to Ireland with long drawn out tales of the one that got away. The energy and enthusiasm which Scott directed towards fishing was reflective of his character towards people. He offered friendship, kindness and closeness to those that wanted or needed it. He enriched the lives of the people who knew him. Shane Crawt, from Purley, Lenny, from West Molesey, and Charlie Smith, of no fixed abode will be sentenced at the same court at a later date.

A poll revealed the extent to which children can innocently damage a home, with the likes of pasta sauce, blackcurrant squash and even the latest craze – slime – all leaving their mark. The most common stage for kids to cause havoc was revealed to be between new-born and three, with some parents admitting the contents of their child’s nappy was the cause of some of their floor stains. Children’s drinks were found to be the biggest culprit of the damaged flooring followed by craft materials such as ink and paint.  But three in  of the parents polled also said liquids are the worst thing for children to spill, with cosmetics and food not far behind. Carine Jessamine of Selco Builders Warehouse, which conducted the research, said: “The research shows parents everywhere have to deal with serious spillages.   “Everyone accepts children are going to have incidents when they are growing up, but when the repair bill can drt into the thousands it can prove costly for parents”. It also emerged one in five parents have had to pay up to pound to get their flooring repaired or professionally cleaned, while one parent even said they faced a bill of pound, to repair the damages. The worst flooring for stains and damages was revealed as carpet. And the most common room in the house for flooring to be ruined is in the bedroom with  per cent of spillages happening there. This is closely followed by the dining room and kitchen, showing how food, including peanut butter and beetroot according to respondents, is such as big issue.   Interestingly, the results of the study carried out among  Brits showed young girls are just as likely to leave behind a trail of destruction as boys.

A perfect Barbie nose, she said in the video. Its Barbies th birthday this Saturday and this week I am celebrating it with cosmetic surgery, as a gt to myself.   The nose job is the latest addition to her pound, surgery bill as part of a big to become the UKs oldest human Barbie - including botox, cheek and lip fillers and eye-bag removal. The -year-old boutique assistant, from Bromley, London, is also celebrating Barbies birthday by going clubbing on Saturday night with her friends - but will be drinking mocktails only. Rachel, who also works as a professional Living Fashion Doll said: I decided to get the nose job non-surgical rhinoplasty to perfect looking like Barbie - I need to look plastic fantastic. Every morning I look in the mirror and set about correcting it with makeup tricks, but it gets tedious and time consuming having to apply dark nose-contouring makeup to give the illusion of a straight nose.   The surgery comes as part of Rachels -year-long mission to look as much like the famous doll as possible. She said: A straight Barbie nose, finishes off nicely other recent surgery Ive had done: jaw tightening with threads, Botox maintenance, mouth corners turned up for a doll-like perma-smile and lip plumping for a doll pout. Over the years I have had thousands of pounds worth of surgery to go from a tomboy to Barbie, and Im not going to stop any time soon. There is always some sort of maintenance that can be done to increase my look and I wont stop until I am the perfect Barbie I know I can be. My facial cosmetic procedures must come first in my le and always have - everything  is put on the back burner, which means I have to sacrice luxuries like a nice car and holidays, but its worth it.   Asked how  she will be celebrating Barbies birthday, Rachel said she will celebrate it in style. I will be putting on my best pink, plastic outfit to look as much like Barbie as possible whilst I am out celebrating, she said. I will be drinking virgin cocktails as Barbie does not drink alcohol and will be shouting Happy th birthday Barbie! all night. I dont drink either and I like to set a good example to young people to party responsibly, just like Barbie would. After all Im a Barbie Girl in A Barbie World.

Rockwell house in Milledgeville, Georgia, comprises of eight rooms with a spiral staircase, slave quarters and a carriage house at the rear. The original owner is said to have had a heart attack after learning his fence cost more than the house, according to urban explorer known as Abandoned Southeast who took the photos. The house, which was a labour of love, features a grand entrance with steps leading to an intricate porch and pillars, and the cast iron fence said to have provoked the heart attack.   Other incredible images show the spacious interior with most of the rooms cleared out, while ornate woodwork remains above the doors and fireplace with two lonely seats being all thats left. This magnicent home was built for Colonel Samuel Rockwell in  in Milledgeville, Georgia, said Abandoned Southeast.

The story is told that when Col Rockwell learned of the cost of the fence, he had a heart attack. There are no markings on the fence as to where it came from.

He continued: There are a number of stories and rumours about the Rockwell House including a rumor of gold buried in the vicinity of the house.  Col Rockwell was the seventh generation of Rockwells in America. He was born in  in Albany, New York. Rockwell moved from Maine to Georgia in .

The image, taken in January , sparked an investigation by the Discovery Channels team of investigators. After first looking into the possibility it was a crater made by the German bombings of Belfast in World War Two, the team realised the circular area was actually raised. Investigator Sheila Hoffman said the mound had hard edges so was unlikely to be the result of an explosion or depression in the ground from bombs, but appeared to be a mound.   Archaeologist Dr Karen Bellinger agreed and found there were large stones visible, making the site most likely to have been a Stone Age henge monument, and that is was likely used by Celtic Pagan savages. Speaking in the Discovery Channel documentary, Dr Mark Altaweel said Celtic tribes were in constant conflict with each other. And typically before battle they would have their priest perform ceremonies to get the tribe ready for the conflict ahead.   He speculated that before battle, humans including young men and girls were killed here to pacy and please pagan gods. He said: Typically the Celts captured someone to sacrice them. They would perform these rituals on these mounds, places that were elevated, in a way to bring them closer to their gods.

The fate of Emanuela Orlandi, a -year-old girl who disappeared without a trace from the Vatican on the way to a flute lesson in , has gripped Italians for the last three decades. But now the mystery could finally unravel - with a coded message which appears to indicate where the teenager’s body was secretly buried. “Look where the angel points,” reads the message in an anonymous letter sent to her family. The angel is a centuries-old stone statue on top of an unmarked tomb within the the Teutonic Cemetery, which lies within the Vatican walls.   And unlike other many similar statues in the tiny city state, the angel’s hand is pointing downwards - towards whatever is buried underneath. The cemetery is not accessible to the general public and no-one knows who was once buried there.Yet the tomb is mysteriously tended every day, with a lit red votive candle that is never allowed to go out, and always fresh flowers in a vase. The only thing engraved on it is a marble scroll the angel holds, which reads Requiescat in Pace - or Rest in Peace. The Orlandi family now wants the Pope to grant permission to exhume whoever or whatever lies inside the tomb, which is reported to have been opened “at least once” - and resealed - within the last few decades.   A Vatican spokesman this week said in a statement that the Holy See is “studying” the matter and will soon decide whether to honour the request. If Emanuela is found to have been murdered and buried inside the Vatican it could engulf the Catholic church in its biggest scandal to date. And it will give oxygen to one of the most sensational theories about her disappearance - that the schoolgirl was kidnapped by high-ranking clerics who kept her as a sex slave before killing her. Pierto Orlandi, Emanuela’s brother, said he believes the Vatican’s highest powers know much more about his sister’s disappearance than they have so far let on. “I wish so much that this story was a hoax. I really wish Emanuela was not here,” he told a local newspaper. While this is the most precise indication yet of where she might be buried, the claim that she was snatched by a Vatican paedophile ring has been made before - by people close to the Churchs very centre of power.  The Vaticans chief exorcist Father Gabriele Amorth, a great confidant of retired Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI, said in  that Emanuela was snatched from the streets of central Rome in the summer of  and forced to take part in sex parties.Fr Amorth, who died in , said: This was a crime with a sexual motive. Parties were organised, with a Vatican gendarme acting as the recruiter of the girls. The network involved diplomatic personnel from a foreign embassy to the Holy See. I believe Emanuela ended up a victim of this circle.”In , Monsignor Simeone Duca, an archivist with the Vatican, backed up the exorcist’s claims.He cited “credible information” that “certain factions” inside the Vatican’s diplomatic corps were involved in procuring young adolescent girls for sexual slavery. He, too, said he believed that the teenager was abducted for that purpose and later murdered. It is not the only theory that has emerged about what happened to Emanuela in what is still one of Italy’s most enduring mysteries.  They include the early claim that Turkish militants tied to the assassination attempt against Pope John Paul II had taken the schoolgirl to secure the release of Mehmet Ali Agca, who tried to shoot the pope in . Then, in , the mistress of a gangster named Enrico De Pedis told authorities that he organised Emanuelas kidnapping at the behest of the controversial American archbishop, Paul C. Marcinkus, the former president of the Vatican Bank, who died in . Some have suggested that Emanuelas father Ercole, a Vatican clerk, had evidence of wrongdoing committed by Marcinkus, and that he asked De Pedis to kidnap the girl to keep the clerk quiet. A traffic warden who had seen Emanuela speaking to a man in a green BMW the night she disappeared worked to produce a sketch of the man, who looked very similar to De Pedis. And in , Italian journalist Emiliano Fittipaldi published a document that had been stolen from the Vatican. It appears to show that the church knew where the teen was and had been paying her expenses for years, including room and board and gynaecological examinations.  The Vatican called the document  and ridiculous. What is without doubt, though, are the very strange circumstances which surrounded her sudden vanishing on June , . The teenager, who had just finished her second year of high school, left the left the familys apartment in Vatican City and travelled to a flute lesson in Rome. On the way to the flute lesson, the man in the green BMW stopped her on the street and offered her money to sell Avon cosmetics, which she refused. Troubled, she called her sister to tell her about the incident. Once she arrived at the lesson, she was distracted and asked to leave early, around .pm. Emanuela was last seen in front of SantApollinare, a church in Rome belonging to the ultra-secretive Catholic organisation Opus Dei that played a mayor role in The Da Vinci Code novel. In the days after her disappearance the Orlandi family started receiving anonymous calls with tips about their daughters whereabouts, none of them leading anywhere.  Pope John Paul II waded into the case on July , , when he made a public appeal for her safeafter a public prayer, saying I am close to the Orlandi family. Two days after the pope’s address, someone called both the Orlandi family and the Vatican, saying that a group had taken the teen to secure the release of Mehmet Ali Agca. The caller, who was American, backed up his claims by leading agents to a photocopy of Emanuelas registration card for her music school, and sending a letter containing photo copies of the sheet music she was studying at the time. But he stopped communicating after October  and was never heard from again. A number of attempts have also been made recently to locate Emanuela’s remains, with the first linked to the secretive Opus Dei church. The only person ever investigated over the disappearance was Monsignor Piero Vergari, the former rector of the Sant’Apollinare church where she went missing. He was a friend of gangster Enrico De Pedis, and after he died he petitioned to let his body be buried at the Basilica of SantApollinare, a place usually reserved for senior clerics, not criminals.  In , De Pediss grave was exhumed to see whether Emanuelas remains might be hidden inside with his, but although, bizarrely, there were lots of human bones around his tomb, nothing matched the missing teen. And last November, workers renovating an annex of the Vaticans embassy to Italy in Rome discovered bones underneath the flooring, sparking immediate questions they may be connected to the teenager’s disappearance. Sometime after Emanuela’s disappearance, Monsignor Vergari is reported to have worked at the embassy. But the bones turned out to be around  years old. This week’s new lead could yet be another blind alley, or could maybe finally solve the mystery that has obsessed Italy, and haunted the Orlandi family, for over three decades. Emanuela’s brother Pierto knows there is still a long way to go to find the truth, especially as it could take weeks, months or even years, for the Vatican to respond to his family’s request to open the tomb. And with each day that goes by, he is more convinced that the Church knows much more about what happened to his lost sister than they had ever been willing to admit. He said: “Weve been asking for collaboration from the Vatican for  years. “Collaboration that has never been. This time we are asking again. Even collaboration that is discreet, just to understand. Just to remove this doubt.” "},{"url":null,"title":"mum blasted leaving five year","story":"NewsMum blasted for leaving five-year-old home alone to cook - and wanting sympathyThe heavily pregnant mum popped out to get a lunch she was cravingShareCommentsByZahra MulroySocial Audience Editor:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR NewsThe little lad was left to fend for himself \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailNo one would argue that having young kids is full on.That hateful mummy brain phrase  It exists because parents are often run ragged just trying to keep everything afloat.But does that justy leaving a five-year-old home alone, evenfor an hour  Evenyou believe he can fend for himself  One mum seems to think so, and its caused a huge backlash.The mum, who is also  weeks pregnant turned to Facebook for sympathy, writing in a group: Its a pain being pregnant and having to get my son ready and in the car, so I usually leave him home behind my fianceacutes back .

You can’t have enough players with pace.“He’s played No  as well and he fits the bill in terms of the type of player we want to bring to the club.”Despite the club’s immediate future unclear as they battle relegation from the Premiership, that’s not stopped Jim putting preparations in place.In the immediate future, however, is Hearts on Saturday at Dens Park.Jim was at Firhill on Monday night to watch the Jambos draw - with Partick in the Scottish Cup and is hopeful his side can repeat their - success at Tynecastle last month.He added: “We had a really good result against them last time.“They’ve had a wee sticky period with injuries but we know we’ll have to defend better than we have because we will be tested.“I always feel we have a chance of winning games, especiallywe can get our strikers fit and, with the wide players we have, I feel we are always going to create.”"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee owners make fresh bid to supporters society to increase shares","story":"Dundee FC’s owners have made a fresh bid to boost their control in the club to over %.The Tele revealed in January that Football Partners Scotland , the majority shareholder owned by Tim Keyes, had made a move to buy the ‘A’ Ordinary shares owned by the Dundee Football Club Supporters Society.With those came rights of veto regarding a range of issues including a stadium share or potential merger with another club.That was knocked back by the Society and now Dundee finance director David Gray has written to them in an attempt to buy their Ordinary shares to bring FPS’ holding to .%.This would allow them to claim Group Tax Relief to offset losses made by the club. A deadline of March  has been made by the club for the Society to decide on two proposals put forward by Dundee FC.The first would see FPS buy the Ordinary shares for £,, the club’s preferred option. These shares have a nominal value, at  pence per share, of £,.The second is for DFCSS to “agree to support resolutions which increase the club’s share capital and then allot shares specically to FPS”.Currently there is no provision in the Society’s rules to sell shares and an extraordinary general meeting would be needed to change that, and with it a vote by its members.The Financial Conduct Authority would also need to be contacted, a process which could take months.DFCSS already had a board meeting scheduled for next Tuesday and will discuss the proposals and their response as a board as well as with their members, despite the sharp time constraint.In a statement, the club added: “At a time when our primary focus is on retaining our Premiership status, we would prefer not to have to undertake an unnecessary time consuming and expensive full share issue and we hope that the Society will support us in agreeing to one of the suggested options.”"},{"url":null,"title":"embrace title race pressure urges dundee uniteds reynolds","story":"Mark Reynolds says the pressure is only going to increase on Dundee United as the season nears its end but he’s backed the Tangerines to embrace it by running down leaders Ross County.The Staggies have a five-point advantage on Reynolds  Co. going into United’s final  matches of the campaign and the on-loan Aberdeen man expects the intensity to increase game by game in the race to promotion.He said: “You need to embrace the pressure.“If you are in a team that’s got aspirations to go up and compete in the Premiership you need to deal with pressure.“There are players that don’t deal with that but they don’t play in big teams.“We have a good enough dressing-room and boys who want it and are used to playing under pressure in big games.“Everyone has the capability of thriving in it and that’s what we need to do.“We just need to keep on winning. Ross County will just keep doing what they do but the good thing is we play them twice so it can still be in our hands.“If we beat them in those games then it starts to put the pressure on but we still need them to slip up to make up the eight points.“We’ve left ourselves a lot to do but all we can do is win the games in front of us.“Regardless of who it is, every game will be huge and three points will be massive.”After the disappointment of losing Sunday’s Scottish Cup quarter-final against Inverness, United are targeting an immediateto their recent good league form with  points picked up from their last  available.They take on bottom side Partick Thistle this weekend at Firhill and Reynolds has urged the Terrors to “step up” and grab the three points.He added: “It was disappointing on Sunday and the boys were hurting – it’s right we feel that disappointment and let it sink in before getting back to training yesterday and then focus on the league.“We realise that was a chance to get in a semi-final but the next  games will be like cup finals.“There will be pressure, teams will try to stop us, they’ll make it horrible and we’ll be a scalp.“Teams will want to take points off us but we need to deal with that, step up and find ways to beat them.“If we keep winning then the pressure will increase and increase and it’ll get harder and harder but we need to deal with that.“We need to step up and,we do that, then we’ll have a good chance.”After a testing double header against Inverness Caley Thistle last week with a league win followed by that cup defeat, Reynolds expects the Highlanders to be a handful for their semi-final opponents – whether it’s this weekend’s opponents Partick or Premiership Hearts.He said: “Inverness are a big physical team – they put the ball up the park and play off the back of it and they have good players in amongst that.“Last Tuesday I thought we stood up to that and we won more balls, picked up more seconds and did enough to keep them out.“We didn’t do that on Sunday, we were second to too many balls.“Inverness can do that to teams. They will cause problems.”Reynolds, meanwhile, is happy to see no astroturf surfaces on the horizon after missing recent away trips to Queen of the South and Falkirk on physio’s orders.“That’s the last game on plastic pitches so, unless we go to the play-offs and have to play on one it’ll be fine.“It was just too early, that’s me not long back from a cruciate ligament injury so the advice from the physios was not to play on it and not risk it.“They were the guys that got me back so it would be daft not to listen to them.”"},{"url":null,"title":"former dundee united defender harry souttar called into australian squad","story":"Former Dundee United defender Harry Souttar has been called into the Australia U  squad.The -year-old, who is on loan at Fleetwood Town from current employers Stoke City, has accepted a call-up for Australia’s Olympic qualication squad for their training camp in Malaysia and qualiers in Cambodia.Souttar has already represented Scotland at U  and U  level and, along with brother John, is poised to be the first Scottish siblings to play for dferent countries.John made his international debut last year after Hearts boss Craig Levein warned Scotland risked losing him to Australia because he was eligible to play for the Socceroos.Harry had previously insisted it was his dream to play for Scotland.He#s eligible to play for Australia through his mother, who was born in Australia.He stressed two years ago during Scotland U ’s Elite Round qualiers in Czech Republic he was desperate to play for his country.He said: “My ambition has always been to play for Scotland.

He has marshalled a slight upturn in fortunes in recent weeks which has only been offset by the improved form of their relegation rivals Hamilton Accies and St Mirren, also.However, for Macca, it won’t be job done until Dundee are mathematically safe.And that is a long way off, as they sit in the relegation play-off place, three points behind Accies and only one ahead of the Buddies.Tonight, the Tele takes a look at the Dark Blues’ run-in to the split to see where they can pick up much-needed points.Dundee v Hearts # Saturday, March One of Dundee’s four wins this season, and their only one against a team which currently occupies the top six, came at Tynecastle at the end of January.That - success in Gorgie, coupled with the Jambos’ recent struggles – they are without a win in their last four league outings – will give the Dark Blues confidence going into Saturday’s clash at Dens Park.However, the Dee have only won once at home all season and need that to changethey are to have any hopes of staying in the ision.It’s must-win, for me, and I think they will rise to the occasion.Verdict: Three points.Dundee v Celtic # Sunday, March A game in which Dundee will not be judged on come the end of the season but one,they keep it tight at the back, could see them sneak a valuable point.However, I fancy Celtic to go on a really good run as they look to wrap up eight titles in a row under new manager Neil Lennon.They’ll have too much.Verdict: No points.St Mirren v Dundee # Saturday, March One word. Ten letters. Hyphenated. Six-pointer.If the teams go into this one still practically neck and neck, which I expect they will, a win would be extremely valuable for both.However, I feel, with the enormity of the occasion, they will cancel each other out in Paisley.Verdict: One point.St Johnstone v Dundee # Wednesday, April The Dee and Saints have had some tasty encounters in recent seasons and this one should be no dferent with both teams likely to still have plenty to play for.St Johnstone may still be in the mix for the top six while Dundee’s situation is self-explanatory.I fancy the Dark Blues for this one, they play better on the road and have more to lose than the Perth men.Verdict: Three points.Dundee v Aberdeen # Saturday, April You have to go back to November  for the last time Dundee got a win of any sorts against the Dons.That’s a run of  games without a win, with  losses in a row.That run has to end at some point, so I’ll back the Dee for a hard-earned draw.Verdict: One point.Total points: Eight points.That would leave Dundee with  going into the split and, you would like to think, put them in a decent position to stay up. That is, depending on how Hamilton and St Mirren get on with their fixtures .Hamilton – Motherwell , Hearts , Kilmarnock , Livingston , St Mirren .Verdict: Five points.St Mirren – Kilmarnock , St Johnstone , Dundee , Celtic , Hamilton .Verdict: Eight points.That would leave Hamilton level and St Mirren a point behind Dundee."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/03/5c80eccb849c11.76417978.jpg ","title":"pals make meat loaf themed coffin to bid farewell to dundee entertainer marc","story":"Friends of a Meat Loaf-loving entertainer came together to make sure he was given a fitting final farewell.Marc Kingston died suddenly last month at the age of , having had cancer.Born in Peterborough, he had lived in Dundee for more than  years and was a well-loved performer and DJ known as Marc Meat Loaf, who hosted events in the city.This week his friends met at Dundee Crematorium to make sure the performer received a fitting send-off.Marc arrived in a custom- made coffin painted with Meat Loaf’s Bat Out Of Hell album cover and driven in a flame-effect hearse. vw, px\"   vw, px\"   vw, px\"  He was a huge fan of Meat Loaf, whose hits include I’d Do Anything For Love and Two Out of Three Ain’t Bad.The song Objects In The Rear View Mirror was played as guests left the service.

This area of Argyll is the most fragile in the region. The people of Argyll, businesses and visitors deserve no less.Forget the squandering of £m on unreliable, mitigation measures trying to justy a flawed decision made many years ago to use the Old Military Road as a ersion which has failed on many occasions and now has a landslip between the two roads. Forget the expensive excavation of pits by the A rather use the cuttings into the hillside to form a two lane road protected with a flow over canopy with closed outer edges at the four problems gullies. If the contractors on the present scheme can work without any road closures then the flow over canopy option would not lead to closures as many officials and some politicians claim.This is a red herring postponing #a proper solution#. When this is option is completed it will save on the expense of manning the ersion route involving - personnel and - vehicles, replacing expensive nettings, delays whilst the farmer clears his animals and collect his fees. A scandalous waste of public money. Solve The Rest Landslides and stop wasting on mitigating measures.Like Brendan O#Hara I#m neither an engineer or geologist but both of us are blessed with plain common sense. If the Faroese can build a tunnel at £.m per kilometre surely a simple open sided m canopy would cost considerably less. In  at Dawlish .km of double tracked railway and .km of sturdy seawall was built at a cost of £m in eight weeks. Why have we in Argyll after nine years, four dferent Transport Ministers and £m spent and still have no guaranteed safe passage   on The Rest and Be Thankful Follow the Argyll Advertiser#s campaign #Invest in the Rest#. Transport Minister Michael Matheson, Transport Scotland and our Government must abandon their obsession with mitigation measures and fund a permanent solution. We demand no less.Sir,Calls for assurances that the Rest and Be Thankful section of the A will be improved to resist future landslides were made during a session of Transport, Infrastructure and Connectivity questions in the Scottish Parliament.I quizzed transport secretary Michael Matheson, about what was discussed at the last meeting of the A Taskforce in November , and asked what assurances the Cabinet Secretary could give to local residents and businesses who rely on the A being open at all times.The Rest and Be Thankful was closed off for nine days in October  following the largest landslide in a decade, forcing road users to either take a major ersion, or to use the Old Military Road during certain hours of the day.A number of petitions were created during the period of the incident, including one by myself, calling for a permanent solution to the Rest and Be Thankful.The transport secretary said that the meeting was #full and frank#, and that there would be a #review of the potential for additional landslide mitigation measures at the Rest and Be Thankful#, and that this would be discussed at the next A Taskforce meeting in March .There was also a commitment that Argyll and Bute would be #prioritised# in the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.I welcome the assurances by the transport secretary that there will be a review of any additional measures for the Rest and Be Thankful, and that Argyll and Bute will receive priority at the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.Donald Cameron, MSPReserve forcesSir,Last issue#sletter raising concerns about the UK government’s proposed use of the army’s reserve force in the event of a no-deal Brexit is timely.In case anyone out there still thinks a no-deal Brexit is a good idea it’s worth noting that the legal authorityof Reserve Forces Act  allowing the Secretary of State to take this step requires him to establish that it is necessary #for the alleviation of distress or the preservation of le or property in time of disaster or apprehended disaster#.Enough said.Frances Roberts, Ardrishaig"},{"url":null,"title":"honours even for red star in argyll derby","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Ropework played host to this keenly contested local derby which was watched by a healthy crowd on Saturday February .And for the second time this season, Red Star and Campbeltown Pupils shared the points in a match both sides will feel they could have won.Both sides were struggling for fluency in the opening stages but Red Star settled first and grabbed the opening goal after  minutes. A long ball to the right hand side was met by Ryan Caskie who cut the ball back to Stuart McLean. The youngster took a touch before slotting past the Pupils# goalkeeper to give Star a - lead.Star continued to press and doubled their lead when Coll McCallum robbed the Pupils# defender on the edge of the box before cutting the ball across goal. The unfortunate Pupils# defender could only ert the ball into the empty net, with McLean waiting on a tap in. The game continued at a frantic pace, however, there was no further scoring in the first half and Star went in with a - advantage.Pupils came out with purpose in the second half as they looked to force themselves back into the game, however, it was a howler from Red Star which allowed them back into the match.A square ball across the back resulted in a mix-up between Star keeper Luke Kalache and defender Ben Forbes which allowed Donald McCallum to prod the ball home from just inside the box and Pupils were back in the game at - with eight second half minutes gone.The home side didn’t recover from this and you could sense a nervousness that gave the visitors plenty encouragement. The equaliser arrived with  minutes remaining when good play from Pupils down the right by Soudan saw him get a low cross in which was met by the on-rushing run of Ryan Deans and he finished well to level the score at -.This set up a frantic finish and both sides could have nicked it towards the end. Pupils went close with a headed effort which was clawed to safety while at the other end there was a goalmouth scramble which Star couldn’t convert and both sides had to settle for a draw in the end as referee Jimmy Litster blew for full time.Red Star were dealt a blow as it emerged that captain Aaron Moore suffered a dislocated shoulder. Hopefully this will not keep him out for too long.On Saturday February , Star have another important home game as they look to move off the bottom of the table when they take on Claremont AFC. The game will be played at the Ropework or Joint Campus G # weather permitting # with a pm kick off."},{"url":null,"title":"young argyll players make their mark in shinty finals","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowEnthusiastic crowds looked on as the  National First Shinty Championships were held across two Fort William venues.The GS Campbell finals on Saturday February  brought together more than  of the best young players from across Scotland, all vying for the coveted national P and P titles.The P and under tournament was played at the Nevis Centre and the standard of play throughout the day was of the highest order with all  teams giving a great account of themselves.Section A saw Aberdour edge out a classy Strachur Kyles side on goal dference to clinch second spot.

Documents such as rent records, estate census papers, military papers, letters, maps and legal documents can offer a glimpse into the lives of people who lived across Argyll.The two-year Written in the Landscape project is set to wind up in July this year and has entailed cataloguing and digitising the Argyll Estate and other records to make them more accessible to the public.As Hannah and Jen travel round Argyll on their tour, the intention is to offer a local flavour from the archives aimed at each venue.For the Lochgilphead workshop on February , Jen and Hannah presented such erse items as #registers of the poor# and burgh court rolls from Lochgilphead, th century wage books from Kilmory Estate alongside military commission documents from the th century and a  map of the proposed Crinan Canal, surveyed by John Rennie.Each record offers a dferent insight among a treasure trove of detail.The Lochgilphead presentation followed a similar event in Campbeltown in January. Workshops will be held in March on Mull, Helensburgh in April before travelling to Strachur, Dunoon, Inveraray and Tiree in May.Further information on the Argyll Paper records can be obtained by emailing archives@inveraray-castle.

Shoppers stopped in their tracks and shopkeepers stood on their doorsteps to honour an Ayrshire soldier. Police sealed off the High Street to cars as the cortege arrived at the Kirk Port entrance to the Auld Kirk. The silence was broken only by the lament of a lone piper as Jock’s family filed their way into church. Jock’s coffin was carried into a packed service by men of the Scottish and North Irish Yeomanry. His coffin was draped in a union flag and on top were his cap, belt, his campaign medals and a wreath. A dozen colleagues in the firing party formed a guard of honour after the coffin had passed under the  lych gate. Jock, , lived in Dundonald with second we Gigliola, better known as Julie. And he ran a log and firewood business, as well as being a yeomanry reservist. He was laid to rest with full military honours at Drongan where he spent his boyhood and where parents Dan and Rita live. The father-of-two died six days after his armoured car overturned at the Catterick Garrison in Yorkshire on January . Among the mourners in the Auld Kirk was Colonel John Dalrymple Hamilton, who was representing Prince Charles. Provost Helen Moonie of South Ayrshire Council also attended the service. And there was military top brass from both regiments in which Jock served –the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards and the Scottish and North Irish Yeomanry. Other regiments represented included the Royal Engineers, the Royal Artillery, the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers and the Le Guards. Members of the Army Cadet Force were also present to pay their respects. Jock was  years in the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards, rising to be a Challenger tank commander. He survived tours of duty in Iraq, Kuwait and Kosovo, only to die in a training exercise. Auld Kirk minister Rev David Gemmell described how John McKelvie ‘grabbed le by the throat’ from his earliest days. He wasn’t much of a scholar at Drongan Primary and Auchinleck Academy, but he knew every creature that ran, crawled, swam or flew in the countryside. And a love of the great outdoors was a huge part of his le – whether it was fishing, playing rugby, ski-ing or mountain biking.  He and we Julie were fond of dogs, and Julie taught her big action man how to ride a horse, said the minister. Major Richard Boyle of the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards read the lesson - ‘To every thing there is a season’ from Ecclesiastes. There were hilarious army anecdotes from best buddy JR Ewing, telling how they had shot at each other - with paintballs. J R also mentioned how when Jock was rebuked by a French officer in Kosovo, the big man pointed to his Royal Scots Dragoon Guards cap badge – a French eagle with the word Waterloo underneath. J R, his voice breaking, concluded by saying: “He was the best soldier I ever served with and my best friend.” Former RSDG officer Will Galbraith highlighted Jock’s pride in his regiment, his family and his friends. He said: “He had a strong sense of honour, of right and wrong, and would always stand up for the underdog.” Will said: “He was a big man, with a big voice and a big heart – a big character. But when you really got to know him, he was a big softie – although you wouldn’t tell him that. You had to be aware of those big hands.” Army chaplain Rev Duncan Macpherson said there were bound to be feelings of frustration, anger and regret at the way John McKelvie died. He hoped these would be resolved, adding: “He was someone who was thoroughly tested, who rose to the challenge and who was a thoroughly professional soldier. He was passionate about vehicles and made sure his was ready for any task.” Lt Colonel Toby Gaddum, commanding officer of the Scottish and North Irish Yeomanry, led the congregation in the regimental prayer. Rev David Gemmell brought the church service to an end by poignantly reciting “We Let You Go’. The poem ends: “We love you, we miss you, we want you to be happy. Go safely, go dancing, go running home.” A collection at the end of the service raised vital cash for the Ayrshire Yeomanry Families Fund. Jock was laid to rest at Drongan Cemetery, where a guard of honour fired three volleys from their rles.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnPrince CharlesRoyal Scots Dragoon GuardsSouth Ayrshire CouncilMiddle EastArmed forcesRoyal FamilyLove and romanceDundonaldAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"ayr boxing king calvin mccord","story":"NewsAyr boxing king Calvin McCord crowned Scottish Lightweight Champion after thrilling bout at Trump TurnberryThe Ayr star won his first Scottish title in an exciting bout before a sell-out crowd in the Donald J Trump ballroom.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR NewsCalvin McCord celebrates with his title\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailRing king Calvin McCord told how he got off the canvas twice to land his first Scottish title.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":null,"title":"college staging wine fuelled feast","story":"NewsCollege staging wine-fuelled feast as job cuts loomLeaked emails tell of lavish bash at cash-strapped Ayrshire CollegeShareByStephen Houston:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR News\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailCollege bosses have defended holding a celebration to honour their success amid a climate of drastic job cuts and cash problems. Ayrshire College supremos and invited senior staff will stage a sit-down feast later this month to mark five years since its formation. The dinner for  will also include free wine after a sponsored deal by college chairman Willie Mackie. Leaked emails state the claim the college is “now regarded as one of the most successful colleges in Scotland.” But our inside source said: “It adds insult to injury that this celebration is being held less than one week before the final jobs structure is issued to staff. “It is in extremely poor taste given the circumstances of potential job losses due to lack of funds.” Evening classes are having to be cancelled so the event can be staged at the Kilmarnock campus on March . Retiring principal Heather Dunk is also to be honoured during the evening. Chairman Willie Mackie said: “She has made a signicant contribution to Ayrshire for over  years.” Ms Dunk retired on February , leaving an impending restructure which will cost jobs. A consultation ends tomorrowand it has emerged the Private Finance Initiative which built the Kilwinning campus is a huge drain on funds. An email which Ms Dunk sent to staff in January read: “We need to make signicant savings to be financially sustainable due to the costs associated with the PFI, unfunded national bargaining costs and the increasing costs of pensions, utilities and other services. I am very disappointed that an organisational review is necessary, it is not what I want to be focused on in my last weeks as principal. “However, we must manage within the financial allocation we receive in this very dficult fiscal climate.” Under the consultation, one of the four vice-principals would be axed, three directors culled, heads of learning cut from  to nine, and three marketing coms staff would go. Also at risk of the chop are two posts within estates as well as a shake-up of duties among departments. The board of management will approve the final structure and staff impacted will get a severance package. Ayrshire College acknowledged finance was a major challenge for all Scottish colleges but said the dinner costs were met by sponsorship. A spokeswoman said: “Our main financial challenge for the year ahead is to meet the costs associated with the Kilwinning PFI Campus, national bargaining costs and the increasing costs of pensions, utilities and services. “While the Scottish Funding Council has agreed to provide further strategic funds to help manage these rising costs, the college still requires to make signicant savings to secure its financial sustainability and jobs for the future. “We are, therefore, considering proposals for an organisational review. “All staff are aware of the challenges the college faces, and have contributed to a consultation regarding potential efficiencies and opportunities for income generation. “We have just passed our five-year anniversary as Ayrshire College, and have planned an event, ‘Celebrating Five Years of Success. It is important to recognise this milestone and celebrate success – for learners, staff, the college and the region. “We are mindful of the costs of holding such an event and so have secured full sponsorship.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnUniversities and CollegesAyr NewsAyrEducationKilmarnockSchoolsKilwinning"},{"url":null,"title":"giant bins placed right outside","story":"NewsGiant bins placed right outside a restaurant and pub in scenic townAnger in Troon as bin squad set up town corral without asking anyone for permissionShareByStephen Houston:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR News \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA council works gang put up a new big bin enclosure – right outside a restaurant and pub in the scenic centre of town. Now a row has broken out after it emerged one council department had not even bothered to speak to another. The unsightly corral cluster for five bins was secured in place near The Cross in Troon without any consultation. Troon Councillors have now become aware after a multitude of complaints. The cleansing department is claiming they contacted the planning department about the placing of the bins. But planners are denying any knowledge of a consultation. Troon SNP Councillor Craig Mackay is now leading the charge to find somewhere  for the bins to be situated, rather than outside the Jade Garden Chinese and Macintyre’s bar. He is asking for officials to meet councillors at the spot in Templehill to try and find a resolution. Councillor Mackay said: “We are trying to develop a coherent vision for our town centre. “I’m not convinced this is the best we can manage for such a high profile location. Cleansing regrettably installed these enclosures without any prior consultation. While it is arguably an operational matter that doesn’t require any such input,they had asked any of the councillors or the community council for comment then I am certain we would not have found ourselves in this situation. “The council’s Planning service disappointingly also appear not to have been consulted on the siting or design of this bin store within the conservation area. I don’t wish to play departments off against each other, but would seek to find a community consensus about what is appropriate for our public realm. “This will almost certainly involve an alternative solution for the bins.” A council spokesman confirmed they are investigating, saying: ““We introduced communal bins to keep the litter secure and away from gulls.

This was his first goal for the Pupils and just reward for his perseverance.It was good to see two teenagers making their mark for the club, with Ross Brown joining his academy teammate MacBrayne in a fine first half performance on opposite flanks of midfield.Nevertheless, the home side ‘stole’ into the lead in the st minute, a comic-cut situation that saw Ellis Robertson unbelievably penalised for stumbling over his own heels.The resultant free kick was delivered with venom and a headed deflection thundered into the net to restore the home side’s lead.The setback was short-lived as almost immediately the in-form Donald McCallum cut inside past two defenders to drive the ball high into the roof of the net for a superb equaliser.This heralded the Pupils# best spell of the match, with Ross Brown ending a great move with a volley that left the keeper rooted to the spot.But the goal, arguably the best of the match, was ruled out for offside.Ryan McConnachie was next to try his luck with an audacious overhead kick that just cleared the bar.Lady luck deserted the cause when the referee awarded a soft penalty kick to home club.The visitors were a goal behind despite dominating most of the second half.With  minutes remaining the league leaders looked to have sealed the points when a tactical long throw was forced home to give ‘the Port’ a two goal advantage.However, in an exciting end to another close fought match, Lee Allen scored a towering header from a Donald McCallum corner to make the score -.Despite a great effort in the closing minutes, the Pupils couldn’t score to get their just reward.Having played well and given everything, the visitors ed home with nothing to show for their efforts.TomorrowCampbeltown Pupilsto home action with another dficult match against third-placed Hillington at Kintyre Park with a pm kick off.  See social media and posters for confirmation of venue.Fraser MacBrayne in action earlier this season at Kintyre Park. _cpupils"},{"url":null,"title":"drama festivals farcical first night","story":"Accent Players# Grave Prospects, by Isabella C Rae, a mix of ghosts and the living, set in a contemporary graveyard, gave plenty of scope for laughs.Mission to Planet Bob, set in , staged by Dunaverty Players, cut the stage cast down to three suspended animation astronauts: Amy , Katieand Ed .Peninver Players# slapstick Melons at the Parsonage was the final Friday act with two plays within a third at an imaginary drama festival.At times Peninver#s action became confusing and caused adjudicator Jim Gibson to declare that he hoped he was not like its adjudicator Ted .Adjudicating at the end of the night, Mr Gibson said that the connection between all three plays was that they all ended in controlled lunacy.Speaking about Accent Players, Mr Gibson said: #There were very good dferent levels of set on the stage.#The make-up was nicely judged, particularly the ghosts, shades of grey but not .#I would have liked to have seen patchier lighting on stage, as it was fairly unorm, and perhaps some spots.#What was really nice was the fog coming on from stage left which reminded me of ectoplasm.#There was lots of good off-the-ball acting.

Such days are ones which have been borrowed from another month, and I think given the temperature and weather we have had recently the days have been borrowed from May.In , May will have borrowed Februaryrsquos days, so we can expect some unseasonal weather in that month as well, but in a dferent way.Sunday was a borrowed day for sure it was so mild and the later part sunny with a feeling of spring in the air. It was a perfect day for a discovery.We set off to find a place Irsquod only recently heard about. A friend had asked me what I knew about the lsquoKingrsquos Chairrsquo by Gullane. I had to admit that Irsquod never heard of it. He told me one of the holes at the golf course there has this name, but it seems it is named after a location nearby.This set me investigating. Sure enough, I found it marked on the map and searched for an image, which I found on a website called Ancient Stones: a large boulder, shaped like a throne, guarded by two other stones either side. It intrigued me and so our quest began.The starting point of our adventure was Gullane Beach car park. I knew roughly where to look but purposefully hadnrsquot brought the map so that we had a challenge to find the lsquochairrsquo. We knew what it looked like and that we needed to walk along the upper path, not the one that heads for the beach.We went the wrong way at first and got stuck in a mass of sea buckthorn, but on reflection that just added to the sense of adventure and achievement. We soon found our way and then suddenly there it was, up on Gullane Hill. The kids ran excitedly towards the stones, shouting: ldquoFound it, found it.I felt quite exhilarated at the discovery, and to be honest impressed by the sight of the Kingrsquos Chair. I can see how it got its name, as it looks something like a majestic reclining armchair. The two boulders on either side of it look like sentries keeping watch.The kids sat on it, of course, and I had to wait my turn after my we, who reckoned it could just as easily be a lsquoQueenrsquos Chairrsquo.When I finally got a chance to seat my majestic posterior on the chair, I realised the view was majestic as well, with Gullane Beach very visible in the near distance.I reflected on the fact we had recently visited Edinburgh Castle and seen the Stone of Destiny or Stone of Scone, along with the crown jewels. This rather uninspiring stone in Edinburgh Castle may be the coronation stone used for  years in England, but it is not, I am sure, the coronation stone used by ancient kings of Scotland, despite official claims that it is.I think itrsquos pretty clear that Edward I never got his hands on the real Stone of Destiny and I am convinced it has remained in Scotland, hidden somewhere, ever since. It occurred to me that this stone actually better fitted the early description of the original coronation stone at Scone than the one in Edinburgh Castle.ldquoImaginethis is the real Stone of Destiny and has been here all the time, I said fancully out loud. I know it isnrsquot, of course, but I have to saythis Kingrsquos Chair was on display at Edinburgh Castle it would certainly look more authentic.But sadly there seems to be no recorded tradition connected to this Kingrsquos Chair. I could find no story, or reference to the origin of its name. Perhaps some local people have some information on this There is an entry from the s that records the name, citing locals as the source, so there is some historic veracity in its title. But no suggestion is offered for the origin of the name, or any tradition associated with the stone. Its geology I could not say but it doesnrsquot seem to be a glacial erratic.And so we are left to wonder. We discussed how the stone got here and how it got its name. Maybe some children played here many generations ago and gave the boulder its title. Perhaps a Viking king who landed on Gullane Beach sat himself down on this natural throne to survey his warriors at their bloody work.Whatever the origin, the name, the location and the nature of the stone make this a worthwhile and fun discovery, even without a firm legend attached to it.And as I sat on the chair I watched smoke billowing from the coastline a little further to the west, close to the edge of Aberlady nature reserve. What caused the fire I didnrsquot know, but even from a distance it seemed destructive.It was a prophetic sight to witness from the Kingrsquos Chair. It looked like a burning coastline from a Viking raid. Thankfully the distant screech of fire engines told us help was on the way. The children wanted to go see the fire, but we kept our distance from the flames and let the firefighters do their job.So the trip to the Kingrsquos Chair had been an adventure in more ways than one. On our way back, the children advanced dferent theories about the origin of the name. It was universally agreed that a story must be made, but no agreement on the actual tale.ldquoPerhaps, I said, ldquowe should leave it to the imagination of those who search for and discover it, so they can sit and feel the power of the place and get ideas.My imagination was certainly ablaze. I saw the leader of the ancient Gododdin tribe, King Loth, sitting on the stone, looking out to the Firth as he watched his terried daughter in a small coracle being taken out to the open sea, his brutal punishment for her defiance of his authority.The story would fit as her journey began at Aberlady Bay, and so her small craft would have been seen from the Kingrsquos Chair as it passed by, being pulled out to sea by one of the kingrsquos boats.Itrsquos all a fancy of my imagination, of course, but thatrsquos my story.

Tell you that therersquos going to be a referendum on Brexit, that the ERG are back in their box, Jezza has finally come good, and Theresa May has been put in a secure unit. But I canrsquot in all honesty agree with commentators, like the blessed Polly Toynbee, who believe we are now on the road to redemption.Yes, Labour did repeat its promise to hold a referendumJeremy Corbynrsquos ldquoworkable plan of a permanent customs union is rejected ndash as it was in one of last weekrsquos many meaningless votes. Oh, and Labour will support a referendumthere is no General Election. Anda no deal Tory deal looks likely. If, , .ButLabour really wanted to eliminate the threat of no deal, it would have moved heaven and earth to deliver the SNPrsquos motion calling for precisely that.Looking back on this dismal week, the standout, surely, is the arrant insanity of Parliament ndash a rational body of elected representatives ndash failing to take the opportunity to rule out an event which would put the army on the streets, interrupt food and medicine supplies, and cause the loss of tens of thousands of jobs.Yes, the Yvette Cooper Oliver Letwin amendmentwas endorsed by Parliament overwhelmingly, after Theresa May gave it the nod. This means that there will be an extension to Article Parliament doesnrsquot support a deal by March . Well and good. If therersquos one thing the UK Parliament is supremely good at itrsquos failing to agree.It doesnrsquot like Mayrsquos botched deal, the Norway option, EFTA or any other solution that Brussels thinks acceptable. So that means an extension is inevitable. Except that the French president Emmanuel Macron and the Brussels negotiator, Michel Barnier, have made clear that the  countries of the EU , will only contemplate delaying Britainrsquos departure from the EUit is for ldquoa purpose. Holding more meaningless votes, staging more ministerial resignations and arguing on College Green outside Parliament do not, one suspects, constitute a legitimate purpose.Still, everyone seems convinced that an extension is in the bag. This led to largely unwarranted excitement on the Remain side. With Labour calling for a Peoplersquos Voteand Theresa Mayrsquos deadline finally breached, Twitter went into orbit. Lord Adonis all but declared victory in the Battle of Brexit. Europhiles were dancing in the streets, metaphorically at least, and jeering at the nasty Brexiters who had been defeated by the forces of good. It was like the last reel of Lord of the Rings.But such triumphalism was premature. Much as I wish it were the case, there is still no majority in Parliament for a referendum. Stephen K Bush, the political editor of the New Statesman, has been counting them out and counting them back in again and he is adamant that the Labour Brexit rebels will prevent any motion for a referendum passing through Parliament. He says at least  Labour MPs are opposed. Hersquos right.ldquoRebels here is something of a misnomer since there is widespread belief that Brexit is the outcome desired by their leader. Indeed, on one interpretation of last weekrsquos events, Jeremy Corbyn has managed to find a way to secure Brexit while also appearing to support a referendum. This is because what is called the Kyle Wilson amendment.This cross-party proposal, which Labour is minded to support on March , calls for MPs to agree to Theresa Mayrsquos deal , but only on the condition that there is a referendum to validate it. Bingo. Labour can tell all its working-class Brexit supporters in target marginals that, yes, it didnrsquot block Brexit. But Jeremy can also curry favour with the Remainiacs of Islington by appearing to support a Peoplersquos Vote.Itrsquos very clever, but to my mind somewhat bonkers. Why would Labour help pass Theresa Mayrsquos deal, which Jeremy Corbyn has said is worse than no deal, would lose thousands of jobs and would lock the UK into a backstop from which it cannot escape  At least this is what he has said repeatedly in the Commons.Surely, a vote is a vote. Theresa May could legitimately say that her deal has been endorsed by Parliament, and call on Labour to campaign for it in any referendum. Not that she has the slightest intention of calling a referendum.Theresa Mayrsquos strategy is the same as it ever was: not listening, nothing has changed, take it or leave it. It pains me to say it, but the Prime Minister at least has a strategy. It is to run down the clock, while allowing the ious tribes in Parliament and in her Cabinet, to fall out among themselves.Itrsquos working. Labour is moving ever more in the direction of her deal, however much they may deny it. Parliament canrsquot agree on anything.There are tears in Cabinet and more resignations ndash  from the Government so far. But whorsquos counting  The European Research Group ndash that comically misnamed faction of extreme Brexiters ndash has reportedly split over William Rees-Moggrsquos equivocation on the Irish backstop.And while all about is chaos and acrimony, so ticks away the clock until Brexit day. Twenty-eight days at the time of writing. Goodness me, is that really the time  Yes it is. As in the film of the same name, the zombies are stirring.I accept that is an offensive way to describe Nigel Faragersquos ldquoBrexit Betrayal march from Sunderland to London. But it could get nasty on the road.What do I think will happen in the end  As Irsquove been saying in this column since Christmas, I think Parliament will block a no-deal Brexit. There will be an extension of Article , and Labour will probably end up backing Mayrsquos deal, or abstaining on it which amounts to the same thing.If Labour, by some remote chance, continues to reject Mayrsquos deal or its iants, in the meaningful vote on the inglorious twelfth, then I think MPs would still reject a referendum. There is still no majority for one, and Labourrsquos die-hard Brexiters are not for turning.Which makes the most likely option ndash about the only one Theresa May can authorise as PM under her prerogative powers ndash would be to revoke Article . Pull the plug. End it.OK, so thatrsquos wishful thinking on my part. Her Government would fall and precipitate an election. But looking at the chaos that is Brexit, and the lack of time, it seems as good a shout as any, especiallyBrussels reject a meaningless extension.If Britain canrsquot decide how to leave the EU, an extension to Article  would be pointless. The sensible thing to do would be to cancel Brexit, go away, and think again."},{"url":null,"title":"footage-reveals-cracks-in-nuclear-reactor-in-north-ayrshire","story":"The unit at Hunterston B in North Ayrshire has not been operating since the cracks were found to be growing faster than expected.A planned inspection of the graphite bricks that make up the core of reactor threein March last year uncovered new ldquokeyway root cracks.EDF Energy said these have now grown to an average of mm wide.The firm has released footage of the cracks, which was taken in  and .Station director Colin Weir told BBC Scotland: ldquoNuclear safety is our overriding priority and reactor three has been off for the year so that we can do further inspections.ldquoWersquove carried out one of our biggest ever inspection campaigns on reactor three, wersquove renewed our modelling, wersquove done experiments and tests and wersquove analysed all the data from this to produce our safety case that we will submit to the Office for Nuclear Regulation.ldquoWe have to demonstrate that the reactor will always shut down and that it will shut down in an extreme seismic event."},{"url":null,"title":"jeremy-corbyn-snp-neglecting-the-poor-to-chase-independence","story":"The Labour leader will say the real ide in society \"is not between people who voted yes or no for independence\",but between law-abiding workersand the tax-dodging rich.He will also tell his partyrsquos Scottish conference that ldquoclimate change is a class issue as it will have the greatest impact on the poor and marginalised and addressing it is a ldquosocialist priority.Mr Corbyn is due to give the closing speech on the first day of the gathering in Dundee.:Jeremy Corbyn backed Scottish independence during a private conversation with Mhairi BlackHe is due to tell delegates: ldquoThe truth about Labour is, wersquore not obsessed by constitutional questions, like the others are.ldquoWersquore obsessed with tackling the problems people face in their daily lives.

It is therefore unsurprising that barn owls in the north of Scotland have a hard time during the winter months, with peak mortality rates being between December and March due to starvation.As temperatures start to drop in winter, small mammals become less active, meaning a lot less food is available for barn owls, and they need to work extra-hard to find it. This often results in the owls being forced to feed during daylight, even though they are naturally nocturnal hunters.This lack of food is particularly dangerous for barn owls as they are poorly insulated and need more food in winter to provide them with enough energy to stay warm.The Barn Owl Trust estimates that between  and  barn owls are killed each year on UK roads.RSPB Scotland site manager Dave Jones recently sent a deceased barn owl to the Scottish Agricultural College in Thurso for autopsy, when some concerned neighbours reported it after finding it at the roadside.The results of the autopsy showed that the bird was fit and healthy, \"in good shape and hunting successfully\", and that the death followed trauma to its wing and abdomen ndash suggesting that the bird died as a result of being hit by a vehicle.Dave said: \"It is extremely sad to discover that a fit and healthy birds le ended in this way. The barn owls in Caithness really are at the edge of their natural comfort zone and are particularly vulnerable in winter, so it isnt an unusual result, unfortunately. Its not all doom and gloom, though.

If you see a road casualty and it is safe to do so, please stop and report the find to your local wildle officer and to the Barn Owl Trust.

He questioned Minister for Public Finance, Kate Forbes MSP, in the Scottish Parliament earlier this afternoon, Wednesday, asking how this shortfall squares with the government’s commitment to the principle of fair funding for our leline internal ferry services.According to the Orkney MSP, the minister responded by saying that the government recognise the challenges in running these ferry services and that they have been clear in their budget that adequate funding is to be delivered.Commenting after the exchange, Mr McArthur said: “We now know that the Scottish Government has cut funding for Orkney’s internal ferry services by £, compared to last year.  This has left a £.m shortfall in the Council’s budget for delivering these leline services.#It is baffling how Ministers think this approach is consistent with their commitment to the principle of fair ferry funding.  It certainly flies in the face of the will of parliament, which voted for the government to deliver on its earlier promises.“Meantime, the island communities that rely on these leline services are left picking up the tab, including a three per cent increase in fares this year.  Ministers may ‘recognise’ the challenges of running these services, but they also must recognise their obligations genuinely to provide adequate funding.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

As the airline’s marketing chief Natalie Bowman put it: “We’re excited to showcase a pilot who’s risen to super hero status - an image that embodies strength and confidence and inspires future aviators across our expansive network to go further.”Scotland may not have any female airline chiefs, and Amanda McMillan, who ran the Glasgow, Aberdeen and Southampton airports group has moved on.However, there have been signicant appointments in other areas, with Syeda Ghufran last summer becoming ScotRail’s first female engineering director.: Alastair Dalton: Experts reveal Scotland’s transport heaven – and hellHaving joined the operator from university as a management trainee nine years ago, she has talked of wanting to change perceptions and encourage more young women to consider engineering “as a viable and rewarding career”.In a further positive sign, half of ScotRail’s latest engineering apprentices are female, albeit there is a big inbalance to address.A second important development was former Scottish Prison Service and Scottish Police Authority executive Catherine Topley becoming chief executive of Scottish Canals.She has a keen awareness of the waterways’ potential to improve people’s lives, from youngsters learning boating skills and elderly people getting the chance to enjoy green space to opportunities for deprived communities along the banks.: Alastair Dalton: The vested interest blocking cuts to air pollutionOther high-profile women who provide key role models include the managers of Scotland’s two busiest stations, Juliet Donnachie at Edinburgh Waverley and Susan Holden at Glasgow Central.The latter’s profile will be raised by being featured in a six-part series on the station which started on the new BBC Scotland channel last Sunday.However, Scotland’s railways - and the rest of transport - still has far to go. Only one in five of ScotRail’s ,-strong workforce are women. There’s the same disparity across transport despite women accounting for nearly half the working population.Women’s influence in the sector has never been as important considering they use the two most popular forms of transport more than men. Slightly more travel to work by carand women are the majority of bus passengers -  per cent.In addition, more women have driving licences than a decade ago -  per cent in  compared to  per cent ten years before.But there are also areas of transport where females are under-represented.Only  per cent cycle to work - half as many as men, and only . per cent of girls cycle to school, compared to . per cent of boys.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"royal mile treasure trove of mary queen of scots documents found","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...A treasure trove of documents signed by Mary Queen of Scots and revealing the #everyday reality of ruling the country# in the th century has been unearthed in a council storage facility on the Royal Mile.A haul of handwritten papers is said to show the doomed monarch “carefully managing the busy commercial le of Edinburgh”, as well as authorising the building of new defences for the city in Leith.The documents, which are set to be the centrepiece of a new exhibition in Edinburgh on Mary’s short-lived rule, have already been conserved and digitised to allow them to be viewed publicly on the council’s online archive. They were discovered by staff in a store at the Museum of Edinburgh, just a few hundred yards away from the Palace of Holyroodhouse, where Mary ruled for six years after ing from France in . The  documents, which are inidually dated, numbered and signed, relate to the rights of deacons and tradesmen in the city, the selling of meat at the Tolbooth and the making of salt in Newhaven.Early conservation work on the documents, which were recently discovered in the Museum of Edinburgh’s own storage facility off the Canongate, has revealed watermarks – one of a goat and another of a flower – which can only been seen when held up to light.It is thought the papers entered the archives of the local authority in the s, but were then “lost” before being rediscovered nearly a century later during conservation work. Intriguingly, some of the documents signed by Mary date from when she was still in France.Experts in the council’s museums and galleries service, which is responsible for the official archives of the city, said the recently unearthed documents revealed an “often overlooked “ aspect of her le.History curator Vicky Garrington said: “Together, the documents shed light on a key part of Scotland’s past. We all know the tragic story of Mary Queen of Scots, her eventful le and eventual execution in , but in these documents we see a dferent side to Mary.“Here, she can be seen carefully managing the everyday affairs of Edinburgh, both from France and Scotland.

Over the last few weeks KPL staff have been busy ferrying equipment, supplies and crews out to it as part of the first such contract secured by the yard. During a visit, I expected to find a hive of activity the roar and clang of big machines.But on Thursday of last week I found the whole site surprisingly quiet. This, I am told, is because most of the activity is now taking place onboard what KPL directors refer to as the OGW.“The rig is crawling with insurance people and regulators right now,” says one of the directors, Simon Russell, as he shows me round. “They are all signing off their bits and pieces before the rig gets the final piece of paper that says it’s good to go.”Every weld is being stress tested. Every item of equipment is being put through its paces.Before the rig can face the punishing swells of the north Atlantic, such attention to detail is a matter of le and death.There are also inquisitive guests onboard, doing a little window shopping. They’ve been helicoptered straight on to the rig, the property of US firm Diamond Offshore. These VIPs are potential customers from major players such as Tarka Oil, here to see what the buzz is all about. While doing so, they may also be mightily impressed with Kishorn Port Ltd. That is the hope, anyway.As you are reading this, there is a good chance the Ocean GreatWhite, with a crew of  aboard, will be making its way back up the Minch. If the weather is favourable it may even be doing so under its own steam, without the need for a fleet of tugs to tow it to the Blackrock prospect, some  miles north west of Shetland.So advanced is the OGW that each corner-leg contains two enormous thrusters, powered by engines capable of generating , brake horse power of thrust. For non-petrol-heads that’s  Ferraris per engine. A top speed of eight knots is the result. Not bad for a structure that isn’t exactly designed to cut through the water. Stability is the name of game: even in the roughest seas the thrusters are meant to ensure that the rig doesn’t deviate by more than a metre from the drill point. West of Shetland, it may need every Newton of force those thrusters can provide. Once safely in place, the Ocean GreatWhite will be used by Siccar Point Energy and Shell UK to test for oil in an unexplored area of the seabed.“This is really cutting edge stuff,” enthuses Alasdair Ferguson, the other director in this   venture involving his own firm, Ferguson Transport and Shipping, and Simon’s LeithsLtd. “The rig can operate in , feet of water and drill a hole , feet deep.”In other words, that’s six miles into the earth’s crust. This is how far down we now have to go to get the black stuff. As the ‘Age of Oil’ wanes, rigs like the OGW could become the workhorses of the near future.However, the days of building giant concrete caissons to support them are long gone. Whatever finished products emerge from Kishorn in the next few years, another Ninian Central will not be among them. Deep water is where the action is – and that means floating oil rigs like the Ocean GreatWhite, a sixth-generation model designed specically to harvest the hard-to-reach hydrocarbons that now makes up much of what the UK still produces. Thankfully for Kishorn, that means west of Shetland.  According to Simon, this trend involves the “centre of gravity” shting away from Aberdeen and towards the west coast.KPL is ready and waiting for that trend to continue.“The same thing is happening with offshore wind,” says Simon. “If you look at the next round of Crown licenses you’ll see that most of them are here on the west coast.”“We want to create a multi-use facility,” adds Alasdair. “We want to build resilience into this facility so that it is not reliant on any one industry.”Offshore wind turbines need concrete caissons, albeit smaller than the Ninian Central’s. That’s another box ticked in favour of Kishorn.From about  metres away, the Ocean GreatWhite does indeed look like a floating hotel, to use Simon’s description. Unfortunately, this is as close as we are allowed to get. Obtaining insurance cover for non-crew is a minefield Diamond Offshore also doesn’t want any photographs taken of their cutting-edge equipment. So circling the rig aboard the ‘Infinity’ will have to do for us.Aside from ferrying crew to and from the Ocean GreatWhite, the ‘Infinity’ usually takes tourists out to St Kilda from the Stein jetty in Waternish. But that happens mostly in the summer.“We have been flat out doing this since the rig arrived,” says skipper Kenny Mackinnon.Regular work over the winter is good for those who don’t usually have it.In fact, the arrival of the OGW has been a boon for the area. Twelve locals have been taken on in ious positions. This is the direct benefit. There is a harder to quanty knock-on effect for local businesses in what Alasdair refers to as the “downstream supply chain”. Everything from additional bed nights to sandwiches bought in the nearest shops are covered by this concept. And there have been quite a few of those over the last six weeks.Food and lodgings for visiting crews and subcontracted workers might sound like small beer, however. But the temporary largesse created by the presence of the OGW could be the start of something much bigger.Nothing like the crazy days of the s and s, though, when a town of , people sprung up in accommodation blocks behind the dry dock. That kind of development, said Simon, will not happen again, partly because of the strain it would place on local infrastructure.  Instead, he envisions - people employed directly at the site.The prefabs of Kishorn’s heyday are long gone but the dry dock is still here, its original concrete floor as good as new, so I’m told. The faint imprint of the Ninian Central , once the biggest manmade object ever moved across the face of the Earth, is still visible a spectral impression of the past.KPL have more modest ambitions than trying to resurrect what was.Simon and Alasdair are building in small steps. They’re making progress, just at a slower pace than many would like to see.Further investment is required to speed things up. That, however, is based partly on more rigs using the yard. KPL have a few irons in the fire on that front, but nothing definite yet.“The revenue this will generate will enable us to extend one of the piers, out into the deeper water, so we can load and unload directly rather than having to ferry equipment and people back and forth,” says Alasdair.Just sixty metres from the shore Loch Kishorn reaches a depth of around  metres, easily enough to accommodate oil rigs which, it should be remembered, need taken apart when they’ve reached the end of their working lives. Decommissioning s is on the KPL menu too.If , jobs were a flash in the pan,  jobs might be the sustainable optimum. By definition, the slow build lasts longer than the quick buck.In this place of big numbers,  might be big enough."},{"url":null,"title":"castle tower pupils are guests of honour for ballymena s royal visit","story":"Staff and pupils from Castle Tower made memories to last a letime after they were special guests at the recent Royal visit to Ballymena.A delegation from the school was invited to The Braid to personally greet the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge on their arrival in the town.With several hundred well-wishers turning out to cheer Prince William and Catherine, young people at Castle Tower were provided a unique vantage point, with many shaking hands and chatting with the couple.The pupils were joined by Castle Tower governors Councillor Audrey Wales MBE and Anne Donaghy, chief executive of Mid and East Antrim Borough Council.Cllr.

As Moy Park celebrates  years in business, Aaron reflects on changes in the sector and milestones along the way. He said: “I first joined Moy Park in  when I was still at school, working part time at the weekends as a factory operative. “As a student, it was a great insight into the world of work and business. It taught me the value of hard work, money earned, and motivated me to want to do more of both! “After gaining a degree in Health and Leisure from Queen’s University Belfast, I was keen to move into a business environment and decided to apply to Moy Park’s Graduate Management Programme, to find out more about a career in one of our fastest growing industries, agri-food. “The two-year programme was the ideal way to find out more about ious strands of a business, from operations to finance, HR and marketing, and what might suit my skillset best. “From my time as a sht worker on the factory floor, I had a healthy respect and interest in the processing side of Moy Park, and the opportunities and challenges therein. “Once I completed the Graduate Management Programme - which we still use as a recruitment tool today - I took up a position as a sht manager, capitalising on my people management skills and interest in operations. “Since then, I have worked my way up across a number of Moy Park’s sites – moving from factory manager to area manager and have now been General Manager at Ballymena for two years. “Ballymena is a great place to work. From a business point of view, it’s strategically located with fantastic transport links and from a social standpoint, you’ll never find yourself wanting for something to do – from shopping to socialising over a drink or a bite to eat. It’s also quickly becoming the spa capital of Northern Ireland! “While Ballymena has faced a number of economic challenges, it’s an area with a rich history and heritage of business success. This spirit is still very much evidenced by the people, businesses and organisations in the town today. “Mid and East Antrim Council has an ambitious integrated economic development strategy for the area to help encourage business growth across the borough, and it’s one we are keen to help support. “It’s a strategy important not just to Moy Park as a business, but to me personally. “I sit on Mid and East Antrim Council’s Manufacturing Task Force Team, a working group committed to supporting and fostering growth. I was delighted to attend Westminster with a delegation from the Task Force recently when Northern Ireland representatives presented their plans for a Belfast City Deal. “Hearing these plans certainly gave us food for thought when it comes to nurturing growth locally. “As Ballymena’s General Manager, I’m responsible for all business s at the site – from technical to HR and finance. “With over , members of staff, it’s a erse and busy job but that’s what makes it worth doing. In the last  years, business management has evolved signicantly. “While there might be more paperwork, regulations, travel and late nights, there is also an incredible amount of collaboration - with customers, industry, educational bodies and government and our local communications. “Managers today cannot afford to work in silos, you need to adopt an attitude of knowledge sharing and foster an environment of innovation to truly succeed. “My key piece of advice to anyone viewing management as a career is to do your research and bolster your skillsyou need to. Being a good manager isn’t a static position, you constantly need to challenge yourself, and a good employer is one who lets you not only challenge yourself but equips you with the skills to overcome these challenges. “One of my own personal highlights over the last  years was been being named ‘Young Processor of the Year’ at the Meat and Poultry Processing Awards in . “Given my background working on the factory floor, it was great to win an industry award. At a business level, I’ve been very proud to see Ballymena evolve to become a Centre of Excellence, focused on driving innovation in food manufacturing. “As General Manager, it’s my ambition to see our facilities continue to grow.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1460409.jpg--.jpg?1550570234000\n","title":"children from gran canaria welcomed to ballymena","story":"A group of children from Gran Canaria have been visiting Ballymena to take part in the annual local music festival.The group of  children are pupils of the British School of Gran Canaria, and are taught by local woman Claire McDonald.Claire, who is the head of the music department at the English speaking school has accompanied her pupils to Northern Ireland to take part in the festival, sightsee, improve their English skills and experience the culture of Northern Ireland.The young people, who are all aged between  and  years old are keen musicians, with some playing the piano, drums, violins while others are singers.They have experienced success at the festival, with some winning first and second prizes and others were highly commended.The group have been travelling around NI, visiting the Giant’s Causeway, Hillsborough Castle and the Titanic museum and performed in a local concert with Kellswater Flute Band.This has been their first taste of Northern Ireland, and it did not disappoint!One of the students, Miguel said: “I’ve really enjoyed my trip. “I play the drums and the musical festival has been great.“We learn English at school so it’s good to speak it here.”Fellow student Alicia, said: “Northern Ireland is great and the festival has been a wonderful experience.“I was really excited to play with the band but my favourite part was the Giant’s Causeway and the music festival.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1460481.jpg--.jpg?1550570359000\n","title":"rodney quigley announces independent candidacy","story":"Ballymena man Rodney Quigley has announced he plans to stand in this year’s Council elections.Announcing his candidacy on Facebook this week, the well known community activist posted: “I intend to stand as an Independent candidate in the Mid and East Antrim council elections on nd May.“As someone who has worked tirelessly as a community worker for over  years, and as a member of the policing and community safety partnership for  years, I feel that I have something to offer at local council level.“I have dealt with many community issues in the past and will continue to put the community first on any issues that are brought to my attention. “Ive also worked with many councillors on many issues in the past and would continue to work along side them for the good of everyone in Ballymena.“I know that many people have said its time for change and it would be good to see a few new faces within Mid and East Antrim council.“If this is the case Id like to be one of the new faces.“I can assure people thatelected, I will put my best foot forward every time and will work to resolve local issues for everyone in Ballymena.”Election datesNomination forms for prospective candidates must be ed to the Deputy Returning Officer by pm on Monday April , .The election will be held on Thursday, May , .

The little trawlers are impounded, their crews taken hostage. But why Captain Jamie Bryson was once the Royal Navy’s most decorated and respected nuclear sub commander. But now he’s living in semi-retirement in the sleepy backwater of Donaghadee, tending his garden by day, chairing the parish council by night. When the call comes from Whitehall for him to take to the conning tower for one last top-secret mission, Captain Jamie has to make a choice between his chrysanths and his country#“Action, romance, danger, flute music. This one has it all.” The Ballymena .“An explosive tale of international intrigue that gallops breathlessly from Glengormley to Dundalk and straight to the gates of hell.” Shankill Buy and Sell.“A really cracking holiday read and, believe me, I know what I’m talking about.” Ian Paisley Jnr.“But Sinn Féin.” Slugger O’Toole.Chapter oneCONTACT‘Up periscope!’Captain Jamie Bryson’s voice was tight with tension as he barked the order. He bent and took the handles, his knuckles whitening with the force of his grip. He welcomed the cold anger, it made him feel alive he channelled it, bent it to his will. Anger and training: the fighting man’s best friends – how well he remembered that from his first day at Submarine School Newtownards.The Astute class hunter-killer nuclear submarine sat sleek and silent  metres below the cold, dark Irish Sea. Captain Jamie’s eyes narrowed as he slowly scanned the still waters of Clogherhead harbour, past the pastel colours of the little trawler fleet until at last his crosshairs came to rest on the dull grey hull of the LÉ Orla. The battlecruiser lay squat and sinister in a corner of the harbour commanding a direct view of the two kidnapped Ulster fishing boats, the Amity and the Boy Joseph, two of its four .mm heavy machine-guns trained on the wheelhouses where captain and crew lay on the floor trussed up like pigs.Captain Jamie pushed the periscope handles into the closed position and took a step backward. “Battle stations,” he rasped, “make ready forward torpedo hatches”Executive Officer Willie Frazer’s face creased into a mask of doubt and uncertainty. “But Captain, we’re under strict orders to maintain a watching brief.”He’d served under Captain Jamie for close on  years and never questioned an order – no need to, for Captain Jamie was a Man of the Sea: confident, experienced, exuding an air of calm authority that brooked no dissent.“Mr Frazer, you have your orders.” Captain Jamie’s words were low, but there was no mistaking his deadly seriousness.“Yes, Captain.”A light wind ruffled the short sleeves of Captain Jamie’s immaculately-pressed white shirt and a weak winter sun glinted off the shiny black peak of his cap as he took his place on the conning tower. He fixed his binoculars on the brooding hulk of the LÉ Orla and stood fixed and resolute as a statue. At his shoulder, XO Frazer gripped the cold metal around him to stop his hands from shaking. Though he didn’t take his eyes from the glass, Captain Jamie sensed his number two’s unease.“Mr Frazer,” he said, his gaze still on the enemy ship. “If those trawlers aren’t released by noon, we open fire. Ulster demands it.”• The Clogherhead Convention.

It is not without irony that the words spoken at that event proved this week to be prescient.Law is meant to provide a moral compass for society, allow us a set of norms by which we agree to conduct society and protect the vulnerable. We live in streets where for decades law was either disregarded or used as a tool in a weaponry of oppression. Those reading this paper who were subjected to the ignominy of its abuse will all know too well what happens when law does not work. It incites and prolongs conflict, harm and pain. But most of all the corruption of law leads to despair. Where can we gowe do not have the protection of law The single most important achievement of the Good Friday Agreement was the review of criminal justice. It was a recognition that the corruption of law needed to be endedwe were to truly ensure our conflict never happened again.When the Supreme Court in London delivered its findings in the challenge by the Finucane family to the decision by the British government not to hold a public inquiry, it was a finding in law. It was not about Weston Park, nor about governmental promises, nor about changing economic environments. It was about what was right in law. And with its clear, non-political eye, saw that an inquiry was required into this pernicious example of state collusion in the killing of an officer of the courts.When last week there was an announcement that inquests would at last have appropriate structure and funding this was because of the domestic and international courts refusing any argument that the application of the rule of law could be subject to political favour or will. Legal compliance is not subject to negotiation.No matter who the citizen is, whatever their background, they should expect the law to defend them. No matter how big the power, whatever their political philosophy, they should expect the law to hold them to account. That is how it works. And it can remedy previous imbalance.Right now, the long arm of those who abused their position and the law in the RUC is reaching into the PSNI to undermine the courts addressing the crimes of the past. Alongside elements of the military and security services these vested interests are doing it because the law, through its courts and processes such as the Police Ombudsman, is holding previous members of state agencies and the narrative of the state as upholders of law and order to account. This is a critical time.

During the piece I never mention death, I never mention anything being lost, in fact I say very little. The piece is very movement-based, it’s an interpretation of grief, because I wouldn’t be able to stand up and talk about it. I wouldn’t want to and I don’t think anyone would be really interested in listening to that either – not really.”Asked why she has chosen to take on something so raw and so close, Róisín tells me: “Well, it is something that keeps coming up in conversation. For me, it was a real compulsion to remember daddy, born out of a fear of forgetting him. I recorded him speaking when he was sick and those recordings have become the soundscape for this piece. His voice is very present in the piece. “I could just do this for myself and not show it to anyone. I could just write it all down and put it under my bed and that would be a part of my grief process. People can be in the same space and share what is a very universal, inevitable thing for every single human being.“I don’t think we as a society are really that great at dealing with grief. “There was a time I wanted to make myself a little badge saying, ‘I’m grieving, please be patient with me.’ Hopefully this piece is a good way for people to share and create conversation – some people might not want to talk and that’s fine. I think that the bottom line is about putting trust and faith in the universe, in nature and the hope and comfort that this is a cycle and we live on.I want people to feel comforted and feel hopeful in some way and I want them to see what I clung on to. Ultimately I want to do daddy justice.”• Natural Disaster is on at the MAC on March  and . Tickets for the play are priced at £.

redevelopment of Casement Park could be approved even without a minister being in place..pushUlster GAA has said it received correspondence from the Department for Infrastructurethis week which said that despite there being no ministers at Stormont, the Department may make the final decision on the Casement Park planning application.However, the Ulster GAA expressed frustrations at the time it took to conclude the assessment process, adding that DfI has acknowledged the delay and has confirmed that responses will be issued as soon as possible. The new projected cost of the redevelopment has jumped to £ million, £m more than the west Belfast stadium plans original budget of £m.Tom Daly, Chairman Casement Park Project Board, said, “The planning application for the redevelopment of Casement Park was submitted in February , yet over two years later theof time it is taking for some statutory bodies to respond to the planning authority is a cause of frustration within our project team and across the wider GAA community.“Our expert team has worked closely with the Department for Communitiesto support all requirements within the planning process.  We implemented government recommendations in full, extensively consulted and produced a highly detailed and comprehensive planning submission to ensure the planning authority had all the information it required to make an informed decision on our plans to deliver upon the strategic stadium needs of our members and our communities.\"Pictured with Ulster GAAs planning application for a new stadium at Casement Park in west Belfast is Brian McAvoy, chief executive of Ulster GAA, Michael Hasson, president Ulster GAA, Tom Daly, chairman of the Casement Park project board, Collie Donnelly, Chairman Antrim County Board and Stephen McGeehan, project SponsorPlanning permission was granted in December  but quashed a year later by the High Court in Belfast following a judicial review taken against the Planning Service.In February  revised plans were lodged, following an extensive and unprecedented -week public consultation process, with % of respondents in favour of the project.Mr Daly said: “Ulster GAA recognises and fully respects the required due diligence by DfI and all statutory consultees.  However, the prolonged nature of the planning process is stalling the project’s progress and is also impacting its budgetary estimate which is now likely to be in the region of £m.\"With every day of delay pushing out the earliest possible start on site for the project it is imperative that government departments discharge their responsibilities as expediently as possible to mitigate against increased costs.\"Sinn Fein MP Paul Maskey said: \"I welcome todays confirmation from the Ulster GAA that the Department for Infrastructure has said the decision on the planning application can be made by the department and that a response will be issued as soon as possible.\"We have met with the GAA on this issue and are committed to seeing it being delivered.\"The redevelopment of Casement Park is a key project that will have a positive impact across West Belfast and throughout the north, both in terms of providing first class sporting facilities as well the economic benefit that will come with the project.\"A DfI spokesman said: “The planning application for the redevelopment of Casement Park remains under consideration by officials in the Department for Infrastructure.  Further environmental informationwas requested from the applicant in February  in relation to environmental health matters and is due to be submitted to the Department on or before  May .  Planning officials are also liaising with DfI Roads colleagues to finalise road traffic considerations linked to the planning application.  This may also require a request for FEI from the applicant. “On receipt of the FEI, the application must be re-advertised and further consultations will take place with the relevant consultees.  Thereafter, Departmental officials will progress the planning application to the point where it is ready for a decision to be made. “At the point where a decision is ready to be made, in the continued absence of ministers and taking account of the context at that stage, the Department will consider whether to issue any future decision.”"},{"url":null,"title":"dup

This is an attempt to get ahead of a possible blame game and appear positive when in reality it is going backwards to something rejected a year ago. \"As the Prime Minister has said, ‘no United Kingdom Prime Minister could sign up to an arrangement which annexes Northern Ireland from the rest of the United Kingdom.  \"Whilst the European Union has spoken often about their value of the peace process in Northern Ireland, this proposal demonstrates that they have a one-sided approach and a lack of understanding about the isions in Northern Ireland. \"Just as nationalists and republicans oppose a new north-south border, unionists oppose any new east-west border which would place a new barrier between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom.\"We need to work for a sensible deal which can work for everyone in Northern Ireland.  It is possible but there must be less intransigence in Brussels.”Taoiseach Leo Varadkar had hinted at this approach from the EU earlier today when he saidGreat Britain does not want to be part of the backstop that’s fine – but Northern Ireland must be in order to ensure there is never ato a hard border on the island of Ireland.👇 I briefed EU Ambassadors and EP today on the ongoing talks with #UK. Following the EU-UK statement of  Feb, the EU has proposed to the UK a legally binding interpretation of the #Brexit Withdrawal Agreement. Most importantly:— Michel BarnierMarch ,   The arbitration  can already, under Article  WA, give UK the right to a proportionate suspension of its obligations under the backstop, as a last resort,EU breaches its best endeavours good faith obligations to negotiate alternative solutions.— Michel BarnierMarch ,   EU ready to give legal force to all commitments from January letter of @eucopresident and @JunckerEU through joint interpretative statement. https:t.co kCUbTknYA This will render best endeavour good faith obligations even more actionable by an arbitration .— Michel BarnierMarch ,   EU commits to give UK the option to exit the Single Customs Territory unilaterally, while the other elements of the backstop must be maintained to avoid a hard border. UK will not be forced into customs union against its will.— Michel BarnierMarch ,   The EU will continue working intensively over the coming days to ensure that the UK leaves the EU with an agreement.— Michel BarnierMarch , The original backstop was only applicable to Northern Ireland but Mrs May convinced the EU to make it UK-wide after the DUP complained about the creation of a virtual border down the Irish Sea.“Bear in mind elements of that compromise like extending the backstop on a UK-wide basis, the single customs territory involving all the United Kingdom, these were compromises that the British government sought.“We were and remain happy to apply the backstop to Northern Ireland onlythey want to go back to that,” he said.Askedthere was anything Ireland could offer to help break the impasse, Mr Varadkar replied: “What’s not obvious is what the UK government is offering the European Union and Ireland should they wish us to make any further compromises. We have received no offer from them as to what they would give us infor any changes.“It requires a change of approach from the UK government to understand that Brexit is a problem of their creation,” he said.In a speech today, Mrs May implored to the EU to give her legally-binding changes to the backstop ahead of a vote on the Withdrawal Agreement in parliament next Tuesday.She said “one more push” was needed to get MPs on board. However, at the same time she delivered a message to politicians in London, saying: \"Back it and the U.K. will leave the European Union.

The second half continued to be a feisty affair and a great spectacle for the neutral spectator.With the lowered sun in Ballynahinchrsquos eyes, Ballymena did the smart thing and constantly took the high router, creating numerous scoring opportunities for Ballymena.Unfortunately, for lsquoHinch, their lead didnrsquot last too long as Ballymena bounced back with another great counter-attacking goal to make it -.It was end-to-end stuff, like the first half, the best of the chances falling to Millar, McIlwaine and Campbell only to be denied by the hard-working Ballymena defence and lsquokeeper.Cards were shown to both sides with William Edgar, Andrew Mulholland and Tim Crean doing time on the sideline.Ballymena had decent short corner chances, but were closed down well by Ashley Brown, Rea Coffey and of course Aaron Donnell.lsquoHinch had a few shorts of their own, but couldnrsquot convert. With  minutes remaining on the clock, Ballynahinch patiently played the ball around the back, waiting for an opening.Ashley Brownrsquos pass then found the lurking Stuart Hunter in space. Hunter was able to pick out roaming right back Leslie Harrison, who pulled a perfect pass back into Millar and he made no mistake in finding the net.Ballynahinch could easily have sat back and closed up shop, but they pinned Ballymena into their own half with a series of concerted attacks.Congratulations to everyone involved with the Ballynahinch menrsquos team, especially the supporters who never miss a game.The celebrations were short-lived as Ballynahinch have a huge game this weekend when they face Portrush in Coleraine in the Irish Hockey Challenge semi-final at pm.Ballynahinch: Aaron Donnell, Rea Coffey, Andrew Mulholland , Ashley Brown, Leslie Harrison, Matthew Martin, Stuart Hunter, William Edgar,Tim Crean, Jason Campbell, Alex Millar, Andrew McIlwaine, Luke Curry, Micheal Carney, Josh Higginson, Steven Crean.Joint men of the match: Alex Millar and Rea Coffey.Ballynahinch Ballymena ULSTER INTER LEAGUE.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"£2m tidal turbine providing energy spins in to action  ","story":"A poundm tidal turbine currently in Strangford Lough could provide electricity for between - homes, it has been revealed.The Scottish firm behind the innovative Subhub has said that energy produced from the fast-flowing lough could cost as low as p per kWH for local industrial load customers.However, the Subhub is not connected to the local electricity grid and is being tested for its environmental impact and maintenance needs.The distinctive yellow Subhub mdash which is roughly the size of of a bus mdash has been in Castleward Bay for the last six weeks.Easily seen from Portaferry, it was towed from Belfast Harbour and fixed into position within  hours on January .Jeremy Smith, managing director of QED Naval, said that Strangford Lough was chosen over the Orkneys for the Subhubrsquos final commissioning before being made available for the global market.Mr Smith explained: ldquoThe Subhub is a foundation structure for tidal turbines and provides a means of transporting and fixing tidal turbines to the sea bed.ldquoWe want to prove the environmental credentials of Subhub after developing it since .ldquoWe selected Strangford Lough as the commissioning site specically as it had the iants of conditions that Orkney hadnrsquot. The Orkneys was problematic as itrsquos a long way away. It would also have costed a lot of money to tow up into position but also the conditions up there were not what was needed.ldquoOur Strangford site has fast-flowing water, a pure rock sea bed and is a stonersquos throw from the shoreline. Itrsquos very accessible and also happens to be a beautul part of the world.Mr Smith said that the Subhub would be in the lough for the next three months at least as it was being assessed.ldquoWe are working with Cuan Marine Services who provides us with daily reports really to see what the environmental impact is for marine mammals.He said that QED Naval had developed Subhub which was less expensive to make, to move into position and to decommission, than other tidal wave s.He believes that some industrial load customers could avail from its electricity.ldquoIndustrial load customers could be paying between -p per kWH now, added Mr Smith.ldquoIf we could work with local industrial customers to get power purchase agreements, there is potential for us to cut their fuel bills for heating water to less p per kWh.QED Naval has worked in collaboration with the Centre for Advanced Sustainability at Queenrsquos University on the project.The Subhub spent last year being equipped at Cimpina Engineering in Belfast before being moved to Strangford Lough.This is the second tidal power development in Strangford Lough.The worldrsquos first commercial-scale tidal turbine was commissioned on the lough in July, .The .MW SeaGen project developed by Marine Current Turbines comprised two KW turbines and represented a poundm investment.

In fact, the South Eastern Trust has been concentrating for some time on trying to find suitable day surgical services which could be delivered in Downpatrick.Miss Ritchie said it appears ldquovery short sighted to relocate services from the Downe to other hospitals, suggesting the bedding down of eye surgery will result in the increased requirement for theatre access for ENT and other services.She added: ldquoAs the Downe has high level computerised technology theatres, it is important that full use is made of them to ensure continued local accessibility to day surgery services at the point of delivery.ldquoI have already written to the Trust urging that ENT surgical clinics are retained in the Downe Hospital.Also this week, Miss Ritchie has issued a fresh call for a permanent MRI scanner to be installed in Downpatrick.She said that for a number of years the local community has been involved in trying to secure a permanent scanner which health chiefs agree is a necessity.She added: ldquoI understand that the permanent facility is subject to a business case which needs a Minister in place to approve. Whilst the devolved institutions remain in cold storage, the approval of such a facility will probably take some time.ldquoIn the meantime, a mobile scanner has been located at the Downe for a limited period to deal with a current overburdened service at the Ulster Hospital in Dundonald. I hope this unit can remain in place until the business case for the permanent scanner has been approved.A South Eastern Trust spokeswoman has confirmed that there are no plans to reduce the number of ENT sessions delivered at the Downpatrick hospital.She added: ldquoThe Trust is planning to increase ENT clinics at the Downe and to relocate an ENT day surgery session from Downpatrick to the Lagan Valley Hospital to facilitate the cataract elective care centre prototype work..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Food firm to create 125 jobs with £17m investment  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK is in line for a major jobs boost.Finnebrogue Artisan has this week unveiled plans to create  new jobs as part of a poundm investment in an ultra-modern nitrite-free bacon facility.The news comes just weeks after the firm unveiled details of a poundm investment in a new vegan and vegetarian factory to support  jobs.Already one of the districtrsquos leading employers and widely regarded as one of Northern Irelandrsquos most innovative food producers, Finnebrogue Artisanrsquos latest investment is being supported by Invest NI.The new manufacturing facility is for the production of the companyrsquos nitrite-free bacon, hailed by many experts as a breakthrough in the food processing sector when it was unveiled to wide acclaim in January last year.The Naked Bacon range is now widely available in leading supermarkets across the UK, with Invest NI offering the Downpatrick company over pound.m of support towards the capital investment in the new nitrate-free bacon facility.The  new posts are expected to be created by , supporting  posts already in place at the ultra-modern plant outside Downpatrick.Finnebrogue chairman Denis Lynn says it has been known for decades that nitrites used in curing meat can cause cancer.ldquoThatrsquos why, despite being the UKrsquos leading top tier sausage maker, we refused to make a single rasher of bacon until we could figure out a way to make it better and safer, he continued.ldquoWe always set out to make food the best it can be, without being bound by the way it has always been done.

The development proposal includes plans for almost  parking spaces, eight of which are reserved for mountain rescue team members.A new pedestrian crossing at the Bryansford Road junction with Shimna Road forms part of the proposal and while planners have received  objections, they have also received five letters in support of the proposal.In papers submitted ahead of next weekrsquos meeting, planners confirm that none of the statutory consultees, including the Department for Infrastructure, Rivers Agency, Environment Agency and the local environmental health department, have lodged any objections to the redevelopment of the former school site.They confirm that roads officials are content that the proposed development will not have any ldquoadverse impact on the existing road infrastructure and is acceptable in terms of road safety.Planners are also insisting that the indicative designs of both the new store and mountain rescue centre would not be inappropriate in this part of the resort.They say it is acknowledged that there are ldquoobvious restrictions for the redevelopment of the existing Lidl store in Railway Street and there are no alternative vacant sites in the town centre which can accommodate the supermarketrsquos needs.ldquoA suitable brownfield site has become available at the edge of the town centre which could accommodate the proposal and has met the requirements of strategic planning policy, say planners.They also confirmed that a study of the impact of the new store on existing retailers shows the proposed investment will not have any ldquosignicant or unacceptable impact on Newcastle town centre.Environmental health officials say they have no objection in principle to the investment, provided conditions are attached restricting hours of business and deliveries, with planners concluding that the overall impact of the proposal, which is close to a number of homes, is not considered to be ldquosignicantly detrimental to warrant a refusal of the application.Lidl has confirmed it plans to develop a new , square metre supermarket, explaining it opted to redevelop the former primary school site as there are limited opportunities to redevelop the storersquos current base at Railway Street in the resort.Lidl says it has been looking for alternative premises in Newcastle town centre for over a decade without success and that while properties have become available, none were suitable because they were too small.It says the current sales area at its Railway Street base is is too small for the store to carry a full range of goods, pointing to narrow aisles with limited circulation space. The company says the car park is too small and fails to meet its requirements, with the general customer experience falling short of a modern food store.Planners say that having assessed the ious planning policies and having regard to all representations made, all consultees engaged and all other material considerations, it is found that the proposal is acceptable in planning terms and approval is recommended..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Newcastle’s pop up beach back on agenda of council  ","story":"A DECISION to reject a proposal for a pop-up beach in Newcastle has been overturned.Last month, a Newry, Mourne and Down Council Committee recommended not to proceed with the articial beach mdash similar to those in Paris and other parts of Europe ndash at the townrsquos promenade.However, the decision was overturned at Monday nightrsquos meeting of the full council when it was agreed to seek funding for the pop-up beach and develop a business case which could pave the way for its introduction.But not all councillors agreed, with Sinn Fein members rejecting it. They said there were health and safety concerns associated with the beach. They expressed support for transporting sand by road from Ballykinlar to Newcastle promenade and implementing an enhanced beach management plan.The radical suggestion to bring a touch of French summer flair to Newcastle was initially discussed last September when it was agreed to further explore the idea, with the initial focus on the cost of developing such a facility.The idea was suggested because of the lack of sand on Newcastle beach.Pop up beaches along the banks of the Seine and other cities and towns across Europe are hugely popular and some local politicians believe they can be a success in Newcastle.Council officials have confirmed that while Newcastle promenade is not suitable for pop-up beaches, two areas adjacent to the Downs Road car park would be suitable and that the cost over a nine-week period would be pound,.At last monthrsquos meeting of the local authorityrsquos Enterprise, Regeneration and Tourism Committee, politicians rejected the pop-up proposal and agreed to seek a meeting with the Environment Agency to discuss securing a marine licence to transport sand from Ballykinlar to Newcastle.It was also suggested that groins would be placed along sections of beach to protect the sand and a programme of better beach management introduced. On Monday night, this recommendation was overturned by  votes to .Mournes SDLP councillor Laura Devlin, who initially proposed to explore the merits of a pop-up beach, said the local authority ldquoneeds to think outside the box to create an articial beach or ldquosimply accept that Newcastle will never have a sandy beach.She continued: ldquoIf improving the natural beach was an option I would obviously proceed in that direction. However, it is not workable.ldquoI have been advised in no uncertain terms by a iety of coastal erosion experts that importing sand to Newcastle or removing stones from the beach simply wonrsquot work due to the movement of sediment and that permission to do this work would be denied by central government.ldquoAs a councillor for Newcastle, I want to improve our tourism product and the pop-up beach proposal is simply my suggestion to try and do something dferent. I also recognise that an articial beach would have to be properly managed and maintained.Cllr Devlin added: ldquoA pop-up beach could not just be created at the start of the summer and left. It would have to be adequately cleaned and looked after. As a mother, I would not want my child playing in dirty sand so the management and cleanliness of the pop up beach is essential.ldquoThis suggestion wonrsquot be without itrsquos issues, but surely as a council it is our job to try and make improvements and better our area where possible, expressing disappointment Sinn Fein opposed her proposal.Sinn Feinrsquos Willie Clarke argued that there was no appetite for a pop-up beach and that the suggestion to move sand from Ballykinlar to Newcastle was to replace the hundreds of tonnes which drt away on a seasonal basis.He continued: ldquoHow are you going to manage a pop-up beach that will be filled with stagnant sand  There is the potential for both dogs and young infants to foul the sand and other health and safety issues which need to be addressed.ldquoWill the sand be cleaned every day  What measures will be taken to prevent sand from blowing up Main Street  Local people and traders want to see a sandy beach, not a pop-up beach. I believe it is a no brainer that we try to secure Environment Agency agreement to place sand on the beach.Cllr Clarke said part of the pleasure of going to the beach was being able to go into the water and suggested that a pop-up beach could not provide such an experience.He added: ldquoWe need to look at anti-social behaviour issues associated with pop-up beaches which could contain broken glass. I wonder who is going to look after them given the dficulty I have in getting someone to clean the beach ldquoWe need to invest resources to ensure the proper management of the beach and encourage people to go to parts of it where there is sand.Cllr Andy McMurray described pursuing the idea as ldquofolly given the current problems in keeping the promenade tidy..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Penalties settle derby cup tie  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH Olympic set up a Clarence Cup quarter-final clash away to Comber Rec, but they had to do it the hard way at Kilmore Road on Saturday.The biting cold wind and rain turned this derby clash into a lottery which went to a penalty shoot-out that ended in total controversy.Olympic held a slight advantage at - on penalties when Kilmore goalkeeper Darren Ross threw his side a leline after he brilliantly saved Niall Murrayrsquos spot kick.This was no more than Kilmore deserved, but their players and supporters quickly became incandescent with rage when the referee insisted that Ross had moved off his line and ordered the spot kick to be taken again.Murray made no mistake at the second attempt and blasted Olympic into the last eight as Kilmore were left to rue what might have been.Olympic played with the swirling, gusting wind in their backs in the first half, but Matty Hardy and Jack Larkin at the heart of the Kilmore defence looked calm and composed.Olympic were struggling to get the ball down in the middle of the park and play their normal passing game as Kilmorersquos Michael Monan and Anton McGrattanrsquos forced Stevie and Ryan Noade into hurried passes.However, with  minutes gone Murray used the wind to his advantage.Olympic were awarded a free kick just inside the Kilmore half and out on the line beside their own dugout. Murray launched the ball high into orbit and wasnrsquot the least bit surprised when the wind took over and helped it on its way to the top right hand corner of the net with Ross clutching at thin air.Six minutes later at the other end Anton McGrattan struck yet another free kick from just outside the box past Ryan Walsh to bring the sides level.Olympic continued to see more of the ball, but Jones, when he did receive the ball out wide, was let down on a few occasions by a lack of support in the box and some wasteful finishing from Shane Murray.Kilmore were far from out of it and the bustling Joe McKinney was proving a handful and he almost gave the visitors a nd minute lead when he shot wide after a sizzling breakaway run from Anton McGrattan.Murray missed another good chance for Olympic after Jones carved out another opening before Kilmore seized the lead.Callum Dougan foraged deep and played a delightful through ball into the path of McKinney, who had beaten the offside trap. McKinney wasnrsquot for hanging around and after shrugging off Stevie McGoran, herounded lsquokeeper Walsh to make it -.The unrelenting wind and rain greeted both sets of players back for the second half and it was Kilmore who went on the offensive with Ryan Slavin being denied by Walsh.Two minutes later Kilmore shot themselves in the foot when Murray floated a free kick into the box and Jason Noade had all the time in the world to head the ball past Ross.Things became hot and heavy for a while with the tackles flying in, but clear cut chances at either end were hard to come by.Kilmore were now asking most of the questions, but a resolute Olympic rearguard refused to budge and Walsh had relatively little to do, apart from the odd shot from distance.Extra-time produced little of note, but Kilmore could have wrapped things up in the second period when McKinney crossed for Pete Casey, but, for once, he sliced his effort into no manrsquos land.Jones, Jason and Stevie Noadersquos first three penalties were perfect for Olympic, but they were matched by McGivern, McKinney and Larkin for Kilmore.Adam McLean nudged Olympic - ahead before Anton McGrattan fired his effort wide, advantage Olympic.Murrayrsquos first attempt was saved by Ross, but the referee made him retake the penalty as he insisted Ross had moved forward off his line. Murray was not about to look a gt horse in the mouth and drilled his second attempt to the net, much to the despair of a mightily aggrieved Kilmore side.Ballynahinch Olympic: Ryan Walsh, Dalton Tate, Aaron McClean, Jason Noade, Ryan Noade, Stevie McGoran, Stevie Noade, Ryan Molloy, Shane Murray, Niall Murray.

Dealing with this type of call prevents our staff from dealing with genuine emergencies.ldquoCalling an ambulance when you donrsquot need one wastes time and resources which could have been better spent responding someone genuinely in need of the high level clinical care ambulance crews provide. Ambulances are not a taxi service and arriving at hospital by ambulance does not mean yoursquoll be seen quicker.\"She added: ldquoIf someone is seriously ill or injured and their le is at risk, you should call  immediately. For those minor illnesses and injuries which are less serious, we hope Woody the dog helps people realise that there are other, more appropriate, services available. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

That being the case, this council, like many others in Wales, is unable to continue to provide the level of subsidy to outdoor sports provision that it has in the past.ldquoExploring dferent ways of working, including the transfer of responsibilities in appropriate circumstances to community groups is a key element of the councilrsquos strategy moving forward as it addresses dficult budget priorities.ldquoFollowing the successful transfer of responsibilities for five libraries to community-based organisations and looking at a number of successful sports clubs across the Vale of Glamorgan who operate without any subsidy from the Council, it is hoped that the majority of clubs currently using council facilities will be able to continue to provide opportunities for all to participate in sports activities. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The event ran from Saturday March  to Tuesday March .The Vale brewery Tomos and Lilford produced a special beer called ldquoCarnival - Penarth Pale Ale.Meanwhile the two Penarth butchers, Thompson Family Butchers and David Lush Butchers, both created their own special Penarth carnival sausages.The organisers estimated that more than  people took part in costume in the walk through town on Saturday, which saw the coronation of the lsquoFirst Foolrsquo at am. The procession marched from Sully Terrace through town.At .am in Penarth Library, there was a presentation of the head of Bendigeidfran, from The Mabinogion. The head was made by children from Cogan and Penygarth schools.The lsquoFirst Foolrsquo was then sent by train to the Tower of London to bring news of the Carnival to the traditional resting place of the head of Bendigeidfran, where he met the Raven Master.Long distance cyclist Dave Hann was due to cycle to Harlech, north Wales to raise money for the RNLI Penarth, and bring news to Harlech that Carnival had broken out in Penarth.Unfortunately Mr Hann only got as far as Cardigan before Storm Freya made it too dangerous to continue. Organisers have one barrel of carnival ale left and will take it to Harlech by train in the next few weeks to share it and the storybook of the carnival.On Sunday, two rugby teams took part in a ldquotug-o-sausage to decide which butcherrsquos sausage was better. Congratulations were extended to the winners, Team Thompson.Congratulations were also extended to the traders Ener-chi and Lilypad by the organisers, for having the best-dressed shop windows. Particular praise was singled out for the carnival flowers at Holm House Hotel created by Lilypad.Further nights of partying, songs and dancing were spotted in the Albion, St Faganrsquos Castle, and other pubs, bars and venues across Penarth. There were also celebrations on the Penarth Pier on Tuesday night following a Pancake Day event, while wandering bands of musicians like Wonderbrass kept spirits high.The festival culminated in a grand Mardis Gras party on Tuesday, which saw crowds of costumed residents dance the night away.Richard Parry, one of the carnival organisers, said: ldquoToday is Ash Wednesday, the beginning of Lent. Carnival finished last night on Mardi Gras.ldquoThanks to everyone who took part, contributed, encouraged, sponsored, smiled and partied, especially those people who took a carnival Bank Holiday Monday.ldquoIt was fabulous to hear your Carnival Bank Holiday stories, and to all those people who have had little private carnival moments of joy over the festival, thatrsquos what it has all been about.ldquoAnd some people have already said, lsquosee you next year!rsquoldquoThere were lots of people laughing and smiling on the sidelines, telling me they wanted to take part next year ndash just with a little more notice next time. But now itrsquos established, wersquoll be back next year and ready for even more people to join in the fun! article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Wersquore creating work which is not really necessary.If we want to improve the gateway there are other ways of doing it.ldquoIt really doesnrsquot begin to tackle the active travel . I do feel this is about spending the money before next February.Councillors were told the widened roundabout was one part of a wider strategy for transport improvements in Penarth.Charlotte Pugh, senior planner for the council, said the new scheme would transform the area.She said: ldquoThis whole are is going to be completely transformed. At the moment it is not very welcoming to pedestrians.ldquoI think it will go some way to transforming this gateway into Penarth and make it a safer environment.Previous plans to make part of Plassey Street one-way to incoming traffic, and removing the roundabout altogether, were dropped following opposition from the public.The committee agreed to endorse the transport scheme but requested regular updates on the wider transport plans for Penarth. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This fantastic choir is run by The Aloud Charity, which is based here in the constituency, and is doing incredible work all around Wales, involving young people in music and teamwork and giving them the confidence to not only succeed in music but in their lives more generally.It was a real honour to host them in Parliament, where they sang for the Speaker, for MPs, and during the St Davidrsquos Day Service in the Chapel, before heading to the Public Gallery of the Commons to watch the St Davidrsquos Day debate.This annual debate is an important one for Wales, allowing MPs to talk about all sorts of issues. I spoke about transport and train services ndash a long running campaign of mine as you will know.I then spoke in the crucial debate on climate change. Believe it or not, itrsquos been far too long since wersquove had a debate on this issue in Parliament, and I spoke about the importance of our investments and pensions going into renewable sources, not into fossil fuels.I also pointed out my support for the young people across the UK who went on a climate strike the week before. Itrsquos their futures that wersquore concerned about here and they were absolutely right to do what they did.And then of course the Brexit shambles continues ndash we cannot escape it ndash but we were debating it again last week, with hugely important votes to come next week.But last week was a signicant one. The PM was forced into a corner, forced to concede that she might have to rule out No Deal and extend Article , and the Labour Party came out decisively for putting this issue back to the people.And this week we saw the Government attempt to win over MPs with a fund it claims will boost less well-off towns after Brexit ndash but in another shambolic aspect to this hapless attempt to bribe MPs into voting for Theresa Mayrsquos so-called deal, there is no cash for Welsh towns.Another example of the Tories letting Wales down, and yet further reason to support the push for a final say on Brexit for the public through a Peoplersquos Vote. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work.

council supports development consultation  ","story":"The Controlled Schools# Support Councilhas said it #is in support of the publication of a development proposal that Craigavon Senior High School will operate on a single site# in Portadown. Confirmation of their stance came in a letter leaked to the Lurgan Mail which said: “There is agreement and evidenced need for a change in provision on the Lurgan campus of Craigavon Senior High Schooland a recognition and need to make CSHS more coherent and educationally and financially viable. “CSSC welcomes the Education Authority’s assurance that the short term accommodation needs will be met in transferring to the single site and further welcomes the commitment to secure funding for major capital investment from the Department of Education in the next - years. “It is the view of CSSC that by addressing the educational, financial, and health and safety issues the school will be enabled to provide a safe educational setting, enhance the quality of educational provision, and move towards a more stable financial environment. “The recent appointment of a permanent principal along with a strong leadership and management team, and a Board of Governors which is committed to providing a quality educational experience, indicate that the school is well placed to manage any changes required. “CSSC is mindful of the strong community interest in this proposal and would request that all interests are given due consideration. “CSSC is of the opinion that the Education Authority, in identying its preferred option, has sought to: maintain the integrity of the Dickson Plan provide a Lurgan solution, had this been possible and secure a type of provision that is in the best interests of CSHS pupils.”“A strong desire was consistently expressed throughout the consultation process by all stakeholders that post- provision within CSHS is of critical importance in meeting the needs of the pupils who choose a non-selective pathway within the Dickson Plan and that the implementation of this should be accelerated. “In supporting the publication of a development proposal which would enable CSHS to operate on a single site, CSSC supports the need to accelerate the establishment of post- provision within the school. “Finally, CSSC would concur with the views of the vast majority of controlled schools in the area and acknowledges, should the proposal be approved, that: there is a clear need for suitable transport provision to be provided to ensure that the transfer of pupils to the new campus operates efficiently and effectively the appropriate accommodation is ready and fit for purpose when the transfer of pupils takes place any future development of a major capital programme will require careful consideration and appropriate consultation with regard to the site for a new school. “CSSC wishes to thank all of those involved in the controlled sector in the Craigavon area, for their participation and contributions to this complex process.” The CSSC was established in September  as an advocacy body for almost half of all schools in Northern Ireland. The body supports controlled schools, which are open to all faiths and none, in providing high quality education for children and young people to enable them to learn, develop and grow together, within the ethos of non-denominational Christian values and principles.Searches in Craigavon part of probe into dissident republican activity Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID

How did you get started in the industry  When we first opened Asia Supermarket in , it was the family’s ambition to bring a taste of home to Belfast. We brought the Chinese culture to the local community through cuisine and provided authentic and tasty ingredients for the hospitality trade here. We branched out due to demand to also provide Indian, Korean, Philippine, Thai and Middle Eastern food and are always looking for opportunities to extend our range. Typically, who are your clients or customers  Our customers would be both wholesale and retail to include restaurants all over Northern Ireland, as well as consumers who want to create some unique dishes in their home kitchens. Do you enjoy what you do, and what in particular  Yes, and in particular having just completed the new build we have enjoyed being involved in the day-to-day aspects, given the bespoke nature of the project, coupled with the hustle and bustle of the day to day challenges of satisfying our customer needs. What is the most dficult part of your job  One of the most dficult parts of the job is sourcing good quality produce at competitive prices and enhancing the range of products available. However, we’re very proud of our new supermarket and warehouse which provides even more quality and choice for our customers. What are the challenges facing your sector, and the economy in general  One of the biggest challenges facing our sector is the cost of goods from our suppliers, particularly those procured in foreign currencies which in turn has a knock-on effect on what we charge our wholesale and retail customers. To maintain our share of the market we constantly endeavour to get the best prices from our suppliers so that we can pass on competitive prices to our customers to maintain and grow our market share. With Brexit looming it will bring a major impact on imports costs and supplier prices which will present a major challenge for our business.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/cleaver_1.jpg","title":"is the future bright for the ni energy market","story":"Posted on Tuesday  February  by Ulster Business It is clear that there are a number of signicant challenges facing the energy sector in Northern Ireland but where there are challenges, there are also opportunities, according to law firm Cleaver Fulton Rankin.The ExecutiveNorthern Ireland has just completed its second year without a ing local government and in the words of David Sterling, head of the Northern Ireland Civil Service, the Civil Service is “… doing everything we can in the prevailing circumstances…but civil servants cannot take the place of ministers when it comes to strategic policy development or in taking transformative decisions”.  This is very much the case with regard to energy policy. The Department of the Economy’s Strategic Energy Framework, which was endorsed by the Executive in , has over the last nine years, led to some very positive changes to the energy generation and supply mix, particularly from renewable sources.However the  year framework is nearing its end and needs to be replaced. The Department is making such preparations as it can on a draft Strategic Energy Framework across the areas of heat, electricity, transport and energy efficiency which it aims to make public some time in the spring. Whether or not this region has its Assembly back to adopt such a framework will remain to be seen, but in the meantime it will ensure the subject remains live and high on the agenda.Brexit and I-SEMThe new wholesale electricity market known as the Integrated Single Electricity Marketwent live on October , . It is designed to deliver increased levels of competition which, it is hoped, will help put downward pressure on prices as well as encouraging greater levels of security of supply and transparency. While the island of Ireland is now integrated more closely with European markets, there is a risk that Brexit could halt this integration. British and Irish business groups and energy trade associations such as the CBI, IBEC, Electricity Association of Ireland, RenewableUK, British Irish Chamber of Commerce and EnergyUK all refer to the delivery of I-SEM, or to the UK’s continued access to the IEM, as post-Brexit priorities for security of supply and or consumer protection. I-SEM is clearly a priority that must be preserved.While Brexit may present challenges and continuing uncertainty, there are certainly opportunities for investment and acquisition in the electricity market as more complex, specialist expertise will be required to effectively trade power on the I-SEM. Policy barriers or inaction cannot be allowed to prevent I-SEM from realising its potential of fully integrating the market by efficiently moving energy from producer to demand.Renewable incentive schemesDespite being on track to hit its target of % of electricity generation from renewables, Northern Ireland risks being left behind. The lack of a replacement for the development support mechanism, Renewables Obligations Certicateafter its closure in April , means Northern Ireland is lagging behind Great Britain which has established the Contract for Dference regime and Ireland, which has started work on its Renewable Electricity Support Scheme . While neither scheme is perfect, doing nothing is not an option. The devolution of energy presented Northern Ireland with the opportunity to shape its own policy but without a government, will the sector and the infrastructure be able to remain fit for purpose GasWith its development over the last  years, the gas network in Northern Ireland, with its low population density, must be seen as a success story. Consumers and businesses have been offered greater choice in terms of price and security of supply. Nevertheless there are certainly further opportunities for gas distributors and suppliers to expand the natural gas network, particularly in the west of the country and east Co Down. So despite the apparent obstacles and challenges, there is opportunity for development and progress in Northern Ireland’s energy sector. The benefits for Northern Ireland will be in terms of security of supply, price and environmental sustainability. Cleaver Fulton Rankin,  Bedford Street, Belfast BT FW.

The proposal for the work to Broadcasting House on Ormeau Avenue in Belfast was approved last March by the BBC board, with the announcement made to staff by the BBCs director general Lord Tony Hall. Now, the plans – which include the redevelopment of the exisiting BBC Broadcasting House building, including the refurbishment and extension of the buildings – will be put to the public, as part of a necessary pre-application event before planning can be submitted. It includes a new extension to the rear, including a landscaped plaza opening onto Linenhall Street. A spokesman for BBC Northern Ireland told Ulster Business: \"As part of the pre-planning application process, public consultation events will take place this month before we can move on to the next phase. The investment to BBC Broadcasting House in Belfast, announced in March last year, will transform the iconic building, its technology and facilities, highlighting the BBC’s commitment to audiences in Northern Ireland. We will share more detail in due course.\" Money invested will go towards structural work on the -year-old building to ensure its long-term sustainability, addressing what the state broadcaster has said are \"critical deficiencies\". Before the announcement last year that the BBC was to stay put and develop its existing building, it was understood the broadcaster had been eyeing up other city centre locations, or could create a new media hub in the Titanic Quarter. The event will take place at the Clayton Hotel on March , between pm and pm, and March  between pm and .pm.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/pin_1.jpg","title":"pinnacle given top sage accolade","story":"Posted on Wednesday March  by Ulster Business IT firm Pinnacle has been awarded a top accolade for its Sage software and services in Ireland.The company, which has offices across the UK and Ireland including Belfast and Dublin, has been named by Sage Ireland as its ‘highest growth partner’ for sales of Sage cloud.Search Workshop Supplies, one of Ireland’s largest suppliers of garage and workshop equipment, is one of the latest firms which has partnered with Pinnacle.Olivia O’Dea of Search Workshop Supplies, said: “From our initial meeting with Pinnacle’s business development director Siobhan Marley, we were given a solid reassurance that Pinnacle fully understood the growing needs of our business.”Barry Murphy, managing director of Sage Ireland, said:“The team at Pinnacle are incredibly passionate in supporting their customers to thrive in an ever-evolving market.

Since I took on the Northern Ireland role six years ago, we’ve doubled the workforce, become the fastest-growing UK region and are now the biggest office outside London with just over , people,” he says. “Our strategy was to be the leading provider of professional services in the Northern Ireland market but there’s no way we’d be the size we are now had we only focused on that.”Instead Paul built on the legacy of his predecessors and accelerated growth in new, technology solutions, while retaining the traditional accounting, tax and consulting services. Today PwC remains the leading provider of advisory services to the region’s family-owned and owner-managed businesses and multinationals, but has also built an impressive portfolio of cutting-edge technologies, opened the door to signicant export markets and is tackling some of society’s most challenging issues. “We’ve grown in many new areas – blockchain, cyber, cloud-based accounting services – but the single biggest impact has come from developing our distinctive ‘Operate’ ision,” Paul says. ”Operate is our service delivery business, which supports and delivers technology and people solutions to large, often regulated organisations. So instead of just advising clients how to solve their problems, we now do the heavy lting for them.”Run by Ian McConnell, a partner who’s been with the firm for  years, Operate is already attracting global attention. “Clients increasingly don’t want a consulting firm just to tell them what to do: they want a problem-solving partnership.” he says. “In its first year of operation, Operate earned over £m, now has , people and is still growing.”Reinforcing Paul’s confidence to invest in Northern Ireland as a strategic location is a  forecast from TheCityUK that it could become the second fastest-growing financial services region outside London by , helping deliver £bn of additional gross value-addedto the UK economy. But that depends on the ability to recruit the right talent, and he says the challenge now is finding and retaining the skills.That’s an issue that particularly concerns Paul as he looks ahead at the economic picture with Brexit and lack of an Assembly to the fore.“The business community wants clarity and certainty. Ideally we want to see a Brexit withdrawal agreement that then gives the scope for a trade deal that offers Northern Ireland the capacity to trade both with the EU and as part of the UK. The potential competitive advantages and ability to attract investment would be terric and the kind of economic accelerator which we have sought for years, but never managed to gain.“However I do worry about the impact of political stalemate on our long term future. Failure to invest, particularly in education and skills, will impair our competitiveness and make this a less attractive place for business.The decreasing effectiveness of health, environment and infrastructure will mean that talented people will opt to make choices to live their lives where.“In my national role, I see other parts of the country fusing partnerships in innovative and exciting ways between business,education and government. Compared to that, we are already getting left behind. We should be moving forward.”Which brings us to Merchant Square, the £m, , sq ft office development which PwC takes over in . “We have great people and one reason why we’re moving to the city centre is because that’s where they want to be. By the time we’re ready to relocate towards the end of , we will have at least , people moving in to the heart of Belfast.“That makes it important for Belfast too and not just because it’s the city’s biggest-ever private sector office deal. As we were making our decision, the whole Bank Buildings issue was at its height, and we wanted to show our support for the city and its future.” The Merchant Square relocation project is led by Kieragh Nelson, a director who joined the firm in . “We’ve got serious ambitions for Merchant Square,” she says. ”There’s a sense of ‘OK, we’ve just opened flagship offices in London, and Manchester – what more can we do in Belfast how can we make it even better ’ And the vast majority of decisions on how it will look, feel and work are made by the team here. Our goal is to create the most technologically-advanced, innovative and collaborative space for ourselves, our clients, and also for the communities around us.”Doing the right thing is a maxim often repeated in PwC, but it gets backed up. On the morning of our interview, a large group of people from the firm, including Paul, took part in one of their regular ‘Darkness Into Light’ walks to raise awareness of mental health. The firm’s commitment to social mobility has seen a number of employment programmes launched, notably the UK’s first technology degree apprenticeships, with Queen’s University one of five universities selected to run the programme. And it’s expanding its Hive Academy programme, which delivers free technology education to primary and secondary schools, to the Channel Islands.This year the firm challenged itself and created a unique charity partnership – the PwC Challenge – to create innovative suicide prevention programmes.“Our purpose is to build trust in society and solve important problems, and it really does feature in how we look at what we do. We strive to celebrate and share our knowledge widely and unselfishly with our people and communities and not be afraid to take a stand and do the right thing. And we put it at the heart of what we do every day. “Take the PwC Challenge: more people in Northern Ireland have died by suicide since the signing of the Good Friday Agreement than from the violence in the years before. This is a crisis, and it’s one which affects our people, and our communities. So we asked local charities in north and west Belfast, the worst affected areas in the UK, to collaborate and devise really innovative approaches programmes to give opportunities to young people and their families through education, technology, sports, and mental health coaching.“As well as the clubs in PwC which fundraise every year for the challenge, our own people are volunteering every week in ious projects – particularly with our Hive Academy. We want to ensure that people, who are high achievers in many dferent fields, are supported to play their fullest part in society.” For Paul, it’s all about the people. Last year PwC invested around £m on staff development here, and this year, a number of people have begun the first Masters in Operation service delivery, run by Ulster University. “It’s important to support people to develop their careers in ways they mightn’t have considered when they joined. That’s a key building block of our purpose – it drives social mobility, equality and ersity.“It’s true thatsomeone decides they want to head off and join PwC Australia or New York, they can. That’s the beauty of working for a global firm – those opportunities are there. But what I really want to make sure is that you don’t have to leave:you want to live and work in Belfast, and have global clients, work with cutting-edge technology and be part of a firm that’s engaged in society, you can do that too.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/eopen_1.jpg","title":"the open its the biggest thing since sliced bread","story":"Posted on Wednesday March  by Ulster Business With just  weeks until Northern Ireland hosts the biggest sporting event in its history, John Mulgrew speaks to the bosses tasked with organising the legendary Open Championship We’ve come a long way in just a short few years.

He’s executive director of championships at the RA – the ruling authority of golf throughout the world, aside from areas such as the US, and organisation responsible for organising The Open.“This will be my th Open Championship, and one reason I continue to be involved is that it’s a challenge every time.”It will see Irish golfing greats, including Open winners Rory McIlroy and Darren Clarke, Graeme McDowelland Padraig Harrington – among others – join the biggest name in sport, Tiger Woods.“One of big drivers to ing to Royal Portrush was the success of the Northern Irish and Irish golfers. They have raised the profile of golf immeasurably. “We are absolutely delighted with the response so far – % of tickets sold in  hours, and sold out within a record-breaking eight weeks.”Johnnie says the decision to choose Portrush, bringing it back to the course after a  year hiatus, was the correct one – buoyed by the support from the community, agencies and organisations. The th Open will be held at Royal Portrush from July -.“In my career, we had a similar scenario, ing to Liverpool for the first time in  years, and we had a very similar response. It ed in , and now Royal Liverpool is firmly on the rota, and I hope that Royal Portrush is similar.”Of course, aside from the golf, both the short-term and long-term economic benefits will trickle down and benefit, not on the surrounding areas, but prop Northern Ireland up on yet another global .According to Tourism NI chief executive John McGrillen that longer-term benefit could be worth up to £m for the wider economy.“There will be , tickets sold for championship days, and % of those sold to people out of state, outside Northern Ireland,” he tells Ulster Business.“It allows us to present an extremely positive image for Northern Ireland, and into key markets across the globe. We will never have experienced the opportunity to provide such a positive image of Northern Ireland. Despite what we might think, there are perception issues.“Northern Ireland has a normalised society and some of the most dramatic golf courses, scenery and landscape to see.“More specically, the fact that the Open will have been here, as one of the world’s top golf courses, will drive up the amount of spend, especially from golf tourism.”That alone makes up around % of Northern Ireland’s tourism intake. John says he wants that to grow to £m by . He says golfing visitors spend around four times that of an average tourist.Johnnie says all signs so far suggest that the Open in Portrush is “going to be an enormous” success. But the process hasn’t come without its challenges – namely theIrish Sea.“This is the first Open Championship we have hosted in my time, in which we have a body of water between our base and our contractor base. There’s getting things across water, and an enormous amount of work on the golf course – new holes, a new road system around the course and a tunnel for the players from one of the new greens to tee. You can’t do that without support from the golf club“The members have been hugely supportive, turning the course upside down, but maintaining integrity and enhancing .”He said, along with the blue light services, local authorities, council and tourism groups, the community in and around Portrush “understands that this will bring great benefits” to the area and Northern Ireland as a whole. “You can overcome dficulties with support,” he says.“Royal Portrush has never had more than , people drive to it, or get the train to it, at the same time. It’s a challenge to make sure we deliver a wonderful Open Championship and a spectator experience.”John McGrillen says the triumph in landing the Open itself was down to the success of the Irish Open in the last few years. “You had more than , people turning out at Portrush… visitor numbers had been dwindling.“That allows us to demonstrate that the course can deal with that many people. Everyoneworked very well, collectively, and that gave confidence to the RA that we would have the capacity to deliver it. The risk factors they had were eliminated because of the success of the Irish Open, and that was very critical.”As for boosting many of the hundreds of businesses in and around the area, John said: “It will do, as it’s showing off Northern Ireland… we have seen a big boost in the number of Americans playing golf. We don’t have to wait until after the event. “The visibility the Irish Open has given us. We have Royal County Down, Royal Portrush and Portstewart – that’s increased signicantly. It’s not just those courses which are benefiting – it’s being spread. People will typically stay in Belfast and travel around.”For John, the best outcome is, of course, an Irish winner. Oh, and clear skies. “A local winner would be phenomenal. It would be fantastic to see Rory win, or Tiger Woods.“If Tiger Woods won the Open in Portrush, that would remain in peoples’ memories forever. While we would love Rory or other locals to win, I would not be disappointed in Tiger winning it.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/pwc_1221.jpg","title":"pwc ni to crack  staff by ","story":"Posted on Thursday March  by Ulster Business PwC is set crack the , staff mark by the end of next year as it moves into its new £m offices in the heart of Belfast city centre, Ulster Business can reveal.Just  months after being appointed to PwC’s national management board as head of UK regions, Paul Terrington, PwC’s NI regional chair, has no plans to reduce his commitment to keep growing the business here.“This is an incredibly exciting time to be part of PwC. Since I took on the Northern Ireland role six years ago, we’ve doubled the workforce, become the fastest-growing UK region and are now the biggest office outside London with just over , people,” he says. “Our strategy was to be the leading provider of professional services in the Northern Ireland market but there’s no way we’d be the size we are now had we only focused on that.”Speaking about the move to its new headquarters in Merchant Square – a £m, , sq ft office – Mr Terrington said:“We have great people and one reason why we’re moving to the city centre is because that’s where they want to be. By the time we’re ready to relocate towards the end of , we will have at least , people moving in to the heart of Belfast.”On the current political uncertainty, he says: “The business community wants clarity and certainty. Ideally we want to see a Brexit withdrawal agreement that then gives the scope for a trade deal that offers Northern Ireland the capacity to trade both with the EU and as part of the UK. The potential competitive advantages and ability to attract investment would be terric and the kind of economic accelerator which we have sought for years, but never managed to gain.”Meanwhile, lettings in Belfast are expected to remain buoyant this year despite the uncertain political climate, according to a report from Lambert Smith Hampton. That’s been buoyed by PwC’s pre-letting of the Merchant Square development, which is currently under construction.
