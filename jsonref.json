These showbiz highs, and lows, we owe to Sam Cowell.The highest-paid singing star of his day, he had songs known the world over, including the innocent-sounding Are You Good-Natured Dear? As his audiences knew full well, this was the stock greeting used by the prostitutes of the day sounding out any potential clients.         Music-hall veterans specialised in double-entendre, with suggestively titled songs like A Little of What You Fancy Does You Good!, and Pulling My Rhubarb Out. These showbiz highs, and lows, we owe to Sam Cowell. Pictured is music hall artist Marie LloydThese numbers went down a storm at the predecessors of the music halls, hugely popular evenings of musical entertainment organised by pub landlords and known as ‘free and easies’.Designed to keep their customers drinking, they were often rowdy occasions with audiences showing their disapproval of bad acts by hurling whatever came to hand at the stage. This included bottles, old boots and even, in one case, a dead cat.But Sam Cowell had few hecklers. Born in London in 1820, the son of actor Joseph Cowell, he had been appearing on stage since he was nine and his comic appeal was such that, as one reviewer wrote, it is ‘impossible to convey by words the inexpressible mirth which even his silence creates’.         Actress and male impersonator Vesta TilleyIn 1852 he was chosen to head the bill at the opulent pleasure palace that was London’s first purpose-built music hall, a 2,000-seat venue brimming with gaslights and glittering chandeliers.Grandly named The Canterbury Hall, it was designed to attract the aspirational working classes, who regarded themselves as too respectable for ‘free and easies’ and it seems fitting that it was on Westminster Bridge Road, not far from the hospital where Simon Cowell, the modern-day King of Variety, was born a century or so later.The attractions off the main hall included a waxwork exhibition and a menagerie, and there were occasional spectaculars such as the legendary Charles Blondin walking a tightrope strung across the auditorium at balcony level.But these one-offs apart, The Canterbury Hall put the emphasis firmly on nightly evenings of variety with acts including ‘Paul Vandy, the Peerless Juggler’ and ‘Mr Harry Edson and his Musical Pug’. But none ever outshone Sam Cowell who could earn today’s equivalent of £8,000 a week for his twice-nightly appearances at The Canterbury.When he once refused to go on stage one night, because another act had performed one of his songs, a near riot followed.By 1875, there were nearly 400 music halls in London alone. Most, like the Canterbury, seated the audience at long communal tables so that they could eat and drink during the shows.They could also promenade around the auditorium freely, leading to accusations that music-halls were being frequented by ladies ‘of known character’ — for which read prostitutes. Neither were moral campaigners of the day impressed by the ribald material of stars like Marie Lloyd.         By 1875, there were nearly 400 music halls in London alone. Most, like the Canterbury, seated the audience at long communal tables so that they could eat and drink during the shows. Pictured is famous juggler Paul Cinquevalli‘I haven’t had it up for ages,’ she would complain to the audience, unfolding her umbrella. As one impresario observed, she could have made the 23rd Psalm sound indecent.In the end, though, what did for the music halls was the realisation that audiences were prepared to pay more for plush inidual seats. From the 1890s onwards, a new breed of variety theatres spread across Britain. And in 1912, these venues reached even greater heights of respectability when the Palace Theatre in London hosted the first Royal Command Performance, in the presence of George V and Queen Mary.Performers included ‘The Little Flying Devil’ Paul Cinquevalli, who could balance a man on one arm above his head while juggling three balls with the other hand, and male impersonator Vesta Tilley, both inheritors of the variety tradition which Sam Cowell did so much to promote.Cowell did not live to see such acceptance. Broken by overwork, and drinking a bottle of brandy a day, he died in Bournemouth in 1864, aged 44, leaving a wife and nine children.But although his name is largely forgotten, his legacy is still with us and that would surely prompt even his curmudgeonly 21st-century counterpart to give him the most enthusiastic of Golden Buzzers. Palaces Of Pleasure: How The Victorians Invented Mass Entertainment by Lee Jackson is published by Yale University Press at £20. "},{"url":null,"title":"Secret happiness free bus pass 60s","story":"Share this article The research, published in the Journal of Transport and Health, looked at surveys of 5,861 people eligible for free bus travel in England. Pass holders, who represented 85 per cent of the sample, were 37 per cent less likely to be sedentary on a weekly basis and just over 30 per cent less likely to be classed as socially isolated, the study found. Bus passes are available to everyone when they reach a certain age, depending on where they live in the UK.The scheme was introduced in England by Gordon Brown’s government through the Concessionary Bus Travel Act of 2007. It was officially launched in April 2008 and allowed anyone over 60 to travel for free during off-peak times. Similar initiatives had already been introduced in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.

Department for Transport figures show the number of local bus journeys in England fell by 85million or 1.9 per cent to 4.36billion in the year ending March 2018.Budgetary constraints mean councils are spending less on discretionary items such as free peak travel, post-school transport and supported rural services.Nearly half of all bus routes receive partial or complete subsidies from councils.The Local Government Association has warned that these services are at risk unless councils are given more funding. "},{"url":null,"title":"Breathtaking bluebells bloom bring Monet Midlands","story":"Share this article But thanks to the softer focus employed by the photographer, the image has come out more like a painting that the great Impressionist Claude Monet might be rather proud of. These images, taken at National Trust-owned Clent Hills in Worcestershire on Monday, echo the colours and style of Monet’s Water Lilies.Bluebells usually flower from mid-April to late May, meaning this magnificent display is just a little earlier than usual – probably because of the mild spring.

Photograph: Alan Betson Trinity College Dublin is launching what it is says is the country’s biggest ever philanthropic campaign aimed at generating €400 million in funding for the 400-year old university.Its “inspiring generations” initiative aims to fund flagship projects such as an extension of the campus into Grand Canal Dock, redeveloping the college’s historic Old Library and a new cancer institute, which it says holds the promise of transforming patient care.Trinity’s provost Dr Patrick Prendergast said funds will also go towards helping attract some of the world’s top professors, creating new academic posts and expanding access programmes for disadvantaged students.Many universities in Ireland say they are reaching “crisis” point as a result of rising student numbers and under-investment by the State.However, Dr Prendergast said the campaign was separate to these concerns and was focused on strengthening Trinity’s reputation as one of the world’s top universities.The funding, he said, will allow the college to “reach for the stars” by researching major global issues ranging from environmental challenges to cancer treatment.A national launch of the campaign on Thursday is due to be followed by international launches around the world including cities such as London, Paris, New York, San Francisco, Hong Kong, Singapore and Sydney. DedicatedDr Prendergast said that since Trinity was founded in 1592, it has gone on to shape a “better-informed and more equal society, in Ireland and around the world”.“Today, we are dedicated to pursuing innovation in education and research, and fearlessly advancing the cause of a pluralistic, just and sustainable society. ‘Inspiring Generations’ will enable Trinity to achieve these ambitions and inspire generations to come.”As part of the campaign, the college has erected three-storey portraits of Samuel Beckett and current student Leah Kenny on either side of the university’s iconic Campanile. Ms Kenny, who came to Trinity via its access programme for disadvantaged students, studied Beckett during her English degree.The campaign organisers say the portraits stem from its theme of “inspiring generations”.Ms Kenny said Beckett had felt inaccessible to her until she began studying his original manuscripts and letters, held in the college’s archives.“You see, up until this point I had placed Beckett on a pedestal. He was not human to me – he was a literary God, with status akin to Zeus as he sits upon Mount Olympus,” she said.“Viewing the manuscripts that first day, reading his correspondence and viewing the cheap copybooks in which he wrote showed me what Beckett was – a man – flawed and human.”ExpansionTrinity’s philanthropic campaign has so far raised €272 million from more than 10,000 donors in 68 countries around the world since 2011.The colleges hopes to reach €400 million within four or five years and says priority will be given to student scholarships and new academic posts.It says these will enable expansion and innovation across education and research.The expansion of Trinity’s access programme is also a key aim, which would allow it to expand its outreach to schools across the State.In healthcare, plans for a new Trinity St James’s Cancer Institute seek to improve treatment by integrating research, medicine and training with inidualised care for cancer patients.Work on a new E3 institute which will focus on engineering, environment and emerging technologies is due to get under way soon, while there are also plans to protect and conserve the Old Library’s collections and make them more accessible to the public.

Some 58 per cent say the State should pay more into the EU’s coffers to continue to receive the benefits of membership.“The fact that the majority of Irish people are in favour of more co-operation at EU level on defence and security, as well as on tax, suggest that these issues are not as sensitive as they are sometimes depicted,” said Noelle O’Connell, executive director of European Movement Ireland.“However, the relative high number of people that answered ‘don’t know’ to these questions reflects the need for continued and constant national debate on certain aspects of our EU membership.”Some 11 per cent said they did not know whether Ireland should be part of increased EU tax co-operation, a position that the Government is opposed to as it aims to protect Ireland’s low corporate tax regime and competitive advantage over other countries.The survey was conducted between March 21st and 27th, 2019, when there was uncertainty around whether the UK would depart from the EU without an agreement as originally planned on March 29th."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3878414.1556778592!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"voters go to polls in english local and mayoral elections","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritish prime minister Theresa May tours the Leisure Box while on the local elections campaign in Brierfield, Lancashire. Photograph: ReutersTheresa May will face local elections on Thursday amid controversy over an ongoing Brexit delay and a Cabinet sacking.With predictions that the Tories could lose more than 800 seats, Conservative high command appears braced for a difficult result.Elections are taking place in 248 English councils outside London, and 11 local authority areas in Northern Ireland.There are also polls for six elected mayors in Bedford, Copeland, Leicester, Mansfield, Middlesbrough and the new North of Tyne devolved regional authority.The poll comes as the UK prime minister has faced criticism for pushing back the Brexit date to October 31st, and is embroiled in fresh controversy after dismissing Gavin Williamson as defence secretary after an inquiry into leaks from the National Security Council.Close to 60 per cent of the 8,425 seats up for grabs in England are currently Conservative, with a quarter held by Labour.The last time a majority of the seats were fought over in 2015, the Tories were on an electoral high as they secured their first Commons majority since 1992 on the same day.Most of the electoral battles are in the Tory shires or Labour strongholds in northern cities, limiting the prospects for large-scale gains by Jeremy Corbyn’s party.The results are unlikely to be a guide for European elections scheduled for later in the month, as neither Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party nor the Remain-backing Change UK are fielding candidates on May 2nd.However, Brexit is expected to play a major role in the elections.Conservatives fear Leave-backing supporters will stay at home or switch to Ukip in anger at Mrs May’s failure to deliver Brexit on time on March 29.Councils to watch on Thursday include Dudley, Trafford and Derby, where Labour could gain overall control, and Swindon, Great Yarmouth, Redditch and St Albans, where control could slip out of Tory hands.The Liberal Democrats are hoping to seize Winchester. – PA"},{"url":null,"title":"telegraph audio briefings sign new whatsapp group","story":"Want audio briefings direct to your WhatsApp?

Early childhood is a period of rapid physical and cognitive development and a time during which a child\u0027s habits are formed.The recommendations go much further than recent guidance from the UK\u0027s chief medical officers.This recommended a break from screens every two hours for all children. It also said phones should be banned from meal times and overnight. At a glance | WHO guidelines on physical activity for childrenThe guidance, which will be launched at the European Congress on Obesity in Glasgow this weekend sets out different advice for children of different ages, up to the age of five. It stresses the importance of avoiding sedentary screen time, in a bid to ensure children get sufficient exercise. One in five children in England are overweight or obese by the time they start primary school, rising to one in three by the time they leave. But some experts said parents were being given conflicting advice based on limited evidence. In January the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health shied away from recommending a limit, but said children should not be exposed to screens for at least an hour before bedtime. Tim Smith, Reader in Cognitive Psychology, Centre for Brain and Cognitive Development, Birkbeck, University of London, said: “In recent months UK parents of 0- to five-year-olds and early-years practitioners have been bombarded with conflicting recommendations and guidelines about how and whether they should be managing their children\u0027s screen time and sedentary behaviour, e.g. from the RCPCH and Chief Medical Officers.“The release of new WHO guidelines does not help to clarify the situation, as its specific recommendations with regards to \u0027sedentary screen time\u0027 and their negative impacts on physical, cognitive and psychosocial health are, by its own admission based on \u0027moderate to very low-quality evidence\u0027.Duty of Care CampaignComment: A customs union compromise with Labour would be bad for BritainLocal Elections 2019: How many councils are taking part and when will we know the results?Who is Penny Mordaunt?

Other key factors included the weight of mother and father, the birthweight of the child, and his or her growth in the first six months of life.And children were less likely to end up overweight if they attended day care in their first few months.Researchers said that such infants might be likely to be in a better routine, and less likely to be over-fed. But they said that in the sample, children with stay-at-home mothers were likely to be less affluent than those using childcare.By examining all 12 indicators, researchers were able to forecast the chance the baby would end up overweight with accuracy levels of 70 per cent.Researchers said the model needed further honing, but should be used to warn parents to take early steps to avoid their child putting on too much weight.Prof Tanja Vrijkotte, from Amsterdam Medical Center, said health professionals should use such information to warn parents that very young children were at risk of getting too fat - long before weight problems developed.“I think we need to be more alert that at this young age we can already make a difference,” she said.“They should use it to make parents aware, to say it’s fine there is nothing going wrong now but looking at these predictors your infant has an increased risk, so we need to discuss feeding patterns or behaviour or exercise,” she said.Overweight parents are more likely to have overweight childrenProf Vrijkotte said anti-obesity policies which focus on school-age children come to late to make a significant difference.“They should move in much earlier. Learning a healthy lifestyle starts at birth or even in pregnancy,”  she said.She said that many of the factors linked to higher risk of weight gain could be an indicator of poorer socio-economic status, which is linked to increased obesity rates.But others - such as diabetes in pregnancy, and overfeeding in early months  - could programme the child to have a greater risk of weight gain, by altering their metabolism.The study found that children sent to day care in the first year of their life were less likely to be overweight aged 10.Tam Fry, from the National Obesity Forum, urged the NHS to introduce early checks on the weight of young children in order to spur parents into changing their family’s lifestyles.He said: “If these clues are all followed up and the weight gain points towards obesity, the parents  must be told and helped to avoid it materialising. This can act as a \u0027wake up call\u0027 to ensure that children can be set on the right road, with healthier habits.Dr Max Davie, from the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said: “Any model that accurately predicts an increased likelihood of developing obesity allows us to intervene and provide targeted weight management support and advice at an earlier stage.”Local Elections 2019: How many councils are taking part and when will we know the results?Who is Penny Mordaunt?

The face is on a sheet of paper which also contains the artist\u0027s studies of a horse\u0027s leg for an equestrian monument, commissioned by the French king.Martin Clayton, Head of prints and drawings, Royal Collection Trust  Clayton said: Sheets of paper could be picked up in the studio and used by Leonardo\u0027s assistants and companions just as rough paper for sketching on.The artist was rather unusual in having a beard and was renowned for his well-kept and luxuriant beard, Clayton added.He said: This very quick, casual sketch...is the closest that we get of a snapshot of Leonardo during his own lifetime.In 1968, art historian Kenneth Clark wrote that it was just conceivable that the portrait was of Leonardo when he compiled a catalogue of the drawings in the collection in 1968.The exhibition will also show studies of hands for the Adoration of the Magi by Leonardo da VinciBut the Royal Collection Trust said the suggestion went no further after this date, with the drawing returned to the archives for view only by scholars until being taken out again and reexamined ahead of the exhibition.The Buckingham Palace exhibition will mark the 500th anniversary of the artist\u0027s death and is the largest display of his work in more than 65 years.Leonardo da Vinci: A Life In Drawing runs from May 24 to October 13 at the Queen\u0027s Gallery, Buckingham Palace.Local Elections 2019: How many councils are taking part and when will we know the results?Who is Penny Mordaunt?

It\u0027s not where the Russians should be interfering. This was a mistake on their part,” Mr Bolton said. The Kremlin, which is backing Mr Maduro, in turn accused America of being behind an attempted “coup”, calling Washington’s actions a “gross violation of international law”.The US-Russia tensions flared as Juan Guaido, the 35-year-old opposition leader who declared himself interim president in January, once again took to the streets after urging a military uprising, despite violence leaving dozens injured the day before. Members of the Bolivarian National Guard who joined Venezuelan opposition leader and self-proclaimed acting president Juan Guaido fire into the air to repel forces loyal to President Nicolas MaduroIn Caracas, the Venezuelan capital, national guardsmen loyal to Mr Maduro roamed on motorcycles to control the demonstrations while tear gas was again used on the crowds.Mr Guaido had called for the biggest protests in the country’s history.  Supporters of Mr Maduro, the 56-year-old socialist leader, took to the streets as well.Mr Maduro was due to attend a rally and vowed that military figures who turned on him would not go “unpunished”. Tuesday’s calls by Mr Guaido for a military uprising had failed to topple Mr Maduro immediately and there were signs that some of those involved were seeking protection. Leopoldo Lopez, a well known opposition politician who escaped his house arrest and appeared in public on Tuesday, took refuge in the Spanish embassy. At least 25 Venezuelan troops have also applied for asylum in the Brazilian embassy.Maduro appears flanked by Venezuela\u0026#39s Defence Minister and two top military commanders in a photo released on Tuesday by the Miraflores Press OfficeTensions have been mounting between the US, one of more than 50 countries backing Mr Guaido’s claim to power, and Russia and Cuba, who support Mr Maduro and have been accused of propping him up. Mr Maduro denied a claim by Mr Pompeo that he was due to flee the country on Tuesday only to be convinced otherwise by the Russians. “Mr Pompeo, please, what lack of seriousness,” he said.The Russian foreign ministry also issued a denial, with spokesman Maria Zakharova calling it “absolute disinformation and fake news”. Mr Pompeo doubled down on the Trump administration’s instance for months that all options were on the table when it comes to US military action in Venezuela.The president has been crystal clear and incredibly consistent. Military action is possible. If that\u0027s what\u0027s required, that\u0027s what the United States will do, Mr Pompeo told Fox Business Network.An opposition demonstrator walks near a bus in flames during clashes with soldiers loyal to MaduroHe later talked to Sergey Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, and urged the Kremlin to stop its “destabilising” actions, according to the State Department.Mr Lavrov in turn called US actions illegal, according to a read out from the Russian foreign ministry, and warned the continuation of aggressive steps is fraught with the most serious consequences”. With the Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro claiming a “crack” in the Venezuelan military had been revealed but Mr Maduro himself insisting commanders remained loyal, the Venezuelan president\u0027s chances of staying in office remain unclear. But some are predicting he could yet retain power. Sergio Gúzman, a Bogota based political risk analyst, told The : “I think the moment has gone for Guaido. Maduro may have lost some military support but the opposition is losing momentum at a greater rate.”Please review our commenting policyComment: A customs union compromise with Labour would be bad for BritainLocal Elections 2019: How many councils are taking part and when will we know the results?Who is Penny Mordaunt?

That pulled down revenues at Apple, which took in 5 per cent less than it did in the same period a year ago, it said in the new results.But the market was happy, as shares surged and Apple presented the results optimistically.That seems to be largely because of Apple\u0027s growing services business, onto which it has tried to switch attention recently. Faced with a decline in iPhone sales, and a technology market that is switching towards people paying for recurring services\u0026nbsprather than hardware with one-off big purchases, it has switched attention to subscriptions.Now, that appears to be working. The company so famous for the iPhone appears to have found a way to a future where it sells less, according to the latest results, with the money from people buying iPhones dropping and the money that people spend on those iPhones growing.As part of the results, Apple said its services business had hit\u0026nbsprecord success. Though it does not break down exactly which services are doing well, it has rolled out a whole host of paid-for services in recent times, including the introduction of a paid-for magazine and newspaper subscription service called News+ along side older services like Apple Music.Created with Sketch.Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 40Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Apple has cancelled its AirPower wireless charging mat, which was slated as a way to charge numerous apple products at once India has claimed status as part of a super league of nations after shooting down a live satellite in a test of new missile technology5G wireless internet is expected to launch in 2019, with the potential to reach speeds of 50mbsUber has halted testing of driverless vehicles after a woman was killed by one of their cars in Tempe, Arizona.

Growth of output and new orders slowed, leading to job cuts for the third time in the past four months.“The trend in new export business was especially weak, as high stock holdings at clients and slower global economic growth led to reduced demand from key markets such as the European Union, the USA and China.”Brexit stockpiling continued to support production output as Britain\u0027s exit day remains uncertain, with a new deadline of October 31 to come up with a deal.Manufacturing employment declined for the third time in the past four months during April, with job losses attributed to “natural wastage, improved efficiency and workforce restructuring”.“Companies plan to use new product launches, new technologies and improved marketing strategies to drive growth forward in the coming months.“However, Brexit uncertainty continues to weigh on plans, as some firms remain concerned about future growth prospects and the likely impact on output and demand from the unwinding of inventory positions later in the year,” Mr Dobson added.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Mike Ashley\u0027s Sports Direct has appionted an employee director The Government’s “world leading package of corporate reforms” have certainly generated some world leading excuse making on the part of Britain’s biggest companies.\u0026nbspWhen she entered Number 10 Downing Street, Theresa May looked like she might be poised to do something bold and radical on behalf of employees by giving them a voice in the boardroom, only to back pedal in the face of an intensive lobbying campaign.The end result was that companies were given a couple of cop outs. As an alternative to appointing employee directors, they could instead designate an existing non executive director to pretend to care about\u0026nbspworkers interests or set up an employees’ advisory panel.\u0026nbspTheresa May’s plan to put workers on boards comes from EUMike Ashley’s Sports Direct weighs up £61m Debenhams deal\u0027Mission led\u0027 Legal \u0026amp General has mission to thwart employee directorsA big problem\u0026nbspat the outset is that the measures were introduced via Britain\u0027s corporate governance code.\u0026nbspIt gives businesses\u0026nbspcarte blanche to ignore anything they don’t like as long as they say why they’re doing so under the principle of “comply or explain”.\u0026nbspWhen the Local Authority Pension Fund Forum, whose members oversee £230bn of investments, conducted a survey of companies to find out how they were dealing with the new rules, nearly one in five (18 per cent) said they planned to ignore them. That’s where the world leading excuse will come\u0026nbspin.Of those planning to comply, just five per cent\u0026nbspsaid they would\u0026nbspappoint employee directors, with nearly three quarters (73 per cent) opting instead to hand the job to\u0026nbspexisting non executive directors. The remainder chose to convene advisory panels.\u0026nbspA look at the way some companies are handling the latter two suggests that they\u0027re treating the new requirements with rather less seriousness than you would hope.\u0026nbspMelrose, which controversially took over engineering group GKN a while back, has, for example, filled its panel not with workers but with the HR directors of the various manufacturing businesses it owns. \u0026nbspMediclinic, which operates private healthcare clinics in Southern Africa, Switzerland and the United Arab Emirates, has, meanwhile, appointed its former CEO Danie Meintjes to speak for employees in his new role as a non executive director. It’s hard to imagine a less appropriate person to serve as the voice of its workers than a company’s former boss.\u0026nbspThe LAPFF, which commendably supports reform, described its overall findings as “particularly disappointing given that no respondent to the survey considered the changes would be negative for the market or their company”.The sort of cynicism it has unearthed is, however, by no means true of all British companies. Transport operator FirstGroup has, for example, had an employee on its board for 30 years. I’ve talked to the group about its experience of this in the past and the response has been extremely positive.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.110 No deal, no tariffsThe government has announced that it would slash almost all tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit.

The numbers really aren\u0027t as good as they look\u0026nbspClick to followThe IndependentSainsbury\u0027s boss Mike Coupe pleased the City with first set of results after the collapse of his planned merger with AsdaSainsbury’s boss Mike Coupe needed to pull a rabbit out of his hat after his attempt to merge the grocer with Asda was blown up by the Competition \u0026amp Markets Authority.With his full year\u0026nbspnumbers, he found\u0026nbspone. It’s just that a fluffy bunny is not the sort of thing that can be relied upon to keep the wolves from the door for long.\u0026nbspThe numbers Coupe unveiled contained much of what the City, which doesn’t tend to look much further than the end of its own nose, tends to coo over.\u0026nbspSainsbury’s boss favoured profit over logic in the Asda mergerCMA slays Sainsbury\u0027s, Asda attempt to create supermarket Thanos Sainsbury\u0027s £12bn merger with Asda blocked by regulatorUnderlying profits - which strip out all sorts of nasties such as the £48m blown on the failed Asda experiment - were up 7.8 per cent at £692m and so (crucially) was the idend. Debt was down, ditto underlying costs.\u0026nbspIt was better than analysts had expected and lit a fire under the shares, which were the biggest gainers on the FTSE 100 early on.\u0026nbspBut all those apparently fresh looking numbers need a little context. Let’s start with the shares. They’ve been bouncing around at near 30 year lows. Set against that, a 4 per cent boost to the price is like scoring a consolation goal in injury time to ease the pain of being down by five.\u0026nbspThen there’s the “underlying” number Sainsbury’s\u0026nbspwas\u0026nbspso keen for people to focus their attention on. It excluded\u0026nbspfully £396m worth of supposedly “one off” items.\u0026nbspIn addition to the money the company blew on the deal, Sainsbury’s listed\u0026nbspcosts relating to guaranteed minimum pensions, retail restructuring, “Sainsbury’s Bank transition”, and the integration of Argos into the business.\u0026nbspAfter factoring them all in,\u0026nbspprofits\u0026nbspslumped by 41.6 per cent to just £239m. That’s a lot less fluffy than the underlying number Coupe was so keen to show off.\u0026nbspIt has risen for two years in a row but pre tax profits have been down for three.

Kantar’s authoritative retail survey has shown the group consistently losing market share. Sainsbury’s complains that it doesn’t include Argos and general merchandise in its numbers but the same is true for, say, Tesco, which has been doing a lot better when it comes to what Kantar does include.Beauty is in the eye of the beholder when it comes to corporate results and the City decided it fancied these ones despite the issues I’ve raised. Coupe has bought himself some breathing space. It will, however, prove temporary if he can’t stop Sainsbury’s from wilting. Make no mistake, that’s what it has been doing while he’s been he’s been off trying to strike a mega deal. \u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Growth of output and new orders slowed, leading to job cuts for the third time in the past four months.“The trend in new export business was especially weak, as high stock holdings at clients and slower global economic growth led to reduced demand from key markets such as the European Union, the USA and China.”Brexit stockpiling continued to support production output as Britain\u0027s exit day remains uncertain, with a new deadline of October 31 to come up with a deal.Manufacturing employment declined for the third time in the past four months during April, with job losses attributed to “natural wastage, improved efficiency and workforce restructuring”.“Companies plan to use new product launches, new technologies and improved marketing strategies to drive growth forward in the coming months.“However, Brexit uncertainty continues to weigh on plans, as some firms remain concerned about future growth prospects and the likely impact on output and demand from the unwinding of inventory positions later in the year,” Mr Dobson added.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

its first self-service outlet with no checkouts, what does it mean for Britain’s retail sector which employs more than any other part of the economy?Click to followThe IndependentStarting this week, shoppers at Sainsbury’s in High Holborn simply scan their own items using an app and then walk outAt a small, central London branch of Sainsbury’s, one mainstay of the traditional supermarket is notable by its absence: checkouts.Starting this week, shoppers in the High Holborn\u0026nbspbranch will simply scan their own items using an app and then walk out.\u0026nbspThe supermarket giant plans to use the trial to develop the app which it says will make grocery shopping quicker and more convenient.\u0026nbspBut it highlights a deepening trend towards fewer tills and ultimately fewer staff.So what might a new till-less future mean for British supermarkets and, more specifically, for the 2.7 million people who work in the retail industry?There’s little doubt stripping out tills from supermarkets will mean fewer jobs in retail, a sector that employs more than any other in the UK, comfortably ahead of the next largest employer, construction, with 1.8 million.Sainsbury’s has said the\u0026nbspnew setup merely frees up staff to spend time on the shop floor helping out customers and stocking shelves.\u0026nbspBut it would defy business logic to think retailers will keep on all of the 200,000 cashiers estimated to work in the UK when the need for them disappears.Created with Sketch.Ageing Japan: Robots\u0027 role in future of elderly care Show all 15Created with

biggest costs and one which they need to cut if they are to face up to the looming challenge of online retailers, including the mighty Amazon.The Office for National Statistics (ONS) estimates that around two-thirds of cashier jobs are at high risk of being replaced by technology. That would mean around 135,000 jobs disappearing.The new store format is more evolution than revolution.\u0026nbspSainsbury’s\u0026nbsphas already trialled its self-service app in other convenience stores and rivals including Marks \u0026amp Spencer and the\u0026nbspCo-op have piloted\u0026nbsptheir own equivalents.\u0026nbspMeanwhile, thousands of supermarket jobs have already gone at all of the big players as they battle discount chains like Lidl and Aldi which employ fewer checkout staff.It won’t have escaped anyone’s notice that supermarkets increasingly rely on self-service checkouts. The self-scan app is the next step on\u0026nbspthat trend.Why shell out on expensive till technology when most shoppers now have a portable barcode scanner in their pocket in the form of their smartphone?So the trend towards automation is well established, but it still has a long way to go.Large parts of the supply chain that brings food (and other products) to our doors could also be automated within the next decade or so.With artificial intelligence, self-driving vehicles and robots, the technology to replace lorry drivers,\u0026nbspwarehouse workers and administrative staff is already here.\u0026nbspPerhaps half of jobs related to retail could be automated as that technology improves and costs comes down, according to some estimates.Created with Sketch.

Improving the efficiency of one of the most important parts of the economy should be welcomed and new jobs will be created as old ones disappear. But the impact of these changes depends hugely on how the process\u0026nbspis managed.\u0026nbspAutomation is frequently referred to as the “fourth industrial revolution”.The government must play a much more proactive role than in previous upheavals, actively forecasting the changes and proactively helping those affected into training and alternative employment rather than hiding behind the excuse that “market forces” will work their magic.It seems likely that they will, but that shop floor workers will still have a significant, if reduced, part to play.\u0026nbspUltimately it will come down to shoppers’ preferences. After all, supermarkets introduced (non-smartphone-based) self-scan apps in the\u0026nbsp1990s\u0026nbspbut the idea never really took off.Will we be willing to pay a little extra to go to a shop that has a few more staff that we can ask for assistance or will we go for the cheapest option?\u0026nbspThere’s almost certainly room for both. As many retailers well know, price is an important determinant of consumer behaviour but it is far from being the only one.\u0026nbspTherefore, there will be room for a no-frills, no-tills shopping experience\u0026nbspalongside more traditional offerings, perhaps with a relatively small number of highly knowledgeable retail assistants that online rivals can’t offer.Traditional retailers are increasingly switching on to the fact that our experiences\u0026nbspof shopping in a real-life store – the sights, sounds, textures and personal interactions – are their key advantage.So a future where we glide in solitary fashion through\u0026nbspthe aisles filling up our baskets without ever interacting with\u0026nbspanyone seems – thankfully – a little way off yet.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This information can help buyers make the right decision.”A Plusnet spokesperson said: “We’d like to apologise to our customers as we know this isn’t the service they’ve come to expect from us.“We worked with Ofcom to keep them informed and to ensure our customers received the best service through this difficult time.“This report refers to complaints during that time in October to December since then we’ve been working hard to get things back on track and the most recent complaints data shows that we are heading in the right direction.”TalkTalk said: “We’re pleased that Ofcom’s data again shows an improving trend for the number of complaints received about TalkTalk. And while some of the results in the quality of service report are disappointing, we are already seeing more customers than ever staying with us.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Others stressed security, such as new encryption tools which will stop messages from being snooped on.But others just added other new fe\u0026nbspatures – including one that allows Facebook to tell people who is crushing on them.The app taking the lead in Facebook\u0027s new privacy-focused approach, Messenger has been made end-to-end encrypted by default for the first time, fully securing messages sent on the service.The app itself has also been completely rebuilt from the ground up, Facebook says, as part of a project called LightSpeed that will make the app smaller and quicker to download, as well as faster to load.A standalone desktop app for both Windows and Mac users is also being introduced, as is a new space in the Messenger app called Close Friends, where users can share messages and Stories with selected close friends and family.The world\u0027s largest social media platform is getting a redesign - with the trademark blue panels of the site being turned white.The company says the redesign, which will roll out later this year, will make the website simpler, faster, more immersive and puts your communities at the centre.The firm\u0027s Facebook Dating feature has also been updated to include a new Secret Crush feature, which will allow users to select up to nine people they\u0027re already friends with they can express interest in.

But it could eventually roll out to all users, leaving them unable to see how many likes their posts get.People will still be able to see when someone likes their posts, and clicking through will show everyone who has done so. But the only way to find out how many of them there are would be manually counting up, since Instagram will no longer show the big number next to the post.“Later this week, we’re running a test in Canada that removes the total number of likes on photos and video views in Feed, Permalink pages and Profile,” an Instagram spokesperson told\u0026nbspTechCrunch, which first reported the news. “We are testing this because we want your followers to focus on the photos and videos you share, not how many likes they get.Created with Sketch.11 useful Instagram features you didn\u0027t know existed Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.111 Hide and reorder filtersFilters are a core part of Instagram, but there are so many available it can be easy to get lost.

On the filters page, scroll to the end, tap Manage, then drag and drop the ones you want to reorder, and un-check the ones you want to hide.

Instagram unfortunately doesn’t let you tinker with filters and effects, but you can change your original caption, tag people and update the location.  Many influencers and other people who are paid to post on Facebook use the like metric as an important way of understanding how popular and engaging a post is. Those numbers can then affect how much brands will pay them to post, making likes an important number for those users.Facebook quietly announces exposure of millions of Instagram passwordsInstagram said it was aware that hiding the likes could therefore be financially difficult for many Instagram users. It told Techcrunch it was thinking through ways for them to communicate value to their brand partners and that the idea was still in its exploratory stages.As anxiety about the damage social media is doing to people\u0027s mental health and wellbeing has spread, the idea of removing some of the more obvious and competitive markers of a person\u0027s popularity has spread. The idea has gathered support from people including Kanye West, who last year sent a flurry of posts about the damage that like counters were doing to social media users.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Eminem also raps: Lil Pump, Lil Xan imitate Lil Wayne.“I just like Em’s flow but don’t like that he’s dissing new rappers,” Bieber wrote. “I like the new generation of rap he just doesn’t understand it.”Created with Sketch.The best albums of 2019 (so far) Show all 32Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.It’s not uncommon for an artist to be influenced by the place they grew up in. Yet few are likely to have as much inspiration to draw on as India-born, Zimbabwe-raised and now Peckham-based artist Rina Mushonga.On Deerhunter’s eighth album, frontman Bradford Cox takes on the role of war poet, documenting the things he observes with a cool matter-of-factness, and heart-wrenching detail. Death is everywhere on Why Hasn’t Everything Already Disappeared?, as much as others may refuse to see it.After a period of tumult, Sharon Van Etten’s fifth album is a reinvention. But beneath its hazy synths and electronics are songs of endurance and inner peace, of settling after a flurry of activity. 432 Bring Me the Horizon  – AmoBMTH frontman Oli Sykes wants to assert the fragility of the boundary between love and hate. Amo is a way of exploring that, even down to the title itself.532 Nina Nesbitt – The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will ChangeNesbitt is back with her second LP, switching to a brand of soul and R\u0026ampB-fused pop that feels bang on time, and suits her far better. The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will Change has slick, polished production from Fraser T Smith (Adele), Lostboy (Anne-Marie), Jordan Riley (Zara Larsson), and Nesbitt herself.This self-titled record, a loose but beautifully crafted collection of folk-rock songs, explores the kinds of anxieties intrinsic to the modern age – the longing to be at once noticed and invisible the paralysing effects of limitless information, and the desire to do good versus the desire to be seen doing good.The album is packed with personal confessions for the fans – “Arianators” – to pick over. It lacks a centrepiece to match the arresting depth and space of Sweetener’s “God Is A Woman”, but Grande handles its shifting moods and cast of producers (including pop machines Max Martin and Tommy Brown) with engaging class and momentum. One minute you’re skanking along to the party brass of “Bloodline” the next floating into the semi-detached, heartbreak of “Ghostin’”, which appears to address Grande’s guilt at being with Davidson while pining for Miller. She sings of the late rapper as a “wingless angel” with featherlight high notes that will drop the sternest jaw. (Helen Brown)The perma-brilliant James Blake has flooded his fourth album – Assume Form – with euphoric sepia soul and loved-up doo-wop. His trademark intelligence, honesty and pin-drop production remain intact. But the detached chorister vocals of a decade in which he battled depression have thawed to reveal a millennial Sam Cooke crooning: “Can’t believe the way we flow, way we flow, way we flow...”While he recognises his roots and includes plenty of nods to grime, AJ Tracey\u0027s magpie’s eye for a good melody or hook extends far beyond that. With the help of stellar producers like Cadenza (Kiko Bun), Swifta Beater (Kano, Giggs), and Nyge (Section Boyz, Yxng Bane), Tracey incorporates electronic music, rock, garage and even country on his most cohesive work to date.The album title of the year gives us an image of Brexit Britain trashed by Old Etonians David Cameron, Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg, but the fifth studio work from the punk duo has more than social commentary to offer. There’s some of that, as vocalist Jason Williamson skewers documentary-makers who take advantage of the poor in “Kebab Spider” – “the skint get used in loo roll shoes” – but elsewhere this is a record that expands the idea of what Sleaford Mods could be.“Do you still have that photograph? Would you use it to hurt me?” asks Australian indie rocker Julia Jacklin, against the menacing throb of “Body”. The tension is stormy: imagine a mid-period Fleetwood Mac song, covered by Cat Power. It’s a masterclass in narrative songwriting.With praise from Kendrick Lamar, five EPs released by the time she was 21, tours with Lauryn Hill, collaborations with Gorillaz and two critically praised albums – including 2017’s excellent concept album Stillness in Wonderland – fans and critics alike wondered what else Little Simz could do to find the kind of mainstream success enjoyed by so many of her male peers.1332 Solange – When I Get HomeSolange Knowles has never been coy about the intent behind her music. Beautiful arrangements and seamless production notwithstanding, you get the sense, each time she drop a project, that it serves a distinct, zeitgeist-shifting purpose.1432 Foals – Everything Not Saved Will be Lost (Part 1)FoalsMerging their asymmetrical early math pop with the deep space atmospherics of Total Life Forever and Holy Fire, plus added innovations – ambient rainforest throbs on “Moonlight”, deadpan EDM on “In Degrees”, Afro-glitch Radiohead on “Café D’Athens” – they’ve created an inspired album of scorched earth new music that, in all likelihood, will only really be challenged for album of the year by Part 2. (Mark Beaumont)Tracks are at once astute and deeply personal in how they capture vignettes of everyday life and spin them into important lessons. “Black”, the most recent single from the record, considers what that word means to different people around the world, as well as to Dave. “Voices” has him singing over an old-school garage beat, fighting off personal demons.At her best, Sigrid throws out precision-tooled high notes like icicle javelins into vast, blue Scandi-produced skies. Then she growls like an Icelandic volcano preparing to disrupt western civilisation until we sort ourselves out.1732 Karen O and Danger Mouse – Lux PrimaLux Prima was born just over a decade ago from a drunken phone call from Karen O to Danger Mouse – real name Brian Joseph Burton – during which the pair vowed they would work on something together. It wasn’t until after O had given birth to her son, though, that recording finally began, and there is a beatific sense of contentment on songs like “Drown”, with its Kamasi Washington-like choirs and stately horns.This is an ambitious creation, meticulously crafted and assembled. For a start, the range of guest performers is a cornucopia of contemporary soul and hip-hop collaborators: vocalists Moses Sumney, Roots Manuva, Heidi Vogel, Grey Reverend and Tawiah strings player Miguel Atwood-Ferguson, and keyboardist Dennis Hamm – both of whom have worked with Flying Lotus and Thundercat.Rose – who found fame in the UK’s indie-folk scene as an unofficial member of Bombay Bicycle Club in 2010, only to walk away amid the band’s growing hype – is darkly compelling on No Words Left. Assisted by producer Tim Bidwell, who worked on Rose’s last record Something’s Changing, she sounds braver than she ever has before. There are moments that recall her Communion labelmate Ben Howard, on his latest album, Noonday Dream, and others that nod to the quiet stoicism of Joni Mitchell and Neil Young. (Roisin O\u0027Connor)The record is loosely conceptual insomuch as it’s punctuated with mock adverts for “WWAY HEALTH, our 247 care programme”. But don’t be put off: Miss Universe is a brilliant collection of songs, an expansive melange of indie, jazz, pop and trip-hop that flits between a lo-fi sparseness and something The Strokes would play. Yanya – who is of Turkish-Irish-Bajan heritage – grew up in London on a mix of Pixies, Nina Simone, The Libertines and Amy Winehouse, and this unlikely combination is certainly reflected in the sound. (Patrick Smith)2132 Jenny Lewis – On the LineHere, Lewis does what she does best: adds the glossy sparkle of Hollywood and a sunny Californian sheen to melancholy and nostalgia, with her most luxuriantly orchestrated album yet. Even when she’s singing, “I’ve wasted my youth”, it’s in that sweet voice, with carefree “doo doo doo doo doo doos”, and at a pace that’s so upbeat that it masks the sentiment. It’s a bittersweet mourning of her past. (Elisa Bray)Comprising songs from Segall’s eclectic (that’s putting it lightly) catalogue and performed by him and the Freedom Band (Mikal Cronin, Charles Moothart, Emmett Kelly, and Ben Boye), the album is delightfully short and sweet. It is certainly a drastic switch-up from Freedom’s Goblin (2018), which had 19 tracks and ran for 75 minutes.If you want to know how hard it is to categorise Titanic Rising – the enthralling fourth album from Weyes Blood – look no further than the American musician’s own attempt to do so. It is, she says, “The Kinks meet the Second World War, or Bob Seger meets Enya.”Tension aside, there’s a great sense of fun here. The title track is pure euphoria, as restless synths of a Utah Saints or Orbital rave break into swelling bass and melody. And they create the full club experience with “Got to Keep On”, on which the four-to-the-floor beat, funky rhythm guitar, sweet backing vocals and chiming bells make way for the simple sounds of happy party-goers just as the anticipation builds, so does the instrumentation into a hypnotic crescendo. It’s masterful production. (Elisa Bray)Six months after the release of Oxnard, Anderson .Paak returns with another Dr Dre-produced record, Ventura. Where the former was overflowing with choppy, experimental sounds, guest appearances and clumsy attempts at Gil Scott Heron-esque revolutionary lyrics, the sequel – recorded around the same time – streamlines .Paak’s sound, making for a tightly packaged, melodic and danceable album.Two years after the release of his Mercury Prize-nominated debut Yesterday’s Gone, the south London hip-hop artist unveils its follow-up, Not Waving, But Drowning. And if any two records could portray how quickly someone can grow from a boy to a man, it’s these.2732 Lizzo – Cuz I Love YouNo one could accuse Lizzo of holding back. Not when it comes to her voice – which is raw and rowdy, so laden with personality even the vulnerable moments are a joy to listen to –  and certainly not when it comes to her message of unabashed self-love. That’s the predominant theme of the singer  rapper  flautist-extraordinaire’s hugely likeable third album, Cuz I Love You.It seems as likely as Old Man Steptoe dining with the Rees-Mogg, but this new tactic of burying their confrontational gruesomeness beneath a veneer of alt-rock respectability for album three works well for Fat White Family. Drenched in chamber strings and celestial harmonies, the plush yet sinister “Oh Sebastian” could be Pet Sounds selling its soul to the devil. “Fringe Runner” is so sleek and funksome it could be a New Romantic “White Lines (Don’t Don’t Do It)” “Kim’s Sunsets” is a piece of refined cosmic reggae resembling a blissed-out “Bankrobber”.2932 Cage the Elephant – Social CuesOn Cage the Elephant’s fifth album, Social Cues, frontman Matt Shultz reacts to the breakdown of his marriage and the loss of three close friends. He undergoes a kind of Jekyll and Hyde transition through the 13 tracks, the result of which is the band’s best work to date.SOAK reaches to outsiders once again on her new album. 3132 The Cranberries – In the EndThere’s a cruel irony that the release of The Cranberries’ final album should come just a week after journalist Lyra McKee was shot dead by the New IRA during a riot in Londonderry. “Zombie” was a protest song written by the band’s late frontwoman Dolores O’Riordan after two children were killed by IRA bombs – was released. She was deeply affected by the deaths, and would no doubt have been devastated by recent events in Northern Ireland as well.On her third record, Aldous Harding combines the gothic folk of her self-titled 2014 debut with the dramatically intimate tones of her follow-up album Party.It’s not uncommon for an artist to be influenced by the place they grew up in. Yet few are likely to have as much inspiration to draw on as India-born, Zimbabwe-raised and now Peckham-based artist Rina Mushonga.On Deerhunter’s eighth album, frontman Bradford Cox takes on the role of war poet, documenting the things he observes with a cool matter-of-factness, and heart-wrenching detail.

For a start, the range of guest performers is a cornucopia of contemporary soul and hip-hop collaborators: vocalists Moses Sumney, Roots Manuva, Heidi Vogel, Grey Reverend and Tawiah strings player Miguel Atwood-Ferguson, and keyboardist Dennis Hamm – both of whom have worked with Flying Lotus and Thundercat.Rose – who found fame in the UK’s indie-folk scene as an unofficial member of Bombay Bicycle Club in 2010, only to walk away amid the band’s growing hype – is darkly compelling on No Words Left. Assisted by producer Tim Bidwell, who worked on Rose’s last record Something’s Changing, she sounds braver than she ever has before. There are moments that recall her Communion labelmate Ben Howard, on his latest album, Noonday Dream, and others that nod to the quiet stoicism of Joni Mitchell and Neil Young. (Roisin O\u0027Connor)The record is loosely conceptual insomuch as it’s punctuated with mock adverts for “WWAY HEALTH, our 247 care programme”. But don’t be put off: Miss Universe is a brilliant collection of songs, an expansive melange of indie, jazz, pop and trip-hop that flits between a lo-fi sparseness and something The Strokes would play. Yanya – who is of Turkish-Irish-Bajan heritage – grew up in London on a mix of Pixies, Nina Simone, The Libertines and Amy Winehouse, and this unlikely combination is certainly reflected in the sound. (Patrick Smith)2132 Jenny Lewis – On the LineHere, Lewis does what she does best: adds the glossy sparkle of Hollywood and a sunny Californian sheen to melancholy and nostalgia, with her most luxuriantly orchestrated album yet. Even when she’s singing, “I’ve wasted my youth”, it’s in that sweet voice, with carefree “doo doo doo doo doo doos”, and at a pace that’s so upbeat that it masks the sentiment. It’s a bittersweet mourning of her past. (Elisa Bray)Comprising songs from Segall’s eclectic (that’s putting it lightly) catalogue and performed by him and the Freedom Band (Mikal Cronin, Charles Moothart, Emmett Kelly, and Ben Boye), the album is delightfully short and sweet. It is certainly a drastic switch-up from Freedom’s Goblin (2018), which had 19 tracks and ran for 75 minutes.If you want to know how hard it is to categorise Titanic Rising – the enthralling fourth album from Weyes Blood – look no further than the American musician’s own attempt to do so. It is, she says, “The Kinks meet the Second World War, or Bob Seger meets Enya.”Tension aside, there’s a great sense of fun here. The title track is pure euphoria, as restless synths of a Utah Saints or Orbital rave break into swelling bass and melody. And they create the full club experience with “Got to Keep On”, on which the four-to-the-floor beat, funky rhythm guitar, sweet backing vocals and chiming bells make way for the simple sounds of happy party-goers just as the anticipation builds, so does the instrumentation into a hypnotic crescendo. It’s masterful production. (Elisa Bray)Six months after the release of Oxnard, Anderson .Paak returns with another Dr Dre-produced record, Ventura. Where the former was overflowing with choppy, experimental sounds, guest appearances and clumsy attempts at Gil Scott Heron-esque revolutionary lyrics, the sequel – recorded around the same time – streamlines .Paak’s sound, making for a tightly packaged, melodic and danceable album.Two years after the release of his Mercury Prize-nominated debut Yesterday’s Gone, the south London hip-hop artist unveils its follow-up, Not Waving, But Drowning. And if any two records could portray how quickly someone can grow from a boy to a man, it’s these.2732 Lizzo – Cuz I Love YouNo one could accuse Lizzo of holding back. Not when it comes to her voice – which is raw and rowdy, so laden with personality even the vulnerable moments are a joy to listen to –  and certainly not when it comes to her message of unabashed self-love. That’s the predominant theme of the singer  rapper  flautist-extraordinaire’s hugely likeable third album, Cuz I Love You.It seems as likely as Old Man Steptoe dining with the Rees-Mogg, but this new tactic of burying their confrontational gruesomeness beneath a veneer of alt-rock respectability for album three works well for Fat White Family. Drenched in chamber strings and celestial harmonies, the plush yet sinister “Oh Sebastian” could be Pet Sounds selling its soul to the devil. “Fringe Runner” is so sleek and funksome it could be a New Romantic “White Lines (Don’t Don’t Do It)” “Kim’s Sunsets” is a piece of refined cosmic reggae resembling a blissed-out “Bankrobber”.2932 Cage the Elephant – Social CuesOn Cage the Elephant’s fifth album, Social Cues, frontman Matt Shultz reacts to the breakdown of his marriage and the loss of three close friends. He undergoes a kind of Jekyll and Hyde transition through the 13 tracks, the result of which is the band’s best work to date.SOAK reaches to outsiders once again on her new album. 3132 The Cranberries – In the EndThere’s a cruel irony that the release of The Cranberries’ final album should come just a week after journalist Lyra McKee was shot dead by the New IRA during a riot in Londonderry. “Zombie” was a protest song written by the band’s late frontwoman Dolores O’Riordan after two children were killed by IRA bombs – was released. She was deeply affected by the deaths, and would no doubt have been devastated by recent events in Northern Ireland as well.On her third record, Aldous Harding combines the gothic folk of her self-titled 2014 debut with the dramatically intimate tones of her follow-up album Party.Eminem, 46, released\u0026nbspKamikaze\u0026nbspas a surprise in August last year. The album was certified platinum later in 2018.Combined with Eminem’s back catalogue,\u0026nbspKamikaze\u0026nbspmade him the top album seller of the year.Biebers’ most recent album,\u0026nbspPurpose, dates back to 2015.

You’ve printed it anyway. I’m not writing S6 let alone S7. The only thing I’m desperate to do is tell people what a c*** you are.”Line of Duty episode 5 review: A winningly tense penultimate episodeLine of Duty’s fifth series comes to an end with a 90-minute episode this Sunday. Fans are hopeful the\u0026nbspidentity of the enigmatic H will be revealed following a devastating episode that saw Superintendent Ted Hastings end up behind bars.The latest outing saw the addition of Anna Maxwell Martin who plays Patricia Carmichael. Speaking on Zoe Ball’s Radio 2 show, the Bleak House actor revealed it was a struggle to learn her lines for the dialogue-heavy interrogation scenes.Created with Sketch.The best TV cliffhangers of all time Show all 37Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Karma for killing Gale comes for Walter White in season five. The meth maker believes his days of cooking are long over. Having lunch with his family, everything seems perfect. And then everything goes wrong. So, so wrong. Hank (Dean Norris) goes to use the toilet and picks up a copy of Walt Whitman\u0027s Leaves of Grass – a gift from Gale to Walter White. “To my other favorited WW. It\u0027s an honour working with you. Fondly, GB.” And with that, as Hank realises Walt’s true identity, the end of Heisenberg’s empire begins.The debate over whether certain final scenes of television shows are actually good will rage on and on. The Sopranos remains front and centre of the conversation. It\u0027s a seemingly banal occasion – a restaurant dinner scene. We watch on as Tony sits there, observing other customers. Carmela arrives, then AJ and Meadow, who the last we see, is parking her car outside. A bell rings, Tony looks up and the screen cuts to black. It’s an ending that’s inspired essays offering varied interpretations but ultimately, it remains a beautifully-executed few minutes of television – and a cliffhanger that’ll never have a resolution.337 EastEnders – The Kat and Zoe revelation (2001)“You can’t tell me what to do ‘cause you ain’t my muvva”  “YES I AM!” - not the work of Shakespeare, granted, but surely one of the biggest moments in soap history. The nation’s jaws collectively dropped as they learned that Kat Slater (Jessie Wallace) wasn’t Zoe’s sister at all, but her mum.  437 Game of Thrones – The Rains of Castamere (2013)Game of Thrones knew George RR Martin was willing to kill off leading characters, but nothing prepared non-book readers for The Red Wedding. Robb Stark (Richard Madden), Talisa Stark (Oona Chaplin) and Catelyn Stark (Michelle Fairley) are attending the wedding of Roslin Frey (Alexandra Dowling) and Edmure Tully (Tobias Menzies) when things go terribly, terribly wrong for the Starks. The Freys turn on them, killing Robb, Talisa and their unborn child. Then, as the blood spills everywhere, Catelyn’s throat is slit. Cut to black. Devastating.The cliffhanger that kickstarted the end of season cliffhanger trend. Larry Hagman’s oil baron JR Ewing had made plenty of enemies in Dallas. By the end of season three, one of them took justice into their own hands, shooting JR in the back twice. However, rather than reveal the culprit, the team behind Dallas left the case unsolved. And over the next eight months – the time between seasons – the whole world was asking “Who shot JR?” Unsurprisingly, considering the hysteria around the mystery, 350 million people tuned in to watch the revelatory episode “Who Done It”.Showrunner Matt Groening had long wanted to do an episode where Mr Burns was shot, and the culprit was not revealed until the next episode. Taking inspiration from Dallas, the animation concluded Part One with the nuclear power plant owner being shot by an unknown assailant. Then, after a Summer of waiting, fans were finally treated to the answer. The two-part episode has gone down as a classic and is often heralded as the series’ best.737 Doctor Who – The Parting of the Ways (2005)Choosing one standout Doctor Who cliffhanger is almost impossible – especially when you consider that all 37 (and counting) seasons have frequently used the plot device. While the introduction of John Hurt’s Doctor certainly ranks among them, one of best came at the end of the rebooted first series. Having absorbed a bunch of vortexes, the Doctor is struggling and on the verge of regenerating. Turning to Rose (Billie Piper), Christopher Eccleston’s incarnation of the iconic character utters the timeless lines: “Before I go, I just want to tell you, you were fantastic. Absolutely fantastic. And you know what – so was I.” Queue shoddy CGI and the introduction of the soon-to-be nation’s favourite Doctor, David Tennant. “So, where was I? That’s it – Barcelona.”Gale (David Costabile) is one of the nicest characters on Breaking Bad. He is not interested in wealth or fame, but in science. However, niceties and a good cup of coffee are not enough to stop him getting in Walter White’s (Bryan Cranston) way. When the choice between their lives has to be made, Walter chooses his own and sends Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul) to do the dirty work. Season three ends with Jesse killing Gale – an incident that eventually brings down the drug kingpin Gus Fring.937 The West Wing – “What Kind of Day Has it Been” (2000)The West Wing’s biggest cliffhanger came in the season one finale. The episode works its way back from the beginning as we see a Secret Service Agent sense danger from a nearby window at a town hall meeting with the president in attendance. When the episode catches up, gunfire rings out and each member of his senior staff is thrown to the floor. Cut to black as we hear an agent ask over the radio: “Who’s been hit?”It wasn’t until the third season finale of Smallville that Superman fans’ patience was rewarded as viewers saw Clark (Tom Welling) appear naked in the middle of a Kryptonian symbol burned into the field of his family’s farm. “You shall be reborn,” Jor-El can be heard saying to Clark Kent, but he wasn’t the alone one the ending marked a radical turning point for the series.Twin Peaks’ season two finale – the mystery drama’s last episode for 27 years – may have featured the most chilling cliffhanger, but the biggest gasp of the series came at the end of season one as the seemingly untouchable Dale Cooper (Kyle MacLachlan) responds to a knock on his hotel room door, only to be gunned down by an unseen assailant.1237 Buffy the Vampire Slayer – The Gift (2001)The 100th episode of Buffy ended with one of the show’s most shocking moments (and no, we’re not talking about the musical episode). Season five concluded with the eponymous ass-kicker sacrificing herself to save the world by jumping into a demonic portal. The episode ends with a slow zoom onto Buffy’s tombstone, which reads: “Beloved sister. Devoted friend. She saved the world. A lot.“It\u0027s easy to forget that True Blood began life as an acclaimed Emmy-nominated drama, and it was a cliffhanger such as this that made it so: Sookie Stackhouse (Anna Paquin) falls asleep with the friendly neighbour dog Dean for company. Upon waking up, Dean is gone and in his place is local barman Sam Merlotte ( Sam Trammell). Turns out he\u0027s a shapeshifter.1437 The Walking Dead – Last Day on Earth (2016)After eight episodes of build-up, the comic book’s deadliest villain, Negan, reared his head in a scene fans were dreading. With the majority of the main cast lined up at his mercy, Negan – in retaliation for the death of one of his gang – decides which one to kill by using “Eeny Meeny Mino Moe”. After selecting his victim, the camera switches POV and Negan bludgeons the unseen character to death leaving fans with a six-month wait before finding out who had met their maker.Lost co-creator Damon Lindelof\u0027s HBO drama was set in a world that saw two per cent of the world’s population disappear into thin air during a tragic event known as the Sudden Departure. Season two presented an intriguing mystery: the disappearance of three teenage girls from a Texan town that nobody had vanished from. It was the season\u0027s penultimate episode that cleared up this plot line as Matt Garvey (Chris Zylka) breaks into a heavily-guarded trailer – only to be met with the three teenage girls staring back at him. What’s more is they’re dressed all in white, a callback to the disbanded cult from the first season.In episode 11, the writers had introduced a hatch buried underground and, week in week out, the fans waited patiently for any detail about the mysterious structure the writers were willing to give them. The end of episode 19 saw a desperate John Locke (Terry O’Quinn) banging on the door, just as desperate to get inside as the viewers were... only for a light to come on from within. This ending remains an unforgettable moment for those who watched it at the time of broadcast.1737 Lost – “Two for the Road” (2006)“I’m sorry.” “For what?” BANG. On paper, not so effective but on screen, it equated to one of Lost’s most gasp-inducing cliffhangers. Viewers watched behind their eyes as Michael (Harold Perrineau), desperate to save his son from the mysterious Others, shoots Ana-Lucia (Michelle Rodriguez) and, in a cruel twist, Libby (Cynthia Watros), who has accidentally stumbled upon the whole thing while looking for some blankets.1837 Lost - \u0027Through the Looking Glass – Part 2Whether you love or hate Lost, there’s no denying that the season three finale deployed one of the most breathtaking rug pulls in television history as writers Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse revealed a shake-up long in the running: flashbacks featuring a suicidal Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) were, in fact, flashforwards to the future. The Oceanic Flight 815 plane crash survivor made it off the island he’d been so desperate to get off for three whole seasons, but was, disturbingly, desperate to get back. The ending set the benchmark for all future finale and was so huge it made newspaper headlines.1937 Line of Duty – Series four premiere (2018)The fourth series of Line of Duty didn’t hold back on the shocks. In fact, its first episode featured a cliffhanger ending to rival the best of them. With DCI Roz Huntley (Thandie Newton) dead on his floor, her murderer – Forensic Coordinator Tim Ifield (Jason Watkins) – sets about dispatching her body, but as his chainsaw nears her face, Roz’s eyes suddenly open.After season one, Heroes became pretty dreadful television. But this cliffhanger looms in the memory for being so left-field it warrants applaud: having captured serial killer Sylar, Angela Petrelli – parent to superheroes Nathan and Peter – tells him she can provide him with the love and guidance he needs. Angry, Sylar tells her she’s not his mother to which Angela drops the bombshell: “But I am dear, I am.” A head-scratching mid-season reveal that had fans chomping at the bit for the next episode.After spending an entire season watching the blossoming romance between medical intern Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo) and Dr Derek Shephard (Patrick Dempsey), the world of viewers was rocked upon discovering the shock revelation that Derek was married all along.Channel 4 sitcom Green Wing took the term “cliffhanger” quite literally for each finale of its two series. While it became a tad gimmicky the second time around, the first remained a genuinely surprising way for a comedy series to end: having discovered that the colleague he’d just slept with was his mother, drug-addled anaesthetist Guy Secretan (Stephen Mangan) steals an ambulance, drives it to the country and loses control. After crashing, the episode ends with Guy and several other characters dangling – you guessed it – off a cliff.A particularly nail-biting fourth season was shaping up to end well: after weeks of playing cat-and-mouse with the Trinity Killer (John Lithgow on Emmy-winning form), Dexter finally put an end to his murderous ways and returned home ready to pack up and join his wife Rita on their vacation. Only Rita’s still at home... dead in the bathtub. Trinity killed her before Dexter got to him. A heartbreaking end to a standout season.When things are going supremely well towards the end of a season finale, you know something big is about to go down. Battlestar Galactica proved no different. After destroying the Cylon Basestar – a warship belonging to the enemy – crew member Boomer, who viewers had learnt was a Cylon in the mini-series that aired the year before, fires a round into the chest of Commander Adama (Edward James Olmos), the show’s main character.Having been warned for two seasons that Z’ha’dum means death, fans expected big things from an episode called “Z’ha’dum”. They weren’t wrong. It ended with the show’s lead character jumping to his death. The episode was so big the episodes leading up to it teased “Z minus 14 days” and “Z minus 7 days.”24 was filled to the brim with huge cliffhangers, but this one – arriving at the 16 episode mark – stands out for sparking what would be the show’s best run of episodes. President Charles Logan (Gregory Itzin) is revealed to be the mastermind behind the shocking assassinations of David Palmer and Michelle Dessler, which kickstarted the season. And thus the show’s most memorable villain was born.2737 Friends – The One with Ross’s Wedding (1998)While Ross (David Schwimmer) and Rachel’s (Jennifer Aniston) “will they, won’t they” courtship arguably went on far too long, there was one moment during the season four finale that left fans with their jaws on the floor. Just after Rachel had accepted Ross was happy with fiancé Emily (Helen Baxendale), everything goes catastrophically wrong. Instead of saying Emily’s name during the wedding vows, Ross says the iconic line: “Take thee Rachel”. After the wedding, as the season finished, everyone was left wondering whether the pair would finally rekindle their romance for good.“I’m in a boxcar, buried inside a quarry, and there are bodies everywhere,” says Mulder to Scully during the season two finale. And just as Mulder solves the riddle of how those people died, the roof of the boxcar slams shut, trapping him inside. Worse still, the Smoking Man then arrives with a unit of soldiers. When they open the boxcar, Mulder’s somehow nowhere to be seen and they decide to blow the freight to smithereens. Did Mulder survive? Did he get away?2937 Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life – Fall (2016)“It certainly wasn\u0027t the ending I expected,” Rory Gilmore actor Alexis Bledel said of the finale. “Fitting but frustrating”, was how Vanity Fair referred to the episode. The Gilmore Girls sequel, A Year in the Life, concluded with a four-word exchange between Rory and her mother, Lorelai (Lauren Graham). “Mum”, the daughter says, sitting in a park’s bandstand. “Yeah”, she replies. “I’m pregnant,” Rory says. Queue hundreds of fans wanting more from the story, which had, ultimately, come full circle.3037 Star Trek: The Next Generation – Best of Both Worlds (1990)Another science fiction show filled to the brim with cliffhangers. Star Trek: The Next Generation had many, but few can measure up to Picard (Patrick Stewart) becoming a Borg. The season three finale sees the Enterprise’s crew having no choice but to turn on their former captain, with Riker (Jonathan Frakes) ordering Worf (Michael Dorn) to open fire on Picard’s Borg ship. Fans had to wait three months to discover whether Picard could be saved – and the fandom almost imploded in the meantime.Marissa Cooper (Mischa Barton) and Ryan Atwood (Benjamin McKenzie) would have done anything for each other. When Ryan’s brother Trey (Logan Marshall-Green) gets in the way, attacking Marissa, Ryan has no other course of action but to settle things “once and for all” between them. As the brawl ensues, Marissa somehow ends up shooting Trey. And as the bullet goes through him, Imogen Heap’s song “Hide and Seek” – AKA the “Mmmmh, what you say?” song – suddenly starts playing. It’s hard not to laugh. The pop song cuts through the scene, completely at odds with what’s happening on screen. No wonder, then, that Saturday Night Live famously parodied the scene in one of their most-beloved skits of all time.Jim (John Krasinski) and Pam (Jenna Fischer) were the ultimate “will they, won’t they” couple, their chemistry electrifying the early seasons of The Office. Things peaked for the first time during the season two finale. Following Casino Night at Dunder Mifflin, Jim finally takes Pam aside to reveal his true feelings, telling her: “I’m in love with you.” She is, at the time, engaged to Roy (David Denman), and decides to reply to Jim: “What are you doing?” While all hope for the pair seems lost, Jim finds Pam (calling her mother) before the episode’s end and kisses her. Cruelly, the showrunners decided to cut to black after the moment, leaving fans wondering for months whether the couple would return to screens happily together (spoiler: they do not).JJ Abrams loves ending things on a twist. Before creating the mystery-box filled Lost, the filmmaker created Alias, and the season two finale marks one the show’s greatest endings. The episode sees Sydney (Jennifer Garner) discover that Francie (Merrin Dungey) is not Francie at all, but a duplicate. The two then brawl, ending with Sydney shooting Francie and then collapsing due to exhaustion. We immediately jump to Sydney waking up in Hong Kong. After reuniting with her lover Michael Vaughn (Michael Vartan), Sydney realises things are amiss as Michael is wearing a wedding ring. Turns out, she has been missing for almost two years. Cut to black, and the world asking “What just happened?”3437 Spooks – Smoke and Mirrors (2003)The season two finale of Spooks shocked the nation. While the episode begins with the CIA taking on a seemingly straightforward mission – to prevent a member of the Cabinet being assassinated – we soon discover that everything’s not as it seems. The formerly-presumed dead Herman Joyce (Tomas Arana) is still alive and masquerading as Herb Zeigler. Not only that, but the villain has masterminded an elaborate plan to make it seem as if Tom (Matthew Macfadyen) has assassinated the Chief of the Defence Staff. With everything working against Tom, the agent finds himself backed into a corner. And when Harry (Peter Firth) loses faith, Tom decides to shoot Harry with his shotgun. Does Harry die? Will Tom ever be found innocent? The questions were many.3537 Dragon Ball Z – Next time on Dragon Ball ZThere’s really no definitive Dragon Ball Z cliffhanger, as almost every single episode in the series finishes with one. From Vegeta staring menacingly at the camera to the villainous Cell launching a deadline attack on Goku, the series leaves you anywhere and everywhere. When that voice-over comes in with “Next time on Dragon Ball Z”, you can guarantee any child watching will be hooked and instantly wanting to watch the next episode.Pushing Up Daisies was unceremoniously brought to an end after just two seasons, with showrunner Bryan Fuller having to quickly conclude the whimsical series with very little notice. The epilogue was added late into the writing process and sees the narrator offer some closure to each characters’ story. Yet, with Ned (Lee Pace) and Chuck (Anna Friel) standing on her aunts’ doorstep, waiting to finally reveal that she’s alive, fans could see that there were originally supposed to be many more seasons to come – and they still want them desperately.Following a war of words with Jim Moriarty (Andrew Scott) on the roof of a building (in which Moriarty shoots himself in the head), Sherlock (Benedict Cumberbatch) decides to seemingly commit suicide by jumping off the building. However, not all is at it seems, as Sherlock is seen alive before the episode end. Fans of the series – plus Martin Freeman’s Watson – were left questioning what exactly happened to Sherlock, with all being revealed in the following special.Karma for killing Gale comes for Walter White in season five. The meth maker believes his days of cooking are long over. Having lunch with his family, everything seems perfect. And then everything goes wrong. So, so wrong. Hank (Dean Norris) goes to use the toilet and picks up a copy of Walt Whitman\u0027s Leaves of Grass – a gift from Gale to Walter White. “To my other favorited WW. It\u0027s an honour working with you. Fondly, GB.” And with that, as Hank realises Walt’s true identity, the end of Heisenberg’s empire begins.The debate over whether certain final scenes of television shows are actually good will rage on and on. The Sopranos remains front and centre of the conversation. It\u0027s a seemingly banal occasion – a restaurant dinner scene. We watch on as Tony sits there, observing other customers. Carmela arrives, then AJ and Meadow, who the last we see, is parking her car outside. A bell rings, Tony looks up and the screen cuts to black. It’s an ending that’s inspired essays offering varied interpretations but ultimately, it remains a beautifully-executed few minutes of television – and a cliffhanger that’ll never have a resolution.337 EastEnders – The Kat and Zoe revelation (2001)“You can’t tell me what to do ‘cause you ain’t my muvva”  “YES I AM!” - not the work of Shakespeare, granted, but surely one of the biggest moments in soap history. The nation’s jaws collectively dropped as they learned that Kat Slater (Jessie Wallace) wasn’t Zoe’s sister at all, but her mum.  437 Game of Thrones – The Rains of Castamere (2013)Game of Thrones knew George RR Martin was willing to kill off leading characters, but nothing prepared non-book readers for The Red Wedding. Robb Stark (Richard Madden), Talisa Stark (Oona Chaplin) and Catelyn Stark (Michelle Fairley) are attending the wedding of Roslin Frey (Alexandra Dowling) and Edmure Tully (Tobias Menzies) when things go terribly, terribly wrong for the Starks. The Freys turn on them, killing Robb, Talisa and their unborn child. Then, as the blood spills everywhere, Catelyn’s throat is slit. Cut to black. Devastating.The cliffhanger that kickstarted the end of season cliffhanger trend. Larry Hagman’s oil baron JR Ewing had made plenty of enemies in Dallas. By the end of season three, one of them took justice into their own hands, shooting JR in the back twice. However, rather than reveal the culprit, the team behind Dallas left the case unsolved. And over the next eight months – the time between seasons – the whole world was asking “Who shot JR?” Unsurprisingly, considering the hysteria around the mystery, 350 million people tuned in to watch the revelatory episode “Who Done It”.Showrunner Matt Groening had long wanted to do an episode where Mr Burns was shot, and the culprit was not revealed until the next episode. Taking inspiration from Dallas, the animation concluded Part One with the nuclear power plant owner being shot by an unknown assailant. Then, after a Summer of waiting, fans were finally treated to the answer. The two-part episode has gone down as a classic and is often heralded as the series’ best.737 Doctor Who – The Parting of the Ways (2005)Choosing one standout Doctor Who cliffhanger is almost impossible – especially when you consider that all 37 (and counting) seasons have frequently used the plot device. While the introduction of John Hurt’s Doctor certainly ranks among them, one of best came at the end of the rebooted first series. Having absorbed a bunch of vortexes, the Doctor is struggling and on the verge of regenerating. Turning to Rose (Billie Piper), Christopher Eccleston’s incarnation of the iconic character utters the timeless lines: “Before I go, I just want to tell you, you were fantastic. Absolutely fantastic. And you know what – so was I.” Queue shoddy CGI and the introduction of the soon-to-be nation’s favourite Doctor, David Tennant. “So, where was I? That’s it – Barcelona.”Gale (David Costabile) is one of the nicest characters on Breaking Bad. He is not interested in wealth or fame, but in science. However, niceties and a good cup of coffee are not enough to stop him getting in Walter White’s (Bryan Cranston) way. When the choice between their lives has to be made, Walter chooses his own and sends Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul) to do the dirty work. Season three ends with Jesse killing Gale – an incident that eventually brings down the drug kingpin Gus Fring.937 The West Wing – “What Kind of Day Has it Been” (2000)The West Wing’s biggest cliffhanger came in the season one finale. The episode works its way back from the beginning as we see a Secret Service Agent sense danger from a nearby window at a town hall meeting with the president in attendance. When the episode catches up, gunfire rings out and each member of his senior staff is thrown to the floor. Cut to black as we hear an agent ask over the radio: “Who’s been hit?”It wasn’t until the third season finale of Smallville that Superman fans’ patience was rewarded as viewers saw Clark (Tom Welling) appear naked in the middle of a Kryptonian symbol burned into the field of his family’s farm. “You shall be reborn,” Jor-El can be heard saying to Clark Kent, but he wasn’t the alone one the ending marked a radical turning point for the series.Twin Peaks’ season two finale – the mystery drama’s last episode for 27 years – may have featured the most chilling cliffhanger, but the biggest gasp of the series came at the end of season one as the seemingly untouchable Dale Cooper (Kyle MacLachlan) responds to a knock on his hotel room door, only to be gunned down by an unseen assailant.1237 Buffy the Vampire Slayer – The Gift (2001)The 100th episode of Buffy ended with one of the show’s most shocking moments (and no, we’re not talking about the musical episode). Season five concluded with the eponymous ass-kicker sacrificing herself to save the world by jumping into a demonic portal. The episode ends with a slow zoom onto Buffy’s tombstone, which reads: “Beloved sister. Devoted friend. She saved the world. A lot.“It\u0027s easy to forget that True Blood began life as an acclaimed Emmy-nominated drama, and it was a cliffhanger such as this that made it so: Sookie Stackhouse (Anna Paquin) falls asleep with the friendly neighbour dog Dean for company. Upon waking up, Dean is gone and in his place is local barman Sam Merlotte ( Sam Trammell). Turns out he\u0027s a shapeshifter.1437 The Walking Dead – Last Day on Earth (2016)After eight episodes of build-up, the comic book’s deadliest villain, Negan, reared his head in a scene fans were dreading. With the majority of the main cast lined up at his mercy, Negan – in retaliation for the death of one of his gang – decides which one to kill by using “Eeny Meeny Mino Moe”. After selecting his victim, the camera switches POV and Negan bludgeons the unseen character to death leaving fans with a six-month wait before finding out who had met their maker.Lost co-creator Damon Lindelof\u0027s HBO drama was set in a world that saw two per cent of the world’s population disappear into thin air during a tragic event known as the Sudden Departure. Season two presented an intriguing mystery: the disappearance of three teenage girls from a Texan town that nobody had vanished from. It was the season\u0027s penultimate episode that cleared up this plot line as Matt Garvey (Chris Zylka) breaks into a heavily-guarded trailer – only to be met with the three teenage girls staring back at him. What’s more is they’re dressed all in white, a callback to the disbanded cult from the first season.In episode 11, the writers had introduced a hatch buried underground and, week in week out, the fans waited patiently for any detail about the mysterious structure the writers were willing to give them. The end of episode 19 saw a desperate John Locke (Terry O’Quinn) banging on the door, just as desperate to get inside as the viewers were... only for a light to come on from within. This ending remains an unforgettable moment for those who watched it at the time of broadcast.1737 Lost – “Two for the Road” (2006)“I’m sorry.” “For what?” BANG. On paper, not so effective but on screen, it equated to one of Lost’s most gasp-inducing cliffhangers. Viewers watched behind their eyes as Michael (Harold Perrineau), desperate to save his son from the mysterious Others, shoots Ana-Lucia (Michelle Rodriguez) and, in a cruel twist, Libby (Cynthia Watros), who has accidentally stumbled upon the whole thing while looking for some blankets.1837 Lost - \u0027Through the Looking Glass – Part 2Whether you love or hate Lost, there’s no denying that the season three finale deployed one of the most breathtaking rug pulls in television history as writers Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse revealed a shake-up long in the running: flashbacks featuring a suicidal Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) were, in fact, flashforwards to the future. The Oceanic Flight 815 plane crash survivor made it off the island he’d been so desperate to get off for three whole seasons, but was, disturbingly, desperate to get back. The ending set the benchmark for all future finale and was so huge it made newspaper headlines.1937 Line of Duty – Series four premiere (2018)The fourth series of Line of Duty didn’t hold back on the shocks. In fact, its first episode featured a cliffhanger ending to rival the best of them. With DCI Roz Huntley (Thandie Newton) dead on his floor, her murderer – Forensic Coordinator Tim Ifield (Jason Watkins) – sets about dispatching her body, but as his chainsaw nears her face, Roz’s eyes suddenly open.After season one, Heroes became pretty dreadful television. But this cliffhanger looms in the memory for being so left-field it warrants applaud: having captured serial killer Sylar, Angela Petrelli – parent to superheroes Nathan and Peter – tells him she can provide him with the love and guidance he needs. Angry, Sylar tells her she’s not his mother to which Angela drops the bombshell: “But I am dear, I am.” A head-scratching mid-season reveal that had fans chomping at the bit for the next episode.After spending an entire season watching the blossoming romance between medical intern Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo) and Dr Derek Shephard (Patrick Dempsey), the world of viewers was rocked upon discovering the shock revelation that Derek was married all along.Channel 4 sitcom Green Wing took the term “cliffhanger” quite literally for each finale of its two series. While it became a tad gimmicky the second time around, the first remained a genuinely surprising way for a comedy series to end: having discovered that the colleague he’d just slept with was his mother, drug-addled anaesthetist Guy Secretan (Stephen Mangan) steals an ambulance, drives it to the country and loses control. After crashing, the episode ends with Guy and several other characters dangling – you guessed it – off a cliff.A particularly nail-biting fourth season was shaping up to end well: after weeks of playing cat-and-mouse with the Trinity Killer (John Lithgow on Emmy-winning form), Dexter finally put an end to his murderous ways and returned home ready to pack up and join his wife Rita on their vacation. Only Rita’s still at home... dead in the bathtub. Trinity killed her before Dexter got to him. A heartbreaking end to a standout season.When things are going supremely well towards the end of a season finale, you know something big is about to go down. Battlestar Galactica proved no different. After destroying the Cylon Basestar – a warship belonging to the enemy – crew member Boomer, who viewers had learnt was a Cylon in the mini-series that aired the year before, fires a round into the chest of Commander Adama (Edward James Olmos), the show’s main character.Having been warned for two seasons that Z’ha’dum means death, fans expected big things from an episode called “Z’ha’dum”. They weren’t wrong. It ended with the show’s lead character jumping to his death. The episode was so big the episodes leading up to it teased “Z minus 14 days” and “Z minus 7 days.”24 was filled to the brim with huge cliffhangers, but this one – arriving at the 16 episode mark – stands out for sparking what would be the show’s best run of episodes. President Charles Logan (Gregory Itzin) is revealed to be the mastermind behind the shocking assassinations of David Palmer and Michelle Dessler, which kickstarted the season. And thus the show’s most memorable villain was born.2737 Friends – The One with Ross’s Wedding (1998)While Ross (David Schwimmer) and Rachel’s (Jennifer Aniston) “will they, won’t they” courtship arguably went on far too long, there was one moment during the season four finale that left fans with their jaws on the floor. Just after Rachel had accepted Ross was happy with fiancé Emily (Helen Baxendale), everything goes catastrophically wrong. Instead of saying Emily’s name during the wedding vows, Ross says the iconic line: “Take thee Rachel”. After the wedding, as the season finished, everyone was left wondering whether the pair would finally rekindle their romance for good.“I’m in a boxcar, buried inside a quarry, and there are bodies everywhere,” says Mulder to Scully during the season two finale. And just as Mulder solves the riddle of how those people died, the roof of the boxcar slams shut, trapping him inside. Worse still, the Smoking Man then arrives with a unit of soldiers. When they open the boxcar, Mulder’s somehow nowhere to be seen and they decide to blow the freight to smithereens. Did Mulder survive? Did he get away?2937 Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life – Fall (2016)“It certainly wasn\u0027t the ending I expected,” Rory Gilmore actor Alexis Bledel said of the finale. “Fitting but frustrating”, was how Vanity Fair referred to the episode. The Gilmore Girls sequel, A Year in the Life, concluded with a four-word exchange between Rory and her mother, Lorelai (Lauren Graham). “Mum”, the daughter says, sitting in a park’s bandstand. “Yeah”, she replies. “I’m pregnant,” Rory says. Queue hundreds of fans wanting more from the story, which had, ultimately, come full circle.3037 Star Trek: The Next Generation – Best of Both Worlds (1990)Another science fiction show filled to the brim with cliffhangers. Star Trek: The Next Generation had many, but few can measure up to Picard (Patrick Stewart) becoming a Borg. The season three finale sees the Enterprise’s crew having no choice but to turn on their former captain, with Riker (Jonathan Frakes) ordering Worf (Michael Dorn) to open fire on Picard’s Borg ship. Fans had to wait three months to discover whether Picard could be saved – and the fandom almost imploded in the meantime.Marissa Cooper (Mischa Barton) and Ryan Atwood (Benjamin McKenzie) would have done anything for each other. When Ryan’s brother Trey (Logan Marshall-Green) gets in the way, attacking Marissa, Ryan has no other course of action but to settle things “once and for all” between them. As the brawl ensues, Marissa somehow ends up shooting Trey. And as the bullet goes through him, Imogen Heap’s song “Hide and Seek” – AKA the “Mmmmh, what you say?” song – suddenly starts playing. It’s hard not to laugh. The pop song cuts through the scene, completely at odds with what’s happening on screen. No wonder, then, that Saturday Night Live famously parodied the scene in one of their most-beloved skits of all time.Jim (John Krasinski) and Pam (Jenna Fischer) were the ultimate “will they, won’t they” couple, their chemistry electrifying the early seasons of The Office. Things peaked for the first time during the season two finale. Following Casino Night at Dunder Mifflin, Jim finally takes Pam aside to reveal his true feelings, telling her: “I’m in love with you.” She is, at the time, engaged to Roy (David Denman), and decides to reply to Jim: “What are you doing?” While all hope for the pair seems lost, Jim finds Pam (calling her mother) before the episode’s end and kisses her.

The episode sees Sydney (Jennifer Garner) discover that Francie (Merrin Dungey) is not Francie at all, but a duplicate. The two then brawl, ending with Sydney shooting Francie and then collapsing due to exhaustion. We immediately jump to Sydney waking up in Hong Kong. After reuniting with her lover Michael Vaughn (Michael Vartan), Sydney realises things are amiss as Michael is wearing a wedding ring. Turns out, she has been missing for almost two years. Cut to black, and the world asking “What just happened?”3437 Spooks – Smoke and Mirrors (2003)The season two finale of Spooks shocked the nation. While the episode begins with the CIA taking on a seemingly straightforward mission – to prevent a member of the Cabinet being assassinated – we soon discover that everything’s not as it seems. The formerly-presumed dead Herman Joyce (Tomas Arana) is still alive and masquerading as Herb Zeigler. Not only that, but the villain has masterminded an elaborate plan to make it seem as if Tom (Matthew Macfadyen) has assassinated the Chief of the Defence Staff. With everything working against Tom, the agent finds himself backed into a corner. And when Harry (Peter Firth) loses faith, Tom decides to shoot Harry with his shotgun. Does Harry die? Will Tom ever be found innocent? The questions were many.3537 Dragon Ball Z – Next time on Dragon Ball ZThere’s really no definitive Dragon Ball Z cliffhanger, as almost every single episode in the series finishes with one. From Vegeta staring menacingly at the camera to the villainous Cell launching a deadline attack on Goku, the series leaves you anywhere and everywhere. When that voice-over comes in with “Next time on Dragon Ball Z”, you can guarantee any child watching will be hooked and instantly wanting to watch the next episode.Pushing Up Daisies was unceremoniously brought to an end after just two seasons, with showrunner Bryan Fuller having to quickly conclude the whimsical series with very little notice.

However, not all is at it seems, as Sherlock is seen alive before the episode end. Fans of the series – plus Martin Freeman’s Watson – were left questioning what exactly happened to Sherlock, with all being revealed in the following special.“It is quite hard,” she said. “I became hysterical throughout the whole process giggling the whole time, internally freaking out the whole time.\u0026nbspI don’t remember much, oh gosh.\u0026nbspI learned one hundred million lines so I blanked it out like a trauma.”Line of Duty concludes this Sunday at 9pm on BBC1Line of DutyThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And now the researchers have revealed early results from that study, published in a new paper in the\u0026nbspMonthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society.The rock hit the moon while it was going\u0026nbsp61,000 kilometres an hour, they said, and left a crater behind that will be 10 to 15 metres across. When it hit, it did so with the force of 1.5 tonnes of TNT,\u0026nbspthrowing out debris that was as hot as 5400 degrees Celsius, roughly the same as the surface of the Sun.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s most stunning pictures of space Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.An image from Nasa\u0027s Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) shows a 200,000 mile long solar filament ripping through the Sun\u0027s corona in September 2013230 Nasa Celebrates 50 Years of SpacewalkingFor 50 years, NASA has been suiting up for spacewalking.

They are often travelling at very fast speeds when they arrive, meaning the rocks vapourise instantly and leave a plume of debris that can be seen even from Earth.Lunar eclipse stuns skygazers –\u0026nbspif they were able to see itThat flash\u0026nbspwas the first ever to be filmed during a lunar eclipse, despite repeated attempts by scientists.Something inside of me told me that this time would be the time, said Madiedo, who was impressed when he observed the event, as it was brighter than most of the events regularly detected by the survey.By analysing the flash using a vast set of telescopes, the researchers were able to conclude that the rock had a\u0026nbspa mass of 45kg, measured 30 to 60 centimetres across, and hit the surface at 61,000 kilometres an hour.The team plan to keep watching for such impacts in the future, and learning more about how they happen. As well as yielding important scientific information, such study will be necessary to ensure the safety of the astronauts who are expected to head back to the lunar surface in years to come.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

its first self-service outlet with no checkouts, what does it mean for Britain’s retail sector which employs more than any other part of the economy?Click to followThe IndependentStarting this week, shoppers at Sainsbury’s in High Holborn simply scan their own items using an app and then walk outAt a small, central London branch of Sainsbury’s, one mainstay of the traditional supermarket is notable by its absence: checkouts.Starting this week, shoppers in the High Holborn\u0026nbspbranch will simply scan their own items using an app and then walk out.\u0026nbspThe supermarket giant plans to use the trial to develop the app which it says will make grocery shopping quicker and more convenient.\u0026nbspBut it highlights a deepening trend towards fewer tills and ultimately fewer staff.So what might a new till-less future mean for British supermarkets and, more specifically, for the 2.7 million people who work in the retail industry?There’s little doubt stripping out tills from supermarkets will mean fewer jobs in retail, a sector that employs more than any other in the UK, comfortably ahead of the next largest employer, construction, with 1.8 million.Sainsbury’s has said the\u0026nbspnew setup merely frees up staff to spend time on the shop floor helping out customers and stocking shelves.\u0026nbspBut it would defy business logic to think retailers will keep on all of the 200,000 cashiers estimated to work in the UK when the need for them disappears.Created with Sketch.Ageing Japan: Robots\u0027 role in future of elderly care Show all 15Created with

biggest costs and one which they need to cut if they are to face up to the looming challenge of online retailers, including the mighty Amazon.The Office for National Statistics (ONS) estimates that around two-thirds of cashier jobs are at high risk of being replaced by technology. That would mean around 135,000 jobs disappearing.The new store format is more evolution than revolution.\u0026nbspSainsbury’s\u0026nbsphas already trialled its self-service app in other convenience stores and rivals including Marks \u0026amp Spencer and the\u0026nbspCo-op have piloted\u0026nbsptheir own equivalents.\u0026nbspMeanwhile, thousands of supermarket jobs have already gone at all of the big players as they battle discount chains like Lidl and Aldi which employ fewer checkout staff.It won’t have escaped anyone’s notice that supermarkets increasingly rely on self-service checkouts. The self-scan app is the next step on\u0026nbspthat trend.Why shell out on expensive till technology when most shoppers now have a portable barcode scanner in their pocket in the form of their smartphone?So the trend towards automation is well established, but it still has a long way to go.Large parts of the supply chain that brings food (and other products) to our doors could also be automated within the next decade or so.With artificial intelligence, self-driving vehicles and robots, the technology to replace lorry drivers,\u0026nbspwarehouse workers and administrative staff is already here.\u0026nbspPerhaps half of jobs related to retail could be automated as that technology improves and costs comes down, according to some estimates.Created with Sketch.

Improving the efficiency of one of the most important parts of the economy should be welcomed and new jobs will be created as old ones disappear. But the impact of these changes depends hugely on how the process\u0026nbspis managed.\u0026nbspAutomation is frequently referred to as the “fourth industrial revolution”.The government must play a much more proactive role than in previous upheavals, actively forecasting the changes and proactively helping those affected into training and alternative employment rather than hiding behind the excuse that “market forces” will work their magic.It seems likely that they will, but that shop floor workers will still have a significant, if reduced, part to play.\u0026nbspUltimately it will come down to shoppers’ preferences. After all, supermarkets introduced (non-smartphone-based) self-scan apps in the\u0026nbsp1990s\u0026nbspbut the idea never really took off.Will we be willing to pay a little extra to go to a shop that has a few more staff that we can ask for assistance or will we go for the cheapest option?\u0026nbspThere’s almost certainly room for both. As many retailers well know, price is an important determinant of consumer behaviour but it is far from being the only one.\u0026nbspTherefore, there will be room for a no-frills, no-tills shopping experience\u0026nbspalongside more traditional offerings, perhaps with a relatively small number of highly knowledgeable retail assistants that online rivals can’t offer.Traditional retailers are increasingly switching on to the fact that our experiences\u0026nbspof shopping in a real-life store – the sights, sounds, textures and personal interactions – are their key advantage.So a future where we glide in solitary fashion through\u0026nbspthe aisles filling up our baskets without ever interacting with\u0026nbspanyone seems – thankfully – a little way off yet.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This information can help buyers make the right decision.”A Plusnet spokesperson said: “We’d like to apologise to our customers as we know this isn’t the service they’ve come to expect from us.“We worked with Ofcom to keep them informed and to ensure our customers received the best service through this difficult time.“This report refers to complaints during that time in October to December since then we’ve been working hard to get things back on track and the most recent complaints data shows that we are heading in the right direction.”TalkTalk said: “We’re pleased that Ofcom’s data again shows an improving trend for the number of complaints received about TalkTalk.

We are talking about nothing less than the irreversible destruction of the environment within our lifetimes.”During the debate on the motion\u0026nbspenvironment secretary Michael Gove, who met with climate activists at Westminster on Tuesday, also said the government recognises “the situation we face is an emergency”, but stopped short of meeting Labour’s demands to officially declare one.High Court approves third runway at Heathrow despite climate crisisClimate activists describe Gove meeting as ‘less s*** than expected’Fight climate change on ‘war footing’ like defeat of Nazis, May toldSadiq Khan meets Extinction Rebellion protesters and pledges actionFracking tsar quits government post and blames eco activists“It is a crisis,” he added. “It is a threat that all of us have to unite to meet.”Mr Gove continued: “Five of the warmest years that this planet has endured have happened since 2010. The consequences for all of us are visible.“While statistics can sometimes be abstract and the impact can seem distant, we can all know that as inidual citizens and as parents that the next generation will face the consequences if we do no take action now to deal with climate change.”The cabinet minister also insisted the legislation will be introduced by the government “shortly” to ensure the UK has the “highest standards of environmental protection” as he claimed it would mark a “step change in how this country tackles the twin challenges of climate change and broader ecological degradation”.The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

If it fails, it could be seen as evidence that he lacks the support he says he has. It might also encourage the authorities, which have already stripped him of parliamentary immunity and opened multiple investigations into him, to arrest him.In January Mr Guaido, the leader of\u0026nbspVenezuela‘s opposition-controlled National Assembly invoked the constitution to declare himself interim president, arguing that Mr\u0026nbspMaduro’s re-election in 2018 was illegitimate.The United States was among some 50 countries that recognise Mr Guaido as\u0026nbspVenezuela‘s president, and\u0026nbspimposed sanctions to try to dislodge Mr Maduro, but the president has so far clung to power.Donald Trump has yet to comment on the uprising, although the White House confirmed he was “monitoring the ongoing situation and secretary of state Mike Pompeo\u0026nbspsaid the US government “fully supports” Mr Guaido’s call for military backing.A former US\u0026nbspofficial said that while it was unclear of Mr Guaido’s efforts would trigger a broader military uprising, it appeared aimed at building momentum towards mass protests planned for Wednesday.Mr\u0026nbspGuaido has said the May Day demonstrations “the largest march in\u0026nbspVenezuela‘s history” and\u0026nbsppart of the “definitive phase” of his effort to take office in order to call fresh elections.Mr Maduro has accused Mr Guaido of being a\u0026nbspUS-backed puppet who seeks to oust him in a coup. The government has arrested Mr Guaido’s top aide, stripped him of his parliamentary immunity and opened multiple probes. It has also barred him from leaving the country, a ban Mr Guaido openly violated earlier this year.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Idealistic young voters are all ears.There is a solution to our looming energy crisis — cheap, clean shale gas. But feeble Energy Secretary Greg Clark threw it away, forcing fracking tsar Natascha Engel to quit yesterday in disgust.After nine dithering years in power, with no idea how to keep the lights on, this Government is damned now whichever way it jumps.Protesters claiming “The End Is Nigh” are swarming like angry wasps.Their claims may be simplistic and sometimes , but they have been nailed on Netflix by national treasure Sir David Attenborough and hammered home by Swedish schoolgirl Greta Thunberg.Jezza is using these crowd-pullers to turn dull carbon emissions into a glittering crusade — a national emergency no less.His Momentum Marxists are tutoring the Extinction Rebellion protesters who gridlocked London and turned -year-old Greta into a global warming superstar. The Tories have nothing to say.Gutless Clark abandoned fracking contractors who risked hundreds of million only to see Project Shale strangled at birth.Engel’s walk-out should surprise nobody. I received a frantic call from the ex-Labour MP weeks ago warning about “nonsense” rules which stop fracking at the slightest tremor.She told me: “This is a real threat to the industry and means buying more Russian gas.” Her argument doesn’t wash with Jezza’s anti-capitalist anarchists, Greta or Blue Planet’s Sir David, who between them now run UK energy policy.Arguments for shale have been drowned out by images of raging bushfires, tidal waves and an Apocalypse Now soundtrack.Saint David’s bell tolls, and it tolls for the Tories.Climate change is the issue of the day. They have thrown in the towel on this as on so much .Greta Thunberg is Sweden’s new dancing queen, upstaging gas-guzzling hypocrite Emma Thompson and treating Britain’s top ministers with withering sarcasm.They were doing NOTHING to reduce carbon emissions, she spat. In truth, Britain is leading Europe, at huge cost, in reducing carbon emissions while replacing fossil fuel with renewable energy. Wind and solar energy are replacing coal.It is also a fact, courtesy of the respected Intergovern- mental Panel On Climate Change, that global warming is not about to roast us all alive or drown us beneath stormy oceans.Polar bears are multiplying, not disappearing. Walruses are thriving, not throwing themselves off rocks.None of this washes with single-issue, black-and-white zealots who regard all inconvenient truth as the work of the Devil. I am no climate change denier. We are polluting the water we drink and the air we breathe.If I ruled the world, Russia, China, India and America would not turn oceans and rivers into chemical sewers.I would ban plastic dumping, save sea le from being choked or poisoned and halt deforestation and desert- ication. But I don’t rule the world, and nor does Saint David or Greta Thunberg — or the hundreds of, let’s say, well-intentioned young folk who think paralysing London is the next best thing.Britain deserves credit for cutting carbon emissions further and faster than most EU countries.Temperatures are rising, but not by Extinction Rebellion or Miss Thunberg’s worst-case projections.Evangelical followers want an end to air travel except when they go skiing.Everything must come by sea even though shipping is a highly polluting form of transport.We must grow our own food, putting farmers in poor countries out of a job and workers here on the dole.WARREN BUFFETT, the legendary Sage of Omaha, has amassed billions putting his money where his mouth is.He thinks Britain, with its rule of law and decent, hard-working citizens is the world’s best place to invest, regardless of Brexit.He’s not alone. Once Brexit is settled, a wall of money will be unleashed by firms at home and abroad who have been sitting on the fence for three years.There is only one fly in the ointment – the prospect of anti-Semitic, US-hating, terrorist-backing Jeremy Corbyn as our next PM.Jezza’s much brighter brother Piers deserves a final say on this sudden burst of mass hysteria and Greta worship.“Listening to an ignorant, brainwashed child is deranged,” he tweets. “I am an actual scientist of physics, meteorology, astrophysics and climate and say Greta Thunberg is wrong.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It could also hand Britain an economic boom, and reduce our dependence on energy imports from far-flung dictatorships.Cowardly Business Secretary Greg Clark is squandering this windfall by giving in to the green lobby. As Engel says — listen to the science, not just to those who shout the loudest.At least the Tories aren’t quite as bad as Jeremy Corbyn, who would ban fracking altogether and destroy hundreds of jobs in the process.It is time the Government ignored leftie posturing and turned on the shale gas taps.THE five thugs suspected of murdering Stephen Lawrence have repeatedly dodged justice. So it’s an outrage they’ve been allowed to run up nearly £million in legal aid — funded, of course, by the taxpayer.Gary Dobson and David Norris lied for  years before finally being convicted of murder, while the other three have always refused to explain their role in the racist attack on Stephen.Of course every suspect has the right to a defence, but it can’t be fair that such sums have been lavished on lawyers for these fundamentally dishonest men.Contrast this state-funded generosity with the treatment of Stephen’s grieving parents, who were denied legal aid when trying to get justice for their son.Coming hot on the heels of Shamima Begum’s legal aid windfall, this is fresh proof the system isn’t working. Legal aid is meant to ensure the right to a fair trial, not help killers avoid being held to account.LEEDS United boss Marcelo Bielsa has restored faith in modern football.His players were wrong to score against Aston Villa while their opponents had a man down injured, but he immediately put it right by gting Villa an equaliser.You could see on Bielsa’s face how much it hurt. The gesture was the final nail in the coffin for Leeds’ automatic promotion challenge — and an incredible example for footie-mad kids who need to know the importance of fair play.In an era where sport stars hit the headlines for all the wrong reasons, it’s heart-warming to see a team go about things the right way.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Once she was hooked in, the messages rapidly escalated to “Jason” telling her he loved her and that, surprise surprise, he was having some financial dficulties and needed help because a film payment had been delayed.He added, and I write this verbatim: “I really need you to do this for me honey I can’t trust anyone but you with my money honey.”At this point, did alarm bells ring that she was, in fact, ­conversing with the Hunny ­Monster  Nope, seems not.So, over a period of time, she sent “a substantial amount which would have made a dference to my le and my family”.I’m torn between sympathy and utter disbelief that someone could be so naive.Online fraud is now an epidemic and plenty have lost money in scams so sophisticated that even the most tech-savvy would struggle to spot them.It’s a world away from the ­early-day scams of someone in Nigeria claiming to have a ­fortune locked away in an account they can only accessyou can just send £squillion right now.But what of “Jason Statham” and his like or, worse, the ones who frequent dating sites in the hope of carrying out their sting in person Barely a week goes by when we don’t read a story of someone who thought they had met the partner of their dreams . . . only to discover, several thousand pounds and a whole lot of heartbreak later, that they weren’t who they claimed to be.It goes without saying that loss or loneliness can sometimes make us throw caution to the wind in our search for love.But common sense must always be preserved.FORMER principal ballet dancer Dame Gillian Lynne has left £.million in her will.A robust fortune garnered from her role as choreographer for smash-hit musicals such as Cats and Phantom Of The Opera.Gillian’s path to success is a salutary lesson for anyone currently despairing that their child is struggling at school.When Gillian was young, her mother was concerned about her lack of concentration, and therefore progress, in lessons.So she took her daughter to see a child behavioural specialist who, after a few routine questions, switched on the radio and told Gillian that he and her mother were going to step outside for a while.Once in the corridor, they peeped through the window and watched as Gillian started moving to the music.“There’s nothing wrong with your daughter,” he concluded. “She’s a dancer. Take her to dance school.”Sadly, around  years on, the State still fails to understand that creativity is as important as literacy in giving kids the best chance of a happy, successful adulthood.When you have a spare  minutes, watch Sir Ken Robinson’s TED talk asking: “Do schools kill creativity ”They can, and plenty do.

Its author is not your standard liberal conscience, ­cloistered in Whitehall or a university sociology department.  Baroness Helen Newlove knows only too well what it is like to be a victim of crime.Twelve years ago she was an ordinary mum living in a suburb of Warrington, Cheshire, when her husband left their home to confront a group of drunken youths who were vandalising his car. He never ed.He was kicked and beaten so savagely that he later died in hospital.What was especially galling for his we and three daughters was that the three youths responsible —  who were each jailed for le — had been the ­subject of numerous complaints.One of those jailed for Garry’s murder had already been on an assault charge but had been released on bail just a few hours earlier to resume his le ­terrorising local residents.Neither police, prosecutors nor the courts seemed to appreciate just how far out of control the youths had become.They failed to put together numerous complaints of antisocial behaviour to see the overall picture. As a result, the problem was allowed to escalate to its murderous conclusion.Sadly, to judge by Baroness Newlove’s report, too little has changed in the years since her first husband’s ­murder. Still, she says, police are treating complaints about anti- social behaviour as isolated incidents, each dismissed as “low-level crime”.A vandalised car is treated as a problem to be sorted out with an insurance claim.  Youths riding motorbikes round a children’s playground might be challenged by police on one ­occasion but it is never followed up.  Dope-smoking seems effectively to have been legalised, the police ­having all but given up even speaking to those involved. At the same time, incidents of antisocial behaviour are  rising sharply.Last year,  per cent of people responding to the British Crime Survey — an annual poll of more than , randomly-selected Britons — reported witnessing antisocial behaviour, up from . per cent the year before.This wasn’t how it was supposed to be.In  the Government introduced what it called a “community trigger” — which was supposed to give residents the right to demand greater actionthree or more separate reports on antisocial behaviour were received within a six-month period.Residents can demand a “case review”, at which the authorities must explain what action they intend to take.Yet in half of local authority areas, says Newlove, the community trigger process was not used during  .Newlove also has a gripe with the police  service — the non-emergency number introduced in .  It was ­supposed to encourage us to report non-le-threatening incidents for which we might be reluctant to call .But, as I found from my own experience, it seems to be used as a means of fobbing us off.When I came across someone stealing from a pile of wood by the roadside I rang the number —  but it took ages to have the call answered and even when it was, nothing  happened, even though I had taken down the registration plate of the thieves’  vehicle.To cap the insult, while  calls are free it costs p to call .Of course, police can’t be expected to deal with and solve every single crime. I know that officer numbers have fallen and that in some areas they are struggling with an epidemic of kne murders, which obviously needs to take priority.Butyou give people the impression that you are no longer even bothering to try to police “low-level” crime, you are just inviting the problem to escalate.It isn’t just the police, however, who are responsible for the lack of action on antisocial behaviour. Local authorities have filled their town centres with enforcement officers, who merrily hand out £ fines for the smallest misdemeanours, such as dropping fag ends.Yet the private firms trusted with ­dealing with litter louts — and who are disgracefully often employed on contracts which incentivise them to hand out as many fines as  possible — are not  interested in policing housing estates.They are only interested in what they find profitable — dishing out fines to soft targets in shopping centres.Serious antisocial behaviour of the sort which preceded Garry Newlove’s murder falls between two stools — it is considered too much bother for enforcement officers but not serious enough for police investigation.But as Baroness Newlove knows only too well, turning a blind eye to repeated antisocial behaviour makes the lives of residents a misery and can end up ­having fatal consequences.The Government has been quick to respond to proposals from the usual bleeding-heart liberals who seem to run the criminal justice system — recently agreeing, for example, to look into ­abolishing prison sentences of less than six months.Ministers must take note of what the outgoing Victims’ Commissioner is saying on the lax approach to antisocial ­behaviour and put the interests of the victims, not criminals, first. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We will give it our best shot.Onasanya was kicked out of the Labour Party too - but has insisted shes innocent and refused to quit.Shes the first politician to be kicked out by Parliament under the new recall rules, and the seat will be vacant until the by-election takes place.If she had been jailed for  months then she could have been automatically booted out as an MP.Onasanya was found guilty of perverting the course of justice after she lied about who was driving her car when it was caught speeding in , shortly after she was elected to Parliament.She launched an appeal against her three-month sentence but it failed.Her brother Festus was jailed for  months for her involvement in the incident.Labours Chair Ian Lavery said this evening: Labour campaigned hard for a victory in this recall petition.The people of Peterborough clearly agree that Fiona Onasanya is not fit to be their MP and we’re delighted they will now have the chance to vote for a Labour MP in our excellent candidate, Lisa Forbes.And Tory candidate for the seat, Paul Bristow said this evening: The people of Peterborough deserve a better MP who will vote in Parliament to deliver Brexit.I’m delighted this result gives local people the chance to make their voices heard and vote for a better MP – and it will be a choice between Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour candidate and me.Ukip will battle for the seat too, leader Gerard Batten confirmed.A petition startsan MP has been convicted of an offence , has been barred for the House of Commons for  days, or is convicted for anything to do with expenses.The petition cant open until all the appeals have been exhausted.It is open for six weeks andat least  per cent of the constituency sign it, the MP will lose their seat and a by-election will be called.The booted MP can still stand, however.This is the first time in history an MP has been booted out of their seat.Last year a petition to try and get rid of of the DUPs Ian Paisley failed to get enough support.Next week a petition to unseat Tory MP Chris Davies, who was convicted of fiddling his expenses, will open in the Brecon  Radnorshire seat."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/NINTCHDBPICT000486769610.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"venezuela coup maduro surrounded by scorpions bottle john bolton","story":"Trump’s national security aide John Bolton says Maduro is surrounded by scorpions in a bottle and its only a matter of time before he’s toppled.Opposition leader Juan Guaid’s has today renewed his attempt to spur a military uprising against Moscow-backed Maduro whose hard left regime has turned South Americas richest country into its poorest.Speaking to reporters outside the White House, Bolton said: “Yesterday even though Maduro didn’t leave the country as he was planning to do because of Russian advice.“The fact is key figures like the defence minister, the chief judge of the supreme court and the head of the presidential guard have been outed as people dealing with the opposition.“And some day the documents they were prepared to sign with the opposition will become public.“Soyou are Nicolas Maduro can you look at your defence minister any more and trust him “I don’t think so. I think Maduro is now surrounded by scorpions in a bottle and it’s only a matter of time.The Cold War era phrase scorpions in a bottle refers to a mutual destruction scenario whereone stings, all end up stung.Bolton used the analogy on Maduros position because it would only take one of his nervous ministers to back-stab him for the whole besieged regime to fall.The veteran National Security Adviser also said US military forces are “ready to go” into the South American nation at a moment’s notice to support the uprising. Speaking earlier on Hugh Hewitt’s radio show, Bolton said: “We’re on the balls of our feet ready to go.”Secretary of State Mike Pompeo also confirmed today that “military action is possible”.The bid to oust the socialist president comes as Venezuela goes into meltdown. Its once prosperous people are angry because while their country has the largest oil reserves in the world, it suffers from chronic food and medicine shortages plus crippling power blackouts. Meanwhile hyper-inflation has rendered their currency and people’s savings worthless.All this has sparked months of demonstrations — but yesterday’s call for an uprising and large scale demonstrations is the most dramatic development so far and suggests a full scale civil war may be imminent. But Maduro is still clinging on to power with backing from his powerful ally, Russian President Vladimir Putin.A second day of protests against the social regime is underway today.State security forces are using tear gas to disperse protesters opposed to President Nicol’s Maduro.They have gathered at a posh El Paraiso neighbourhood in western Caracas where the socialist government elite live, demanding Maduro steps down and a general election is called.  Meanwhile paranoid Maduro and a “dirty dozen” of his top lieutenants are holed-up in a luxurious palace complex.The tyrant has taken refuge in Fort Tiuna surrounded by thousands of CUBAN troops as he no longer trusts his own army with his le.Maduro went into hiding after violence — which saw defecting soldiers stage pitched battles with Maduros military — was sparked by opposition leader Juan Guaidos calls to oust him.Amid the mounting mayhem, armoured cars were filmed driving at full speed into the crowds of people.Horrying video showed demonstrators lying on the ground with their heads and legs bloodied after being mowed down by troops fighting under the orders of Maduro.But the chaos was far removed from the tranquillity of the leaders luxury enclave in Caracas with its bowling alley, swimming pools, lakes and restaurants.Maduro and his henchmen are living in fabulous estates which would not look out of place in the hills of Hollywood.In one area of the complex, next to a military parade ground, a giant iron gate leads into an officers’ club with a bowling alley, floodlit baseball stadium and enormous two-level swimming pool.One visitor to one of the hillside mansions in Fort Tiuna described passing seven checkpoints, the last of which was manned by Cubans in red shirts who supervise Maduro’s security.Confirmation of Maduros five star bolthole was revealed by Donald Trumps National Security Adviser John Bolton.The bloody upheaval in Venezuela saw:In an interview he said: Basically, where they are is a place called Fort Tiuna, which is the Cuban headquarters in Venezuela.Why were they there  Because I think they couldn’t trust most of the Venezuelan forces to actually protect them.The Cubans, they could count on. That tells you what the real political situation in Venezuela is for the regime.Its estimated there are up to , Cuban troops now based in Venzuela tasked with keeping the Maduro alive and his regime in power.Its been reported Venezuelan troops are ready to turn on paranoid Maduro after he cut their monthly pay to just  and infiltrated their ranks with spies.Earlier it was claimed the panicking president was actually ready to flee to Cuba amid yesterdays uprising - and more violent demonstrations are planned today.Pompeo said the besieged tyrant was talked out of boarding a waiting jet at the last minute as an insurrection swept the capital Caracas.Speaking to CNN, Pompeo claimed Maduro was prepared to leave the country on Tuesday as key military and political figures began turning on him in the face of the popular revolt - dubbed Operation Freedom.But Maduro - deemed an illegitimate leader by opponents and many western countries - was talked out of fleeing by Russian backers in the Kremlin, he claimed.Mr Pompeo said: They had an airplane on the tarmac. He was ready to leave this morning, as we understand it.Russians indicated he should stay. He was headed for Havana.The violence - which saw thousands including defecting soldiers take to the streets and mount pitch battles against the loyal military - was sparked after calls by opposition leader Juan Guaido.Amid the mayhem, armoured cars were filmed driving at full speed into the crowd.Horrying video showed demonstrators lying on the ground with their heads and legs bloodied after being mowed down by troops loyal to - and fighting under the orders of - the president.The injured protesters were rushed away on a motorbike as the armoured trucks sped away dodging fireballs thrown by the demonstrators.On Tuesday morning, Guaido told his anti-government supporters to mount a rebellion to overthrow Maduro - who was swept back into power in January following controversial elections deemed illegitimate by many countries.Guaido was joined by Venezuelas most-prominent opposition activist Leopoldo Lopez in a three-minute video to announce the coup yesterday morning.Lopez was apparently released from house arrest by soldiers who defected to the growing anti-government cause and were now answering to Guaido.In the video, Lopez declared: I want to tell the Venezuelan people: This is the moment to take to the streets and accompany these patriotic soldiers.And Guaido said of his defecting military supporters: The armed forces have taken the right decision.With the support of the Venezuelan people and the backing of our constitution they are on the right side of history.The calls kicked off a day of bloody clashes as thousands took to the streets just blocks away from president Maduros presidential palace.The violent street battles that erupted in parts of Caracas were the most serious challenge yet to Maduros rule.While the rebellion seemed to have garnered only limited military support Guaido sought to keep the momentum going at the end of the day by calling for people to take to the streets again today.Yesterday, Guaido and Lopez coordinated actions in the capital from a highway overpass - while troops loyal to Maduro fired tear gas from inside the adjacent air base.A crowd that quickly swelled to a few thousand scurried for cover, reappearing later with Guaido at a plaza a few blocks from the skirmishes.A smaller group of masked youths stayed behind on the highway, lobbing rocks and Molotov cocktails toward the air base and setting a government bus on fire.The head of a medical centre near the site of the street battles said doctors were treating  people, about half of them with injuries suffered from rubber bullets.Venezuelan human rights group Provea said a -year-old man was shot and killed during an anti-government protest in the city of La Victoria.As Maduros forces repelled the action, Lopez and his family sought refuge in the Chilean ambassadors residence in Caracas before moving to the Spanish embassy.Maduro tried to project an image of strength, saying he had spoken to several regional military commanders who reaffirmed their loyalty.He wrote on Twitter: Nerves of steel!But the head of Venezuelas secret police penned a letter breaking ranks with the embattled leader.Manuel Ricardo Cristopher Figuera, the head of Venezuelas feared SEBIN intelligence agency, said it was now time to rebuilt the country.He added: The hour has arrived for us to look for other ways of doing politics.To build the homeland our children and grandchildren deserve.Governments from around the world expressed support for Guaido while repeating calls to avoid violence.US National Security Adviser John Bolton said the Trump administration had received assurances from three key Maduro officials that the president would be removed peacefully.Mr Bolton declined to discuss possible military actions - but said that all options are on the table as President Trump monitors developments minute by minute.President Trump had tweeted: I am monitoring the situation in Venezuela very closely.The United States stands with the People of Venezuela and their Freedom!The uprising has been fuelled by popular resentment at political corruption in the country still wracked with poverty despite it having the worlds largest oil reserves.When oil prices crashed in , the Venezuelan government had not used the prosperous years to build up reserves to fall back on.Large areas of the collapsing country have been left in the dark for days at a time by power outages.More than three million Venezuelans have fled in recent years.Maduro has strongly resisted calls for an early vote or that he leave power early before his six-year second term ends in , sparking huge anti-government demonstrations.Venezuelas socialist party boss, Diosdado Cabello, called on government supporters to amass at the presidential palace to defend Maduro from what he called a small uprising of traitorous military soldiers backed by the US.He desperately tried to downplay the signicance of the rebellion, saying Caracas is calm and that the air base near where the rebellious soldiers are gathered had not been touched.Cabello said the opposition had not been able to take over the air base, which he said remained absolutely under the operational control of the government.Meanwhile supporters of UK Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn — a vocal admirer of the embattled socialist regime — dubbed the uprising a Pincohet-style coup.Corbynista MP Chris Williamson said: It appears that the USA is ramping up its efforts to overthrow the legitimate and democratically elected President of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro, in a military coup.I stand in full solidarity with the people of Venezuela against this attack on their democracy and sovereignty.The middle ranks are earning around  to  a month, and that is impacting their own structure, said one expert on Venezuelas armed forces.The military has also struggled to maintain its equipment as it suffers from a shortage of spare parts.According to some analysts, intelligence agents are also embedded among the military forces to guard against anti-regime activity.Those troops  who support the opposition have been accused of betrayal and have been arrested, according to Human Rights Watch.Authorities have also arrested the family members of some suspects in an effort to determine their whereabouts, the rights group said.Guaido, the leader of Venezuelas opposition-controlled National Assembly, in January invoked the constitution to assume an interim presidency.He argued that Maduros re-election in  was illegitimate.Around  countries including the United States have recognised Guaido as Venezuelas interim president.Maduro calls Guaido a US-backed puppet who seeks to oust him in a coup.The government has arrested his top aide, stripped Guaido of his parliamentary immunity and barred him from leaving the countryLast week, Guaido said his congressional ally - opposition lawmaker Gilber Caro - had been detained, and that  members of his team had been summoned to appear before the Sebin intelligence agency."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/NINTCHDBPICT000332699416.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"mum swindled 70k from employer disneyworld","story":"Charlotte Clton, , doctored payments to suppliers and staff to fund the holiday, as well as meals out and her beautician course.She wept in the dock as she was handed a -month sentence, which the judge said she would serve at least six months of behind bars.The mum-of-three was accounts manager at County Gates Ltd, a small business based in Stockport that provides custom gates, railings, balconies and other metalwork.She was responsible for paying weekly wages to staff and suppliers, Minshull Street Crown Court heard.Before Christmas  a routine check of payments was carried out before the firm closed for the holidays.It was discovered that one payment went into Cltons account instead of to suppliers, according to Manchester Evening News.A company investigation then found that there were  fraudulent transactions disguised as payments to staff and suppliers.The sum of the money was £,, which the judge said the small firm could ill afford.She used some of the money to become qualied in doing non-surgical cosmetic procedures, which allowed her to set up shop as a self-employed beautician.Huw Edwards, defending, said she made the first few payments because of her dire financial position but became greedy when she got away with it.He urged the judge not to send her straight to prison.Mr Edwards said Clton, who has no previous convictions and three children, was genuinely remorseful for her actions and would be greatly affectedshe was jailed.Nicholas Clarke QC, told her that her -month sentence could not be suspended.He said: You indulged yourself at the expense of your employer, who trusted you explicitly.As accounts manager you were responsible for paying suppliers and staff wages.

It is important for us to be looking at the new models that are available.“It’s also all too often framed in terms of existing language which people take to mean certain things.“Often people will use the terms customs union and have in their mind dferent things about what that achieves.”Mrs May added: “We are sitting down and talking about what both sides both want to achieve in relation to customs.“Can we come to an agreement on that  I hope we will, but those discussions continue.”In a unique display of cross-party Brexit unity, Labour chiefs reinforced Mrs May’s words last night to suggest a customs compromise was in the offing.Mr Corbyn’s spokesman said: “There is more than one way to skin a cat in terms of the Government moving off its position on a customs union.“The name isn’t the most important thing.”During the  minute session with the MPs, the PM also clashed with both Remainer and Brexiteer critics.Arch Tory Eurosceptic Sir Bill Cash told her: “You’ve just said you want to leave the EU. Well why don’t you get on with it Prime Minister ”Mrs May hit back: “”I’ve been trying to get on with it.“I want us to leave the European Union.

He said: “This can act as a wake up call to ensure that children can be set on the right road, with healthier habits.”Other key predictors are diabetes and smoking during pregnancy, and whether the child’s parents are also fat.Prof Vrijkotte hopes the test will help medics identy children at higher risk so they can act early to prevent poor health.She said many parents would be shocked by the tool’s predictions.Speaking at the European Congress on Obesity in Glasgow, she added: “It is so dficult to lose weight so I think we should focus on prevention, so that children can become healthy adults.“I think we should start earlier than two years old... to use these kinds of tools in discussing with the parents, when the infant does not have a problem yet.”CHATTY parents are more likely to have brainier kids with larger vocabularies, a study found.Tots exposed to more adult words aged two to four performed better in thinking, numeracy and shape awareness tests.They also used a greater iety of words themselves.Researchers fitted tiny sound recorders into the clothing of  pre-school children and monitored them at home for three days.Mums, dads and other carers also completed activities with the kids, such as drawing, copying and matching tasks.Analysis revealed children with the most talkative parents scored highest.Those who were encouraged to explore and express themselves were also less likely to be restless, aggressive and disobedient.Study leader Katrina d’Apice, from the University of York, said recording the children at home gave better results than previous lab-based tests.She added: “We found that the quantity of adult spoken words that children hear is positively associated with their cognitive ability.“However, further research is needed to explore the reasons behind this link.“It could be that greater exposure to language provides more learning opportunities for children.“But it could also be the case that more intelligent children evoke more words from adults in their environment.”Prof Sophie von Stumm, who also worked on the study, said: “This study is the largest naturalistic observation of early le home environments to date.“We found that the quantity of adult spoken words that children were exposed to ied greatly within families.“Some kids heard twice as many words on one day as they did on the next.”The findings are published in the journal Developmental Psychology.Possible interventions include diet changes or more exercise to reduce their obesity risk.Commenting on the study Dr Max Davie, Officer for Health Improvement at the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said: “Any model that accurately predicts an increased likelihood of developing obesity allows us to intervene and provide targeted weight management support and advice at an earlier stage.“We know that overweight children are more likely to become overweight adults with an increased risk of serious health problems, so being able to identy and help young children at risk would go some way towards protecting their health in the future.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But thereaposs a major event on May  that affects you more powerfully and directly than leaving the EU. They are the local elections - where millions of voters across England get to decide who oversees their parks, streets, libraries, leisure centres and more. More than , seats are up for grabs, half of them Conservative, which means Theresa Mayaposs party has a huge amount to lose. Tory peer and pollster Robert Hayward has claimed the party could lose  seats, around a fth of all those up for grabs. So when are the elections and what are the areas to look out for  Hereaposs everything you need to know, or you can see hour-by-hour results declaration times here.  The  local elections are being held on Thursday  May. Polls open at am and close at pm. Around half of councilsapos results are being counted overnight, with results expected from midnight. The other half will start being counted on Friday morning so results can be expected to pour in after lunch. Where are the  local elections being held   Council elections are being held in most of England outside London and Birmingham. Some  town, city, borough and county halls have seats up for grabs - ranging from a third of the council to every single seat. In total  unitary councils,  metropolitan boroughs and  non-metropolitan districts are taking part. There are also elections for six directly-elected mayors - in Bedford, Copeland, Leicester, Mansfield, Middlesbrough and North of Tyne. Elections are not taking place in Scotland or Wales, or big unitary authorities like Cornwall, Wiltshire, Northumbria, Durham and Shropshire, or parts of Cambridgeshire. When was the register to vote deadline   Voters had to register by midnight on Friday  April on the governmentaposs website. In addition, anyone wanting to vote by post had to register for a postal ballot by pm on Monday  April. Those wanting to vote by proxy - where you send someone to vote in your place - had to apply by pm on Wednesday  April. Registered voters have until pm on polling day to apply for an emergency proxy votethey are hit by unforeseen circumstances. How do I checkIaposm registered to vote   Every local authority holds the electoral register for their own area. There is no online electoral roll. To checkyou are registered to vote, you will need to contact your local electoral registration office. See the full list on the Your Vote Matters website. Who are the candidates in my area   You can find out which council, and which ward, you are in by visiting the Who Can I Vote For website and entering your postcode. It will then tell youthere are elections in your ward for local councillors. There should also be list of all the candidates standing for election in your area and what party they represent.  How many seats are up for grabs   , seats are up for grabs, according to research by Tory polling guru Lord Hayward. . Just over halfthe seats are Conservative, according to new analysis by Lord Hayward and polling firm ComRes. Likewise, more than half the councils up for grabsare Tory-controlled, according to the Local Government Information Unit. Labour is defending just , seats while Lib Dems hold , Independents hold  and  seats belong to smaller parties or community groups. Labour controls  councils, while seven are in Lib Dem hands and  are under no overall control. Five are new councils. Who will aposwinapos the local elections   The Tories will technically win - get the most seats - because they currently hold around half the ,-odd council seats up for grabs. Thataposs because this yearaposs elections are focused on more rural areas that are Tory strongholds. But that huge total means the Tories have the most to lose from low turnout and voters frustrated by Brexit . And matters could be made worse by the fact that the last elections of this kind were in  - a high point for the Tories when they unexpectedly won the general election on the same day. Tory peer and pollster Robert Hayward has predicted the Tories could lose  seats while the Lib Dems pick up  and Labour claw back .    Ashfield was Labour until a slew of defections last year to Independents and Tories. Will it tip back  Thanet was once UKIPaposs stronghold and aposIndependent and UKIPapos are the second-largest grouping. Tories hold the administration and should gainBrexitaposs going well. Or the vote could go to anti-establishment parties. Lib Dems are tipped to make gains in Bath and North East Somerset and Wokingham - home to hard Brexiteer Tory MPs Jacob Rees-Mogg and John Redwood. Labour need a small change to seize control of Trafford and Calderdale councils, among the handful of metropolitan areas Jeremy Corbynaposs party doesnapost control. But Tories are standing candidates in every seat in every metropolitan authority, so theyaposll put up a fight. Itaposs a tougher battle in neck-and-neck red-blue battlegrounds Carlisle and Brighton. Dudley has a minority Labour administration but only on a kne-edge, and a small change could tip it back to the Tories. Walsall and Stoke-on-Trent on a kne-edge the other way round, with only a small change needed for Labour to come out on top. Labour also only need a small boost in Derby to gain control from an unusual pairing of Tories, Lib Dems and UKIP, But Labour had big losses last year and itaposs one of  councils where UKIP are putting up a full slate of candidates. Labour only needs a little gain in Redcar and Cleveland to get overall control. And the Tories need just one extra seat to gain control in Scarborough and Teignbridge - or two in Thurrock. Any signs of an anti-Brexit effect could come in Stockport, a minority Labour council with a big Lib Dem contingent. And Tories appear worried about Theresa Mayaposs image in Cheshire East and Wirral, where you can find some standing under a aposlocal Conservativesapos ticket. Maidstone is a Lib Dem-Tory battleground, with the yellows in power but the blues needing four gains to seize control. So is Winchester, where the Lib Dems are just one seat behind the Tories, and North Norfolk and Portsmouth. Some councils are narrowly held so could be thrown into no overall control with just a slight change. They include Cannock Chase , Three Rivers and South Somersetand Mole Valley, Tandridge, Pendle and Woking . And the Tories could lose overall control in Hertfordshire or Peterboroughtheyaposre having a bad night. Meanwhile some rock-solid councils will be worth watching. Tories are defending  of  seats in Amber Valley, so this will be target practice for rivals. The Greens are hopeful in Stratford-upon-Avon where theyaposre putting up a full slate of candidates. Leeds has  dferent political groups standing - the most of any area. But not everyone has to fight for survival.  seats are unopposed or guaranteed in Fenland. What will the results mean for the main parties   The huge number of Tory seats means the elections will be target practice on Tories, polling guru Lord Hayward said. The party is widely expected to lose ground no matter what happens, but how much ground will be a test of Theresa Mayaposs leadership. Labour could be expected to gain seats, because the last election for these seats was on general election day in , but not necessarily. The picture may be more complicated. Turnout is set to drop “dramatically” since the seats were last fought in , and that could hit both main parties and establishment groups hard. Despite soaring membership under Jeremy Corbyn , Labour is contesting just % of all seats. This is a rise from % in  and % in , but well below the % contested by Tories. A Labour source said it was because many of the elections are being held in rural Tory heartlands. The Lib Dems are contesting % of seats and are widely expected to have a bounce back, while the Greens are contesting % of all. UKIP are contesting just % of all seats, a dramatic drop from % in . The party can expect a wipeout. How will Brexit affect the elections   No one knows for sure - but experts think continued chaos and indecision would hit the Tories hard. Tory peer Lord Hayward warned Conservatives across England face losing their council seats in a “ Brexit penalty”thereaposs still no deal.  Lord Hayward said the drop in turnout, combined with “bored to the teeth” Brexit voters staying at home, is set to hit the Conservatives in their heartlandsthere is still no agreement in a month’s time.  The peer - who predicted the “shy Tories” surge that helped David Cameron win in  - said: “There is a Brexit benefit to the governmentthere is a deal.  “There is clearly a disadvantage, disbenefit, a deficit to the Tory party to not having a deal. “There’s no question about it. Andyou talk to most of the MPs they will say exactly the same thing.” Lord Haywardaposs analysis claimed Lib Dems and Greens were most likely to benefit from any Tory losses. What about boundary changes  A huge number of councils have changed their seat boundaries or re-formed into new councils entirely since . This makes like-for-like comparisons of results very dficult. According to the Press Association, councils with confirmed local boundary changes coming into effect for the May  polls are:Unitary authorities: Bath  North East Somerset, Cheshire West  Chester, Nottingham, Redcar  Cleveland, Rutland, South Gloucestershire, Torbay, West Berkshire, Windsor  Maidenhead Royal politan boroughs: none. Non-met authorities: Allerdale, Ashford, Babergh, Bolsover, Carlisle, Chichester, Copeland, Crawley, Dartford, Dover, East Cambridgeshire, East Devon, East Hampshire, Eastbourne, Forest of Dean, Harborough, Hertsmere, Horsham, King’s Lynn  West Norfolk, Lewes, Mid Suffolk, North East Derbyshire, North Norfolk, Norwich, Preston, Reigate  Banstead, Ribble Valley, Richmondshire, Rother, Runnymede, Scarborough, South Norfolk, South Somerset, Surrey Heath, Teignbridge, Tendring, Test Valley, Tewkesbury, Torridge, Warwick, Wealden.In addition, owing to local authority mergers, there are several new councils in the  local elections, replacing existing councils. The changes are as follows:Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole go into a single Bournemouth, Christchurch  Poole unitary authority East Dorset, North Dorset, Purbeck, West Dorset and Weymouth  Portland, as well as Dorset County Council, go into DorsetSuffolk Coastal and Waveney become East SuffolkForest Heath and St Edmundsbury become West SuffolkTaunton Deane and West Somerset become Somerset West  Taunton ."},{"url":null,"title":"tories could lose 800 council","story":"NewsLocal elections: Corbyn slams bickering Tories as they face -seat wipeoutJeremy Corbyn has accused the Theresa May government of bickering while the public suffers at the hands of austerityShareCommentsByPippa CrerarDaily Mirror Political Editor:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY NewsTheresa May is set to have yet another bad week \"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe Tories are on the brink of a local election meltdown tomorrow as voters go to the polls across the country.  Theresa May’s party could lose around  council seats inflicting further misery on the already battered Conservatives.  And the Prime Minister knows a disastrous day at the polls could hasten her departure.   Her only silver lining is that Nigel Farage’s Brexit party is not standing and UKIP is only putting up candidates in one in six seats. Speaking to the Mirror, Jeremy Corbyn accused ministers of “bickering and jostling” while the country suffered from austerity.  “People don’t feel like what’s going on in Westminster has any bearing on their lives,” he said.    Voters are desperately concerned by the social care crisis, rising crime, the plight of high streets and school cuts. But Mr Corbyn added: “In their front rooms TVs have blared about the mess Theresa May has made of the Brexit negotiations and plots to depose her.” The Labour leader is hoping to show the momentum is with his party by clocking up over  gains.  But he acknowledged that the elections could be “tough” for Labour too with Brexit “overshadowing” everything. And party insiders suggested polling expertsapos predictions the Tories could lose more than  seats were “way off”.  This set of elections were last fought on the day of the  general election, when turn-out was high and David Cameron won a small majority.    A lower turnout nearly always disproportionately hits the Labour vote. The elections are also predominantly in Leave-voting Tory heartlands that could punish Labour over its second referendum stance.   In a plea to voters, Mr Corbyn said: “Today people have the chance to elect caring and hardworking Labour councillors and mayors to show Theresa May and the Conservatives that after nine years of running down and cutting vital services, there is an alternative.” Some , seats are up for grabs in  councils in England. The Tories defend ,, Labour , and the Lib Dems . Labour hopes to seize Trafford, Redcar and Calderdale and leapfrog the Tories as Brighton’s biggest party.  A good night would result in the party winning Walsall, Stoke-on-Trent and Derby.

And they were published too late for , ex-Tax Credit claimants who have already been moved onto UC through a change in circumstances.  Mr Sharma claimed the Department for Work and Pensionsmade a mistake in withholding the report from the public for more than a year. He did not explain how the scandal happened, but told MPs on the Commons Work and Pensions Committee: Certainly it was a mistake. We should have published this earlier, I’m not going to defend that.” The Employment Minister added: In terms of that report, to be very up front with you, absolutely we collectively dropped the ball on that. “The intention was that should have been published earlier.  “We are making sure we have systems in place to make sure we don’t make that kind of mistake again.” It came as MPs quizzed chiefs on the movement of millions of existing benefit claimants onto Universal Credit. They have raised fears over the hundreds of thousands of existing claimants whoaposve already been shunted onto UC due to changing circumstances. However, aposmanaged migrationapos of other existing benefit claimants has been stalled until  due to concerns about the system.

Take a look inside... The entrance  hallway  As you step inside the Radford home the entrance and hallway is a rainbow of coats and bags, from pink spotty jackets to cartoon rucksacks. Thereaposs just stuff everywhere, admits mum Sue. A large Ikea storage unit hides items inside such as cardigans and blankets, while two prams - including a double one - are also stored there, with a car seat perched nearby. Proudly displayed on the wall are marathon certicates and medals. A shelf of shoes also sits in another corner full of trainers, boots, wellies and dolly shoes. Sue said: Anyone that comes in the house who hasnapost been before laughs at this shoe storage. As you can image we go through lots of them [shoes]. The dining room    The massive dining table takes centre stage and has  leather chairs and two high chairs around it. The walls are covered in floral wallpaper while curtains beautully drape around the bay windows as they pour in light. A wooden chest of drawers proudly features a globe and pictures of a family holiday to Australia, including some of the children holding koala bears. Sue said: I love this dining room, itaposs so good. The kitchen  Next up is the kitchen which Sue hates and is getting redecorated. It has a massive dark granite-top island in the middle, which has a large oven fitted inside and four bar stools surrounding it. The room also includes more than  cupboards and drawers and a huge fridge, which has  dferent boxes of cereal peering from on top. The lounge  A huge brown corner sofa takes up almost two walls in the living room and can fit more than  kids on plus Noel. There is also another sofa with enough room for three adults. Family photos adorn the walls, while toys are neatly stored away in a wooden chest. Poking out is a doll, cuddly Tigger toy as well as books. A plasma TV sits above the fireplace which has a iety of ornaments on the mantlepiece. Sue said: This is a big living room. I love how high up our ceilings are. Thataposs the thing with old houses, you get a lot of character. I do love this room. Bedrooms  There are  bedrooms in the house. On the first floor is one of the girlsapos bedrooms. It has four single beds all lined up in a row, decorated with crushed velvet grey headboards and pink floral bedding. Above each bed is a wooden letter of each of the girlsapos initials - K, A, E and T. The wallpaper is also pink and features the Efel Tower. The room used to have triple bunk beds before they were replaced with single beds. Next door, is a small blue room with a bunk bed, chest of drawers and TV where two of the younger boys, Josh and Max, sleep. Daughter Chloe then has her own large bedroom with a double bed.    Then there is Luke, Daniel and Jamesapos bedroom, which has been painted red. It features two double bunk beds, one which isnapost used, made by Noel. There is also a dedicated space for the boys to sit and play their video games. On the top floor is Sue and Noelaposs room which has a grey crushed velvet headboard, grey floral wallpaper and Next yellow floral bedding. A mirrored dressing table sits in front of the window, while a picture hangs above the bed which reads: aposFamily. noun. a group of people who live together and usually drive each other crazy but share so much love for one another.apos Opposite Sue and Noelaposs room is another of the boysapos rooms where Oscar and Casper sleep, decorated in blue, full of cuddly toys and featuring bunk beds, while in the corner are two cots for the babies. Next door, Hallie and Phoebe share a bedroom with two small white beds, rainbow bedding and pink walls decorated with the words aposTwinkle Twinkle Little Star, do you know how loved you are.apos In the basement is another bedroom used by Chloe as a makeup room, but is set to become one of the older boysapos rooms. Millie and Jackaposs separate bedrooms are also in the basement. Bathroom   toilet    There is one small toilet on the ground floor, while on the second floor is a bathroom designated for the kids. It has a shower but not a bath, so Sue admits there are often queues to use her large bathroom on the top floor. Basement  The basement is home to the laundry room with a huge Kg washing machine - which is most definitely needed in a house of more than . Itaposs massive, said Sue. There are also three bedrooms. And Noel keeps his treadmill in the corridor.  The family posted the tour on their YouTube channel and fans have been left amazed by it. One said: Canapost believe how spotless your house is. I have four children ... And I spend all day everyday constantly cleaning but they still trash the place.. You do an amazing job! X  Another added: I can’t believe how clean you keep things with so many little ones. You need a medal. Love all of your wallpaper. And a third commented: I am in awe of how capable you are, lovely house tour. The Radford children are: Chris, , Sophie, , Chloe, , Jack, , Daniel, , Luke, , Millie, , Katie, , James, , Ellie, , Aimee, , Josh, , Max, , Tillie, eight, Oscar, seven, Casper, six, Hallie, three, Phoebe, two, and Archie, one, and Bonnie, six months. Their son Alfie was stillborn in . Bonnie had the same due date as Alfie. After Archie was born, the couple said it was strange knowing he would be their last. And when the entire family appeared on ITVaposs This Morning in January , Sue said: Archie is definitely going to be the last Radford baby. But eldest daughter Sophie, who has three kids herself, shook her head and claimed she canapost see her mum stopping and she wasnapost wrong as months later Sue fell pregnant with Bonnie. Childhood sweethearts Sue and Noelaposs first child, Chris, was born when Sue was aged just .  Sue and Noel were both given up for adoption after they were born, and they decided to keep Chris and raise him as teenage parents. They got married and had their second child, Sophie, when Sue was . Noel even had a vasectomy, later reversed, after baby number nine. The pair face a monumental task each day just to feed, clothe and ferry about their huge brood. They spend an estimated £, a year of their own money bringing up their children - including birthdays with a reported budget of £ per child and Christmas at £ to £ per child.

Mother-of-three Charlotte Clton doctored payments to suppliers and staff to funnel tens of thousands of pounds into her own account.Clton wept in the dock as the judge told her she would serve at least six months behind bars for her deception, reports the Manchester Evening News.The -year-old worked as accounts manager at County Gates Ltd, a small business based at Chadkirk Industrial estate in Romiley, Stockport, that provides custom gates, railings, balconies and other metalwork. She was responsible for paying suppliers and the weekly staff wages, Minshull Street Crown Court heard. In December , a routine check of payments was carried out before the firm closed for Christmas. It was discovered that the bank account details on one payment were not that of the supplier, but Cltonaposs.    A more detailed examination revealed  fraudulent transactions disguised as wages payments or payments to suppliers. The total amount of money funnelled out of the company was said to be over £,, a sum a judge said companies of that size could aposill affordapos. Police said Clton used to the money to obtain qualications for non-surgical cosmetic procedures, which have enabled her to start up her own business as a self-employed beautician. She also spent the money on days out, eating out and even booked a family holiday to Disneyworld in the US, they added. Clton, of Dorking Close, Stockport, admitted one count of fraud at an earlier hearing. Huw Edwards, defending, said Clton made the first few payments due to her then aposdire financial positionapos, but because she aposgot away with itapos, she aposbecame greedyapos and carried on taking money, which she began to rely on. He said Clton, who has no previous convictions, was aposgenuinely remorsefulapos and urged the judge not to send her straight to prison. Mr Edwards said Clton has three children, who would be greatly affectedshe was jailed. I cannot think of a more worthy candidate to have her sentence suspended, her offending behaviour aside, he added. Clton wept in the dock as the judge, Recorder Nicholas Clarke QC, told her a -month sentence could not be suspended. She will serve half her sentence in prison and the rest on licence. He told her: You indulged yourself at the expense of your employer, who trusted you explicitly. As accounts manager you were responsible for paying suppliers and staff wages. This offence was sophisticated and involved the altering of records.    It was devious and quite deliberate. The total amount is signicant, over £,, which small family firms can ill-afford. There is a perception that fraud is a faceless crime but this case is a good example that most certainly is not. The company told police: Charlotte was a well-liked and trusted member of staff. We are shocked at the level of deception Charlotte has shown herself capable of. We had concerns because although we were busy and had plenty of customers, we were only making a minimal profit. Charlotte knew that we were cutting back. Despite this, she has continued to take from us. A Proceeds of Crime Acthearing will be held at a later date to begin to try and reclaim the money.

Frustrated Neal Robinson, , says the disgraceful construction has knocked £, off the value of his three bedroom house, which he is desperately trying to sht. The father of two has only had one offer, of just £,, for the property since it hit the market in January  - one month after building work began, despite it being valued at around £,. Neal, from Blackburn, Lancashire, claims he can touch his next door neighbouraposs wall by sticking his arm out of his upstairs window.    Blackburn with Darwen Council planning officials approved the extension and maintain there was no fault in the decision making process. The neighbours, a family of six, had the extension done before moving in a year ago according to Neal, who said he has no relationship with them. Iaposm disgusted by the way this has been handled, Neal, who works as a driver,said. The neighbouraposs extension is actually touching the guttering of our house. I can reach out and touch it. He added: Itaposs definitely knocked value off the property.    The estate agents valued the house at £, but weaposve only had one offer of £, since then. Ten people have also not turned up when viewings have been arranged and people have actually driven past our home, seen the extension, and decided not to view it.

Council planning manager Gavin Prescott said Nealaposs complaint has been investigated but insists there was no fault in the councilaposs decision making process. He said: Mr Robinsonaposs complaint has been fully and thoroughly investigated by both the council and the local government ombudsman. The councilaposs investigation concluded that full consideration had been given to the planning application and all relevant legislation. The ombudsman report also concluded that there was no fault in the councilaposs decision making process.  Neighbour, Rashida Begum, said she aposhas permissionapos for the disputed extension. She said: This is my property and the council has given me permission. Now he [Neal Robinson] harasses us, every time we go out he shouts. Every time we go out he shouts and tells us to give him the money for his house. Responding to the comments, Neal said: I work nights and they work during the day so I donapost even see them to shout at them. My real problem is that eventhe council did give permission, they could still look at what they have done and realise they have not been a good neighbour.

Now, with Meghan Markle due any day now, the spotlight has fallen once again on the rights and wrongs of expecting new royal mums to face the media hours after giving birth.Some think itaposs the price you pay for a le of immense, largely public-funded privilege. Others feel itaposs completely inhumane to ask a mum so immediately postpartum to do this. Remarkably, Kate not only did it with her firstborn, but then again with Charlotte and Louis.While a lot was obviously made of her changing style and the subtle nods to Diana , another change was playing out before our eyes. If you look back at Kateon the famous Lindo Wing steps with each of her babies, other dferences in how she handled the publicity become more apparent too. Prince George With so many new royal babies having made their debut - or about to - Georgeaposs birth on  July seems like a letime ago. Just a day after his birth, the new parents faced the press and the public outside the Lindo Wing.  The couple had delayed announcing the birth for four hours as theyaposd wanted to just enjoy spending some time with their tiny son first. When they eventually tottered outside, they were very generous with their time in the front of the cameras. Out of all of their children, William and Kate spent the longest posing for photos with George. As for why, there are a number of potential reasons.  It was a warm summer evening. George will be king one day, meaning public interest was particularly high. And, as elated, emotional, first-timers, they may have felt more inclined to show their baby off. Dressed in a polkadot Jenny Packham number, Kate did not try to hide her postpartum tummy. She paired the dress with some casual cork wedges and wore her hair in a natural, loose style.There were some signs of nerves from the new parents .Kate kept a firm hold on George, cradling him with both arms during their appearance. Only once did she release one hand to wave for photos.  Onlookers also witness a sweet and slightly fumbling handover as Kate passed George to William - and then there was the struggle fitting the car seat, which any parent can relate to. Kateaposs body language also gave away her nerves.Kateaposs feet are nearly overlapping as sheaposs standing on the stairs, body language expert Patti Wood told Good Housekeeping .This indicates that she feels the need to keep it all together. Both of them have relaxed hands but thereaposs slight gestures like the feet and forced smiles that indicate theyaposre a bit tense in this moment.    And who could blame them  Princess Charlotte Just under two years later and William and Kate are no longer first-time parents working through all the nerves and novelty of having a newborn. Kate was admitted to hospital in the early hours of the morning on May , and left later that evening.    The couple once again posed for photos but there was a marked dference from the photocall with George. Not only did Kate seem a lot more polished and preened , but she seemed a lot more confident too.    This tender moment between Will and Kate is something out of a movie, Wood said. Her fingers are locked inside his, which is her subtle way of saying aposthis moment is all about us.apos  This time, she and William spent less than two minutes in front of the camera. There was no answering questions of walkabout as there had been with George, and Kate kept hold of Charlotte the whole time - albeit cradling her with just one arm. They both appeared more poised and comfortable - and a little more businesslike.    William, this time, bossed fitting the car seat - and he even flashed a cheeky peace sign at the waiting paps. Prince Louis By the time baby Louis arrived, the Cambridges were seasoned pros at parenting - and their appearance outside the Lindo Wing proved it. There was a smaller crowd gathered outside this time - perhaps because the little prince falls slightly further down the royal ranking.  Kate was ready to face the cameras just seven hours after giving birth, and looked even more cofed, once again wearing Jenny Packham and in high heels. Perhaps mindful of the cool wind and their two eldest waiting for them at home, she and William spent just a minute and a half outside. One particularly touching shot of Kate and her new son shows them mirroring eachothersapos hand gestures.    Sure, Kate is fixing her hair from the wind but itaposs also an indicator of a strong rapport between the two, Susan Constantine, human behavioral expert and author tells Good Housekeeping. After some brief posing, the couple marched over to their car - completely confident and in sync.

The St Cuthbert’s Centre in west London provides a fine-dining experience for rough sleepers and other vulnerable members of the community five days a week.Those who attend are left amazed at the standard of the food with many left saying aposthereaposs nowhere  like itapos and apositaposs one of the best places Iaposve ever eatenapos. The open door service, known as Refettorio Felix and under the umbrella of non-profit organisation Food for Soul, is run by an amazing team of dedicated staff and volunteers. They cook up a delicious menu which changes every day and caters for inidual dietary requirements. Once a week, the centre has a aposguest chef takeoverapos - with famous names coming to prepare the food. A team from Heston Blumenthalaposs three Michelin star restaurant The Fat Duck are regulars who take control of the kitchen.  Brett Graham, head chef of the two Michelin star restaurant The Ledbury also pays a visit once every four weeks to cook up a special feast. Other well-known names who have offered their time and expertise are Executive Chef of the Ritz John Williams, who has cooked at the centre with his team, chefs from Harrods, and Jason Atherton who co-hosted the Sky Living TV series My Kitchen Rules in . And just like the regular staff at the centre, the top chefs have no idea what they will make until a van delivers fresh ingredients first thing in the morning, donated on a daily basis from a range of charities, supermarkets and restaurants working to minimise wasting surplus food. Most of the ingredients come from The Felix Project, which collects surplus food from food retailers and wholesalers and then redistributes it to charities and schools that provide food for those in need. But others are donated from Michelin star and popular restaurants, with everything on site made from scratch.  The Ledburyaposs Brett Graham said chefs are in a fortunate position to help charities.  He said: These people need a bit of nourishment, a lot of people are down on their luck. Itaposs about making a place where they feel normal. Some of the people who attend donapost have anyone to help them, no family or support. I want that place to feel special. I want people who use the service to feel like itaposs a treat and to feel like they are going to a restaurant. I enjoy cooking there and being part of it. I felt quite emotional on my first time there two years ago. Mr Graham helps out once a month but praised the work the regular staff do on a daily basis as aposfantasticapos saying: The chefs do a great job there every day and the volunteers are amazing.  About  per cent of people who turn up to St Cuthbertaposs are rough sleepers. The rest who attend are made up of the elderly, adults with learning dficulties and people with mental health conditions who live in the community but need help with caring for themselves. One woman who attends the centre, Rene, said: This is one of the best places I have eaten - I really appreciate their efforts. Russell, , has been homeless since , eating at dferent centres or waiting outside takeaways for them to throw out leftovers. He said nowhere  compares to the food at St Cuthbertaposs.  Thereaposs nothing I know of thataposs close to it for food, Russell said. Itaposs nice to be able to come and eat here and thereaposs far more people who would comethey knew about it than this place can even accomodate.  I heard about it through word of mouth - and this is what I found, he said. And he said the fine-dining experience was far from anywhere  heaposd been.    Russell said: I used to go to a day centre where everyone, like me, was homeless. But people would arrive there staggering drunk and it was the kind of place I didnapost want to be, so I had to stop. One of the problems I had to solve is, where do I get food  I regularly go to a carry out place when it closes at pm for leftovers. But anytime you find somewhere like that you have to be careful because before you know it thereaposll be others standing around doing the same. People say apossave for a rainy day,apos but what do you doevery day is a rainy day   Russell, who sleeps rough, said heaposd been in low paid jobs his whole le until he found himself out of employment and on the streets, with no savings.  I realised the alternative was ending my le or trying this le of being homeless, he said.  I donapost go to shelters because the people there are drug addicts or gamblers, they take peopleaposs things.  There are rules and regulations of shelters but I like my freedom.  If I can find a safe, quiet place to sleep, I would rather not get someone aposs permission. One man, who has been homeless for  years and did not want to be named, said: We get free food here and nice chefs who are kind. I can sit down calmly and have my food served to me. Here is a list of some of the guest chefs who have visited the charity: * Fat Duck group chefs Edward Cooke,Tom Allen, Jonny Glass and Daniel Svensson * Brett Graham, head chef of the two Michelin star restaurant The Ledbury * Executive Chef of the Ritz, John Williams * Greg Marchand, whose restaurant Frenchie Rue du Nil in Paris has been awarded a Michelin star * Sally Abé who is the head chef at Michelin-starred The Harwood Arms in London * Michelin-star chef Merlin Labron-Johnson * Chefs from Harrods * Jason Atherton who co-hosted the Sky Living TV series My Kitchen Rules in .   Jean Usher, , lives nearby and the centre enables her to have company and make great friends. We have lots of celebrity chefs here. We get a chef from the Ritz and Brett Graham from The Ledbury. Itaposs a great place to be, I wouldnapost want to be anywhere . Where would I go  I would be sitting in my one-bed flat feeling sorry for myself. Here we get a dferent menu every day. Fidela Orthega says she was once homeless for three weeks so she can relate to many people at the centre. A regular at St Cuthbertaposs for nine years, she said she is diabetic but her needs are catered for. Fidela, , said: This place is a home away from home. Steve, , added: I have got an awful lot of problems. I donapost like being on my own. Here I get my tea and a lovely lunch.  Examples of dishes Brett Graham has rustled up at the centre include veal T bones, pumpkin soup with ginger, chilli, turmeric, yoghurt and coriander and a iety of freshly made ice cream. This month chefs from The Fat Duck and Dinner by Heston attended the centre and the menu entailed a roasted vegetable salad with hummus and a pesto dressing to start, a choice of two curries for the main and a sticky toffee pudding to finish off. An example of a meal cooked by the centreaposs regular staff is a Morrocan-style white bean stew with pumkin and sesame with a pineapple carpaccio dessert.  The St Cuthbert’s Centre is a charity set up  years ago, but the Chief Executive said it was what you would expect a drop in centre to look like. It was around two years ago that the concept changed.

Chief Executive of St Cuthbertaposs Centre Ali Kingsley says: A lot of people helped by the centre are at crisis point, they are sleeping on the streets.  Itaposs all about giving them back their dignity, until they feel valued and that they are in a special place.

Jay Barham and orce  mum-of-two Linda fell in love in  - despite their  year age gap. While many of their friends and family told them it would never last, the happy couple, from Harwich, Essex, have now enjoyed  years together. Now Jay, , and Linda, , have said the secret to their happy le is to never go to bed on an argument and spend lots of time together. Jay said: Linda has been called a child snatcher, Iaposve been called a granny basher. Weaposve been called names in the street, and sometimes people think she is my mum. But we donapost care what people say.    Our marriage has lasted a lot longer than many others and we are still very much in love. Jay was a trainee youth worker when he first met council youth worker Linda. The couple say they were instantly attracted and bonded during driving lessons she gave him and through their love of music. Jay added: For eight weeks she was helping me learn how to drive. And then one time a track just started playing and we just kissed. For the le of me I canapost remember which one but it had to be Elton John because heaposs our favourite. It was completely unspoken up until that point, but as it happened it was like the sun just came out and it was a shock to both of us. It took Jay, who had had three previous serious girlfriends before Linda, three days to get over the shock of the kiss before asking her out on a date.    At the time Linda, from Hardcourt, Essex, was concerned for the feelings she felt for a boy the same age as her son Simon. She said: I just thought: aposthis is wrongapos, I felt awful. But I was orced for five years, my children were all grown up and knew that it just felt right Lindaaposs children Alan, , and Simon, , were shell shocked at the idea of the relationship but decided that as long as mum happy, nothing  matters. For Jayaposs parents, who were over a decade younger than his new girlfriend, they thought it was just a flash in the pan. Jay said: They were okay about it, they just thought: aposOh well it will lastit lasts.apos We were more worried about how my nan would react, but she was fantastic about it. In spite of doubtful friends that were certain the relationship would never workout, Jay and Linda got married eight months after meeting in July . Jay said: We got married at Colchester Registry office on Friday the th, and everyone told us that we shouldnapost as it was an unlucky day.    And then my suit didnapost fit, our car broke down, the ring didnapost fit and it got to the point that Iaposd just wear trackies and a top Linda said: We were happy to get a bus to the wedding, but our family stepped in and sorted us out Jay and Linda have worked together for most of their married lives at an Asda bakery and are now opening a small cafe together near their home in Hardcourt, Essex. Jayaposs mother Valerie, who died in , was  years younger than Linda but the two were still extremely close. He said: Linda and my mum gelled really well, there were absolutely no problems. My dad has a really good relationship with Linda, he actually describes her as aposthe daughter he never hadapos. We all go on holiday together and weaposre incredibly close. In fact, bemused onlookers always mistake that Jayaposs dad Stephen and Linda as his parents.    Of course people always think Iaposm their child and theyaposre my parents, but we just laugh at it. Itaposs understandable, all sorts of people ask all sorts of questions. But Iaposve never thought about age, I just think about the woman I love. Jay and Linda are un-bothered by peopleaposs comments about their extreme age gap. Jay said People have said horrible things to us in the street. The couple have even had their car windows smashed in what they assume to be an attack on their marriage. Jay said: We just got on with it, even now people frown on it. I always reply to people like that asking how many orces theyaposve had. Most marriages have all split up, regardless of their age. Linda thinks there is some hypocrisy in judging older woman more so than older men that have young partners.    If itaposs a man then youaposre doing well for yourself, but thenyou are a woman then youaposre disgusting and frowned upon. We just love each other, we havenapost done this for fame or for money, we just love and think about each other. When the couple first got married, Linda was still able to have children but Jay was never keen in being a parent. I never wanted to be a father, Iaposm one of those people that just keep the toys to myself. Iaposm just not the parent type, I much prefer having grandchildren as you get to give them back. Linda has seven grandchildren between the ages of four weeks and  years-old. Jay says that he never thinks about the likelihood Linda will die before him: I treat everyday as my last so thereaposs no point in worrying about numbers. Personally the biggest positive about being married to an older woman is the civility, being able to speak about feelings and not pushing them under.    We have adapted our lives [for Lindaaposs age] for example instead of walking ten miles weaposll go for a ride in the car. Although they have adapted their lives in some aspects, they certainly havenapost changed anything in the bedroom. Jay wasnapost a virgin when he starting Linda and he described himself as well experienced. You donapost just stop having sex when you reach . She still has that drive, I donapost know why people think you die sexually at . The secret to a happy marriage, according to Jay, is simply about loving one another. I think itaposs spending so much time together, we love each other and we do everything together. The only think we argue about is the cat, and even then we never go to bed without sorting everything out.

Andy Hamill, a father-of-two, was found dead by police at his home on February  after consuming a cocktail of drugs. The -year-old from Birkenhead had struggled with his mental health for a decade and sent worrying messages and pictures to friends in the days before he died. The Liverpool FC fan has been described by the mother of his children, Rebecca Waldron, as a doting dad who had an incredibly close bond with his two children.She told the Liverpool Echo: He was so funny and witty and liked and heaposd always go the extra mile to help me and the kids out. Nothing was ever a problem.He always sent videos of the kids and was always in contact, we very much did things together and decided everything together.    She added: We were very much a family unit. He was a doting dad, he just had such a close bond with the kids, Iaposve never seen a dad have a bond like that with kids to be honest. Andy had battled with mental health problems since  and had previously attempted to take his own le, the hearing at Liverpool Coroneraposs Court heard. In the days and hours before his death, Andy sent messages and pictures to Rebecca, his ex-partner Hannah Gale and other friends which first sparked concern for his wellbeing three days before he was found.  On the Friday before he died on the Monday, he sent Rebecca a message saying he couldnapost look after the children the next day because he was in a bad place and apologised to her for being a failure, telling her her she was a great mum. On the same night he also sent a message to Hannah asking hershe could look after his daughter the next day because he wouldnapost be around. Protecting his children from his mental health dficulties became a main focus for Andy. Rebecca said: He always knew when he was ill and heaposd say he couldnapost have the kids or send me a message, like on the Friday - and say to leave them until he could calm himself down. Officers from Merseyside Police rushed to his home twice on Friday, February  when other friends raised concern for his well-being after he sent messages and shared pictures suggesting he may harm himself. However, on both occasions Andy told officers and paramedics that he was fine and there was no cause for concern. His family and friends repeatedly tried to reach out to him over the weekend but were largely unable to contact him.    He sent a last message to a friend on Saturday afternoon where he said he didnapost want to be here. That was the last time anyone had any direct contact with Andy. On Monday evening, police ed to his flat and found Andy hugging a picture of his daughter, having taken his own le. Assistant Coroner Joseph Hart concluded he had died as a result of suicide caused by taking a cocktail of drugs. Mr Hart said: Andy was found in a rear bedroom, laying on the bed and as I understand it from investigations, he was hugging a pillow with a picture of his daughter in his arms. Paramedics pronounced him dead at the scene shortly before pm. In delivering his verdict Mr Hart said: The heart of this seems very clear, on the balance of probabilities Andy Hamill took a quantity and combination of drugs, the effect of which was to cause his death. I have little dficulty in reaching that conclusion. I have to then go on and consider what he intended by taking these drugs. He added that it was clear Andy did not want help and effectively stonewalled any attempts to help him. Mr Hart said: Perhaps the clearest indicator for me of his actual intent is that a running theme through his mental health dficulties was the protective father being there for his children. Whilst profoundly upsetting, perhaps the most important piece of evidence is that when he is found he was hugging a photograph of his daughter. He demonstrated, in my view, evidence of his profound love of his children.

Her mum Kate, the Duchess of Cambridge, took the snaps at Kensington Palace and the family’s Norfolk home of Anmer Hall last month. The princess, who is fourth in line to the throne, is pictured in a summer dress as she sits crossed legged on a patch of grass at the palace. Little Charlotte is wearing brother Prince George’s shoes he wore last June to the Maserati Royal Charity Polo Trophy at Beaufort Park in Gloucester when they were both pictured running carefree across the fields.    In the other two images, taken at the Cambridge’s home of Anmer Hall, the Queen’s great-granddaughter is pictured running and smiling as she holds a flower while in the other photograph she sits on a fence beaming at the camera. The Duchess is a keen and accomplished amateur photographer who has letime honorary membership of the Royal Photographic Society which recognised her “talent and enthusiasm”.  Meanwhile, Kate opened a mental health charity’s £ million centre on Wednesday which officials hope will be a “game changer” in supporting young people. She said she was “proud” to see the new home of the Anna Freud National Centre for Children and Families, which she supports as patron. The facility brings a range of experts under one roof in King’s Cross, London.  At the event, Kate revealed how daughter Charlotte loves playing with “pink slime”. She joined a small group of children attending their first lesson in the new Pears Family School classrooms and shared a laugh with Narriyah, seven, and her grandmother Rose - about the playful gunk. Rose, who declined to give her last name, said: “Kate was talking about her daughter and said when Charlotte plays with slime it’s pink but by the time she’s finished it is brown. “Narriyah is just the same, she’s obsessed with slime.” "},{"url":null,"title":"rude map britain reveals cheeky","story":"NewsThe Rude Map of Britain reveals cheeky locations from Bell End to Titty HoAndy and Magnus Tait have spent six years planning their , mile journey across the country, finding all of the UKs smuttiest addressesShareCommentsByStephen White:,  MAY NewsAndyand MagnusTait with one of their tamer locations \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailTwo brothers drove , miles on an epic ‘Rude Trip’ of Britain - to visit every place with a rude name. Andy and Magnus Tait spent six years planning their journey visiting streets, villages and towns with naughty titles. They stopped off at Cumwhinton, Fanny Street, Upperthong, Butthole Lane, Willey, Titty Ho and Sandyballs. They also visited Bellenden Gardens, Poundbottom, Cockermouth, Penistone, Butthole Bell End, The Knob, Lower Swell, Old Sodbury, Butcombe and Shaftesbury.    The pair also took in Shitterton, Lickfold, Fingringhoe, Slutshole Lane, Feltwell, Fanny Hands Lane, Scunthorpe, Rimswell and Wetwang. The lads spent four days on their road trip and took a selfie at  roads, town or village signs. Their remarkable tour of Britain saw them trek through at least  counties on each of the north, east, south and west coasts. The trip took six years for -year-old Andy, from Aberdeen, to meticulously map out.  He dreamed up the idea after he drove past a place called South Gash, in Fraserburgh, Aberdeenshire in  with his brother Magnus, , from Edinburgh. Andy says he couldn’t help but laugh at the signpost and ever since that day has researched the location of other amed places. He then went on to painstakingly map out a route, incorporating  stops in almost every corner of Britain. “I always enjoy going out of my way to have fun and to take things too far”, said audio engineer Andy.  “It was a lot of fun and we actually saw a lot of interesting places, he continued. “It was a bit of a slog towards the end and it was dark when we got to some places. But never at any point did we get bored. “I’d say it’s definitely an alternative was to see Britain. We just found it hilarious. We laughed our asses off at each place and that says a lot about us.” Andy and software developer Magnus set off on their journey from Bellenden Gardens, in Edinburgh, last Friday morning. They arrived back in the same street at .am yesterday morning.    He says it took him six years to convince his brother to join him on the trip after constant pestering ever since the pair passed South Gash together in . Andy chipped away at planning his route on a monthly basis over the six years, before finally packing up a few belongings, snacks for the road and wads of cash for fuel. He says the trip saw they visit some of the country’s prettiest places. The most picturesque places for him were Poundbottom and Sandyballs in the New Forest.  But his favourite out of the whole lot based on the hilarity of its name was Wilsford Cum Lake. Andy said: “I’ve had the idea for six years now. I insisted we stopped at South Gash to take a photo but Magnus didn’t fancy it. “That led to an obsession for places with funny names and six years later Magnus decided to make it up to me. “He saw the funny side of it eventually.”  Andy’s route is so well mapped out that it only took the pair between  and  minutes to drive between each stop. He said: “We went right down the west coast, along the south coast and up the east coast of England. “We have got a childish and immature sense of humour. “This is something we can tick off our bucket list.” "},{"url":null,"title":"slimming worlds greatest loser 2019","story":"NewsSlimming Worlds Greatest Loser who was size XXXXXXXL sheds incredible  STONEJon Vidler is now looking for love after he lost a vast amount of weight - and is planning on climbing Mount SnowdonShareCommentsByLaura Connor:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY NewsAt his heaviest Jon Vidler couldn’t stand for more than a few minutes without suffering from back pain \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAt st lb and size XXXXXXXL, Jon Vidler’s hopes of being a winner in love were slender – but not now after becoming Slimming World’s Greatest Loser .

I want to fill it with things I missed out on due to being so heavy. Meeting someone special would be amazing.    Previously he could barely stand for more than a few minutes and was prone to panic attacks caused by worrying about his weight. Those and other health scares drove him to join a pal at a Slimming World group in Chandler’s Ford, Hants. Jon saw his weight plummet after being inspired to eat healthily and take up walking. He now races and is training to climb Mount Snowdon next month.    “At my biggest I struggled with severe anxiety,” said Jon, a pharmaceutical firm’s senior quality officer. “At one point I was rushed to hospital by ambulance, with both I and the paramedics thinking I was having a heart attack. “Thankfully I wasn’t but I was at a low ebb and hid away.

The -year-old died in  while studying at the University of Bristol - where  students have taken their own le in the last three years. An English undergraduate, he had been told the university had chosen to dismiss him from his course following his lack of attendance at lectures and at an exam.But at an inquest into his death at Avon Coroneraposs Court his parents James and Janet Murray said they feel that the university failed their son.James, from London, told the inquest that  dferent members of staff were involved in email correspondence during Benaposs seven months at Bristol University. But he said not one face-to-face meeting was organised with Ben. The student then became confused and upset about the universityaposs decision to dismiss him from his course, it was said.  Benaposs father James told how he saw Ben for lunch the same day that his son died - just hours before Benaposs death. He said: He mentioned that Bristol Uni had written to him to say thathe didnapost engage they might remove him from the university. We discussed this, and I said thathe didnapost want to continue with university that was okay. But I told him to try and pass his exam so that he could have the summer to decide whether he wanted to leave on his own terms. After lunch I hugged him and told him I loved him, and he went back to his halls - or at least, that was what he told me. James added: I feel like that last lunch I walked into a perfect storm - not knowing that he had been kicked out already, and was being forced out his accommodation, his home, the following week. In a statement to the hearing, Benaposs parents said: As a family we believe time was a critical factor in Benaposs death. He spent far too long aposstruggling in the waterapos, so to speak. Much earlier intervention was needed and should have happened. Ben was not even referred to the university halls welfare officer, as he was not considered at risk. But in the workplace, you do not just send letters to sack people. There are proper, face-to-face procedures that should be followed. For a -year-old fresher to be kicked out of his first year course without a face-to-face meeting is unacceptable and extraordinary. If a -year-old says he is anxious, and is not attending lectures, you should immediately take action, and not just send him links. What further signs do you need that something is wrong  We believe Bristol Uni failed on a number of occasions with the lack of pastoral care given to Ben. Benaposs social media messages to his university friends had suggested he was suffering from depression and they urged him to speak to student services. He had twice told senior tutor Charles Gunter that he was not feeling well, and had been struggling to connect, an inquest heard.  But although Mr Gunter emailed Ben information on how to register with student services, no checks were made on whether Ben actually did so. The inquest heard that Ben was sent a letter dated February , informing him that he was being dismissed from his course due to lack of engagement. This followed senior tutor Charles holding a telephone meeting with Ben on December , during which Ben expressed he was struggling to settle in at uni and struggling to connect. Mr Gunter said: I told him it was quite natural to feel a little bit unsettled. I established that he hadnapost registered with the uni health services, and sent him information on that and how to register. I wanted to make sure that he was aware that there was support. After Ben missed an exam in January, Mr Gunter got back in touch with him and advised him to fill out an exam absence form, as Ben once again told him he had been unwell. Mr Gunter added: At the start of February the next teaching block started, and for the second term in a row Ben did not complete registration for that teaching block. I asked ious tutorshe was attending classes, and I received mix replies. Some said he had been to lectures, others said he had come to some of them. The situation became one that required attention. This was not just Ben missing one or two classes, or failing to hand in an assignment. He had failed to engage and had not passed  credits. At a faculty meeting at the start of February, the university Arts Faculty made the decision that Ben be dismissed from his course. However, despite Mr Gunter contacting the Humanities School education doctor, Lesel Dawson, to try and raise Benaposs attendance, the senior tutor said that the dismissal letter of February  was the last contact the English School had with Ben. He said: I had hoped that Benaposs issue was just an issue with settling in in the first term. I escalated Benaposs case to Dr Dawson because I felt I had already made contact and had done what I could. I find that sometimesa student no longer wants to engage with one member of staff, perhaps talking to a new member of staff can help. However, Dr Dawson proposed a meeting with Ben on March  - two days after Benaposs appeal period to remain at the university would have passed, the inquest heard. And, the very day before his death, Benaposs friend Stefan Lossev said Ben messaged him, concerned and confused about an email informing him he had to move out of his halls the following week. Ben wrote to Stefan: I feel like Iaposm leaving the Matrix or unplugging, to which Stefan replied: Donapost kill yourself, please. The inquest heard that Ben had been known to take recreational drugs - and it was believed to be this that had contributed to his poor attendance at university lectures. Ben had started at University of Bristol in September  - but Bristol was not his first choice of uni, the inquest heard. He had hoped to go to Edinburgh University with his long-term girlfriend - and his mother Janet said that the long distance relationship was quite hard for both of them. Benaposs mum said: Ben was in a transition year. He was in his first year, having come through clearing, and so was under academic pressure. He was also facing bereavement, having lost both his grandparents to cancer  months before his own death. They were very important in Benaposs le, and he would definitely have felt that loss. I suggested that he see a counsellor to talk about his feelings around that, but he didnapost want to. Ben was in good health and was not on any medication that I was aware of. When he ed to the university after his first-year Christmas holidays, he said he was going to eat more of a plant-based diet, and be more conscious about the food he ate. He didnapost mention that he was unhappy at Bristol or not attending lectures. The inquest continues.

Chloe Storer, , was taking a picture of her -month-old son Jake when she spotted the right side of his face appeared to be paralysed. The worried mum was concerned Jake had suffered some kind of stroke and showed medics the picture during a hospital appointment.Jake had been to ious hospital appointments since birth after he stopped growing at  weeks and had to be delivered over a month early.He was eventually diagnosed with micro duplication q. - a condition so rare that only  people are diagnosed worldwide.Jakeaposs disorder can cause facial paralysis and it could even leave him with learning dficulties , heart conditions and hearing loss.   The mum-of-one, said: It becomes more obvious when he smiles or eats, and initially he had problems with his eye. I hadnapost noticed his face appeared to be drooping on the one side until I was taking a photograph of him. Theyaposre not sure why his face is paralysed, and whether itaposs linked but because the condition is so rare, weaposre still learning about it. Initially I didnapost notice but it becomes more obvious when he smiles or when he cries. With hindsight, Jake was premature and he was five weeks early. Heaposd stopped growing at  weeks and there had been no explanation for that from the doctors. They made the decision to induce early, and they began testing on him straight away - theyaposd assumed heaposd had a stroke initially but there was more to it.    When they first told me his diagnosis, it sounded like a jumble of letters, and I felt very much out of my depth - after all only  people have it worldwide. As far as we know, Jakeaposs future is completely unknown - the doctors predict things like learning dficulties, heart conditions and hearing loss, Iaposm hopeful it wonapost affect him too much, but Iaposm still learning all the time. Right now, I notice that Jake stands out because heaposs very small and he has delayed milestones. He only started walking this week, and he couldnapost roll or sit up at the normal times. He sometimes struggles eating, and when he smiles, I notice his face, itaposs almost like it could be a facial nerve. Chloe has since decided to begin her own support group in the hope of finding other aposchromo cutiesapos after struggling to find any mum and baby groups she could join. She plans to find other parents and caters for those who have children with rare chromosomes disorders.    Chloe added: Jake initially couldnapost close his right eye and I donapost think he can feel much as he sticks his finger in his eye. The most help Iaposve had has been through the charity UNIQUE who can answer some of my questions, and provide information and leaflets. But I want Jake to find someone like him - most groups are five years and over, and I just wanted to find someone in my situation. It would be a leline - there would be someone to empathise rather than sympathise. Sometimes I struggle with it, and what the future may hold for Jake, but when I see him hit milestones that we didnapost expect, like when he started walking last week, it hits home. Jakeaposs condition is unknown but he keeps defying expectations. Heaposs happy, heaposs always smiling and heaposs so determined.

Barry Briggs, from Ohio, fell ill after a boating trip in Tampa, Florida and ended up with horric injuries.He raised awareness of his illness through Facebook , posting raw images of what the flesh-eating bacteria can do - leaving his foot and shin without any skin. Barry was rushed into Miami Valley Hospital in Dayton after ing home where he then spent  days undergoing extensive treatment for the terrying condition.He underwent skin grafts and was put on several dferent antibiotics, but eventually he was lucky that doctors were able to save his foot.    Barry was diagnosed with necrotizing fasciitis caused by group a Streptococcus bacteria which usually enters through a small wound. Necrotizing fasciitis is a rare infection and there are  to  cases in the U.S. annually, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. However, researchers told CNN that they also believe this is an underestimate due to cases being underreported. The news channel said Barryaposs story came just days after a Florida man was hospitalised at Tampa General Hospital, also for a flesh-eating bacterial infection he contracted while fishing in the Gulf of Mexico. Mike Walton said he was poked by a fishing hook  miles off the coast of Palm Harbor.  I had like little blisters starting to form on my hand and you could watch like sweat beads coming up on side of the hand, and then they just turned black, he said. Doctors told Mike he’s lucky to be alive, and lucky to have his arm. “When you look down and you can see your own tendons, back of your hand and your bone going up your arm,” Mike said, “that makes it real.” Walton is now recovering at home and will have to be treated with antibiotics for the next month.

This area of Argyll is the most fragile in the region. The people of Argyll, businesses and visitors deserve no less.Forget the squandering of £m on unreliable, mitigation measures trying to justy a flawed decision made many years ago to use the Old Military Road as a ersion which has failed on many occasions and now has a landslip between the two roads. Forget the expensive excavation of pits by the A rather use the cuttings into the hillside to form a two lane road protected with a flow over canopy with closed outer edges at the four problems gullies. If the contractors on the present scheme can work without any road closures then the flow over canopy option would not lead to closures as many officials and some politicians claim.This is a red herring postponing #a proper solution#. When this is option is completed it will save on the expense of manning the ersion route involving - personnel and - vehicles, replacing expensive nettings, delays whilst the farmer clears his animals and collect his fees. A scandalous waste of public money. Solve The Rest Landslides and stop wasting on mitigating measures.Like Brendan O#Hara I#m neither an engineer or geologist but both of us are blessed with plain common sense. If the Faroese can build a tunnel at £.m per kilometre surely a simple open sided m canopy would cost considerably less. In  at Dawlish .km of double tracked railway and .km of sturdy seawall was built at a cost of £m in eight weeks. Why have we in Argyll after nine years, four dferent Transport Ministers and £m spent and still have no guaranteed safe passage   on The Rest and Be Thankful Follow the Argyll Advertiser#s campaign #Invest in the Rest#. Transport Minister Michael Matheson, Transport Scotland and our Government must abandon their obsession with mitigation measures and fund a permanent solution. We demand no less.Sir,Calls for assurances that the Rest and Be Thankful section of the A will be improved to resist future landslides were made during a session of Transport, Infrastructure and Connectivity questions in the Scottish Parliament.I quizzed transport secretary Michael Matheson, about what was discussed at the last meeting of the A Taskforce in November , and asked what assurances the Cabinet Secretary could give to local residents and businesses who rely on the A being open at all times.The Rest and Be Thankful was closed off for nine days in October  following the largest landslide in a decade, forcing road users to either take a major ersion, or to use the Old Military Road during certain hours of the day.A number of petitions were created during the period of the incident, including one by myself, calling for a permanent solution to the Rest and Be Thankful.The transport secretary said that the meeting was #full and frank#, and that there would be a #review of the potential for additional landslide mitigation measures at the Rest and Be Thankful#, and that this would be discussed at the next A Taskforce meeting in March .There was also a commitment that Argyll and Bute would be #prioritised# in the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.I welcome the assurances by the transport secretary that there will be a review of any additional measures for the Rest and Be Thankful, and that Argyll and Bute will receive priority at the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.Donald Cameron, MSPReserve forcesSir,Last issue#sletter raising concerns about the UK government’s proposed use of the army’s reserve force in the event of a no-deal Brexit is timely.In case anyone out there still thinks a no-deal Brexit is a good idea it’s worth noting that the legal authorityof Reserve Forces Act  allowing the Secretary of State to take this step requires him to establish that it is necessary #for the alleviation of distress or the preservation of le or property in time of disaster or apprehended disaster#.Enough said.Frances Roberts, Ardrishaig"},{"url":null,"title":"strathlachlan cup attracts players from all over argyll","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe annual Strathlachlan Cup Open Pairs indoor bowling competition took place on Saturday February  at Strachur Memorial Hall.There was a good turnout of  pairs with members from Cairnbaan, Colintraive, Connel, Innellan, Inveraray, Kilmun as well as the host club  Strathlachlan.There were some close games in the qualying rounds and the lucky four pairs to reach the semi-finals were Tom Paton and Moira Robertson, Strathlachlan Myra Campbell and Duncan Lauder, Innellan Fulton Ronald, Connel, and Robert Scott, Cairnbaan, and John #Joe# Campbell and Ross Speirs Senior, Strathlachlan.The finalists were Strathlachlan#s John #Joe# Campbell and Ross Speirs v Fulton Ronald and Robert Scott, with the visiting team going into the last end one shot up.

Throughout the day, there was a steady stream of smallish spurs around  to cms to keep everyone occupied, but by far the best fish of the day fell to Andy Jamieson who hooked into a very creditable lb oz thorny.Overall it was a pretty decent day, with  fish comprising spurs, thornback ray, dogfish, whiting and pouting measured and ed.Jim Smith was the winner of the Christmas Shield.Scores: Jim Smith  Gary Sinclair  Robert MacBrayne  Nikki Thompson  Gordon Law  Steven MacBrayne  Andy Jamieson  and John Byrne .PICS:Andy Jamieson with a nice thornback ray. no_aFyneSeaAnglingChristmas in February. no_aFyneSeaAngling"},{"url":null,"title":"macnicol hat trick helps inveraray defeat oban celtic","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsOban Celtic took on premiership opposition, going down - against  Inveraray#s first team at Ganavan.Young Ruaraidh Graham gave Inveraray the lead with a shot from distance which took an awkward bounce on the way in.

A bruised and battered face caused alarm on first viewing which gave way to quite a lot of laughter and bold comment.But what a delightful party, laid on by our warden Sheena Stewart and ladies and saw we all had tea, coffee, and home baking, including shortbread and sconesand presents of wine and malt whiskey. What a lovely morning.To all who sent cards for my th, including the community council, the Wednesday Club, the Inveraray Highland Games , my warmest thanks. And many thanks to those who helped me up after my fall and in particular Stuart Campbell of Brambles who took me to the surgery, whose very kind people cleaned me up and sent me on my way to my party half an hour later.And a mention to Take the Floor too on Radio Scotland on Saturday night. Thank you Inveraray and District Accordion and Fiddle Club and Margaret Mather our secretary for this request.So I won#t forget my th in a hurry, but such kindness and friendliness cannot be forgotten ever.My thanks to you all,Niall Iain MacLean, InveraraySir,I read with great interest the letter in the March  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser from C Rees, Lochgilphead.In addition to all that was mentioned I wonderyour readers are acquainted with the McCrone Report which was written in the s As I’m sure your readers are aware this was when oil had just started flowing from the North Sea. Mr Gavin McCrone was, at that time, a civil servant instructed to write a report on the possible effects of North Sea Oil on the argument for Scotland’s devolution.This quote comes from a letter written, by Mr McCrone, in April : #The Paper was written over a year ago in the weeks immediately before the February  election. This will be particularly apparent on page  where, of course, the ministerial pronouncements referred to relate to the Conservative Government.#So he was instructed to write this report by a Conservative Government but was reporting to a Labour Government.This quote comes from the end of the letter: #When my paper was written it was classied “secret” and given only a most restricted circulation in the Scottish Office because of the extreme sensitivity of the subject.#The report discussed the possibility of Scottish Independence and came to the conclusion: #What is quite clear is that the balance of payments gain from North Sea oil would easily swamp the existing deficit whatever its size and transform Scotland into a country with a substantial and chronic surplus.#Now, this is a very tiny segment from a document that could have changed our history but that’s in the past and we must now look to the future.What is upsetting is thatthis wealth had been invested in an oil fund or more fairly distributed by the  British Government # either Conservative or Labour # there might not, now, be an upsurge in support for separation from Westminster.Wilma Watts, TarbertSir,With Theresa May’s Brexit deal yet again failing to get through the House of Commons and a delay to the date the UK is due to leave the EU, it is clear that we are simply lurching from crisis to crisis.One wonders what good an extension will actually do given the negotiating position of both the EU and the UK. The UK is deadlocked, in terms of its people, Parliament and Cabinet and the likelihood of any semblance of a deal that command the majority of the House of Commons is unlikely. This is especially true given the deep isions within the Tories, both Remainers and Leavers, as well as opposition from the DUP.Given this situation those like myself have long argued that a UK-wide referendum on the deal, a so-called ‘People’s Vote’, with the option to remain in the EU, is the only credible way to break this deadlock. For those who argue that this would damage our democratic process, I am not sure we can slump any lower than the situation we are currently in.As David Davis, the former Brexit Secretary and an ardent Leaver, pointed out before the EU referendum: #If a democracy cannot change its mind, it ceases to be a democracy.#There are few I know who voted for Brexit in the belief it would make them poorer, and it is up to the public to give its view on whether the deal, and more importantly its implications, are what it wants.For once I agree with Jacob Rees-Mogg who previously supported a vote on the renegotiated settlement. A statement he now curiously seems to have forgotten.The Scottish Parliament has led the way in backing a People’s Vote and now that we know the precise nature of the deal, it is up to the public to have its say.Alex Orr, Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"athletes tackle the crinan puffer","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowOver  pairs of running shoes were strapped on for this year#s Scottish Sea Farms Crinan Puffer on Sunday March .Athletes from as far as Dunoon, Campbeltown, Mid Argyll and beyond came to join the race # billed as one of Scotland#s friendliest and most inclusive running events.

However, Mr Cameron had failed to noty Scottish Borders Council planners about the change of use, who found out once concerned neighbours began to complain about noise disturbances by rowdy hen parties.In November , Mr Cameron received an enforcement notice from the council outlining its grievances, which included concerns over noise disturbances, a detrimental impact on residential amenity and a breach of planning protocol.Mr Cameron subsequently appealed to the Scottish Governmentrsquos department for planning and environmental appeals , saying that because the property has been used for this purpose for more than ten years the council could no longer object to the change of use.The appeal statement also outlines the steps Mr Cameron has made in order to mitigate the noise disturbances from his property.This includes removing two hot tubs from the rear of the building, and instead installing a new one in the spa, which has triple-glazing to minimise noise impact.Mr Cameron has also proposed to remove the barbeque facility from the rear decking of the property, in an effort to stop groups of guests congregating outside.Finally, Mr Cameron has proposed employing a night manager to monitor the property and sound levels between pm and am on Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays, and to give the four closest neighbours a direct line to the night manager to raise any issues immediately.Despite this, the DPEA has ruled against the West Linton businessman, and has been two months to cease using the property as a party mansion.Chirs Norman, a DPEA reporter appointed by Scottish Ministers, writes in his ruling: ldquoBefore  November  the availability of lsquoGreenloaningrsquo for holiday letting, and its limited use for  weeks, was ordinarily incidental to its main use as a house.ldquoSome two or three years after  November  it ceased to be the appellantrsquos main residence.ldquoFrom  lsquoGreenloaningrsquo was continually promoted and used as self-catering accommodation for short-stay lets.ldquoOn the balance of probability and on the basis of the evidence before me I find that the unauthorised change of use of the house occurred between  November  and  November .ldquoTherefore the council is not time-barred from taking enforcement action and the appellantrsquos appeal fails.ldquoI find that the house is accessed from an unsurfaced road in the north-east part of West Linton and is in an area characterised by large, in the main, detached houses set in substantial garden grounds in a semi-rural part of the village.ldquoIts location some  metres from the A  and the centre of the village means that residents in the area enjoy a very high standard of amenity.ldquoI have studied the representations on the case and note the alleged impact on residential amenity caused by the use of the property for short-stay letting.ldquoI further note that the appellant has taken steps to curtail the effects of the unauthorised use, and in particular noise and alleged anti-social behaviour.ldquoI am also mindful of the support given by persons staying at lsquoGreenloaningrsquo to businesses in the village.ldquoHowever, I conclude that the unauthorised use of lsquoGreenloaningrsquo has an unacceptable impact on the character of the established amenity in this generally quiet part of West Linton.ldquoExternal activity can arise after . hours and a signicant change into the quiet residential area has been introduced.ldquoThe two-month time period for the cessation of the use is reasonable, given the impact of the unauthorised development on the amenity of this part of West Linton."},{"url":null,"title":"explorers-great-mystery-comes-to-borders-stages","story":"A LIGHT-HEARTED romp featuring starvation, scurvy, cannibalism and some jolly tunes comes to the Borders next week.The new play by Peter Arnott for Mull Theatre, Unspotted Snow, is based on the tale of Sir John Franklinrsquos ill-fated expedition to discover the Northwest Passage.In , Franklin and  men sailed off to discover a route from the Atlantic to the Pacic via the north coast of Canada, but were never seen again.A bold and adventurous account of tragedy, mishap, folly, arrogance and madness, it also serves as a cautionary tale of true-blue British heroism ndash and some ruthless news management.After nine years, news of the expedition was at last brought to London by the remarkable Orcadian explorer and physician John Rae, who worked for the Hudsonrsquos Bay Company.The news he brought was both tragic and grizzly. Unfortunately for Rae, it was the wrong story ndash true, but wrong in that it was not the story that Victorian England wanted.Unspotted Snow is a play of two halves: the first set on the barren ice flows of the Arctic and the second in the equally inhospitable environment of Lady Jane Franklinrsquos drawing room.As playwright Arnott explained, unlike Franklin and the majority of th century British explorers, Rae was uninterested in conquest and the imposition of religious, commercial, or imperial norms on the wilderness.ldquoLike John Muir in Calornia, he anticipated a much more lsquomodernrsquo holistic approach to the natural world, not seeing people as being conquerors of empty space but as inhabitants of a planet shared with other forms of le, he said.The story of the expedition has fascinated the general public, scientists and explorers for over  years.From early findings of frozen corpses and a few artefacts to the very recent discoveries of the expeditionrsquos boats, the Erebusand the Terror , successive generations have been enthralled by the ambition and daring-do of the explorers and by their terrying, macabre fate.That fascination, and the split between two realities, is emphasised by the two-part nature of the play.ldquoIn the first half, a kind of horror-comedy, we have an encounter between three of the last survivors of Franklinrsquos expedition and some Inuit ladies to whom they utterly fail to explain themselves, explained Arnott.ldquoAnd then, in a curious echo of that, we have the inhospitable wilderness of Lady Franklinrsquos Drawing Room, where John Rae again finds himself telling a story that his audience simply cannot, or will not, understand.Unspotted Snow will be performed at the MacArts in Galashiels on Thursday, May  and

election riots, contracted Malaria and suffered a iety of broken bones having fallen down a storm drain.Dominic, who is , told the Border : ldquoWe really donrsquot have any idea of how others live on

a charity in Kenya, The Sunflower Community Orphans Support Project.The organization helps feed orphaned children, many of whom are affected by poverty and HIV AIDS, by using the proceeds of a cafeacute selling food to the public.Dominic fully embraced the lestyle of the local community, enduring the same daily struggles faced by the local population.ldquoI experienced what it was like to have electricity and water shortages and to fetch and carry drinking water.ldquoFor the two years I went without washing machines, showers, fridges, cookers, TV or a flushing toilet.His desire to experience the tough reality of le in these societies is perhaps unsurprising given his previous holiday destinations have included North Korea, Chernobyl and the annexed Crimean Peninsula.Despite the dficulties faced by the communities he assisted, Dominic was struck by the gratitude and positivity he encountered. He said: ldquoThe best part was seeing the smiles and laughs of the people I helped.ldquoThey were grateful and happy, and because I lived like the majority of the people in the slum they made feel a part of the community - I really did feel like it was home.This sense of community was demonstrated when a newly born child was named after him, an experience which left Dominic ldquospeechless and overwhelmed.The experiences of his spartan existence during his charitable travels, and the positivity of communities with so few of the things we take for granted, have shaped Dominicrsquos attitude to le since ing to the UK in March.He added: ldquoAfter selling most of my things to help fund this mission I now own very few items and the ones I do own I appreciate more.ldquoI appreciate things

Valley.Warrington-based WHP Telecoms plans on erecting a  metre-high G tower on Deephope Hill, just off the B between Eskdalemuir and Ettrick.The plans have largely been welcomed by local residents, who cite the current lack of mobile phone signal as a detriment to both the quality of le in the valley and the ability of businesses to thrive.However, they also attracted nine letters of objection, which cited concerns over the height of the mast, the impact on the landscape and the potential detrimental impact on property prices.One supporter, Ogilvie Jackson, of Selkirk, appeared before Scottish Borders Councilrsquos planning and building standards committee on Monday to urge councillors to support the plans.He told the committee: ldquoWe have been lobbying very hard to get mobile coverage in the valley.ldquoFor the last three years our neighbours at Ettrick village have enjoyed good coverage due to government funded masts that tower over the settlement.ldquoThe mast before you will give us near perfect G coverage for the Ettrick Valley.ldquoThe proposed site could not be better. In fact compared to some masts in the Borders itrsquos very discreet.ldquoMany motorists have been stranded and unable to secure help because of the lack of phone signal. This mast will make our valley a safer and more self-reliant place to live.ldquoI would say this to the objectors: itrsquos easy to object to a phone mast just because you donrsquot like phone masts. If that happened everywhere there would be no mobile coverage in the country.Councillors sitting on the planning and building standards committee were advised by planning officers that the benefits outweigh the impact of the mastBarry Fotheringham, the councilrsquos principal planning officer, told the committee: ldquoThe proposed mast and associated equipment form part of a national programme to deliver a new mast network and telecommunications coverage in hard to reach areas in Scotland that do not benefit from mobile telephone connectivity.ldquoThe proposed mast will be visible in the landscape but it is considered that the benefits of having a strong telecommunications signal in the Ettrick Valley outweigh the limited and localised landscape and visual impacts.ldquoThe proposed mast will be future-proofed so that it can accommodate other users and G networks. This will avoid the need for a proleration of other masts locally.ldquoThe proposed development complies with the principal policy requirements of the local development plan and is consistent with ensuring that an improved digital infrastructure is available, to ensure people and communities are better connected.While discussing the proposals, councillors were broadly in favour of granting planning permission.East Berwickshire councillor Helen Laing said: ldquoI have no problem with this application whatsoever. Itrsquos time the Ettrick Valley was brought into the st century.ldquoI absolutely think this is the right decision.Kelso and District councillor Simon Mountford also spoke in favour of the proposals: ldquoIrsquom delighted by this.

It was decided by those in high office that the gold-plated cockerel weather vane should be re-plated and that the Selkirk Town Clock should actually be removed for repair and cleaning. That clock and its illuminated front face were well maintained over many years by local jewellers and clock repairers and in more recent times has been well maintained by Ritchies in Edinburgh without recourse to actual removal from the building.This time the entire mechanismwas lowered by jib-crane and taken on a lorry down to England for a complete overhaul. That was fine and no-one noticed as the whole building was enveloped in scaffolding and plastic sheeting.However, when it didand was re-installed in its original place all was not what it seemed.In fact it has never kept time since it was put back in the Town Hall. Sometimes it simply doesnrsquot keep time, sometimes it doesnrsquot go at all and, even worse, it goes backwards!What happened to the role of Clerk of Works in all this turmoil and who signed off the work which was then proved to be faulty in the extreme with the steeple now leaking water where it had never leaked before and with huge double front doors that after ldquorestoration couldnrsquot be opened Is Selkirk actually taking a step back in time Are our Councillors backward Who knows, but come the Common Riding morning letrsquos hope Selkirk Silver Band big drummer John Nicol has a watch that keeps good time or neither the First Drum nor the Second Drum will ever take place!But in the middle of all this confusion I have recovered another great mystery, or is it mysteries What happened to the works of Selkirkrsquos mason-astronomer James Scott who was born in Midlem in  and died in November . Who was he and how did he acquire the title mason-astronomer  We have to rely on an interesting little booklet written by Bowmont Weddell, M.A., F.E.I.S and who was headmaster of Selkirk Public School in the s when he wrote and published the pare which was printed by Walter Thomson in High Street.James Scott was born at ldquoThe Burn in Midlem and followed his father and grand-father into the building trade as a stone-mason after school at Midlem.His hobby was the repairer of clocks and from that he became a builder of time-pieces and studied not just the time of day but also the universe and how it worked and related to time and movement.James was totally self-taught but among the books and manuscripts he read was a lecture paper by the City Astronomer of Edinburgh, William Peck. The stone-mason cum clock repairer got even more interested in the stars and planets and their movements to each other and became so knowledgeable that he could predict the phases of the moon and work out on a nightly basis where its place in the heavens would be.That saw him on a journey in which he designed and built, first of all, his ldquoGreat Clock which told the time accurately while at the same time represent the solar system and the relative movements of the stars and planets around the centre-piece, the sun. Included in this masterpiece are the signs of the Zodiac and through its  spaces this Great Clock tells the time, the placings of the planets and a pointer also displays the date and the year.He developed several clocks, long before the advent of digitisation and modern technology. Some of his works were famous and his Astronomical Clock formed a centre-piece of The Scottish Natural Exhibition in Edinburgh in .The ldquoGreat Clock and his elaborate but extremely accurate ldquoJupiter Clock which spelled out the movement of Jupiter and the rest of the planets in relation to the Sun and Earth, were kept locally and by the date that the Rector of Knowepark Public School, Mr Weddell, wrote his paper in  these valuable inventions were part of the fabric of Selkirk Town Hall, in custody of the people of Selkirk as a tribute and a memorial to a one-time stone mason and self-taught astronomer and clock maker, James Scott.The question is ldquowhere are they now They are obviously parts of Selkirkrsquos heritage and Selkirkrsquos past but also a glowing tribute to what can and should be done even today by people with the right attitude to their own environment.If a tin shed half way down The Green, built as a garage, can in any way be classed as Common Good Property and of any value to the burgh, then all efforts should be involved in finding out where these inventions of James Scott, the Selkirk Mason-Architect are now.These clocks are certainly worthy of the title Common Good property."},{"url":null,"title":"expect-cues-as-sporting-greats-set-for-book-festival","story":"SNOOKER legend Stephen Hendry canrsquot wait for this yearrsquos Borders Book Festival.The seven-time world champion leads a pack of sporting heroes appearing at the Melrose event next month.And he will be bringing the action from many World Championships to le as he discusses his book, Me and the Table.Hendry told us: ldquoI am really looking forward to come down to the Borders.ldquoIrsquove visited two or three times over the years to play snooker, but it has been so long since I was last there.ldquoThe book festival should be a really fun event.

There is a very strong feel that this is completely inappropriate.ldquoThe proposal is to build two big two-storey houses, which would simply not fit into the village environment.Set in  acres, the Archerfield Estate is home to two golf courses and a iety of accommodation styles to rent, including grade one-listed Archerfield House.There is also a cafe, deli, food market, gt shop, bar and microbrewery at Archerfield Walled Garden."},{"url":null,"title":"tims-tales-wallaces-mutton-hole","story":"AT THE tail end of the Easter weekend, I headed for Yellow Craig ndash not the beach, but the craggy small hill which gives the area its name.Itrsquos a volcanic vent, created millions of years ago, just like North Berwick Law nearby.But it canrsquot be compared to the Law. Itrsquos a tiny hill, and many people walk past without noticing it, as nature has covered much of it under a blanket of overgrowth.But close up Irsquove always thought it appears mysterious. It is made up of agglomerate, which is the remains of volcanic ash all mixed up with bits of other rock and stone, then solidied and compressed over millions of years.But in places the agglomerate rock looks like it could be the ancient rubble built walls of an old ruined castle. Steps now lead to the summit, and despite the smallness of the hill, the view from the top is quite spectacular.I could see Fidra Island basking in a shimmering sea when I climbed it in the evening of Easter Monday. I reflected that Robert Louis Stevenson must have once stood on this exact spot as he viewed what many say was his inspiration for Treasure Island.But my purpose that beautul evening was to find lsquoWallacersquos Mutton Holersquo. There was a local tradition that a small cave-like cavity on the north side of Yellow Craig bore this name, and although the origin of the tradition is lost, it was clearly linked to William Wallace.I found reference to this tradition in an old account from over  years ago in the Haddingtonshire Advertiser by a Mr Jamieson. However, it was brought to my mind when I read of the refurbishment of the Wallace Monument. As part of this, there will be the Luumlbeck letter on display, written by Wallace and sent to the merchants of Luumlbeck in .Wallace, it seems, was in East Lothian at the time this letter was composed. And it was this connection that sparked my memory of the reference to lsquoWallacersquos Mutton Holersquo on Yellow Craig and set me on my quest.But it was in the dying embers of the day we arrived, and I had limited time to explore. The kids had fallen asleep in the car and I think my long-suffering we was content to relax while I scrambled around a rock at the tail end of a fun but exhausting day.As I headed through the wood alone to the craig, the sun was already beginning to lower its head. The sound of birdsong was a crescendo naturersquos melody for spring.Yellow Craig wood isnrsquot ancient, most trees are around  years old. But there are some, mostly sycamores, which are clearly much older. They have exotic shapes and their twisted limbs and scaled bark make them look like fossilised dragons. Perhaps they are. There is one which grows close to the play park that even looks like a serpent.These older trees give this wood an ancient feel. There are also Scots pines, mostly along the edge of the wood. They are descendants of the great Caledonian Forest which once covered most of the north of Scotland. Patches of emigrant Scots pine can be found all over East Lothian and at Yellow Craig they seem to guard the wood from northerly gales, and they are bent and shaped by the wind.Scots pines also stand guard at Yellow Craig itself. When I arrived I didnrsquot initially head up the steps but scrambled up the northern slope, looking for Wallacersquos Mutton Hole.The meaning of this term is a subject of debate, and I claim no academic authority, but I wonderit could come from the term lsquomootrsquo, which is an old Anglo-Saxon word meaning debate or discussion. A moot hall was a room for this purpose in a medieval building, but Wallace was a guerilla fighter, so could this meeting place have been his moot ha If this was so, perhaps Yellow Craig was a meeting place, where Wallace and his followers once met to discuss strategy. Could the idea of the letter to Luumlbeck have been decided here, as they cast their eyes across the sea from the vantage of the rock Itrsquos an interesting idea, but of course therersquos no historical evidence for it. Yet most of what actually happened in those times has no historical evidence.I couldnrsquot find the hole or hollow, as nature has claimed the slope and thick vegetation meant I was kept away from the recesses hidden behind. Perhaps winter would have been a better time to search.But I was not disappointed. I sat on the summit and my instinct told me there was a mystery here that remains untold. A scant and seemingly forgotten oral tradition is not much to go on. But often an ancient half-whispered tradition has grown from a seed of truth.There is a similar East Lothian connection to Wallace in the Garleton Hills. I have written of the Wallace Cave there and the traditions associated with it. There is enough connection to our national hero in East Lothian to say our landscape can also claim connection to him.I will search deeper for references to Wallacersquos Mutton Hole at Yellow Craig andmy findings to this pagemy search proves fruitful. But regardless of the results of this search, for me Yellow Craig will always be a place of magic contemplation and imaginative possibilities."},{"url":null,"title":"worlds-oldest-golf-scorecard-from-musselburgh-up-for-auction","story":"Estimated at pound,-,, the card, which has been framed and mounted, dates from December , .It shows that a Mr Cundell played the five holes within the Musselburgh race track twice, a total of  holes in  strokes.

And wersquove also shown, really importantly, how our economic policies would be enhancedwe had the powers of independence.ldquoThat would grow our economy, deliver greater fairness and empower us to make the right decisions by the people of Scotland.In response to SNP MSP Bruce Crawford, Mr Mackay agreed the currency would remain the pound after a Yes vote and only change when an independent parliament decided that.ldquoOur policy is that we will support a change as soon as it can done safely and securely in the interests of the country, the economics of the country, when the time is right.Mr Mackayrsquos comments followed more criticism of the plan to ditch the pound.A former member of and an adviser to the partyrsquos Growth Commission both questioned the move, saying it could jeopardise peoplersquos savings and was not a priority.Richard Marsh, an external adviser to the Growth Commission, warned savers and householders could he hammeredthe new currency has less value than sterling.In , the Scottish Governmentrsquos own Fiscal Commission Working Group warned a new currency was a ldquosignicant undertaking in the short-term, though not unprecedented, and Scotland would need to ldquore-denominate all domestic wages, prices and contracts.Ms Sturgeonrsquos special advisers were unable to say at the weekend whether a new currency would be pegged to sterling - with the Scottish pound worth the same as a UK pound, for example - or float on the international money markets, and potentially be devalued.Mr Marsh said devaluation could wipe out yearsrsquo of savings and leave , householders trapped in negative equity, as their mortgages were recalculated in the new currency.He told the Scottish Daily Mail: ldquoThe Scottish Government may seek to absorb some of this risk to protect mortgage and asset values by pegging the currency.ldquoBut [given] this could be at the cost of public services and delivery, this would be a dficult decision for any new administration to make.ldquoIf Scotland took a lsquobig bangrsquo approach with a new currency set up shortly after a vote for independent, then it would mean businesses, iniduals and the Government would need to take account of movements in exchange rates between the newly established Scottish pound and sterling.Dan Macdonald, a former member of the Growth Commission, said currency was ldquoalmost irrelevant compared to economic growth and ldquosecondary in the independence debate.He said: ldquoWe need plans for the economy over the next five to ten years. That is more important than any one issue, including the constitutional question - we need to build the economy first.Financier Peter de Vink, a friend of Alex Salmond who backed Yes in , said a fledgling independent Scottish currency would be a magnet for speculators.The director of Edinburgh Financial and General Holdings said the result could be worse than Black Wednesday in , when speculators made millions betting on sterlingrsquos devluation, sending interest rates soaring.He said: ldquoThe pound was devalued by  per cent and that was in Britain - Scotland is a tenth of the size, so it would be even more of a problem. It would be devastating.ldquoIt is cloud cuckoo land stuffthey think they can do it. I thought there would be a little more brain power.ldquo[At] the last referendum, we avoided the currency issue as much as we could because we all knew it would be the most dficult thing.ldquoTalking about a currency is all wishful thinkingyou havenrsquot got a strong economy, and Scotland is not going to have a stronger economyScotland continues to have higher taxes than the rest of the United Kingdom.An SNP spokesperson said: \"Scotland will keep the pound immediately after independence.\"The SNPs policy is to make a managed and responsible transition to an independent currency, only when it is safe, secure and practicable to do so.\""},{"url":null,"title":"boutique-hotel-in-edinburgh-up-for-sale-at-8m","story":"Developer Edinburgh Castle Ltd has appointed commercial property consultancy Knight Frank to market the property.Read More:Ian McConnell: EU dream of Tusk may prove antidote for Faragersquos Brexit nightmareKnight Frank said that, following a full renovation and fit-out led by contractor Redpath, the development celebrated the buildingrsquos original features, including the school house facade and double-height atrium.It added that the property, in the heart of Edinburghrsquos .-acre New Waverley regeneration project which includes offices, housing, and leisure and retail, was expected to be complete and ready to hand over to a new owner in June.The former Victorian schoolhouse will feature  aparthotel-style bedrooms and commercial units spanning two floors, which Knight Frank declared would be ldquoideal for a bar, restaurant and outdoor terrace area.Read More:Ian McConnell: SNPs Mackay hits mark on Brexit amid independence poll sound and furyKnight Frank noted that Edinburgh Castle Ltd had forecast operating rooms revenue at pound. million per annum.

Everyone was terribly polite, too much so, and there was lots of slo-mo walking through rooms to faux classical music.

itrsquos not great but there are years and years of these types of conventions.ldquoIn terms of Scottish independence I canrsquot actually foresee a situation where we can expect Westminster to be deciding that, though.But Mr Wishart said nobody should doubt his personal commitment to independence, as he had demonstrated during the first independence referendum.Acknowledging some SNP supporters had been extremely unhappy with his announcement, claiming he was not ldquosettling up but settling in, the Perth MP appealed for them to recognise his long history of campaigning for Scottish independence as an MP.He said: ldquoI was here in Westminster during the first independence referendum and I donrsquot think I ever worked so hard to kick myself out of a job than during that.ldquoWhen we have the next independence referendum I will be trying equally hard.ldquoSome of the more enthusiastic supporters could look at who would be better in the chair than an MP who comes from the SNP.Mr Wishart said he also understood he would not have the natural, large support base of the two main parties but hoped to attract MPs who were tired of the status quo and wanted a modernised and more equal Commons.:In full: Theresa Mays letter sacking Gavin WilliamsonThe shadow Commons leaderrsquos manesto includes bringing in electronic voting, which is already in place in the Scottish Parliament, and calling MPs who have campaigned on topics first instead of by seniority.The veteran MP, who also chairs the Scottish Affairs Committee, wants to end the practice of referring to MPs by their constituency, because he wants MPs to ldquospeak to each other like ordinary human beings.And Mr Wishart said he had ldquototal respect and admiration for the work of his friend Mr Bercow, despite accusations of bullying.The SNP MP said: ldquoI thinkhas transformed the whole role in the face of consistent attacks from the executive and the Government and the way he has conducted himself has been exemplary.ldquoI hope he does stay on for his whole term.He does not address the issue of bullying directly in his manesto, which he admits to the Press Association he should ldquoprobably have included, and stressed his long history of working to combat bullying.A pledge to reform the management of the Commons by including staff as well as MPs, is included, as is promise to remove sanctions for clappingand push for more family-friendly working hours.Mr Wishart also denied he was edging towards retirement due to disappointment when he pulled out of the deputy leadership last year.ldquoIrsquove got no intention of retiring, he said. ldquoIrsquove never really had any leadership ambition.ldquoI sort of stumbled into being a politician from being a musician and Irsquove taken forward causes that are really important to me regardless of how popular or unpopular they might be.ldquoThis is the same thing becausepeople at home are looking at us and thinking

just like plant explorers from hundreds of years before, Dr Mark Hughes and his team set up a tarpaulin to work under, pitched their tents and started a fire to make what every jungle adventurer needs most ndash a cup of tea.Around them were lush tropical forests thick with towering trees and plant le, alive with exotic creatures.Ahead lay the prospect of finding something that no-one before them had ever discovered ndash rare ieties of the hardy garden favourite, Begonias.Read more:Benefits from Scotlands nature and countryside are growingFor gardeners in the grip of a love-hate relationship with the waxy leaved bedding plants, the teamrsquos discovery of new species of Begonias may not sound particularly thrilling.However,  new species of Begoniandash including one sticky iety which, unlike the garden centre begonias found in many Scottish flower beds, has been found to be carnivorous ndash are among a remarkable list of new species of plants just confirmed by the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh.One of the identied plants is Begonia DroiseroidesThe haul from a series of RBGE expeditions to a wide range of exotic locations around the world includes stunning gingers, ieties of fruits from the exotic mangosteen family and a minuscule moss, as well as the clutchof Begonias.Among the new species are moe than a dozen that are regarded as being under threat from loss of habitat or climate change. Their discovery has sparked hopes that they can be saved for future generations.While some of the plants were identied on the spot as previously unknown species, others posed a major scientic puzzle.In many cases, cuttings and seeds were brought back to be nurtured and double-checked against countless catalogues and images. Eventually, in a process that would surely have blown the minds of the th and th-century plant explorers, modern DNA techniques used to establish that they are, indeed, previously unknown species.Read more:Beavers become protected species but farmers are less than thrilledFor some, the processes have spanned years of intricate detective work at specialist research facilities.The new species collated in the RBGErsquos list were gathered during a year of research that saw its teams of scientists head to remote areas of Indonesia, Madagascar, Vietnam, the Philippines, India, Democratic Republic of Congo, Nigeria, Thailand, Brazil, Colombia and Peru.Among them are  species of Amomum that come from Zingiberaceae, the ginger family  Cyrtandra, part of Gesneriaceae, which is part of the African Violet family five species of exotic mangosteen fruit Garcinia and  species of Begonia.Along with the impressive list of new species, RBGErsquos scientists and horticulturists are also awaiting confirmation on other recent collections from Borneo and Peru that are now growing in its Edinburgh Glasshouses, many of which are said to be ldquoalmost certainly new to science.While much closer to home, the new species include a never before listed native moss species Weissia wilsonii, which was found in Cornwall and grows to just mm tall.Spotted in only a few sites in England and Wales, RBGE research has found it has undergone a long-term decline in distribution and had been on the brink of disappearing.The Cyrtandra kinhoii was collected on trip to SulawesiThe expedition to Sumatra took tropical ersity scientist Dr Hughes and his team in the footsteps ofth century Scots botanist William Jack. His gruelling  journey across dficult terrain and in defiance of warnings from terried locals that he risked disturbing evil spirits, resulted in the discovery of eight species of Begonia.Tragically, however, Aberdeen-born Jack would die within a year of his discovery and the bulk of his findings were destroyed by fire.Dr Hughes, who has spent two decades working on Begonias and searching for new species, described the RBGErsquos list of new species as good news at a time when many plants are under threat. He added: ldquoAt least we know where these plants are and how threatened they are. That means we can do something about it. We can only conserve what we know. All of the species we describe get a full conservation assessment based on the level of threat.ldquoWithout having a name, many plants do not have a hope of surviving. In some ways, we are giving these plants a voice.RBGE has a Living Collection of , plant species, including some of the worldrsquos rarest plants and many which are new to science. Its scientists and horticulturists work in more than  countries globally.Dr Hughes added: ldquoNaming and assessing them is just the first step, we need to make sure these species have a secure future in their native habitat and we do this by working with botanists in the relevant countries."},{"url":null,"title":"herald-diary-yeast-ribs-and-meringues","story":"ST Andrews University has been named Scotlandrsquos top university, and the third-best university in Britain.

A major part of the Yes movements strategy in  was to attract many who had never voted before. The disenfranchised at the lower end of the socio-economic spectrum were the mainstay. This demographic is targeted by every nationalist and populist movement with the rhetoric of injustice and a new dawn when those who are to blame are cast out. Who was targeted and how the message was pitched are part of what was sown. The voices Mr Mackay mentions are part of what is reaped whenever nationalist sentiments are agitated.Scottish independence will never become a reality without the votes of the shouty and of the marchers derided in the article. I fear that a crucial point has been missed in respect of the marchers. Many turn out not to convert but to exhibit solidarity. I might not agree with them, but I see that as more than enough reason for people to gather and exercise their rights.The piece refers to the need for the Yes movement to care about the country as a whole and not have Scotland ided against itself. This seems to be a forlorn wish. Scotland has been ided against itself since at least . Any and all who push for a second Scottish independence referendum keep it ided.However, at the end, I wasnt entirely sure whether Mr Mackay simply wants to exclude those who tarnish progress toward his goal or whether hes advocating removal of pursuit of independence from the table in the interests of harmony. Id support the latter. However, I could never subscribe to the former.Listening to things you dont agree with is one of the cornerstones of democracy. Some of them are distasteful and some are gross. However, unless they are criminal you should listen to them and try and work out for yourself why they form part of the picture.Kenny Wilson Union Street, Greenock.I AGREE with some of the points in Neil Mackays article.It is certainly true that the next independence bid needs to win by a decent margin.I think it is widely agreed among Yessers that  per cent for Yes would be reasonable.I also agree that the aim should be to win over No voters and those who are undecided. Many Yes Campaign organisers are holding public meetings and events with a wider appeal than the Yes movement and in my view are getting better at it. At a recent meeting of our local Yes Campaign almost half of the activists were not SNP members. The All Under One Banner marches have been hugely successful in putting out a good-humoured message of solidarity and confidence, particularly in remote areas like the Highlands. In places like Dumfries and Galloway,the presence of the marchers contradicts the negative message put out by a largely hostile media.But I think that Mr Mackay wants to have his cake and eat it. You cannot argue the Yes Campaign is not doing very much in the way of concrete campaigning and then complain about the currency debate ndash \"scrapping the pound\", as he puts it.The future of Scotlands economy will determine the success of independence. There is a case to be made for a Scottish currency and banking system that will not repeat the errors of the past. We must not leave the monetary system in the hands of the \"experts\" ndash ie bankers and their pals. The Scottish people, who in the past set up many aspects of the banking system have the good sense to listen to complex arguments and make up their own minds.Maggie Chetty, Woodend Drive, Glasgow.IT seems when it comes to the economics of currency in an independent Scotland there is still much misunderstanding and misrepresentation of the actuality of the situation.Alasdair Gallowayrefers to the long-term depreciation of the pound sterling and he associates this with the UKrsquos balance of trade deficit. In contrast, he states that Scotlandrsquos trade balance is in surplus which he suggests may allow an independent Scotland to avoid the \"continuing decline\" of sterling.However, the relevant measure of the balance of payments for an independent country is the current account balance and not the trade balance, since it is the former that a sovereign nation has to finance. The UK currently has a balance of payments deficit of four per cent of GDP on its current account. The latest Scottish Government statistics show a Scottish massive current account deficit of  per cent of GDP, which represents around pound billion.Since an independent Scotland would inherit approximately poundbn of foreign exchange reserves this would be insufficient to finance such a deficit. This means that there would be a considerable excess demand for foreign exchange on currency markets, and as in any market, the price of foreign exchange would have to rise which, in turn, implies a sharp devaluation of any Scottish currency. In other words, a new Scottish currency would have to be sharply devalued compared to sterling given the size of its balance of payments deficit.It is important to stress that this balance of payments   currency linkage implies that although an independent Scotland could of course try to use the pound post-independence , this would quickly unravel, whatever tests may be in place, since it is not a sustainable or credible policy for international capital markets.The only result of adopting sterlingisation post-independence would be a massive speculative attack and a rapid movement to a separate and sharply depreciated Scottish currency with all of the implications this would have for mortgages, pensions and other financial assets and liabilities.Ronald MacDonald,Professor of Macroeconomics and International Finance,Adam Smith Business School , University of Glasgow, Glasgow.THERE should be another national referendum with two questions:.

He saw the male characters as misogynistic. He hated the language, for example, used to describe the female prostitute who is called Natelyrsquos Whore, and her  year-old sister, referred to as Natelyrsquos Whorersquos Kid Sister.Clooney doesnrsquot says as much, but no doubt he was disturbed by the fact women are seen largely as objects of lust. We donrsquot get a female characterrsquos point of view until  pages in, and even then to tell of how she likes being with and receiving attention from men.And the Hollywood star has, of course, a perfect right to read the book and hate its writing, to believe its sensibility has no part to play in a modern world.But then he changed his mind. He announced he would join the projectthe sexism were removed. Which inevitably happened. Who wouldnrsquot want Clooney on board However, St George of Oxfordshire has slain a dragon that should have been left well alone. There is no denying that soldiers of war were sexist. There is no doubt that injured airmen grabbed at nurses. Itrsquos entirely true that pejoratives such as whore were rled at women.But Hellerrsquos book worked because it told us how it was ndash which was harsh, cold and horrying. He runs with the theme of absurdity the absurdity of existence, the absurdity of people in positions of power.

If hersquod planned to take us closer into the minds of female characters he would have done. This is a story told through the experience of the highly disturbed, desperate men sent out on never ending bombing missions, facing death every time a propeller turns over. This doesnrsquot mean their sexism was acceptable, but it does reveal how the minds of men coped in that dark, dangerous world of near anarchy and impending doom. And itrsquos a reminder of how sensibilities have altered. Who, for example, ever complained at the sight of scantily clad women painted on the side of the Bs, underneath the cockpits of young men facing a  per cent chance of death Variety Magazine wrote: ldquoCatch- is a classic of mid-th-century American literature, but to try to recapture what made it so is to invite failure.They were right.

The council’s Infrastructure Services Committeeapproved the kerbside collection policy and procedures last year, including guidance on how to deal with contaminated bins. Any non-recyclable material placed into the recycling bin is classed as ‘contamination’, which could spoil the recyclates in any load. The recycling reprocessor may then reject whole loads as a result. Any rejected loads of recycling are disposed of at an additional cost to the taxpayer, for which there is no council budget available. Income which they would have generated to invest in services is lost.Collection crews will now visually check each recycling bin for contaminated recycling before emptying as a matter of course – those with severe contamination will not be emptied. Households consistently presenting severely contaminated bins will be offered advice and support to properly separate their waste. Those who ignore that advice could run the risk of their recycling bin being removed.Moderately contaminated bins will be emptied and an orange tag will be attached, providing information to the householder on how to properly use the recycling service. If a bin has not been emptied and tagged explaining why it has not been emptied, it is contaminated and the offending materials must be removed before the next collection. Crews will notto empty a rejected bin until the next scheduled collection day for the same bin.Bins considered to have little or no levels of contaminants will be emptied as normal.Collection crews will keep a record of bins unemptied due to overloading or contamination and this will be checked before a decision is made toto empty any bin reported as a missed collection.For those with a lot of recyclable materials, additional, free recycling bins can be requested by contacting the council’s Wasteline. Additional non-recyclable waste bins may also be authorised where there is a genuine need following a home visit and assessment by a Community Waste Officer. data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.buchanobserver webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Police Scotland\"  Police urge revellers to be safe and responsible viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BUCH | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BUCH | Article Teaser\"The council’s Head of Roads, Waste and Landscape services, Philip McKay, said: “It’s important residents understand how to recycle properly and make best use of the facilities available to them. “Sending waste to landfill costs more than double the amount it costs to recycle and tackling the levels of contamination in kerbside bins is intended to reduce the amount of recyclates sent to landfill.“We will be enforcing the procedures in a staggered rollout, tackling problem routes first. This will allow crews to get used to the new procedures without any severe implications for the collection schedule.”Over half the materials in local non-recyclable waste bins are recyclable through existing services – equating to around , tonnes of recyclable materials being landfilled at a cost of £.million a year.Not only does maximising the value of a material benefit the environment, it also frees up money for other essential council services.Residents are encouraged to get in touch with the Recycling and Waste Aberdeenshire Facebook pagethey are unsure of how to dispose of any material not listed in the A-Z guide.For any recycling and waste related queries, or to request an additional recycling or non-recycling bin, please contact Wasteline."},{"url":null,"title":"occasional hours licence for brewdog","story":"An Aberdeenshire licensing authority has narrowly paved the way for the anticipated opening of BrewDog#s new #, Inverurie bar and restaurant next month.Despite the brewing giants not possessing a provisional licence, Aberdeenshire Central Licensing Board took the highly unusual step of granting two occasional licences to enable it to open in the former Mitchell’s Dairy premises on Market Street.Some  new staff can now be employed at the bar which will see the number of BrewDog employees in Aberdeenshire soar to more than .BrewDog retail director James Brown told the board the firm had made “a huge commitment to Inverurie and Aberdeenshire” and afterwards said he was “delighted” with the decision which will initially allow the bar to operate from May  to .The company’s full licence application is currently being fast-tracked by the council after delays incurred due to the installation of a new data system and subsequent backlog.Under the agreement after a close - vote by licensing board members, the bar has been limited to operating from am to  midnight Sunday to Thursday and from am to am Friday and Saturday but only while former BrewDog Tap Room manager Craig Cargill is on the premises. Off-sales have been approved from am to pm Monday to Sunday.However, among ious conditions imposed by the licensing standards team, it was also agreed that the outdoor space to the rear of the premises will not be utilised by customers until a full licence is granted.The licensing board heard from Audrey Junner of agents Hill Brown Licensing that BrewDog had no intention to trade by way of occasional licences for an extended period of time.She added: “We would like to reassure members that a provisional premises licence has been submitted… for the avoidance of doubt my clients wholly accept that no assumptions can be made about the grant of that provisional licence.“They have undertaken the fit-out works at the business entirely at their own risk.”But licensing standards officer Lisa Gordini reminded the board that while a provisional licence had been applied for, it would not be discussed until the board’s June meeting and could receive representations or objections which could impact on BrewDog’s operation.She maintained there was an argument that the board should not be granting any occasional licences which may “conflict with the consultation process” of the provisional licence application.After considerable debate, board member Robbie Withey proposed refusal of the application, saying the authority expected a six-month consultation period to process applications and that the company – which operates  bars around the world – should have applied sooner.data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Andy Beattie will be honoured with a new road named after him at Midmill Business Park\"  Honour for football manager viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"But admitting that the application was “a dficult one”, Gwyneth Petrie proposed making an “absolute exception” to usual practice and proposed approval."},{"url":null,"title":"pitcairn dominates thainstone breeding sale","story":"A Limousin cross British Blue heer and its heer calf sold for the top price at Aberdeen and Northern Marts# annual show and sale of commercial beef breeding cattle at Thainstone, sponsored by East Coast Viners.The animals from regular consignors, Craig and Katreen Malone, Pitcairn, Lochgelly, Cardenden, Fe, sold for £,.Champion in the pre-sale show judged by Will MacDonald, Tormore, Dunbeath and Kris Sutherland, Dunbeath Farms, Dunbeath, this heer was originally bought as a bulling heer from William and David Moir of Moir Livestock, Fraserburgh, while the heer calf is by Lodge Hamlet.The outfit sold for the lead price of £ to Dunbeath Farms, Dunbeath, Caithness.Craig and Katreen also scooped the reserve champion honours with a Limousin cross heer bred by Tom Howden, Stanley Farms.

Also among those present was Janine Miller, we of Australian national Greg Miller who also lives in Orkney.This year the wreath was laid on the final resting place of –year–old Royal New Zealand Navy Volunteer Reserve pilot, LieutenantThomas Noel Bush, who was tragically killed on December , .Lt Bush’s Hawker Sea Hurricane fighter plunged from the sky above Kirkwall straight into the Peedie Sea — while, only yards away, people were in their homes, or going about their daily business.On that fateful day, Lt Bush arrived to pick up the aircraft and, following a few pre-flight checks, took to the air.However, within minutes witnesses heard the aircraft`s engine revving at high speed and, from a height of approximately ft, it ed straight down into the Peedie Sea, killing the pilot instantly.Local emergency services and personnel from HMS Sparrowhawk were quickly on the scene, but nothing could be done for the unfortunate pilot.Lt Bush’s body was recovered from the wreckage and he was buried, with full military honours, in St Olaf`s Cemetery, on the outskirts of Kirkwall, on December , .Kirkwall branch of the Royal British Legion chairman Dougie Manson said: “Those who died came from far and wide to serve their countries overseas, coming here today is the least we can do to remember them.

The online poll is available on Orkney Islands Council’s website www.orkney.gov.ukA shortlist has been drawn up by OIC Marine Services which features prominent figures from the county’s history, plus the name of a previous pilot launch:The design and build contract for the new -metre pilot vessel was secured after a competitive tendering exercise by Astilleros Armon S.A, which has its main base in Northern Spain.The vessel will join the two pilot launches currently operated by Marine Services. The naming ceremony is planned for September .Graham Sinclair, chairman of the council’s development and infrastructure committee, said: “Like the celebrated explorer John Rae, some fitting names from Orkney’s past feature on the shortlist for the new vessel and I would encourage folk to take part in the poll.“With harbour business thriving in Orkney, this is an opportune time to replace an ageing pilot launch with a more modern, capable, and reliable vessel. Like her predecessors, she will give us the capability to deliver a -hour, year-round pilotage service in the very challenging waters around Orkney. This greatly benefits the economy of our islands.“I look forward to the outcome of the vote and hope that as many folk as possible take this opportunity to choose the name for a vessel that will become a familiar sight in local waters.”As well as the online poll, you can send your preferred name from the shortlist by post to Pilot Vessel Poll, Harbour Authority Building, Old Scapa Rd, Scapa, Kirkwall KW SD. If you submit a postal vote, please include your name and phone number.The poll closes on Tuesday, May . A winner will be drawn from the votes for the most popular name, invited to take part in September’s naming ceremony and offered the opportunity of a family trip at a later date aboard the new pilot launch.Brian Archibald, Harbour Master and Head of Marine Services, Engineering and Transportation, said: “We look forward to the delivery and naming ceremony for our new pilot launch.“Orkney continues to benefit from a signicant upturn in harbour related activity, making it essential that we invest in the equipment and vessels necessary to deliver a safe and efficient service.“Our pilot launches play a vital role at the heart of our harbours operations. They enable marine pilots to embark and disembark from vessels heading to and from berths and anchorages within the Orkney Harbours area.

With new surfacing laid over the last week, the council say that a short time will be required for the surface to cure, with the streets to reopen to traffic on Friday at the latest.The works are part of the Kirkwall Townscape Heritage Initiative’sPlaces and Spaces project, which include changes to the area at the bottom of the Strynd and top of Castle Street, as well as providing a new path to the War Memorial on the Kirk Green.With the initial phase of the project now completed, works will be suspended for the main summer season. Plans are for work to move to the entrance to Victoria Street in the autumn, being suspended again in December for Christmas shopping season.The Places and Spaces initiative was developed alongside community groups such as the Kirkwall and St Ola Community Council and the Kirkwall BID, who identied key areas of the town where it was felt improvements could be made. According to OIC, proposed improvements were the positively received by the Orkney community during a two-day consultation period, where  per cent of those who attended said they supported the proposals,  per cent were against and the rest were undecided.The Kirkwall Townscape Heritage Initiative is a five-year heritage-based grant scheme which seeks to deliver sustainable improvements to the built heritage of the Kirkwall Conservation Area, in an effort to regenerate the centre of Kirkwall for the benefit of local communities and businesses, as well as to attract visitors.

The council say that all profit would stay in the islands, enabling the local authority to preserve and enhance key services that local people value and depend upon. This, OIC believes, will provide a foundation for communities to drive transformational projects of their own.The council hopes that developments will allow it to join other local developers in making a meaningful contribution to a Needs Case for a new interconnector for Orkney, thereby substantially supporting the vital renewable energy industry in Orkney, including future development of the marine energy sector.OIC believes that the wider economic development value of a new cable to Orkney could be highly signicant, particularlya substantial proportion of local ownership can be secured — which could help employment and income remain in the county.Plans for a development of up to around MW in Hoy were announced to the local community last year — with sites for a development of up to MW on the island of Faray and up to MW on shoreside farmland at Quanterness outside Kirkwall now also being investigated.The proximity of the project at Quanterness to Kirkwall could also enable a separate private wire network project in which the council could directly supply electricity to its own buildings as a means to reduce costs.Public engagement events have been organised for Kirkwall, Eday and Rendall over the coming fortnight. Proposed plans for the developments will be on display at these, with elected members and council officers on hand to discuss the plans with members of the public. The proposed Quanterness site has the potential capacity for six m blade tip height turbines. The site on Faray has enough space for up to eight m blade tip height turbinesThe event details are as follows:An event will also be held in Westray, with the date yet to be confirmed.The current proposal at the third site in Hoy is to erect seven turbines, compared to the  presented in the original plans.The proposals for each site are expected to evolve as further site investigation work and consultation is undertaken. Site investigations, including bird and telecommunications studies, will be ongoing at all three sites.The council#s intention is to reach planning permission stage by the end of , ensuring all views and issues are fully explored and considered before any final decisions are made.  Proposals for how the applications will be determined are currently being considered.Councillor James Stockan, Orkney Islands Council leader said: “It is vital that the Council now takes an active ‘developer approach’ to energy projects in our islands. Not only does this allow us to maximise the resources available to us in the islands to support services and projects for local people, but it also allows us to contribute signicantly and in a meaningful way to allow our world-renowned local energy industry to survive and thrive through a new grid connection.“Our strategy is one that meets uncertainty head-on. The final details of proposals are by no means set in stone whilst investigations are carried out at the three sites, nor are all three sites guaranteed planning permission — and of course we also wish to take into account public opinion on the developments. Widening the net and moving to investigate three separate sites, allows us a degree of flexibility in the make-up of the final outcome.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Interim targets for emissions cuts of  per cent by  and  per cent by  will also be included in the forthcoming Climate Change Bill – the highest statutory targets for these years. Scottish environment secretary Roseanna Cunningham said: “There is a global climate emergency and people across Scotland have been calling, rightly, for more ambition to tackle it and safeguard our planet for future generations. “Having received independent, expert advice that even higher targets are now possible, and given the urgency required on this issue, I have acted immediately to set a target for net-zero greenhouse gas emissions for , which will see Scotland become carbon neutral by .“I have been consistently clear that our targets must be ambitious, credible and responsible. We must take an evidence-based approach and balance our climate, economic and social responsibilities. “We have already halved greenhouse gas emissions from Scotland while growing the economy, so we know we can do it. I am committed to meeting the most ambitious targets possible, and doing so while continuing to build an inclusive and fair economy.” She said everyone must play their part and called for Westminster to work with Scotland to achieve climate goals.The new report updates the CCC’s previous advice, which had found a net-zero target was not realistic.The new target will raise the goals set out in the draft Climate Change Bill, which had demanded a  per cent drop in emissions by , but stated that a net-zero target would be set as soon as was practicably possible.The CCC report concludes that Scotland is well equipped to achieve a  per cent cut in emissions from the  baseline level by  – five years ahead of the rest of the UK.It says the targets are achievable with known technologies and improvements in people’s behaviour, and at an affordable overall cost.A range of measures and new policies will be necessary to hit the targets, many of which are already being developed.These include increasing green power, energy-efficient buildings, switching to electric vehicles and introducing carbon capture and storage technology. But the authors acknowledge slashing emissions in some sectors – namely agriculture and aviation – will be dficult. The report shows there are multiple benefits of moving to a zero-carbon economy, such as improvements in public health and economic opportunities. However, it stresses the costs of moving to a low-carbon society must be fair.CCC chairman Lord Deben warned that hitting the targets would be challenging. He said: “Scotland has been a leader within the UK with many of its policies to tackle climate change. By setting a strong net-zero target for  it can continue that leadership on the world stage. “It will be tough, but it can be done and Scotland’s strong track record positions it well to succeed.”The decision to adopt the net-zero target has been welcomed by environmentalists, academics and industry.Mike Robinson, board member of the coalition Stop Climate Chaos Scotland, said: “Tackling climate change is our moral obligation, but this report shows it is also possible and affordable.” ©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"nicola sturgeon slammed for forgetting her own currency plan","story":"Nicola Sturgeon has been criticsed for failing to recall her party#s six tests for introducing a new Scottish currency yesterday as she launched a government plan to increase exports over the next decade.Nicola Sturgeon has been criticsed for failing to recall her party’s six tests for introducing a new Scottish currency yesterday as she launched a government plan to increase exports over the next decade.The First Minister came under pressure to list the economic tests the SNP’s Growth Commission had said are vital to meet before a new currency could be introduced in an independent Scotland. Currency was debated atat her party’s conference last weekend with SNP members ultimately backing a plan which would see the Pound dropped “as soon as practicable” after independence.However when asked to list the tests Ms Sturgeon said: “The six tests are about having the infrastructure in place, the central bank, having a sufficiency of reserves to support a currency. Tests around where the Scottish business and economic cycle fits with the UK economic cycle. It’s about the overall interests of the economy, businesses, investors, traders. And about the Scottish Parliament deciding that the right conditions had been met.”However there is no requirement in the Growth Commission’s test for the Scottish Parliament to decide “conditions had been met” and the First Minister did not mention fiscal sustainability and the financial requirements of Scottish people and businesses.Scottish Conservative shadow finance secretary Murdo Fraser said: “If Nicola Sturgeon can’t remember the SNP’s currency plans, what chance does anyone  have  This exposes the fact that the SNP doesn’t care about the detail – it wants to force independence through whatever the cost.”Labour’s finance spokesperson James Kelly MSP added: “Nicola Sturgeon said the country can ‘move forward now with confidence’ in her currency plan. It hardly inspires confidence when she doesn’t know the tests she would use to judge her policy as ‘safe’ to introduce.” But a spokesperson for Ms Sturgeon said: “The First Minister knows the six tests and gave a summary of them. The Tories’ Brexit shambles threatens to cost families and business across Scotland – which is why they are running scared as support for independence continues to rise.”Ms Sturgeon was asked about the currency tests after she announced a new £m Trading Nation strategy to increase Scottish exports to the level where they account for a quarter of Scotland’s Gross Domestic Product over the coming decade, creating , jobs and increasing Scotland’s tax take by an estimated £m a year. The £m would be spent on trebling the number of trade envoys from four to  and helping companies grow existing exports and enter new markets.She said: “The target that we have adopted of exports accounting for  per cent of our GDP in  years time is both important and also ambitious. Exports have hovered around the  per cent mark for almost the entire  years of devolution so getting to that  per cent and staying there - or progressing further - would be a big change.”Responding to the announcement, CBI Scotland director Tracy Black said Scotland had not kept pace with the progress made by other similar sized countries.

While  per cent want one within the next two to five years,  per cent want one within the next five to ten years and  per cent did not know.The online survey asked the opinion of , adults across Scotland.The First Minister told MSPs on Wednesday that new legislation would be brought forward at Holyrood by the end of the year, which would provide the framework for a second vote. But any prospect of the UK government repeating the granting of a Section  order, which would allow Scottish ministers to hold a legally binding vote, was ruled out by Mr Lidington.“We don’t see any evidence that there is a demand from the people of Scotland to review the decision they took in ,” he said. “That referendum was said at the time to settle matters for a generation.“We don’t see that a Section  order is called for. I don’t see how it would help put right problems with Scottish schools and hospitals.“Devolution in Scotland has given many additional powers to the Scottish Parliament and some of those powers have not even be used. So I think there is plenty more that can be done in terms of the Scottish Government using the powers that are already there.”Askedhe would rule out granting a Section  order before , the minister said: “We have made it very clear we don’t think that is justied.”The First Minister indicated the Scottish Government would hold off requesting a Section  order. While Mrs May’s administration has ruled out granting one, the Prime Minister is widely expected to stand down in the coming monthsa Brexit deal can be secured. Mr Lidington refused to speculate on whether a new Tory government would be more likely to grant the order. The minister’s remarks were seized on by the SNP, with the party’s Westminster leader describing them as an “arrogant diktat”.Ian Blackford said: “Scotland’s future cannot and will not be decided by the arrogant diktat of this shambles of a Tory government, which has been rejected by Scottish voters at every election and which is soon likely to be out of office.“Whatever people’s views on independence, a strong majority of people back the Scottish Parliament’s right to determine the nation’s future.“Overwhelmingly, it is Holyrood – not Westminster – which the people of Scotland believe should have the right to decide this country’s democratic path.“The Westminster system is broken beyond repair and does not serve Scotland’s interests – something now conceded at senior levels in the Scottish Tory ranks.” But the Scottish Conservatives said the new polling proved there was no demand for another referendum.The Survation poll found more people were in favour of Scotland remaining in the UK than leaving. Askeda referendum was held on the question “should Scotland remain in the United Kingdom or leave the United Kingdom ”,  per cent said they would vote remain and  per cent said they would vote leave.More respondentssaid leaving the UK would be worse for Scotland’s economy than Brexit, while  per cent thought it would be better.

Such oppor­tunities don’t come often. They were also seen to catch a seal in the bay at Lund, and photographed by several folk during their progress north, and so hopefully can be identied by the team that are still up here researching the distribution and abundance of killer whales around Scotland.From photographs, it has been established that an orca seen off Cullivoe, north Yell, on the evening of the th July, is a big male known as  or “Bigga”.Next day, the same inidual was identied at hrs heading north through Yell Sound.Some of our showiest plants are in flower just now. “I know a bank whereon the wild thyme blows …” wrote William Shakespeare in “A Midsummer Night’s Dream”. And indeed I do. There’s a fantastic bank near me where the pale mauve flowers of thyme are pushing through between the bell heather, itself with some plants paler than others.Common heather is not so bold in its colouration, but works in mass production, and will soon be colouring the hills with subtle shades. The third in the trio of obvious heathers is cross-leaved heath, whose compact flowerheads drooping from a single stem are pinker in colour.Changing colour, two striking plants are now in full bloom – angelica and meadowsweet. Although names for meadowsweet in dferent coun­tries all translate as “queen of the meadow”, it seems that its name actually comes from its use in flavouring the drink mead. Also in the days when hygiene was not quite so good as now, the plant with its rather nauseating scent was spread out on the floors of houses to counteract unpleasant odours. A Shetland name is “blackenin-girse”, from its use for dyeing wool.From the showy to the opposite – demure and unnoticed is a little plant with a big name that is very common about gardens, steps and roadsides: procumbent pearlwort. This low, hairless, tufted perennial has its base as a non-flowering rosette. However, the name pearlwort is said to come from the tiny, pearl-like white, long-stalked flowers whose sepals are actually longer than the usually four petals. In folklore it is said to have special powers of protection. So next time you go to pull out this so-called weed, just give it a closer look first. Maybe its powers of protection will rub off on you!"},{"url":null,"title":"li","story":"The Liberal Democrats claimed by far the highest number of Shetland votes in Thursday#s European elections, gaining roughly twice the number of nearest rivals the SNP.However, the isles# effort was unable to save the Euro seat of Lib Dem George Lyon, who was likely to be replaced at Brussels by UKIP#s David Coburn.Returning officer Jan-Robert Riise at the European Election count.

I always thought it would but it#s possibly exceeded my expectations.#I#m extremely delighted for George Lyon and just hope that it can be replicated down through the country.#George Lyon is a very, very good MEP, interested in the rural areas, and I just hope he gets back again.# raquoShetland#s slide to the right in the past few years reflects what is going on nationally and internationally, but needs study.yuns de longest contribution yet Brian, du better hae a mandatory rest period noo ta big desel up ageen.UKIP got the seat,great news !I wonderhe#ll be like the outgoing Yorkshire UKIP man who hardly attended any debates in the parliament, or like the new one, who#s said this morning he won#t attend at all Lets hope we learn not to be so apathetic, we literally get what we deserve. Salmond and Farage, the opposite sides of a nasty #nationalist# coin.And what of British Nationalists Mr Tinkler For example Michael Gove yesterday, banning #Of Mice  Men# and #To Kill a Mockingbird# from school reading lists in England.Can you imagine the SNP doing likewise because the want -% of literature studied to be Scottish Inconceivable.For whatever reason British nationalism # incredibly, even in the form of UKIP # isn#t sneered at the same way as Scottish nationalism.What is your point Carl  Scotland is somehow superior to England because it does not ban “Of Mice  Men” and “To Kill a Mockingbird” from school reading lists. How very petty of you. For information I loathe all nationalism, Scottish, British what is the dference, just raw tribalism by another name.SNP, UKIP, Scottish Independence, United Kingdom Independence, as I said, two sides of a very nasty littlecoin.How verySad andironic, the Scots# inScotland have just elected a UKIP MEP!! I#m glad to hear it Ian.So you are pro-EU and pro-immigration You mean you loathe most of human society from the ancient world to the st century  Nation-states have existed throughout human history and patriotism # or nationalism # is a normal part of human social experience, as evidenced in innumerable great artistic works, for example. Where things go wrong is where one nation-state wants to conquer and control others. But that has a dferent name: imperialism.Well Carl, when it comes to education and this of literature, I would rather have a book written by a british,not scottish, author than this of an american, in which to study or reflect on with regard to literary works used for educational purposes. Quite rightly, these books, written by foreigners##sorry, yanks, should be taken out of the national curriculum and author#s unique to the UK or Scotland selected instead. I must confess, I am a little worried and concerned about the UKIP doing so well in the European Election#s considering Mr Farrage is a more extreme version of the vile Tories, and how he gives the impression of a nationalist, xenophobic buffoon where, I feel,we do leave the EU, he will, like the vile Tories, be in a position to rule and do as he pleases without being answerable to anybody, namely the EU under the European Human Rights Act. Many people may criticize the EHRA, but I would dread to think what this country would be like without it     David, you never fail to amaze me.You start off by arguing that teachers should be banned from using any book written by a foreigner and then go on to criticise nationalism and xenophobia.You really do believe in taking the scatter gun approach to political philosophy.Without the European Human Rights Act there would be an awful lot less terrorists running round for a start, old hook hands would of been deported along with his pals years ago, The   tube an bus bombings may never of taken place, an Cherie Blair would have a few less £millions in the bank. Any and all of these options are preferable to what we have now.At the last general election when the Lib Dems signed a pact with the Conservatives the writing was on the wall, they blew it big time and will never in the future be able to have an influence on British politics.Maybethey had made a coalition with Labour it might have been dferent but now its too late, any vote for Liberal in the future will be a vote wasted.The study of English literature should, in my view, encompass all literature written in the English language, including its many dialects and historic iations. That should include studying local writers, but not to the exclusion of international authors.We study literature for all sorts of reasons, but bolstering national pride or trashing another nation shouldn#t be amongst them.If we were to go down the road of only studying our own literature, Scots students would never study Shakespeare or Dickens, English students would never study Burns or Lewis Grassic Gibson, neither would study Melville or Twain, and all would be worse off for it.The attack on the English curriculum has come from the dreadful Michael Gove, but it could quite easily have come from Nigel Farage who hates hearing non-English accents, let alone reading non-English texts.UKIP under Farage represents a severely authoritarian threat to our liberty which should not be under-estimated. So far we#ve only seen the tip of this particular iceberg.Farage is married to a German so he hears a foreign accent every day, such a pity you only soak up what murdochs media tell you instead of a few facts.How very true John, they, the LibDems, know how to go out with a bang##so to speak. A prime example of# not what to do in a political career # lolGod forbidthe Libdemsshould go into bed with UKIP, I think that would most certainly put a stake into the heart of the party lol Mind you, lets hope that UKIP do not get to that level of power where a they rule the roost or b contemplate a coalition with another party.I do believe they are in the same league as the Tories with regard to the Scottish Parliament, in that they have  single representative####.. too many in my books lol# you never fail to amaze me. You start off by arguing that teachers should be banned from using any book written by a foreigner # lol Malcolm, I was being slightly sarcastic in my response to what literature teachers should be using to teach with ###.but on a more serious point, I do not see why teachers cannot use books written by scottish or british authors to demonstrate literature and its meaning##..within and between the lines. I am sure, as you might agree, there is just as equally good examples of literature within the boundaries of our own country or the UK in which to use for educational purposes  I wasn#t specically saying every foreign book should be banned##.it was, as said sarcastically, yank#..sorry, american in the context of the subject.Theo Smith and the other  Shetland Lib-Dem voters might explain why they like it so much. But they won#t.Are you unable to express your own views Brian  because that link is your longest post by far.Carl Pickard, in answer to # Ian. So you are pro-EU and pro-immigration # I am strongly forUnity of all humanity, that does not mean I carte blancheagree with of all the attemptsand mechanisms to forge those unities by politicians. However the EU is a vast improvement of what went before it. WW and WW were the result of the preceding collection of sovereign nation states.On balance I there for do support the EU, however there are grounds to improve it, not demolish it. I most definitely agree with immigration and the opening of borders to all friendly states and cultures..Britain has benefited hugely due to its ersity of cultures.If anyone advocates banning immigration and sending #them# home, would they expect all UK and Scottish ex pats to be expelled from wherever they are and be sent backThat would be fun would it not I would expect to be deportedfrom whatever country I was in other than my ownI broke their laws. I would not expect that country to feed clothe and house me, nor would I expect free everything, maybe that#s just me as I don#t expect this country to do that for me either . Instead of hysterical rantings of they want to send them all back try actually listening to what they say instead of what the murdoch media say they say.A new experience # Iagree with Ian Tinkler.Robert Sim, in answer to # you loathe most of human society from the ancient world to the st century# I certainly do loath the primitive mentality which is soblind and stupid to realise most of human suffering is simply because Nation States and nationalistsare collectively too selfish to look beyond theirown self interest and belief in racial superiority.. Nationalism is a prime example of that and Salmond and his NATS a great example. Our oil, we are better, fairer, alone we would be wealthier, ect,ect and all that self righteous rubbish. Also nationalism goes a bit beyond great artistic works, a few examples : The Holocaust ,Omagh bombing , Bloody Sunday. Ethnic cleansing . Tribal massacresCambodian genocide , these are a few examples of hundreds of incidents..These killings have little to do with imperialism, more about tribalism and a self belief in racial superiority. #The simple fact is we are all the same species with exactly the same ancestry and emotions.# Very true, Ian. In fact, your words remind me of these words from a famous historical document: #We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal##. The document is of course the American Declaration of Independence..."},{"url":null,"title":"first look at the jarls squad ","story":"Plenty of onlookers were already on the streets as the squad made its first procession of the day from Islesburgh Community Centre, past the galley shed on St Sunniva Street and on to the Toll Clock Shopping Centre.In the gloom, the ranks of the Jarl#s Squad looked the part wearing emerald green kirtles with dragon mots underneath simple brown leather breastplates embossed with the same mot.

He began his career in  as a Chemistry Teacherin Wallace High School, moving to Regent House School where he later was appointed Head of Chemistry and then to the Principalship of Rathfriland High School. From his early career,Simon excelled not only as a vibrant and engaging classroom teacher, but also as the leader of the largest Duke of Edinburgh Award Scheme in the Province whilst at Regent House.Simon brought to Portadown College this lelong passion for adventure and outdoor pursuits by participating in Duke of Edinburgh expeditions and instilling a love of the outdoors in all of the young people who participated in these ventures.A hallmark of Simon’s Principalship was his heartfelt interest in students and staff as iniduals. So as to ensure that each knew their value, he was always ready to offer a gentle word of encouragement and would urge them to, “Do something today that your future self will thank you for”.Regardless of background, belief or personal circumstances, students, staff and parents were received with a warm smile and a sincere willingness to work towards a positive outcome. In all such situations, Simon gave of his time generously and graciously, always setting aside his own priorities to support others.Simon was a strong educational leader with distinctive values which he brought to a range of challenging situations. As a College community, we are indebted to him for the dedication and industry he demonstrated in working alongside the Board of Governors to advocate for the Dickson Plan, consistently placing students at the heart of his educational vision.A man of strong personality and principles, Simon espoused high standards in allaspects of College le and never once shied away from any criticism this might have attracted.Simon’s service to education in Northern Ireland extended beyond Portadown College and included holding office in the Craigavon Area Learning Community, Association of ControlledGrammar Schools and the Post-Primary Principal’s Association. His long standing career had also involved acting as Chief Examiner for A Level Chemistry with the CCEA.A passionate traveller who enjoyed adventures in the most far-flung corners of the globe,Simon was ever keen to share his experiences with students and staff alike, encouraging each and every one to get out into the world, savour its magnicence and seize every opportunity. One of Simon’s most distinctive qualities was that he never lost a childlike sense of awe and wonder at the beauty of the world. He took particular delight in his garden at the foothills of the Mountains of Mourne and regularly enjoyed walking these hills with his much loved Irish Deerhound companions, Oisin and Uther.Current and former students will remember with fondness his infectious sense of fun and wicked humour, from his cameo roles in College charity events to a starring role in “PC Happy”. In jovial banter with students, staff and Governors, he also shared his love for sport, in particular his longstanding support for Ulster and Irish Rugby, alongside Coventry City and Crusaders football teams.A man of eclectic taste, Simon derived considerable joy from art and music of all genres - classical, Irish folk and contemporary. Proud of his Banbridge roots and passionate about his Ulster culture, he demonstrated a reverent respect for tradition, as exemplied through his meticulous attention to detail and great pride in leading the College’s annual Act of Remembrance.Indeed, Simon often reflected poignantly on the sacrice of others and had served proudly as an officer in the Royal Naval Reserve for almost a quarter of a century.Students and staff alike will hold dear the sentiment of Simon’s final Easter Assembly, inspired by his many visits to Coventry Cathedral, in which he spoke on the theme of Forgiveness and the message of Hope in the death and resurrection of Jesus themes deeply important to Simon and ones which he sought to enact in his daily le.As a College community, our loss is immeasurable. However, we will endeavour to uphold the College Motto “Fortiter et Humaniter” in Simon’s memory:May the road rise up to meet you.May the wind be always at your back.May the sun shine warm upon your facethe rains fall soft upon your fieldsand until we meet again,may God hold you in the palm of His hand."},{"url":null,"title":"yfc get on their bike with 75km for 75 years","story":"Rathfriland Young Farmers Club are set to kick off their th anniversary celebrations with a bang this weekend.The club are delighted to announce their first event to commemorate the milestone anniversary with a sponsored cycle challenge.

They’ve been to an All-Ireland semi-final and they know when to stop the game and they have a few marquee players. I thought our boys matched them. We were under the cosh at times, but our boys showed desire and pride too. The conditions were dficult and we saw some of the shots and passes out there – the game was probably lucky to be played, but the surface was fine.”The teams were closely matched for the first  minutes with Antrim’s Paudie McLaughlin cancelling out an early Liam McDonald free for Monaghan.However, the hosts were dealt a blow when full-back Emmett Irvine, who had impressed in the early stages, picked up a black card after  minutes and the Farneymen assumed control for the remainder of the half with scores from Jason Irwin, Darragh Dempseyand McDonaldputting them - to - ahead at the break.Antrim’s second and final point arrived via a well-taken effort from Daniel McNicholl while Irwin landed his second of the evening on  minutes.Yet, the Monaghan captain, booked in the first half, picked up a second yellow for a high tackle moments later and the visitors were guilty of some cynical fouling as they looked to preserve their lead.Another Dempsey free moved them four clear inside the final  minutes and they looked to have done enough to seal victory.Antrim’s Ryan Lennon was black-carded for a third-man tackle, but a clever pass across the face of goal in stoppage time from Reuben Carleton allowed McNally to palm the ball past Joe Kirk in the Monaghan goal.Monaghan corner-forward McDonald was issued with a straight red for a strike while Antrim didn’t have time to muster a late equaliser.McAllister’s men must quickly regroup for the Qualiers as they will face Armagh in the Athletic Grounds on Saturday afternoon.ANTRIM: J Rodgers R Carleton, E Irvine, M Ferris R Hagan, E Higgins, S O’Callaghan J McNally -, D McNicholl - R McKillop, S Madden, C Higgins P McLaughlin -, R Lennon, R Boyle.Subs: C Killough for Irvine , M Lynch for Higgins .

There are two key principles: . Start from your child’s present level of knowledge. . Help your child to learn from their mistakes.Motivation, motivation, motivation! You have to take your child with you on this journey. A simple rewards system can be highly effective.Don’t just practice. There’s a tendency to think that just practising one test after anther will do the trick. It’s far more important to learn from mistakes. Going through the test afterwards with your child and filling in the the gaps in learning is crucial.Stay calm, manage stress, build confidence. Don’t talk about the Transfer test all the time. Use breaks, treats and bite-sized learning sessions to keep things fresh. Be realistic about your child’s potential. Pass or fail, it’s important to try to make this process a positive one.Manage the exam day. Make sure that you have everything ready for the day, that your child tries to get a good night’s sleep, eats breakfast and gets there in good time.How and when to use our testsIt’s best to use them as real exam practice. These tests are mock exams. They are set out in a style as close as possible to the real thing – though the format will y from year to year. It is best to use them as authentic exam experience rather than for general practice. Follow the instructions and advice in the sections before starting the test.What a score means and how to boost itIt is unfortunately impossible to say that a certain score can guarantee a pass in the actual exams. However, we suggest that a score of % would be a standard to aim at. It is important not to present this to your child as a concrete benchmark though, as the best motivator for them is to see the scores going up. Here are some tried and tested tips for improvement.Go over any incorrect answers. Always go over incorrect answers so that your child can see what went wrong. To help with this process, some of our harder Maths questions are explained.Use an action planner inside. This will provide a plan for what to do next when a test has been marked.Improve basic exam technique. Work on improving speed, working efficiently – coming back to trickier questions later – and pacing within the time limit.Improve general English skills. Ensure the foundations are strong enough. Use a range of checklists to help reinforce your child’s English skills.Target what is not fully understood. The secret is not to keep blindly practising but to target the areas of English Maths that your child is weakest in. This is where crucial marks can be picked up.Once your child has completed the papers you can download the corresponding answer sheets here:Answer sheets: Monday th AprilAnswer sheets: Tuesday th AprilAnswer sheets: Wednesday st MayAnswer sheets: Thursday nd MayAnswer sheets: Friday rd MayAnswer sheets: Saturday th May"},{"url":null,"title":"danske bank payout to deaf belfast woman over handling of call","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

When she spotted the attempted fraud, she checked the banks website for guidance and made contact via telephone as instructed, with the help of her brother.She said the employee who took the call refused her service as she was using her brother as an intermediary on the call.Ms McKendry explained: \"I asked my brother to explain my disability and to ask for a reasonable adjustment to enable me to act quickly on fraudulent activity on my bank account. \"I didnt want my brother to act for me, I wanted him to relay the instructions of the bank employee to me and I would respond via the speaker phone.\"Even though the bank employee said he could hear me, the account holder, he refused me service because I was lip-reading the information the employee provided to my brother via speaker phone. \"I could see attempted transactions happening on my account while this call was ongoing and was extremely worried.\" The bank had blocked the card immediately after her phone call, but following what she saw as a refusal of service, Ms McKendry contacted her bank via secure messaging on its online app. The app said it could take three to five days or more to get a response.Ms McKendry felt the situation was more urgent.The next morning she was invited to meet the branch manager who confirmed that her card had been blocked following her call, her account was safe and missing funds would be reinstated. The manager suggested putting in place a mandate that would give her brother access and transaction rights to her accounts. Ms McKendry rejected this, saying she is well capable of managing her financial affairs herself.She made a formal complaint to Danske Bank and contacted the Equality Commission.A disability discrimination case was taken against Northern Bank Ltd, which trades as Danske Bank, with the help of the Equality Commission.In settling the case, Northern Bank Ltd paid Ms McKendry £, without admission of liability, and has made adjustments to its services.Ms McKendry said she found the episode \"hugely frustrating\" and welcomed the banks move to put in place technology she can use to contact it in a hurry.Danske Bank said: \"Our award-winning local contact centre has since invested in market leading voice biometrics technology to help customers more easily identy themselves securely. \"We have been happy to work with Ms McKendry and the Equality Commission to help deliver better outcomes. \"We also recently became the only company in Northern Ireland to sign up to The Valuable , a global movement of organisations who pledge to promote disability inclusion and place it on the board agenda in .\""},{"url":null,"title":"dup mp paisleys poach tourists from dublin call sparks backlash","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

In December Mr Paisley also faced questions over a luxury trip to the Males. data-dfpadtargetingTourists at Dunluce CastleMr McGlone added: \"Its nice to see Mr Paisleys recent tourist trips to Sri Lanka and the Males have helped him become such an expert in tourism.\"But perhaps he could have been warned that such ill-advised comments would only draw more attention to those overseas trips.\"The tourism industry will always work hard to attract as many visitors to Ireland both north and south, and we welcome all to these shores.\"I wonder how many times Mr Paisley has flown out from Dublin Airport since hes so aware of the lack of marketing for Northern Ireland \"Most visitors from overseas have no choice but to land in Dublinthey want to visit. Telling them theyve landed in the wrong place is not the message we should be putting out.\"Sinn Fein said that \"clearly Ian Paisley has a great deal of experience of tourism and overseas travel... but he obviously knows nothing about marketing\".\"Tourists from across the world see Ireland as a single entity and it is rightly marketed as such,\" it said.\"His comments also show a lack of understanding of the north-south bodies which his party colleagues sat on which have responsibility for all-Ireland tourism marketing.\"Hospitality NI chief Colin Neill said that something has to be done to ensure Northern Ireland maximises its tourist potential.However, he admitted Mr Paisleys words was \"not the sort of language I would have used\".\"The Republic of Ireland is our second biggest market behind Great Britain,\" he said.\"Around % of air traffic of visitors to Northern Ireland comes through Dublin Airport, so yes, we need to do everything we can to make sure they turn left as well as right after they arrive.\"But theres a bigger issue and that concerns infrastructure in Northern Ireland.\"We have to do more to attract international flights to Belfast airports. Ways of bringing visitors directly into Northern Ireland have to be addressed.\"He called for reductions in air passenger duty and the development of new routes as tourism here \"could be missing out on as much as £bn a year\".\"Its easier to keep people in Northern Irelandthey arrive at one of our airports in the first place,\" he said.Gerry Lennon from Visit Belfast and Odhran Dunne from Visit Derry appeared before MPs at yesterdays Westminster committee hearing. Both agreed that more marketing was essential, but warned that resources were tight and more public sector funding is needed.Tourism NI, the organisation which handles marketing in the Republic, said it was not in a position to comment as it would be contributing to the committee at a later date.Tourism Ireland is the body responsible for marketing overseas."},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland catholic school population surges to record high","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Those moves are likely to prompt a vote on holding Mr Barr in contempt, and possibly the issuance of subpoenas — bringing House Democrats and the Trump administration closer to a prolonged battle in court.Even though Mr Barr informed the  he will not be coming, House Judiciary Committee chairman Jerrold Nadler said he will still hold the hearing on Thursday morning, raising the prospect of an empty witness chair.“I hope and expect the attorney general will think overnight and will be there as well,” Mr Nadler said.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Attorney General William Barr testying before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Capitol Hill As Mr Barr refused to testy, Democrats sought to speak to Mr Mueller himself.

Democrats on the  charged that Mr Barr was protecting President Donald Trump after he assessed Mr Mueller’s report on his own and declared there was not enough evidence that Mr Trump had committed obstruction of justice. Mr Mueller did not charge Mr Trump with obstruction, but wrote that he could not exonerate him, either.JUST IN: @HouseJudiciary Chairman @RepJerryNadler Statement on AG Barr.https:t.co rLCxApvQp— House Judiciary DemsMay , The standoff with the Justice Department is one of several fights House Democrats are waging with the Trump administration. Mr Trump has vowed to fight “all of the subpoenas” as multiple committees have sought to speak with administration officials or obtain documents relevant to his policies and finances. Democrats have signalled they will not back down and will take the steps necessary — including in court — to get the White House to comply.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has said she was not interested in impeachment, for the moment. But she told The Associated Press on Wednesday that “the threat of impeachment is always there”.Mr Nadler and the Justice Department traded barbs shortly after Mr Barr informed lawmakers of his decision on the hearing, with Mr Nadler saying the attorney general is “trying to blackmail the committee” by setting his own terms. Mr Barr had objected to the format of the hearing after Democrats decided to let staff attorneys conduct a round of questioning after lawmakers were done.Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said the staff questioning is “unprecedented and unnecessary”.Also weighing in on the matter of who would ask questions was Mr Trump. “They want to treat him dferently than they have anybody ,” the president told Fox Business Network’s Trish Regan on Wednesday night, adding, “You elect people that are supposed to be able to do their own talking.” Mr Trump said he heard that Mr Barr had performed “incredibly well” before the Senate .\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Senator Lindsey Graham holds up a copy of the Mueller report It’s unclear whether Barr will eventually negotiate an appearance with the House . Mr Nadler said he would not issue a subpoena for Mr Barr’s appearance on Thursday but would first focus on getting the full Mueller report, likely including a vote holding Mr Barr in contempt of Congress.While a contempt vote would make a strong statement, it is unlikely to force the Justice Department to hand over the report. A vote of the full House on contempt would send a criminal referral to the US attorney for the District of Columbia — a Justice Department official who is likely to defend the administration’s interests. But eventhe US attorney declines to prosecute, Democrats could pursue other avenues in court.In a letter sent to the committee late on Wednesday, assistant attorney general Stephen Boyd laid out a list of reasons that the department will not provide the full Mueller report or all the underlying evidence. Mr Boyd said the special counsel’s investigative files include “millions of pages of classied and unclassied documents, bearing upon more than two dozen criminal cases and investigations, many of which are ongoing”.Mr Boyd also reiterated that the department would not disclose secret grand jury material, another battle that could end up in courtMr Nadler decides to fight it."},{"url":null,"title":"why is a building in miami giving the west end and broadway a run for its money","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Exercise equipment lines some hallways. Nearby is living accommodation for  of the performers.Often dismissed in the past as second-tier, cruise entertainment has evolved to a genre that Royal Caribbean says commands some of the best talent and technology around.Several of the main characters in Mamma Mia are from the Broadway version of the show. \" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Performer Montana Moore dances during a rehearsal at Royal Caribbean’s entertainment training facility in North Miami While New York theatre has struggled to turn profits with its small, intimate venues, fickle crowds and finite real estate, the cruise industry’s onboard audience is growing exponentially.Royal Caribbean is building five ships in the coming years, each with a custom-built theatre with sophisticated stages and high-tech effects. A few years ago, they built a small plane with a -foot wingspan that now flies over the audience in every production of Flight: Dare To Dream.“The stages that they have on the ships, the technology is far better than it ever was on a Broadway stage, even  years ago,” said Greg Graham, who was the resident choreographer for Billy Elliot on Broadway before coming to the cruise line to choreograph Hairspray.Roughly , hopefuls showed up to recent auditions for Hairspray in New York and London.Weir said the casting operation is massive, culling talent from  cities a year auditioning nearly , performers last year alone.“At my audition there were hundreds of girls … it’s very competitive.

Well before the first Chinese arrived in June , British trade unionists were alarmed that a precedent was being set for the importation of cheap labour closer to home, and Britain’s ‘Non-conformist conscience’ was disturbed at the spectre of ‘nameless practices’ developing in compounds of young men separated from their families. ‘Chinese slavery’ would be a major factor in the crushing defeat of the Conservatives in the  general election.\"In Belfast, William Walker, Ireland’s best known Labour leader before Big Jim Larkin, made much of ‘Chinese slavery’ in his efforts to become a Labour MP in Belfast North.

The ferry is a real benefit to Strangford, it canrsquot be a liability.Cllr Enright claimed that the DfI ldquoin order to save on staff costs, have not been using the queuing area on the Strangford side.During a recent meeting of Newry, Mourne and Down Council, roads officials confirmed that they were evaluating introducing an earlier morning sailing from Portaferry to Strangford.Councillor Gareth Sharvin said he was also concerned about the regular traffic congestion in Strangford after being contacted by local people caught up in the weekend traffic jam.He said: ldquoI donrsquot understand why there is ferry traffic congestion when there are good ferry traffic lines around the harbour.

The event was finished off by further prayers and hymns with soup served to all.The call for the Church of Ireland community to boycott the event was ignored as several additional ministers attended the event for the first time.Former Bishop Trevor Williams, recently retired from the Church of Ireland diocese of Limerick and Killaloe and former rector of Newcastle, said he felt it was important to attend the event.ldquoThe Christian message for me is one primarily of love and concern for others and on this Good Friday thatrsquos precisely the message, the cross of Jesus Christ and what he gave to the world, he said.ldquoJesus said love one another as I have loved you so that is the importance of this day. We learn most from those who are dferent so this walk today gives us an opportunity to realise that each of our traditions have something to offer, each has something to learn from each other.Church of Ireland minister, the Rev Adrian Dorrian from the Lecale group of churches, said he felt it was important to attend the walk.ldquoWe have a similar walk of witness in Downpatrick today, he said. ldquoBut, given the coverage this year and the protest letter which we disagree strongly with, we wanted to show support.

After all it is a peace walk and itrsquos about peace, reconciliation and hope and we all have to learn from one another. Surely that has to be a great thing In welcoming the walkers to St Paulrsquos, the Rev Brian Cadden said: ldquoIt is a real sense of joy today, despite dferent expressions of the Christian faith, that we can come together to share the most basic aspect of our faith which is the death of Jesus Christ on the cross.St Malachyrsquos parishioners, Harry and Margaret McCartan from Newcastle, have attended the walk for years.Mr McCartan said why there were there: ldquoTo bear witness with our Christian neighbours, thatrsquos what it is all about, he said.ldquoThatrsquos exactly it, this is nothing to do with politics, added Mrs McCartan.He continued: ldquoWhy be a Christianyou are afraid to show it Gerald King from Annsborough said he attended the walk due to recent newspaper coverage.ldquoI came today after seeing that letter because them men are wrong, he said. ldquoLove one another as I have loved you, thatrsquos what this is about.St Malachyrsquos parishioner Mary Steele, who walks every year, said: ldquoItrsquos been lovely and peaceful and calm.

It is understood that it could be early July before this work is completed.There have been a series of issues associated with the regeneration scheme to provide new paving, street lighting and furniture in Irish Street with the initial start date delayed as Phoenix Gas took longer than expected to complete its work at this part of the town.Signicant issues have now arisen with the foundations for the blast wall which surrounded the former police base, but of major concern is problems with the sewer network.A series of frenetic phone calls to politicians and NI Water were made recently after raw sewage flowed out of an old section of piping for over a week.Businesses say they have been told that major sections of the sewer network need replaced and that contractors recently discovered that one large section of the sewer was completely blocked with concrete and has most probably been like this for decades.All businesses have reported a downturn in trade since work in Irish Street started and a temporary one-way traffic system was introduced, while there is concern that a number of parking spaces have been lost and that the width of the main street has been substantially narrowed in places.Calls have been issued for a rates reduction given the impact the work has had on business with traders highlighting that the delay in completing the scheme, ironically designed to help attract more shoppers, is outside their control but has had a signicant impact upon them.Mr Alan Oakes, of Plus  Print, said the sewer outside his business collapsed for eight days, with main contractors apologising for what was happening.ldquoTrade has been poor since the works started on January  and with further realistic delays forthcoming, we donrsquot know what the future might hold, he said.ldquoOne business in Irish Street has now closed, traffic is at a standstill, deliveries are impossible and collection from businesses is a nightmare while footfall is at zero. The management of the entire streetscape has been disastrous from day one and now more delays are anticipated.Mr Oakes said what concerns him most has been the lack of communication provided by Newry, Mourne and Down Council. He also fears that the sewage infrastructure in Irish Street is at breaking point.He added: ldquoWe are a family-run business with  yearsrsquo experience in the town and an employer. These past few months been very testing and dficult for all businesses in Irish Street.Another trader said that given the loss in trade businesses have experienced, they should be entitled to a rates rebate.He said: ldquoWe all accepted that the street upgrade was needed but the work was supposed to take three months. Now they are saying that it will be the end of June and even into July before it is completed. What is going on ldquoEveryone has taken a hit and, given that fact, we deserve a rates rebate. Business is hard enough without having to put up with this. We were told the work would take three months, but we will be into a seventh month before this over.A spokeswoman for the Department of Infrastructure said the Irish Street scheme is a project it is managing on behalf of Newry, Mourne and Down Council and the Department for Communities.ldquoThis is a full refurbishment of the existing streetscape, with the provision of new street lighting, street furniture and carriageway resurfacing, she explained.ldquoUnfortunately the scheme has encountered a signicant number of unexpected delays due to utility alterations and dficulties with construction around the old blast wall foundations at the PSNI station.The spokeswoman confirmed that in consultation with the contractor carrying out the work, it is now anticipated that further delays are ldquounfortunately unavoidable at this stage with the finish date of the main paving works now expected to be June .She also revealed that a full road closure will then be required to carry out resurfacing of the carriageway.The spokeswoman added: ldquoWhile we appreciate this unavoidable delay has caused concern, please be assured that all measures to expedite works are being taken.South Down MLA, Colin McGrath, said it was ldquodisappointing to learn that the completion of roadworks at Irish Street have been delayed until the end of June.ldquoWhile residents and business owners will want to see the work completed to the highest standard, that this will be at the cost of another two monthsrsquo interruption which is disheartening. If the work can be completed ahead of schedule this would be welcomed, he added..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Work set to resume at old Downe  ","story":"BUILDING work on a new social housing project at the old Downe Hospital site in Downpatrick is due to resume in the near future.Contractors moved off site a few weeks ago after laying foundations for a number of new homes whichare being built on behalf of Clanmill Housing.An initial  homes are being built part as part of a major social housing project at the site where around  new homes could eventually be constructed.While concern has recently been expressed locally about the halt to construction work at the site,Clanmill has explained that there is a valid reason.The social housing provider said it is aware that work at the sprawling town centre site mdash which borders four main roads mdash has ceased for a short period of time.ldquoThe developerrsquos subcontractor is awaiting the arrival on site of a piling rig to allow work to continue, she explained.ldquoWe appreciate the continued support and patience of local residents as construction continues and are looking forward to welcoming families to the first phase of the development later in the year as planned.The redevelopment of the former hospital site includes a range of housing types including apartments, two and three storey homes and bungalows.Itrsquos understood that the former hospital and canteen building behind it, which are both listed buildings, have been incorporated into the development plan as apartment blocks.The main entrance into the former hospital complex, off Pound Lane, will remain, while itrsquos understood that a new entrance is also proposed on the Ardglass Road side of the old Downe site.Downpatrick councillor, Dermot Curran, is pleased that the suspension to building work is only temporary.ldquoThe redevelopment of the former hospital site will go some way to reducing the number of people on the waiting list for social homes in Downpatrick, he said.ldquoThe Clanmill project is an eagerly awaited development. Not only will it provide much-needed new homes, but greatly assist with the social and economic regeneration of this particular part of the town. People are eager to see the first tenants move into their new homes and the transformation of this particular site.Cllr Curran said he is also pleased that tenants could be in their new homes later in the year.ldquoWe have a number of people on the waiting list for social housing who are classed in the urgent need category. They will no doubt be eagerly monitoring the progress of building work at the old Downe complex, he continued.Cllr Curran added: ldquoHaving viewed plans for the redevelopment of the entire site, I can say that they are particularly impressive and will transform what had become a blot on the landscape into a vibrant, and much-needed social housing development..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/ource srcset=/resources/images/9759945.jpg?htype=190\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"life without art would be empty and unsatisfying","story":"JC: What is your artistic background JC: What inspires your art JC: Is there a specic place that you do your work JC: What has been your most ambitious piece to date JC: What dferent artistic media do you use and which is your favourite JC: What are you currently working on JC: Do you exhibit your work anywhere JC: Any new artistic ventures planned for  JC: What are you up to when you arenrsquot painting JC: What does your art mean to you This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

eight, episode three of Game of Thrones. Directed by Miguel Sapochnik – who also helmed fan-favourite episodes including ‘Hardhome’ and ‘Battle of the Bastards’ – last night’s instalment ‘The Long Night’ was billed as one of the longest and largest battle scenes ever committed to film or TV.And while the episode was filled with explosive and grisly scenes of warfare, some have been complaining that they were straining to see the battle, due to the episode’s apparently darker-than-usual cinematography.One Twitter user wrote: “Tried to watch Game Of Thrones tonight but the episode was too dark to see anything. It sounded very exciting though!”Another said: “I’ve been watching ep for  minutes, still don’t know what’s going on it’s too dark.”Some have suggested that people could have solved the issue by adjusting the settings on their TV’s, with one person stating: “Did people forget they can increase the brightness and contrast on their TVs ”Another claimed it may have been due to the limitations of streaming services: “One of the reasons for the ‘it’s too dark’ complaints about the new Game of Thrones is because so many will be streaming it. Many streaming services are still poor when it comes to video encoding for dark scenes.”However, plenty of viewers seemed to have no problem and were left wondering what all the fuss was about“Turn your light off, close your blinds and stop whining,” one Twitter user wrote.Another said: “I saw what I needed to see. Arya kicked butt. And the red woman came back and helped. Theon protected Bran till the end. Jorah protected Dany.”“I guess its winterfell’s fault for not having proper street lighting,” joked another.Man dies after being hit by two vehicles in Hampshire town Cranleigh School opens new

It is no longer a cross-commmunity event, for a section of that community now feel excluded simply because they hold to a high view of the Lord’s Day.” He also queried what impact the race would have on Sunday church services across Belfast.The number of applicants to run the  miles has hit an all-time high of almost , this year. Organisers believe the rise is due to the move to a Sunday as well as cutting out a “tortuous” climb on the Antrim Road and avoiding Duncrue Industrial Estate, which had no supportive crowds. After reading Mr Thompson’s comments, Ms Alexander contacted the News Letter to say she was “delighted that finally someone with Christian beliefs has spoken out”. She added that Mr Thompson “is correct” in saying that the number of participants may well have increased, but that it is “no longer a cross-community event” as some Christians will now feel excluded.“I do feel excluded and would love to be preparing once more to compete in the Belfast Marathon,” she said. “For many years Belfast Marathon has been a highlight of my running le. In  and  I was fortunate to make the podium, claiming third overall female on both occasions.“In  and  I finished as the second Northern Ireland female behind Laura Graham. In fact last year I set a new personal best of : at the age of .”A Home Economics teacher, for many years she has taken pupils from Magherafelt High School to enjoy the fun run part of the marathon.“Last year we won the prize for the largest school group. The children, many of whom come from Christian backgrounds, have been very disappointed that this fundraising opportunity is now no longer part of the school calendar.Nellie joins centenarian club months after husband Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"“As a rule I do not race on a Sunday unless I am competing for my country. It is such a shame that this local event is yet another race which I cannot participate in. However, I feel that by not racing on a Sunday I am making a stand for my beliefs. “Let’s face it. The issue of competing on a Sunday has been a long lasting debate. Eric Liddell is the famous name which comes to mind.”Devout Scottish Christian Liddell refused to compete in his specialist distance of m at the  Olympics as the race was scheduled for a Sunday. Instead, he won gold when he entered the m instead, the story being immortalised in the film ‘Chariots of Fire’.“I am aware that those with Christian beliefs have their own stance on this issue and I do not hold it against, or judge, anyone who goes ahead and takes part on a Sunday,” Ms Alexander said.“Perhaps Wallace Thompson could be persuaded to organise an alternative marathon on a dferent day to help raise money for the Caleb Foundation ”She added: “I do want to add that I hope every runner has a good run and most importantly finishes it safely. I have many good friends in the running community and sincerely wish them all the best.”try catch  TrendingIf PSNI had shot gunman who murdered Lyra, the cry would be: lsquoshoot to killrsquoDr Philip

In recent years, that pattern has reversed, with turnouts of around % in both the Assembly and then the Westminster elections of .The last Assembly elections also produced disappointing results for the DUP and Sinn Fein. The DUP, facing unionist unhappiness at Peter Robinson and a host of unionist alternatives on ballot papers, saw its vote slip by four percentage points to %.Sinn Fein, facing frustration at its role in an unpopular Stormont system which was not seen to be delivering for nationalism, also saw its vote slip but by less, falling to .%.By contrast, those parties are now far stronger. As they confirmed their dominance over rivals and as politics tribalised further, Sinn Fein’s vote in the  Westminster election rose to .% while the DUP’s vote soared to %.Although council and Westminster elections are not entirely analogous, the gap between those sets of results means that eventhe DUP and Sinn Fein were to lose signicant support since , they could still make signicant council gains across Northern Ireland.The count could be protracted in some areas, especiallythere is an increased turnout, meaning more votes to be counted.The final result is unlikely to be known until later on Saturday with Belfast, as the largest council area, likely to be the last council to declare.Although voters are electing councillors – whose responsibilities are centred on bin collections, leisure facilities, planning andbuilding control – the results will be signicant to the question of whether Stormont s.Hidden crisis at Northern Ireland’s key electricity control centre – SONI – revealed Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"The election is also the first electoral test of two new nationalist offerings – Aontú, the pro-le republican party set up by former Sinn Fein TD Peadar Tóibín, and the new SDLP-Fianna Fail alliance.The Ulster Unionist Party had a relatively good election in  and will be attempting to hold on to those gains, despite having lost votes in other elections since that point. Alliance will be attempting to hold on to its  councillors but also expand its support base by standing in areas much further away from its eastern heartland.It will also be signicant for the smaller parties – the TUV, the Green Party, Ukip, the PUP and People Before Profit, attempting to retain their support in the face of the DUP-Sinn Fein juggernaut.Ann Watt, head of the Electoral Commission in Northern Ireland said:“The  councils across Northern Ireland play an important role in the delivery of local services. The  councillors elected will make important decisions on issues that affect everyone in their local area – from leisure services to recycling to food safety.”Polling stations will open at am and remain open until pm tonight. However, under a change to the legislation in recent years, should anyone be in a queue at a polling station by pm, they will be able to vote – evenit is past pm.Voters should bring photographic identication such as a passport or a driving licence with them.Polling stations will publish the number of ballot papers issued at midday, pm and pm.There will be overnight verication of the unused ballot papers ed from the polling stations but verication of votes will not begin until tomorrow morning with the councils to be ready to begin the count at am.The verication process will begin between am and am, depending on the council area, and will be followed by the counting of the votes.try catch  TrendingIf PSNI had shot gunman who murdered Lyra, the cry would be: lsquoshoot to

Dogs and their human companions are being invited to Dogs Trust Ballymenas Family Fun Day at the Ballee Playing Fields on May .All proceeds from the day will go towards the continued care of residents at the Rehoming Centre, located outside the town at Teeshan.This year’s event will also mark the first ‘Doggy Olympics’ which will be held by Dogs Trust’s Dog School team in Northern Ireland. This will include an Olympic Dash course which has fun challenges for owners and their dogs to complete such as the loose lead egg and spoon race, with prizes up for grabs. Owners can also enter into a ‘Best trick of the day’ competition.Other activities available will include a Doggy Dash, a raffle, ious stalls and Dogs Trust Tombola. There will be Canine Carers on hand to offer rehoming advice, free microchipping and a Dogs Trust Reunion.Dogs Trust Ballymena Supporter Relations Officer Samuel Reid said: “Everything we do is for our rescue dogs and we hope you and your four-legged friends can join us on the day and show your support. We can promise you a really fun day out for all the family, with lots of activities available throughout the day.“It’s a fantastic opportunity to meet local dog lovers and raise pounds for the hounds in our care as the proceeds from the day help us to care for dogs like five-year-old Lurcher cross Banjo , currently staying at the Rehoming Centre.”Banjo is a sweet-natured dog who loves attention, as well as walks in quiet areas and will do anything for a tasty treat. He would prefer to be the only dog in the house and could live with older children.”Entry is £ per adult and children are free but encouraged to donate one tin of dog food.

Three years on, operators Penarth Quays Marina and Vale owners have not agreed on a way to bring it back into operation. Gwynne Grfiths, chairman of the association, said: ldquoLoss of this amenity is particularly hard for those without access to a car who rely on public transport.ldquoThere is nothing mechanically wrong with the bridge. It was tested on February .ldquoThere appears to be disagreement between Penarth Quays and the Vale over the safety facilities needed to operate the bridge and minimise the impact on neighbouring houses and businesses.The Association is now campaigning for it to be reopened.A spokesperson for Penarth Quays Marina said: ldquoWe are obligated to operate the bridge based on an agreement made in , but the bridge was built to standards applicable in . Now, the bridge has several operational regulations like alarm levels ndash we canrsquot balance the high level of noise needed for a bridge and the low level needed for a residential area. This is the reality that the council have to consider and resolve.A Vale of Glamorgan Council spokesman said: ldquoThe swing bridge is maintained and operated by Quay Marinas, who manage the Penarth Quays Marina site.ldquoIt was closed due to a number of safety concerns, with upgrades needed before it can be reopened, including audible warnings.ldquoThe council is currently awaiting the outcome of a noise report following which our health and safety officers and those from Quay Marinas will discuss possible solutions which may enable the bridge to be reopened in the future. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

I get to give something back to the community, or rather put something into it.ldquoThe hospice is such a warm place to come to and the staff are all fantastic at making everyone feel welcome.Suzanne, who has previously visited the hospice with brother and Olympian Colin Jackson, said: ldquoItrsquos been a pleasure to officially open the new Marie Curie Cafeacute at the charityrsquos Cardf and the Vale Hospice in Penarth.ldquoMeeting the staff, volunteers and families and hearing stories about the care provided here for people living with a terminal illness has been inspiring.

So many people say lsquowhy wonrsquot the council talk to us \"Cllr Steffan William askedsports pitches could be ldquofenced off to prevent dogs walking on them, but the councilrsquos operational manager Colin Smith said this ldquocould be quite costly for the council.At the start of the meeting, Mr Smith said: ldquoWe know the majority of dog owners are responsible and we donrsquot want to limit them from the green spaces the Vale has to offer.There were also calls for more dog waste bins throughout the Vale at the meeting.Councillors heard there have been just six prosecutions for dog fouling in the Vale of Glamorgan in the past year.Cardf councilrsquos PSPO against dog fouling will see dog owners fined poundtheyrsquore found without bags or the means of picking up after their pets.But Mr Smith said: ldquoThe legal team were concerned it wouldnrsquot be lawful.

Surely it should be three strikes and out for this deal now And so on Monday, further indicative votes were held as MPs once again took control of parliamentary business ndash despite attempts by the government to shut down our debate before it started.Supporting the move to hold these further indicative votes on Monday, I said: ldquoI think Parliament made remarkable progress the other day in a few hours, compared with the Government, who have had two years to sort this out.\"It is important that we not only have the opportunity to make further progress tonight, but,necessary, a small amount of time on Wednesday to get to where we need to be, so that Parliament can take control and we can move forward together as a House.And so on Monday evening, there was a hugely signicant result placing a Peoplersquos Vote as the top option for resolving the impasse, with a Customs Union only narrowly missing out as well.I voted the same way as I did last week ndash for a Customs Union for a Peoplersquos Vote, and to revoke Article we face a No Deal Brexit.Itrsquos time for the PM to compromise for the good of the country.We all need to work together to find a solution.We need a credible Brexit option to be put to a public vote in a final say, with the option on the ballot paper to Remain, in order to find a way through this crisis. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentsSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

Surely it should be three strikes and out for this deal now And so on Monday, further indicative votes were held as MPs once again took control of parliamentary business ndash despite attempts by the government to shut down our debate before it started.Supporting the move to hold these further indicative votes on Monday, I said: ldquoI think Parliament made remarkable progress the other day in a few hours, compared with the Government, who have had two years to sort this out.\"It is important that we not only have the opportunity to make further progress tonight, but,necessary, a small amount of time on Wednesday to get to where we need to be, so that Parliament can take control and we can move forward together as a House.And so on Monday evening, there was a hugely signicant result placing a Peoplersquos Vote as the top option for resolving the impasse, with a Customs Union only narrowly missing out as well.I voted the same way as I did last week ndash for a Customs Union for a Peoplersquos Vote, and to revoke Article we face a No Deal Brexit.Itrsquos time for the PM to compromise for the good of the country.We all need to work together to find a solution.We need a credible Brexit option to be put to a public vote in a final say, with the option on the ballot paper to Remain, in order to find a way through this crisis. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentsSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

In England the local government budget has seen cuts that are twice as large as here in Wales and school spending has been much better protected.When I met Penarth head teachers I was honest about our choice to protect NHS spending.Health has consistently been the top priority of the public and I still face demands from all parties to spend even more money on the NHS.To deliver signicantly more money for schools and the local government budget would mean taking money out of the NHS.Keeping our commitment to the NHS affects every other public service, including our schools. That is the reality of nearly a decade of austerity.That does not mean that schools have been abandoned.For example the Welsh Government chose to increase funding to our st Century Schools programme. That means more new schools like the Penarth Learning Community and thanks to the budget deal secured by Labour councillors more money to renovate Victorian schools in the Vale.This year changes to teachers pensions by the UK Government have created a multi-million pound hole in school budgets. The UK Government only passed on  per cent of the costs to Wales. The Welsh Government funded the missing  per cent but that is money that canrsquot be spent somewhere .Despite the fact that local government in Wales has a much better funding deal than across the border in England I recognise that our councils have an incredibly dficult challenge setting a budget.We all saw that in the Vale, where nearly half the ruling Conservative group refused to back the budget proposal from their own leadership. There is a choice to be made between reducing services or raising council tax. Even after council tax rises most councils are still reducing services.Education and social services are the largest spending areas for local councils. Each council decides their own spending priorities and dferent councils have made dferent choices.The local funding formula for schools in the Vale was reviewed and simplied by the previous Labour administration and agreed by local head teachers. Itrsquos simpler and more transparent as a result.Itrsquos disappointing that the Vale Council leadership refuses to recognise that it has any responsibility for school funding choices. For example Cardf council has put a larger proportion of its budget into schools than the Vale.I welcome the Welsh Government review into the local authority funding formula. The wider review should provide an updated picture.However that in itself does not mean that there will be more money flowing into school budgets in the Vale.That still comes back to choices about how much money we are prepared to invest in our public services rather than a competition between public services that each of us value. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He shook my hand, and showed me some of the facilities.I was shown how the ldquoMagic Carpet works, an interactive board on the floor. It lit up with a flower pattern, that moved and shimmered when stood on.I was then invited to the soft play room, where Elias flung himself over the equipment, scampering above me and the assistant. He grinned for the camera.Ysgol Y Deri particularly shines in the creative approaches it takes to putting its students first.In the big school I was shown to ldquoThe Holodeck, a Star-Trek-esque room filled with projectors and touchscreen sensitive walls.There was a French quiz projected across the walls, and the students jumped around the room selecting the correct words.The sensory experience was not only impressively creative, but vital to some studentsrsquo learning.The school has many similar rooms built to offer a multi-disciplinary team approach to the youngsters and offer a fully holistic experience.They have a large team of therapists on site, including nurses, occupational therapists, speech and language therapists, physiotherapists, music therapists and play therapists.They also offer a huge range of interventions, designed to put their pupilsrsquo happiness and education at the forefront.They offer yoga, mindfulness lessons, climbing, gardening, wood work, pet therapy, rebound therapy and hydrotherapy, as just a small example. Timetables are crafted to suit inidualsrsquo needs, as some pupils respond better than others to certain lessons.I was shown to a classroom where a group of seven students worked on their laptops.These students were proud of their work and excited to talk about maths.We were then ushered through as a group for a photo with next doorrsquos class, a group with physical disabilities.The students waited patiently as overhead cranes helped those who could not walk into position.Everyone smiled. Thumbs and peace signs were flashed.Afterwards, a Learning Support Assistant tapped me on the shoulder and reminded me to take a photo of Caitlyn.I pointed the camera at her, and Caitlinrsquos smile immediately reached her ears.Maxine, a fellow student, told me how proud her family were of her and her work.The happiness of every one of the pupils is palpable, filling every area of the school, as does the pride of the teachers.ldquoWe have our pupils come back in every now and then, said Stacey Long, the schoolrsquos transition officer.She helps pupils move on from the school and into adult le.ldquoThey always tell me how much the school meant to them, how helpful it was in getting a job.ldquoWe try hard to get pupils ready for adult le where we can.ldquoWe have a coffee shop on campus where several students get plenty of work experience.The curriculum covers both the national curriculum as well as general le skills.One interactive quiz I was shown could be rapidly switched from a lesson on the Great Fire of London, to a quiz on which materials go in which recycle bin.There are plenty of extra-curricular activities on offer too, including choir and youth club and regular trips outside of school.I was given a glimpse into a gym, along with a music recording room with plenty of recording equipment, and the school radio room.Outside, pupils are given a huge playground with an outdoor classroom, space to play sport, a climbing wall and little walled off sections for each of the primary classes.Developer Barratt Homes was also on the site, building a sensory garden for students to enjoy.Last week a group of pupils of ying abilities went on a trip to Paris, where they were involved with ious Comenius [European Union education] projects and forged links with numerous schools in other European countries. Several pupils couldnrsquot wait to tell me about it, showing off photos.Chris Britten, the head teacher of Ysgol Y Deri, said: ldquoWe work with every child. They are all dferent and we treat every one as an inidual. We meet their needs so they can flourish, both in school and after they leave.

Especially being Cameroonian, living in a culture that isnrsquot mine, and with my kids growing up between two heritages.ldquoI didnrsquot want them looking down on one half of their heritage. I wanted to pay them a fuller narrative.No major publishers have picked up the books yet. ldquoI was disheartened early on in the process. One publisher advertised themselves as being very inclusive.ldquoI reached out to them but was disappointed by their feedback ndash all they said was a childrenrsquos book is  pages long. It felt like you can only be a BME authoryou conform to these standards. Really,yoursquore trying to promote ersity in publishing you should look outside the box!The books use the personal experiences of the boys as inspiration. ldquoTwo years ago we travelled around Europe. We found a caravan and went exploring, and the books have been inspired by our adventures ndash the first being Charlie the Fearless and Tancho the Brave.ldquoTheyrsquore all about courage, and being brave enough to admit when something scares you. They focus on looking out for one other, and how love makes you brave.ldquoA Place to Call Home deals with the anxiety of moving, and the unknown, as we travelled and settled in Penarth.ldquoTheyrsquore about making the best of situations ndash there are little anecdotes in every story, like the time we broke down in north France. It was the boysrsquo optimism that helped us through situations like that and I wanted to reflect that.The books are carried in Grfin Books on Windsor Street, Penarth on Amazon. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ulster Business GMcG is already a well-established and leading independent accountancy and advisory business, and the growing firm tells Ulster Business about planning for a brighter future, carrying out major investment and developing the next generation “Our success is about people, building and growing relationships, innovation and developing the next generation. We have a business that has very much enjoyed its own expansion and we want to shine a light on our next generation of young professionals”.According to Susan Dunlop, that’s a well refined mantra at GMcG Chartered Accountants. Susan is one of seven directors at GMcG, having joined the firm more than  years ago and who now heads up the firm’s Audit and Business Advisory Services department. Part of planning for the future has been the recent appointment of a new director in Audit and Business Advisory Services, together with an associate director who will head up the firm’s Corporate Finance department. Both are signicant investments at management level and a reflection of the firm’s growth and ambition across its three offices.“As a leading independent accountancy firm, many of our key strengths lie in our ability to get things done, through local decision making, management and accessibility of our people” Susan says.Accessibility is regularly acknowledged as being of great value to the firm’s clients and has become a key component of how the firm does business.“Business owners know they can lt the phone and speak to any of our directors, at any time of the day. For us, that’s just part of our client service, but our clients expect it and they know it can make a huge dference to getting an issue resolved quickly and effectively, allowing them to get on with running their business.”As local businesses face uncertainty and challenges across many fronts, Susan and the management team recognise the importance of being positioned as the complete business advisor and having the expertise, understanding and experience to deliver. “Businesses evolve through dferent circumstances and with dferent requirements. We need to be one step ahead, providing the right expertise at the right time. GMcG can offer this expertise through our service lines which include Audit and Business Advisory, Tax, Forensic Accounting and Investigation, Corporate Finance, GMcG Digital and International liaison, through our TIAG membership.” The firm delivers these services though a team of more than  employees across three offices in Belfast, Lisburn and Portadown. Having initially operated as independent firms in each locationthe GMcG evolution was completed in  when the three firms merged completely under a single GMcG brand. This was a signicant investment and transition for the firm.Gill Johnston, director at GMcG Portadown, says: “It was vital that we didn’t lose focus on the profile and client relationships we had developed over many years in each location. “So we are delighted with the success of the transition and how the shared systems and expertise are adding real value to client service delivery across each location”. GMcG services a broad client base from sole traders to large corporates, including a erse range of businesses and private iniduals, public and not-for-profit sector entities, as well as legal and other professional services practices.For Susan and the rest of the team, the firm’s independence and longstanding client relationships are what bolster the firm’s success.“We have a loyal and growing client base and are particularly proud of the fact that many of these relationships go back decades or transcend generations. We advise many of these clients on succession planning, helping them develop their business through the next stage of its journey. “In our experience, all of this is underlined by the importance of investing in client relationships, getting to know the client’s business, their issues, opportunities and the type of expertise they need.“It can be a long term effort and something that often demands dedication beyond a nine to five working day. But we always view it as a rewarding investment, especially when we see our clients thrive and grow.”As part of the firm’s growth and expansion, GMcG has undergone major investment in its overall strategy, its people, IT systems and recruitment.With no shortage of drive and ambition, it’s very much a case of ‘been there, done that’ for GMcG, having themselves undergone restructuring, appointed new directors, undertaken signicant investment, experienced dynamic growth and transitioned seamless succession planning.“We have done it ourselves, and been through it all,” Susan says. “We have grown our firm and understand many of the challenges and opportunities facing SME clients with real aspirations or plans for business development we have that insight and experience that has really proved valuable in advising many of these clients.”Building on these foundations, the firm today has a strong focus on developing the next generation of its service team. A younger generation of professional advisors are moving up the ranks in the firm, with other new faces joining the expanding management team.Nigel Moore, who started with the firm back in  as a trainee, has been appointed director in the Audit and Business Advisory Services department. Director Stephen Houston also started his career as a trainee and heads up GMcG’s Lisburn office. Robbie Milliken, who has more than  years’ experience across corporate finance and business banking, has also joined the firm to head up its Corporate Finance department.Susan is keen to acknowledge that GMcG is a firm that is proud of its working environment, and that career progression is part and parcel of its ethos.“We give employees every opportunity to progress through the ranks and be rewarded for their success, and we can point to two of our directors who commenced as trainees. We feel this is testament to the experience and environment we offer, and to our commitment to ensuring employees reach their full potential”. “Importantly, achieving the right work-le balance is something we facilitate and promote as much as possible across all grades.

The egg processing business includes big names such as Marks and Spencer and McDonald’s among its customers.Frylite, which started le when Eamon McCay opened a cooking oil business at a small Strabane premises, has seen its turnover increase to £m, with pre-tax profits sitting at £.m. He’s now grown Frylite from a small family operation to an Ireland-wide firm with more than  staff.And helping highlight the firms which are still based in Northern Ireland and retain ownership here, accountancy firm Harbinson Mulholland hosted its inaugural HM Homegrown event in Belfast.Showcasing the top  SMEs here, it highlighted that Northern Ireland boasts more homegrown businesses per head of population than Wales, Scotland and all regions across the north of England.And almost % of them operate in just three sectors – manufacturing, construction and wholesale retail. Of the list,  are based in Co Antrim,  in Co Down, nine in Co Tyrone, eight in Armagh and one each in Co Londonderry and Fermanagh.The firms earned just over £m in operating profit in their last reporting year on a turnover of £.bn, while almost £m in wages and salaries was paid out to , employees.  out of the  businesses are family-controlled.Professor Mark Durkin, executive dean of Ulster University Business School, which carried out the research, says the economic impact of the  companies “is considerable generating as they do £.bn in revenues and wages of almost £m”.“These companies act as key enablers of Northern Ireland’s entrepreneurial ecosystem, an ecosystem that Ulster University Business School is proud to be part of. The results of this research demonstrate that just because businesses are local in origin does not imply, they are not global in ambition that because they are from traditional sectors does not mean they are not modern in outlook. Indeed, local homegrown businesses have a sense of place and origin that can really create competitive advantage.“Northern Ireland has demonstrated its ability to sell its agri-food, manufacturing and construction products and services overseas, but internationally successful companies tend not to emerge in isolation. “Domestic competition drives innovation, efficiency and productivity improvements, which in turn develop businesses which can take on any competitor across the world. As a result, there is merit in Government identying the most appropriate ways to support the continued growth of successful clusters to help power the economy into the future.”And Darren McDowell, senior partner of Harbinson Mullholland said that homegrown businesses were the backbone of the practice’s client base.“The Top  list underlines the vibrancy of this group of companies and the spending power they give to local communities through employment.“Attention is often focused on other sectors, but this research demonstrates the continued importance of traditional businesses and industries to the local economy and the extent to which they can be successful.”There’s also a raft of multi-generational businesses here, which have kept both ownership and controlOne of those is food giant Henderson. It’s now in its fourth generation of the Agnew family, and is undergoing further expansion at its Mallusk headquarters. But while it’s very much a family affair, the company is now the sixth largest Northern Ireland business, according to last year’s Ulster Business Top  – with turnover of £m.Martin Agnew told Ulster Business: “It’s important for us as a family to continue to run our business with the same values on which Henderson Group was established by my great-grandfather, John Henderson. We’re also proud that we have built a sustainable business which continues to proactively develop and expand, and provides employment for over , people in Northern Ireland.”    More than  years ago, John Henderson set up a stall selling butter, eggs and cheese – he was a well-known figure and frequently was a judge of cheese and butter at the annual Balmoral Show.That subsequently progressed into a stall at St George’s Market in Belfast, and then in , the business was incorporated as a limited company.In , William Agnew married John Henderson’s daughter, and in  William joined the company as a salesman, taking a controlling interest when John Henderson retired three years later. A few years later in  John Henderson, founder of the company died at the age of .Now, the company owns a range of brands – notably SPAR and Vivo – and has spent millions in the last few years expanding its operations.Operating out of its head office in Mallusk, it employs , people across Northern Ireland.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/jm_1.jpg","title":"would you do a blind interview","story":"Posted on Friday  April  by Ulster Business Diversity and inclusion in the workplace has never been more relevant than it is today, writes John Moore, managing director of Hays Northern IrelandIn a recent global survey by Hays for International Women’s Day, we asked over , respondents on a scale of one to five how committed their employer was to achieving gender equality. Close to a thirdsaid their employer was less committed to achieving gender equality, with womenmore likely to believe there was a need for improvement, versus % of men. Only % of all respondents said their employer was committed to achieving gender equality, with men overwhelmingbelieving this to be the case versus % of women. There’s clearly still a long way to go.Most business leaders are well aware of the merit of employing a erse workforce. Diversity in areas including age, employee background, gender and religion affirms a message of inclusivity within the organisation and to a wider external audience, creating a strong position andHiring methods are an integral element of increasing ersity among employees, and CVs are one of the many ways in which the process can be improved. Many organisations will judge candidates based on their most recent job listing, potentially overlooking talented and competent applicants without a steady course of uninterrupted career progression. This can particularly disadvantage many women in professional sectors who have prioritised childcare at points throughout their career.Whether you believe it or not, we all have unconscious bias built in to our responses to others. So,you could eliminate those biases from the process, would you do so More and more organisations, including many here in Northern Ireland, now recruit based on blind CVs, where information such as age, race and gender is removed to prevent subconscious biases from influencing hiring decisions.Using competency-based application processes assesses essential soft skills such as communication, emotional intelligence, problem solving and self-motivation, rather than testing specic knowledge, which can be learned more quickly than soft skills. The absence of a CV can change the way you prepare questions and open interviews up to discussions that wouldn’t otherwise take place.Favouring competency-based applications or requiring blind CVs is a sign your organisation is taking steps to fairly assess candidates based on their skills and experience. These methods of talent-based hiring also demonstrate a commitment to overcoming the perceived disadvantage of career breaks which will positively contribute to erse representation across all sectors.The practice of blind hiring is not without its shortcomings. For instance a candidate’s personal information can only be withheld during the initial screening process. Once a line manager conducts a one-to-one interview there is no way to suppress a candidate’s gender, ethnicity or age. While applying the principle may result in a wider pool of first-round interviewees employers subsequently be faced with the same ersity challenges, for example, seeking graduates with a first class honours or a high :.At Hays we have trialled blind recruitment at assessment centres for a number internal of appointments. The absence of a CV opened up a depth of enquiry and supporting examples from interviewees where the receipt of a CV might not have encouraged the same level of enquiry and open-mindedness.Demand for transparency around targets and performance is also at an all-time high. So,your organisation is transparent in their ersity reporting, it proves their willingness to make a public commitment to achieving a fairly recruited workforce and makes them accountable for measuring and reporting their progress.  You’ll undoubtedly make some excellent new hires that you may not have appointedyou maintained your traditional processes.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/DEB.jpg","title":"debenhams pushes on with cva and store closures","story":"Posted on Friday  April  by Ulster Business Debenhams has launched its cost-saving plans as it reveals it will push forward with the closure of  of its stores next year, it has emerged. The struggling chain has entered into a company voluntary arrangement . It follows a pre-pack administration for the high street business. Five Northern Ireland Debenhams stores are continuing to trade, but it has confirmed  other stores will shut, outside Northern Ireland. It’s thought more than , jobs could be at risk. Debenhams is the anchor tenant at five shopping centres in Northern Ireland, including Newry’s Quays Shopping Centre, Ballymena’s Fairhill, Belfast’s CastleCourt, Craigavon’s Rushmere and Londonderry’s Foyleside. The firm’s earlier administration angered shareholder Mike Ashley, owner of Sports Direct, who has called for the process to be reversed. The administration wipes out the stakes held by Sports Direct and all other shareholders. The stores that are due to close are: Altrincham, Ashford, Birmingham Fort, Canterbury, Chatham, Eastbourne, Folkestone, Great Yarmouth, Guildford, Kirkcaldy, Orpington, Slough, Southport, Southsea, Staines, Stockton, Walton, Wandsworth, Welwyn Garden City, Wimbledon, Witney, Wolverhampton. Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, director Aodhán Connolly, says \"rising costs, a sluggish economy, and changing shopping habits are making le incredibly hard for the industry\". \"Those pressures are being exacerbated by ever-increasing public policy costs which are making it more expensive to employ workers and operate from physical premises. These factors will lead to a very dferent retail industry over the next few years. \"The challenges department stores face are a microcosm of the immense changes affecting the retail industry. As more consumers shop on-line, there is a challenge to encourage shoppers into stores, and then to get them to spend when they are there. One of the big trends we are seeing is retailers innovating to try and create a number of reasons for customers to visit the store. That can be through offering food and drink, dferent services, and by investing in customer service. The big advantage a physical retailer has is those trained helpful colleagues who can provide detailed guidance on products to help customers. \"It’s notable those retailers who have invested in evolving from purely physical retail to a multi-channel offering are those who are in the strongest position. Many of the larger stores are particularly affected by government policy which has consistently made operating from property more expensive.
