It has already affected the lives of nearly three million girls and young women across sub-Saharan Africa.Its CEO, Lucy Lake, who was with the sixth in line to the throne in Zambia, revealed to the Mail that she had briefed his wife privately at Kensington Palace earlier this year about their work in the country, as well as Zimbabwe, Ghana, Tanzania and Malawi.The Duchess was also met with Zimbabwean-born Angeline Murimirwa, one of the first girls to go to secondary school with the organisation\u0027s support and is now its African executive director. She was named last year as one of the BBC\u0027s 100 most inspirational women.Lucy said: \u0027We had the opportunity to meet with the Duchess in the spring.

Big fan of yours!’I replied, and for the next few months, we corresponded on a regular basis.We’d chat about everything from US gun violence (she shares my horror of it) to a charity trip she made for the United Nations to Rwanda, spinning classes, calligraphy, and our joint hatred of 4am filming call-times - hers for Suits and mine for Good Morning Britain in the UK.She even started sending me early preview episodes of her show so we could debate juicy storylines yet to air – which we did, at length.Meghan introduced me via cyberspace to another Suits cast member, Rick Hoffman - who played Louis Litt – and he and I also began to regularly correspond. He described their relationship to me as so close it felt like ‘brother and sister’.In February 2016, Rick came to London and at my invitation, he appeared on Good Morning Britain.Nobody really knew who he was here, nor Meghan for that matter, but we had a fun interview and I sent the photos to Meghan afterwards - who was thrilled by them.          When her co-star Hoffman was in London in early 2016, I had him on my show - even though no one knew who he was in the UK. They didn\u0027t know who Meghan was either thenMeghan and Harry set to stay with Kate and William at Anmer...\u0027She social climbed her way out of my orbit\u0027: Piers Morgan...Samantha Markle mocks sister Meghan over claims she wanted...Share this articleIn early June, 2016, she messaged me to say: ‘I’m in London for a week of meetings and Wimbledon. Would love to say hi!’I suggested my local pub, the Scarsdale Tavern in Kensington – ironically just a few hundred yards from where she now lives at Kensington Palace.‘Serena Williams sends her love,’ she texted on the day from Wimbledon, where she was watching her friend play in the annual tennis tournament. ‘You’re very popular as it turns out. Get you!’I don’t hear those words very often, so they made an impression…Then she turned up at the pub and we had a very enjoyable time for 90 minutes or so before I put her in a taxi to a dinner she was having with friends at 5 Hertford Street, a fashionable club in London’s Mayfair.She spoke very candidly about her family - there were some private, sensitive things she told me I would never repeat because they were said in confidence - Donald Trump (she’s not a fan), and of course, Suits.She asked me for advice on her career and the media, and if she could come on Good Morning Britain next time she was over, which I said I would arrange.From the cab, Meghan sent me a series of texts thanking me and saying she was looking forward to meeting up again next time we were in the same city.She even publicly tweeted about how nice it was to see her ‘friend’ – me – in London.So at this point, I was indeed labouring under the massive misapprehension that we were friends.I was wrong.She met Prince Harry at the dinner that night, went on a solo date with him the next night, and I never heard from her again.Not a word.I’d been ghosted.          She met Prince Harry at a dinner the night we met in person, went on a solo date with him the next night, and I never heard from her again. Or her costar. I\u0027d been used. They were just rudeAnd not just by her.At Meghan’s behest, Rick Hoffman ghosted me too.I didn’t hear from him again for 18 months, then he eventually crawled out of the woodwork after attending the big royal wedding last May.‘Piers! I am very sorry for not responding,’ he wrote in a lengthy message. ‘You must understand, once I heard the news, out of respect for Meghan, I couldn’t share a thing. Now I can share fun stuff! I would love to catch up at that favorite pub of yours. Hope to hear from you pal. Love you pal. Rick.’I didn’t reply, because no, I didn’t ‘understand’.A real ‘pal’ doesn’t ghost a friend for 18 months, right?That’s just rude.In fact, I found the behaviour of the pair of them damn rude.I’d been ‘played’ by a couple of B-list actors, who were clearly just using me to advance their careers.           From the moment I read that Harry barked ‘What Meghan wants, Meghan gets! at staff in the run-up to the wedding, my heart sankBut when someone more important and influential came along, in the shape of Prince Harry, I was instantly dumped like a sack of spuds (that’s what we call potatoes in the UK).Now, on a certain level, I grudgingly admire the work.And frankly, who am I, a former tabloid newspaper editor, to take a dim view of such ruthless antics?But on another level, the whole experience left me feeling suspicious and cynical about Ms Markle.And nothing in her behaviour since marrying Prince Harry has alleviated those concerns.From the moment I read that he barked ‘What Meghan wants, Meghan gets! at palace courtiers in the run-up to the wedding, my heart sank.Because I fear that’s exactly what she’s used to getting.And anyone or anything that may not give her what she wants or gets in the way of her social climbing self-advancement gets discarded.Her first husband? Ditched as her Suits career took off.Her dysfunctional family? Banned from the wedding – all of them.Her poor old ailing Dad? Cut off and disowned for struggling to cope with media attention about his daughter.Meghan’s swapped her dreary, problematic old real world for a thrilling new fantasy world of the Queen, Michelle Obama and the Clooneys.Only her mother Doria made the cut to Princess Meghan’s AAA-list new life.          Her first husband Trevor was ditched as her Suits career took off          She ditched her family, cut off her ailing father and and only mom Doria made the list to Princess Meghan’s AAA-list new lifeBut pieces of work never change their spots.Now, there is a steady flow of negative stories streaming from Palace ‘insiders’ about Meghan’s alleged a antics.She was said to have ‘displeased’ the Queen by demanding an emerald tiara for the wedding.There are rumours of a growing rift with the Duchess of Cambridge, who was reported to have burst into tears over Meghan’s hostile behaviour during a bridesmaid dress fitting for her daughter Princess Charlotte.Kate was also reported to have complained about Meghan being needlessly unpleasant to a royal member of staff.          Now, there is a steady flow of negative stories streaming from Palace ‘insiders’ about Meghan’s antics and rumors of a rift with the Duchess of Cambridge, who she reportedly made cry. Kate has also reportedly complained that Meghan is unpleasant to a member of staffMeghan’s personal assistant Melissa Toubati recently quit after just six months in the job after also being left in tears.Royal courtiers are said to be already ‘fed up’ with her domineering and dictatorial attitude that involves daily 5am email demands and even led to her apparently insisting on air fresheners to hide the ‘musty odour’ of St George’s Chapel, Windsor Castle.It was an absurd request that was very firmly denied.When Palace ‘insiders’ start leaking this amount of damaging mud, you can be certain that much of it is true.And given my unfortunate experience with her, I’m afraid I’m not remotely surprised.It’s got nothing to do with sexism or racism, as some ridiculous commentators have suggested.No, I think it’s far simpler than that: Meghan Markle is a self-obsessed professional actress who has landed the role of her life and is determined to milk it for all she’s worth.

Ryan Coogler\u0027s superhero sensation has already notched countless records, pulverized box-office myths and set new marks for inclusivity. And now, \u0027Black Panther\u0027 is in line to shatter Oscar norms, too.All of this year\u0027s contenders have by now screened, and Oscar prognosticators generally have \u0027Black Panther\u0027 in, comfortably, as a best picture nominee. Both the pundit survey \u0027Gurus of Gold\u0027 and Hollywood Reporter awards analyst Scott Feinberg place \u0027Black Panther\u0027 fifth, behind front-runners \u0027A Star Is Born,\u0027 \u0027\u0027Roma,\u0027 \u0027\u0027Green Book\u0027 and \u0027The Favourite.\u0027 Gold Derby slots \u0027Black Panther\u0027 in at No. 7, still easily within the category\u0027s range of up to 10 nominees.   It\u0027s also up for Ryan Coogler\u0027s direction, for Joe Robert Cole and Coogler\u0027s script, Kendrick Lamar\u0027s song \u0027All the Stars\u0027 and Michael B. Jordan\u0027s performanceMuch is still in flux in the Oscar race ahead of Thursday morning\u0027s Golden Globes nominations. But unless something drastic happens, \u0027Black Panther\u0027 will next month become the first comic book film to be nominated for best picture and easily Marvel Studios\u0027 most significant Oscar contender ever.That\u0027s very good news for ABC\u0027s Feb. 24 telecast which is coming off an all-time low of 26.5 million viewers. Some 55.2 million watched \u0027Titanic\u0027 sweep the 1997 Oscars, and producers have long harbored dreams of another big-tent blockbuster pulling viewers to a broadcast increasingly dominated by independent films like \u0027The Shape of Water,\u0027 \u0027\u0027Moonlight\u0027 and \u0027Spotlight.\u0027 Usually, bigger movies mean bigger ratings.For the makers of \u0027Black Panther,\u0027 it\u0027s a new chapter for a film - with more than $1.3 billion in ticket sales, the third-highest all-time domestic gross and the biggest box-office hit ever directed by a black man - that has already filled record books. What does Coogler think of \u0027Black Panther\u0027 as an Oscar movie?\u0027Fortunately, I don\u0027t have to think about it that much,\u0027 the 32-year-old filmmaker of \u0027Fruitvale Station\u0027 and \u0027Creed\u0027 said in an interview. \u0027I\u0027ve grown to have close relationships with my collaborators, so I care about the crafts people who work on the film and the actors who work on the film. Because of those relationships, I\u0027m happy when they\u0027re happy. It\u0027s always nice when people are recognized for their work. But beyond that, I really don\u0027t worry about it.\u0027 The film is also in the running for Ruth Carter\u0027s costume design, the cinematography of Rachel Morrison and Hannah Beachler\u0027s production designYet few films will be watched more closely through awards season than \u0027Black Panther,\u0027 which is also in the running for Ruth Carter\u0027s costume design, the cinematography of Rachel Morrison (who last year became the first woman ever nominated in the category), Hannah Beachler\u0027s production design, Coogler\u0027s direction, the script by Joe Robert Cole and Coogler, Kendrick Lamar\u0027s song \u0027All the Stars\u0027 and Michael B. Jordan\u0027s supporting performance.\u0027Black Panther\u0027 has already been at the center of the uproar over the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences\u0027 short-lived plans to institute a \u0027best popular film\u0027 category. The academy\u0027s move was intended to rope in more box-office hits to the broadcast, but critics said such a category would potentially ghettoize films like \u0027Black Panther\u0027 from the prestigious honor of best picture. (Coogler declined to address the category\u0027s scuttling.)While superhero films have dominated multiplexes for the last decade, the Oscars have been famously resistant to them. Ten years ago, \u0027The Dark Knight\u0027 earned eight nominations but missed out on best picture, prompting the film academy to expand the category the following year.   Coogler had a sense he wasn\u0027t alone in wanting a connection to the film, that others felt a need for it, too. \u0027But,\u0027 he says, \u0027I could never imagine to the extent that it did\u0027          With more than $1.3 billion in ticket sales, the film has the third-highest all-time domestic grossMany of the academy\u0027s members resent how superheroes have come to dominate the industry, but there have been some signs lately that anti-Marvel sentiment is ebbing. Last year, while \u0027Wonder Woman\u0027 failed to earn a nod, the Wolverine sequel \u0027Logan\u0027 became the first superhero film nominated for best adapted screenplay . This year, best animated film may also be a superhero battle, with \u0027Incredibles 2\u0027 and \u0027Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse\u0027 among the favorites.But the awards campaign for \u0027Black Panther\u0027 is predicated less on its superhero DNA than on its cultural impact and on its personal nature as, despite its budget, an auteur film by one of the most widely respected young filmmakers in Hollywood. \u0027Black Panther\u0027 last week for a day played for free in arthouse theaters nationwide in an event put on by Art House Convergence and Film Comment.George H.W. Bush\u0027s service dog Sully visits his casket in...Grateful George W. and Laura Bush make a surprise visit to...Share this articleFor Coogler, making \u0027Black Panther\u0027 couldn\u0027t be more personal. It was a journey in finding his own connection to Africa. While developing the script, he visited South Africa, Kenya and the Kingdom of Lesotho - a tiny nation that inspired Coogler\u0027s Wakanda.\u0027In simple terms, the film is what brought me to the continent,\u0027 says Coogler. \u0027It was kind of a lifelong thing just to get there and see it. The thing that I found was a sense of identity as an African person. I found in those trips and through that research a definition for myself of what it means to be African. That was a question I was seeking as a filmmaker.\u0027Coogler had a sense he wasn\u0027t alone in wanting that connection, that others felt a need for it, too. \u0027But,\u0027 he says, \u0027I could never imagine to the extent that it did.\u0027\u0027Black Panther\u0027 arrived to feverish enthusiasm and debuted in the most resplendent and regal Hollywood premiere of the decade. It has been called \u0027a defining moment for Black America,\u0027 pop-culture myth-making at its best and the best big-budget studio epic in ages. Parents took their kids and kids took their parents in a groundbreaking generational event. Theaters were rented out.

One raid took place at an ice cream parlour in the city of Duisburg, western Germany this morning          In Germany the focus was on the western state of North Rhine-Westphalia, which borders the Netherlands and Belgium, and Bavaria to the south.

Raids took place across Europe and Latin America as dozens of suspected mobsters were rounded up      In 2016, a suspected \u0027Ndrangheta boss, Ernesto Fazzalari (left), was arrested after two decades on the run, fleeing a life sentence for murder. A year later, another suspected boss of the crime clan, Santo Vottari (right), was detained in Calabria having been on the run for a decadeThe organisation\u0027s tight clan-based structure has made it hard to penetrate, but police have made some in roads in recent years. In 2015, 163 people were arrested in a major crackdown on the notorious mafia gang, which by that time had become the most powerful crime organisation in the country.In another sting that year, police snatched assets worth £1.4billion from the \u0027Ndrangheta, which included more than 1,500 betting shops, 82 online gambling sites and almost 60 companies.  In 2016, one of Italy\u0027s most wanted mafia bosses Ernesto Fazzalari was arrested after two decades on the run, fleeing a life sentence for murder. The \u0027Ndrangheta member was captured in an apartment in a remote part of the southern region of Calabria.On the run since 1996, he was convicted in absentia in 1999 of mafia association, kidnapping, illegal possession of weapons and a double homicide linked to a bloody 1989-91 feud which left 32 people dead in his home town of Taurianova.His arrest was hailed by the government as a significant victory for the state in its battle against the powerful mafia group.Last year, another suspected boss of the crime clan, Santo Vottari, was detained in Calabria having been on the run for a decade.He was arrested hiding behind a trap door of a bunker having gone to ground over a 2007 massacre in Germany.  Vottari was convicted in absentia in 2009 of being one of the heads of an \u0027Ndrangheta clan whose feud with local rivals culminated in the Duisburg killings.He was given a prison term of 10 years and eight months, two years after he went on the run.Vottari was one of 31 people sentenced to prison terms in 2009 in connection with the Duisburg killings, which happened after a vendetta between two clans based in the same village, San Luca, spiralled out of control.The feud between the Nirta-Strangio and Pelle-Vottari clans reportedly began with an egg-throwing prank in 1991. Reprisals escalated after the killing, on Christmas Day, 2006, of Maria Strangio, the wife of clan leader Giovanni Nirta.          A view of San Luca village in the southern region of Calabria - the Italian heartland of the \u0027Ndrangheta crime clanThe feud was blamed for at least 16 deaths in total, with the killings in Germany bringing it to international attention.Giovanni Strangio was convicted in 2011 of being the mastermind and one of the authors of the Duisburg killings.He was sentenced to life in prison. Seven others were given life sentences linked to the feud at the same trial.Notoriously ruthless, the \u0027Ndrangheta has surpassed Sicily\u0027s Cosa Nostra and the Naples-based Camorra in influence thanks to its control of Europe\u0027s cocaine trade.The organisation is made up of numerous village and family-based clans based in the rural, mountainous and under-developed \u0027toe\u0027 of Italy\u0027s boot.The name \u0027Ndrangheta comes from the Greek for courage or loyalty and the organisation\u0027s secretive culture and brutal enforcement of codes of silence have made it very difficult to penetrate.But authorities claimed a major breakthrough last year when they captured Ernesto Fazzalari, whom they described as the last senior \u0027Ndrangheta fugitive still at large.                                                    It has surpassed Sicily\u0027s Cosa Nostra and the Naples-based Camorra in influence thanks to its control of the cocaine trade, and is the sole mafia organisation to operate on all continents, according to anti-mafia prosecutors.Despite the raids today, Federico Cafiero De Raho, Italian anti-mafia and anti-terrorism national prosecutor, sounded a note of caution, saying that they only scratched the surface of the powerful group, whose tentacles and illicit activities spread all over the world.Speaking in The Hague, De Raho said the arrests \u0027are nothing for \u0027Ndrangheta. There are thousands of people who should be arrested and billions of euros that should be seized.\u0027Wednesday\u0027s operation came a day after Italian police arrested new Cosa Nostra boss Settimino Mineo and dozens of other suspects in Sicily in a major swoop.Jeweller Mineo, 80, was detained along with at least 45 others just before he was due to be appointed official heir to notorious mafia boss Toto Riina who died in prison last year. "},{"url":null,"title":"When London really swinging","story":"    For a time, London in the Swinging Sixties became the centre of the universe.

Before last night, this would have been a simple motion noting the statement that could not be amended.Now MPs will be able to try and re-write it with amendments.  \u0027They will live to regret it\u0027: Furious Andrea Leadsom...Ex chief whip Mark Harper joins the 103-strong Tory revolt...Share this articleWhat can the new amendments be about? Amendments to the motion could try to give instructions to the Government on what to do next instead of simply accepting or rejecting the plan shown to them.This could be taking measures to avoid no deal, backing a second referendum, calling a general election or setting out new negotiating red lines for further talks in Brussels.Brexit supporters could also use it to try and tell the Government to pursue no deal.To have any impact at all, the amendments will have to win a vote of MPs.  When will the new amendments be debated and voted on? The law says the Government must produce its next steps motion within 21 days of a defeat on its deal. This is over the Christmas recess so it is likely to be debated sooner than that, sometime between December 12 and the last day of term on December 20.Speaker John Bercow will choose which amendments are voted on at the end of the debate.            Tory rebels took a major step toward giving Parliament control over Brexit by inflicting a huge defeat on the Prime Minister (pictured yesterday in Downing Street) last nightWhat will it mean if any amendments pass? The amendments will not have any legal force but a majority vote by MPs on what to do will have a lot of political power.Even if the vote is not in favour of current Government policy, Ministers could use it to change course - scrapping the current red lines in the negotiation to adopt a Norway-style Brexit or passing new laws for a second referendum. What do Brexit supporters think about it? Brexiteer MPs insist because the amendments are not legally binding, they officially change nothing. They say if Mrs May\u0027s deal is defeated, Britain is on course to leave without a deal under current laws.This is true, legally speaking, but ignores the political power of Parliament taking control with a vote in favour of a new course of action."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/10/11/01/51342ED700000578-0-image-m-40_1539218272000.jpg","title":"Young womans life saved Tinder date donates organ","story":"    Cheyenne HanLee, 22, met Gavin on Tinder after he \u0027super-starred\u0027 her.\u0027She was our shining star\u0027: Family remember \u0027beautiful and...Belgium\u0027s Dr Death proudly admits he has killed 140 patients...Share this articleShe was soon diagnosed with kidney failure, and in a heartwarming act of kindness, Gavin saved her life by donating a kidney to her.Cheyenne, from Santa Ana, California said: \u0027I never thought I would have found Gavin through this dating app, and now we are here and he\u0027s giving me his kidney – it\u0027s kind of crazy.\u0027Gavin added: \u0027She had a nice smile and talked a lot, which made it easy.\u0027When Cheyenne and Gavin first started talking, Cheyenne was in denial over how sick she was.She explained: \u0027When I first got Tinder, I didn\u0027t believe that I was sick because my illness is invisible. No one else, including myself, could see that I was sick but I could feel it.After Cheyenne collapsed during the pair\u0027s first year of attending college in San Diego, Gavin took her to the hospital to have her bloods taken.Cheyenne was told she was surviving on a dangerously low 2 per cent kidney function.\u0027Most people don\u0027t live to that point, I would have died in a few days if I didn\u0027t go to the hospital when I did,\u0027 Cheyenne explained.

Haemodialysis made me so exhausted, I wouldn\u0027t be able to function afterwards.\u0027After I started peritoneal dialysis, I felt a little better and sought out a support group, learning about kidney disease has helped me a lot.\u0027Cheyenne was told she needed a transplant very soon, and that was when Gavin stepped in.He explained: \u0027I already knew I wanted to get tested at that point, but I couldn\u0027t really do anything for a while because there\u0027s a process to get on the transplant list.\u0027Cheyenne added: \u0027I was really sick we didn\u0027t talk about the transplant – I just thought I was going to die.\u0027Once Cheyenne was more stable, Gavin went through the process of being tested and realised he was a match for Cheyenne.

Jones Jr (right) were both awarded Purple Hearts for their service in Iraq. In the image above, Burke holds Jones’ prosthetic leg, which he lost when his unit was attacked while on patrol. They are both part of a new project called ‘Depicting the Invisible: A Portrait Series of Veterans Suffering from PTSD.’ Artist Susan J. Barron said she did the project to give veterans a platform to express what it is like to have post-traumatic stress disorder, known as PTSD          Corporal Derek Butler (pictured) went to Iraq in 2008. Butler explained to Susan J. Barron, the artist behind the new portrait series, ‘Depicting the Invisible,’ that after returning home, he had a reoccurring nightmare about his fellow soldier and friend that died while they were on patrol. After Butler’s second suicide attempt, he got a service animal, a Pitbull that he named  Phoenix (pictured). ‘When I brought him home, the change was immediate. He gave me a purpose, a positive distraction,’ Butler said          Smoke shrouds the face of Specialist Justin Hebert, who was deployed to Iraq in 2006. He told Susan J. Barron, an artist who created a portrait series about veterans and PTSD, that ‘having three people killed in my company was rough,’ one of whom was a childhood friend. \u0027For two months all I did was wake up and drink first thing in the am and just drink until 3am,’ he said, adding, ‘To be perfectly honest I don’t like to talk about it’          Sergeant Renoula A. Trotter (pictured) is the only female veteran in the new portrait series, which is also a book. Trotter explained to artist Susan J. Barron that she joined the army after college because she wanted to be a medic. While she was stationed at Fort Drum in New York, she went away for a weekend with other soldiers and was sexually assaulted.  ‘A star solider RAPED me. Who is going to believe me?,’ she says in the image above. Trotter was then deployed to Afghanistan with her rapist, but didn’t report what happened. She said: ‘I didn’t want to be a victim or a whore for the rest of my military life’\u0027I set out on a mission to give these guys a voice. I set out on a mission to use my art as a catalyst for social change and to make a difference for our men and women in uniform when they’re coming home,’ Susan J. Barron, the artist, told DailyMail.com.‘What ended up happening is these veterans made a big difference in my life. They gave me so much.’Barron was delivering school supplies to military bases – an extension of a for-profit philanthropic enterprise that she once had – and started meeting women who had lost their husbands to suicide.‘I was inspired to do this show when I learned the fact that 22 veterans commit suicide every day mostly due to PTSD,’ she recalled. ‘I found that statistic just so appalling and so sad and I really wanted to use my art to shine a light on this terrible epidemic.’A US Department of Veterans Affairs’ report released in June stated that the average number of veterans who die by suicide each day was 20.Barron said that she was then introduced to veterans and ‘it really grew organically.’ She spent time speaking with the veterans by phone and learned about them and their deployment.Behind the suicide hotline: Operators reveal intense...Veteran Affairs Department reveals it won\u0027t repay 450,000...Trump Foundation donated ZERO dollars in 2017, just one year...Share this article‘Understanding what the experience was like to be deployed and to be in a war, and what was the experience that happened to them that triggered and started their PTSD, and then what were challenges coming home. So those were the things that I really wanted to focus on,’ Barron said. The next step was taking the stories and editing them to down to about 130 words, which was what could fit in the painting.‘I think that was probably the part that took the most amount of time and… the most difficult where I really, I really honed their stories,’ she said. By the time it came for her to photograph the veterans, Barron said she felt she knew them well. After developing the project in her mind, Barron said she worked on the series for about a year and half. The classically lit portraits, she explained, were in direct contrast to the brutality of the words.‘Each of the portraits, the subject is making direct eye contact with the viewer, which was very intentional,’ Barron said. ‘Because I wanted the viewer to not be able to look away – to have bear witness to these veterans’ stories.’          Staff Sergeant Joshua Sandor is pictured with his daughter, Emma. Sandor was deployed to Iraq in 2003 and said that their mission \u0027was to flush out Al Qaeda from the area.’ When his vehicle was hit by improvised explosive device, known as an IED, he \u0027suffered a traumatic brain injury.

He told artist Susan J. Barron that being in Iraq \u0027was an out-of-body experience. I made it home after what we saw and did. Just to survive is incredible. I look at life that every day is a gift. If I’m not getting shot at or being blown up… then I’m having a great day’          Specialist Dortrie A. Jones Jr., who goes by the nickname Bird, was 23-years-old when he was deployed to Iraq in 2006. Jones (pictured) had been in Baghdad for three months when his unit went on a patrol at 4am. ‘My Humvee hit a roadside bomb… My thought was to get away to assess our position. As I started to walk away my leg became unattached. I stood up to go assess the situation and my right leg came out of my pants.’ Jones lost his leg, and told artist Susan J. Barron that he wanted to be photographed standing with his prosthetic leg          Sergeant Russell \u0027Rusty\u0027 Carter (pictured) told artist Susan J. Barron that after 911 happened when he was in eighth grade, he  \u0027always wanted to be part of something bigger,’ and enlisted with the military when he was older. He was awarded a Purple Heart for his service in Afghanistan, helping pull his fellow soldiers to safety. In another incident, while his unit was helping another under fire, the truck he was in ‘went right off the bridge fifty feet down the ravine.’ Carter is paralyzed from the neck down for the rest of his life          Sergeant Mike Burke (pictured) was deployed to Iraq in 2006 at aged 23. He had been in the country for 15 days and was on his third patrol when an IED went off - instantly killing his friend who he had met at basic training. The explosion threw him fifty or sixty feet in the air and knocked him out. Burke could have gone home after that incident, but told artist Susan J. Barron that he signed up to give his life for his country and as he hadn\u0027t done that yet, he stayed and continued to serve in IraqThe portraits, which are large at 6 feet by 6 feet, are mixed media. Six of the images will be part of the art fair, Aqua Art Miami, taking place this week. ‘They’re layers. So the photographic imagery is printed on canvas and then there’s layers of paint on top of that and then they’re the layers of the graffitied stories over that and then several of the pieces also have collaged elements,’ she explained. She called the collaged elements ‘memories fragments: a way to visualize the images that the veterans often tell me they can’t get out of their head. They have these incredibly traumatic, violent images of war… As soon as their minds slow those images come flooding in. I wanted to find a way to visually sort of express that.’  When Barron photographed Specialist Dortrie A. Jones Jr., who goes by the nickname Bird, he told her: ‘I want to be standing with my prosthetic leg because there’s so much dignity in that.’In his portrait, Jones stands, his muscled arms in a flex pose, sweat dampens his shirt and he is wearing shorts, his prosthetic leg visible. Above him is his quote: ‘When you almost die 3 times you start living life to the fullest!’Barron said: ‘I never give any direction to my subjects – what to wear, how to be – I just ask them to come as they are and that’s how Bird walked in.’   In the book, which has the same name as the series, ‘Depicting the Invisible,’ Jones said, ‘I have PTSD. The PTSD is worse than the physical injury.’But four years of group therapy have helped him, he said.For Corporal Derek Butler, who served in Iraq in 2008 to 2009, what helped him with his PTSD was a Pitbull named Phoenix. Butler explained in his story that after returning home, he had a reoccurring nightmare of his fellow soldier and friend that died while they were on patrol.After Butler’s second suicide attempt, he got Phoenix. ‘When I brought him home, the change was immediate. He gave me a purpose, a positive distraction,’ he said.Barron said: ‘One of the things that he says in that portrait... back then the invisible wounds of war really weren’t thought of. It was so much easier to get support for something you could see. And I think that’s still the case. We have to change that. We have to bring awareness to the fact that invisible wounds of war are just as devastating if not more so than the wounds that we can see.’ Throughout his image, which is Butler with Phoenix, Barron also added the collaged element of dog biscuits – ‘a reference to his love for the dog.’           Specialist Ken Weinert (pictured) was a teacher’s assistant when 911 happened. He signed up for the military and was deployed to Iraq in 2004. His unit was tasked with finding IEDs and land mines, and then detonating them. He was in a Humvee when he was hit in the arm. ‘June 18, 2004 is my alive day. It’s the day I didn’t die.\u0027 He told artist Susan J. Barron that he doesn\u0027t celebrate his birthday, he celebrates his \u0027alive day\u0027          Specialist Craig McNabb (pictured) was a military police officer in New York City when 911 happened and his unit was stationed at Ground Zero. \u0027Right of the bat my PTSD started. I’d fill and stack up body bags. There were also a lot of bones and pieces of people. It was chaos.\u0027 He was then deployed to Iraq in 2003. Years later, he said he still has issues. \u0027People have no clue what you’ve seen, what you’ve been through, what you’ve had to deal with\u0027          After attending the funeral of young man he grew up with, Sergeant Kele L. Jones (pictured) enlisted in the army and was deployed to Afghanistan in 2010. He and his best friend came back home in one piece, but his friend committed suicide. He told artist Susan J. Barron: ‘I’ve been so dark. I know how he felt. I definitely love the guy. Now he’s gone’          Staff Sergeant Brian Torres was already in the army when 911 happened. He was stationed in Kuwait when his unit got the order to move into Baghdad. He told artist Susan J. Barron that he has \u0027a lot of survivor guilt. I have friends that lost their lives. I have a friend who’s a hundred percent blind for the rest of his life. Why didn’t it happen to me?’ He said it took him three years to get diagnosed that he has PTSDIn the series, there is only one female veteran depicted and Barron explained while she spoke with many women, they did not feel comfortable coming forward with their story.In her portrait, Sergeant Renoula A. Trotter is seated and wears ripped jeans. Her hands are clasped together covering part of her face, which is framed by her long hair.In the book, Trotter explained she joined the army after college because she wanted to be a medic. She was stationed at Fort Drum in New York, and when she went away for a weekend with other soldiers, she was sexually assaulted.‘A star solider RAPED me. Who is going to believe me?’Trotter was then deployed to Afghanistan with her rapist, but didn’t report what happened.‘I didn’t want to be a victim or a whore for the rest of my military life.’Barron said Trotter wanted to come forward to make it better for the next generation of women in the military. Trotter’s portrait includes the hashtags #msa, which stands for military sexual assault, #metoo and #ptsd.‘These veterans deserve a voice and they want their stories told. I wanted to give them a platform to do that,’ Barron said. All of the proceeds from the the first edition of the book, which is 100 copies, are going to Freedom Fighters Outdoors, a nonprofit organization that helps veterans with PTSD. "},{"url":null,"title":"Shocking moment cars bonnet explodes 80mph","story":"    The bonnet of a Volkswagen Golf is ripped off the front of the car as it travels at 80mph on the M1          It\u0027s catapulted into the sky as metal and plastic debris shower down on the carriageway near NottinghamMr Troth, from Rugby, Warwickshire, captured the incident while he was driving near Nottingham.The 48-year-old explained: \u0027Driving down the M1 this guy in the VW Golf forgot to close his bonnet, it could have been a lot worse if there were more traffic on the road.\u0027The video shows Mr Troth cruising on the M1 at 75mph, when the Golf appears overtakes him.Fears of vigilantes force police to stand guard outside home...Gone in 18 seconds!

She talks about her early working life, encounters in public toilets and fighting the label ‘iPhone artist’If the annual Turner prize may be seen as a rough-and-ready barometer of British art and British preoccupations, this year’s exhibition gives a fairly unambiguous reading of the cultural weather. Consisting entirely of work in film, video and moving image, it is devoid of those Turner prize staples of high jinks, daft humour and goofy provocation. Instead, its subjects include state-sponsored violence, fake news and the shattering limbo of being a refugee. One of the shortlisted artists, the multi disciplinary collective Forensic Architecture, uses techniques including investigative journalism to question the accuracy of an account by the Israeli police of a confrontation that led to two deaths in a Bedouin village in the Negev Desert. Another, Naeem Mohaiemen, has offered an oddly compelling film, lasting an hour and a half, centred on the 1973 Non-Aligned Countries conference, complete with archive footage of Madame Binh and Yasser Arafat. It is serious art for serious times, and feels completely right just now.The winner, announced on Tuesday night, was the 44-year-old Glasgow-based Charlotte Prodger, for a delicate, multilayered, poetic film, shot entirely on her iPhone. Compared with other shortlisted artists, it might seem domestic, interior – but it is no less political and no less of the moment. Filmed around her flat as she recovered from surgery, and in Scotland’s forests and on its simmering grey seas, it explores her own queer identity in a way that touches on deep history, wide-open landscapes and the politics of isolation and connection, separation and union, quoting from her own diaries as well as drawing on other texts such as Julian Cope’s The Modern Antiquary. When the prize was announced at Tate Britain in London, she sat completely still for a moment, stunned, while her proud dad leaped to his feet and cheered.Delighted and shocked, she is still trying to take in the win when we meet the next morning. The £25,000 prize money will come in handy. “I’ll be living off it – my rent, my studio rent, my living costs, my materials,” she says. Like the others who were shortlisted this year, her kind of work is not easily commodifiable. She is certainly not one of the handful of artists making a mint from the globalised art market.In her acceptance speech, Prodger made pointed reference to Scotland’s continued commitment to a free university education. Born in Bournemouth, she grew up mostly in Aberdeenshire after her father moved there to work as an engineer her mother was a secretary and researcher. She left school with two highers – not enough to get her a place at university. She took a couple of vocational courses (including one in photography) and did a variety of jobs: “I worked in a sandwich shop, a jumper shop, in the Kodak lab in a branch of Boots in Edinburgh, in call centres, doing data input, cleaning.” It was working as a life model at the Edinburgh College of Art that introduced her to artists and contemporary art. At 23, she got a portfolio together and applied to do art as a mature student. She studied at Goldsmiths in London and later, the Glasgow School of Art.Her film, Bridgit, takes its title from an ancient goddess of that name. At one point a voiceover talks of the alternative names for the deity, which, it says, have shifted over time and place. Bridgit’s is an unstable, contingent identity that nonetheless offers some hope of a matrilineal, non-patriarchal prehistory later, the film refers to the theorist, artist and writer Sandy Stone, who, via working as a sound engineer, built her own computer and worked with the lesbian separatist label Olivia Records. At another point, Prodger describes being a teenager in Aberdeenshire, working in a care home in the early 1990s, taking acid and ecstasy in her downtime, while, unknown to her, the musician and antiquary Cope was ranging over the neolithic sites of her home county, thick with standing stones and stone circles, which he described as “bang in the middle of the Great Mother’s heart”. Prodger was trying to work out how to be a young gay woman here were signs in the landscape that she had yet to read.The whole film, her most personal to date, seems to see Prodger searching for a place, feeling out of place, resisting being too carelessly placed. Her works, she says, always start with a sense of “how I want them to feel, rather than what I want them to do”. With Bridgit, she wanted it to feel subterranean. It is certainly very interior: there is a lot of material about altered states, the effects of anaesthetic, a feeling of being out-of-body. A lot about the body, in fact. There is a passage where she records her experience of public-lavatory confusions – someone yelling “There’s a boy in the girls’ toilets!” in a night club on a Caledonian MacBrayne ferry, a middle-aged woman hesitating on the threshold of the loos as she catches sight of Prodger, saying: “I thought I was in the wrong toilet there.” These episodes appear in the film without rancour, but now Prodger says that such encounters “are just relentless actually. It’s something that punctuates my life nearly every day now. It’s pervasive – though I don’t experience the levels of confusion that other queer people do. It’s exhausting, making it OK for people. I’ll be drying my hands and someone will come in and they will look embarrassed or ashamed. I feel for them. I want to make it all right for them. It’s a structural problem when everyone involved ends up feeling embarrassed.”Bridgit is a change in direction for Prodger. It is only the second work of hers in which visitors sit in the darkness and watch a large single screen. Previously, she has made multi-channel works on monitors often positioned at head height, arranged almost confrontationally in space as a sculptural installation. Watching Bridgit feels like being in Prodger’s head, or in her dreams. It opens with a view of her feet propped up on the sofa the camera rises and falls in time with her breathing. You never see her whole body, or anyone else’s. You might see a portion of her hand, or a bit of her furry hat. The self is fragmented into not just one subjectivity, but seemingly into several, offering the opposite of the certainty of a masculinist point of view. It reminds me of the Scottish poet and nature writer Nan Shepherd – a writer whom Prodger admires – saying that the better way to discover a mountain might be not to walk up it, but to walk around it, finding its secret places and crevices rather than its peaks.This intense subjectivity, or series of subjectivities, arises largely from the way it was shot – on her iPhone. Despite its shiny, glassy, factory-made optimism, the iPhone is, she says, “a filthy format – smeared and grubby”, almost an extension of her own body. She films all the time, as life goes on. Part of the split of her nature is a love of friends, and a desire for solitude – the phone means no crew, no hassle and complete privacy. At times Bridgit has a passing family resemblance to that most ubiquitous of domestic phone outputs, the cat video (a black cat huddles in the warmth and light offered by a desk lamp, Don Cherry playing in the background).She doesn’t like, however, being labelled an “iPhone artist”. “It’s just not a thing for me,” she says. “For me, it’s just another format.” In her time she has shot on everything from 16mm to HD, and has ransacked old TV footage from the internet. She is interested in playing with the possibilities of these different formats. Shooting on iPhone has coincided with making her first single-channel works, which is a case of form and content coming together (previous work using a 4:3 ratio rather than the 16:9 of the iPhone was more suited to being shown on TV monitors). In any case, she says: “I’ve moved through a number of different formats just because I’m 44 and technology has changed.”She is not into digital as such, and indeed, claims to be an utter technophobe. “I can’t use WhatsApp, and I don’t really know what the Cloud is. My girlfriend has to set everything up on my phone for me.” At the same time, she enjoys working within the parameters and limitations of the iPhone (“I can’t cope with a lot of options,” she says), and will continue to use it for her next major work, which will be a film for the Venice Biennale next year, where she will represent Scotland. But she won’t do so slavishly. “In the Venice film there will be some things that the phone won’t be able to capture, so I’ll use video,” she says. A rare hint of irritation enters her gentle, peaceable, musical voice. “I just sometimes think: ‘Just stop talking about the iPhone.’”The Turner prize is at Tate Britain, London, until 6 January"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5d65b28ffe8b2289925b0f57121b576da4412b05/153_113_1135_681/master/1135.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a33b1881868805adb144569176e19810","title":"italy rules getty museum must return 2000 year old victorious youth statue","story":"Institution vows to defend ‘legal right’ to Victorious Youth statue discovered off Pesaro in 1964Italy’s supreme court has ruled that the Getty museum in Los Angeles must return a 2,000-year-old bronze statue it bought for almost $4m (£3.1m) in 1977.The museum has vowed to defend its “legal right” to the ancient Greek statue of Victorious Youth, also known as Athlete from Fano or simply the Getty Bronze, which was made by Greek sculptor Lysippos between 300 and 100 BC, after the court said it must be returned to Italy.The bronze statue was discovered by fishermen off Pesaro, on Italy’s Adriatic coast, in 1964, sold several times, and eventually bought by the American museum over 40 years ago.But Italy has always maintained that it was smuggled out of the country and acquired illegally, making its first formal request for its return from the US in 1989.After an 11-year legal battle, the supreme court rejected an appeal by the J Paul Getty Museum against an order from the Pesaro judge Giacomo Gasparini in June for the statue to be confiscated.Culture minister Alberto Bonisoli urged US authorities to act quickly on the country’s behalf to “favour the restitution of the Lysippos to Italy”.“I am happy that this judicial process has finally ended and the right to recover an extremely important piece of our country’s heritage has been recognised,” he added.Italy’s battle over the statue included a letter to the US president, Donald Trump, from art critic Vittorio Sgarbi calling on him to ensure its restitution.But the museum has refused to surrender the relic, saying it would appeal against the decision. The museum argued that the statue was discovered in international waters and pointed out that it was acquired by the museum nine years after Italy’s top court concluded there was no evidence that the statue belonged to Italy.“The court has not offered any written explanation of the grounds for its decision, which is inconsistent with its holding 50 years ago that there was no evidence of Italian ownership,” Lisa Lapin, Getty’s vice-president of communications, said in a statement.“Moreover, the statue is not and has never been part of Italy’s cultural heritage. Accidental discovery by Italian citizens does not make the statue an Italian object. Found outside the territory of any modern state, and immersed in the sea for two millennia, the Bronze has only a fleeting and incidental connection with Italy.”Experts dispute this. The fishermen who found the artefact sold it in Fano, a town in Pesaro province, to Italian art dealer Giacomo Barbetti. Barbetti kept the statue in his father’s home before it was transferred to the Umbrian town of Gubbio in 1965, where it was eventually sold to an unidentified buyer from Milan. The statue then changed hands several times before being bought by the Getty.“Italy has made a very clear and compelling case that the Lysippos was smuggled into Italy, via Fano, and therefore was later smuggled out of Italy,” Noah Charney, an arts professor who teaches each summer on the Arca postgraduate program in art crime and cultural heritage protection in Italy, told the .“Where it was first discovered, whether in Italian or international waters, is therefore a moot point.”Tristano Tonnini, a lawyer for Le Cento Città, an association leading the fight for the statue’s return, said he was convinced that the Getty museum of “always knew it was buying a smuggled and illegally exported artefact”.The statue is among the most popular works at the Los Angeles museum, but its legal ownership has been in dispute ever since Getty bought it from German art dealer Herman Heinz Herzer in 1977.The sum paid was nearly 800 times the $5,600 that Italian art dealers gave to the fishermen who found it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/605ae1f027e2eac5f0fef6d136d48aaed9102ba1/0_0_2000_1333/master/2000.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=ee2aa6b941460247457bbe3d1ed236a7 1400w","title":"boys love to pokemon british museum host major show manga","story":"Exhibition will be largest on the comic books and graphic novels ever held outside JapanBeautiful, heart-fluttering gay vampires are coming to the British Museum next year, possibly for the first time, in the largest ever exhibition of manga ever held outside Japan.On Wednesday the museum announced details of a major show devoted to Japanese comic books and graphic novels to be staged in its huge temporary exhibitions space.It will explore how the medium has become a worldwide cultural phenomenon and include a recreation of the oldest surviving manga bookshop in Tokyo.Nicole Rousmaniere, the show’s curator, said there was a manga out there for everyone, including “boys’ love”, “a very important part of Japanese manga”.“It is basically expressions of love between younger men and what’s interesting is that in general it is drawn by women and the audience is women,” she said.The show will include bestselling books such as Moto Hagio’s Poe Clan, a series from the 1970s about a family of vampanellas, or vampires, whose main characters are Edgar and Allan.“It is fantastic, it is romantic, it is heart-wrenching,” said Rousmaniere. “It is about outcasts. These vampanellas are outcasts … when they are uncovered they are killed, so it resonates with people feeling isolated or alienated.”Another is Keiko Takemiya’s The Poem of Wind and Trees, which was initially blocked by its publisher because it showed a little too much of the sexual coming together of its exotically named teenage characters, Serge Battour and Gilbert Cocteau, who meet at a boarding school in the south of France.The books are generally less about sexuality and more about romance, said Rousmaniere, and there are many theories about why Japanese women are drawn to the boys’ love stories.“Many people feel that in a way it’s safer for women, especially younger women, to fantasise about men. It makes them less embarrassed, it takes them outside of their own immediate reality.”The boys’ love stories are in Japanese but the museum hopes to translate some of them into English.There will be unprecedented loans from Japan for the exhibition, the museum said, as well as a rendering of the Tokyo manga bookshop.Rousmaniere was reluctant to give full details, preferring it to be a surprise, but it will be both digital and real, with people having the “retro experience of holding a book in your hand”.One of the highlights will be the loan of a giant curtain, the Shintomiza Kabuki Theatre Curtain, created in 1880 by the painter Kawanabe Kyōsai. Measuring 17 metres (55ft) and 4 metres (13ft) high, it features demons and ghosts and was originally displayed between acts at the theatre.If that is a little too old-fashioned for some, there will also be examples of anime and gaming that grew out of manga.For example Dragon Ball, a hugely successful adventure series adored by seven-year-old children, and Pokémon Go, a phenomenon the museum is used to given there are 16 characters to be found there. “It’s interesting,” said Rousmaniere, “we have people who are in their 70s looking for them.”Rousmaniere said the family-friendly show would not shy away from adult themes. “There is some horror. There’s violence. The horror could be disturbing. But when you have the Road Runner and Coyote, that gets killed every 30 seconds, I think children are pretty used to violence.”There would be a story for everyone, she said. “Anyone who enters this exhibition will become, by the end, fluent in manga. It’s better than going on an Open University course because you can do it in an hour and half and it will be fun.”The director the British Museum, Hartwig Fischer, said manga had forged a new international visual language and the museum was the perfect place for the show, given it cares for one of the finest collections of Japanese graphic art in the world."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/44b1828357a9aeeda350ffb41ff7d7e818b6a33e/84_118_1836_1101/master/1836.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5068bf91b41b2cdfab18733b4aa7307b","title":"british library alba amicorum renaissance facebook","story":"These 400-year-old books, soon to be seen at the British Library, were a permanent record of young people’s lives ‘that they could show off about’. Sound familiar?Age: From the Renaissance.Can you be more specific? Why’s that? Don’t you know when the Renaissance was?Of course I do, but it covers at least three centuries. OK, clever clogs: mid-16th century. About the time that young aristocrats and the children of the nouveau riche started to interrail around Europe.And what are they? Friendship books. These Renaissance youngsters, especially German and Dutch ones, would go around collecting autographs and tokens of affection from the people they met and liked in these beautifully embossed books. A cross between a diary, a commonplace book and an autograph book, they created a permanent record of some key period in a young person’s development, often their time at uni.Sounds sort of familiar ... Well, so says the British Library, which is putting much of its collection of 500 or so alba amicorum on show from 26 February.What is the selling point? Somewhat ingeniously, the library says the alba amicorum are effectively early versions of Facebook and Instagram, with Renaissance millennials getting signatures (one of the BL books bears the signature of King Charles I, equivalent to a Lady Gaga today) and sketches (read: selfies) of people they met, and then boasting about them.There is nothing new under the sun. That is very much the message. “Rather like today, they didn’t want those friendships to be a secret thing,” says the British Library chief executive, Roly Keating. “They wanted a record to be made that they could show off about and ‘share’, in current language.”A bit of spurious marketing hype by the library, perhaps? You are such a cynic. There is scholarly support for Keating’s view. “Social media is a late form of the book of friendship,” Dr Earle Havens, a curator of rare books and manuscripts at Johns Hopkins University’s Sheridan Libraries, told the arts website Hyperallergic in April. “Facebook is simply doing something that we’ve needed to do for a long time, which is capture the ephemeral nature of friendship.”To be confused with: Stammbücher, the German word for friendship books. The German states were the centre of the craze, although the thirty years’ war didn’t help (either friendship or autograph collecting).Do say: “Wonderful idea. I reckon there is a commercial opportunity for friendship books today.”Don’t say: “Isn’t this a bit recherché for Pass notes?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e5e91d3a74df95646135b7daf523b7b698238b54/0_117_4200_2520/master/4200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c64bb34af68aacdf7c27fb042a6da6f7","title":"new yorks strand bookshop begs to avoid official landmarking","story":"Much-loved retailer boasting ‘18 miles of books’ says city’s plans to legally recognise its status would entail expenses that might kill the businessNew York City’s most celebrated bookshop, the Strand, is a cultural landmark for locals and tourists alike, promising “18 miles of books” to its customers since 1927. But now the shop is battling attempts to make its landmark status official, saying the designation could destroy it.Run by three generations of the Bass family since it opened, the shop at the corner of 12th Street and Broadway is the only survivor of what was once known as “Book Row”, home to 48 booksellers in the 1920s. New York City’s Landmarks Preservation Commission is keen to declare the Strand a city landmark, describing it as “a centre of literary life in Lower Manhattan” and “an internationally recognised bookstore and destination”. But at a public hearing on Tuesday, owner Nancy Bass Wyden begged the commission to reconsider.“The Strand is the last of the great bookstores that were a hallmark of business development south of Union Square. We’re the last for a reason,” she said. “Please do not destroy the Strand by adding more bureaucracy and unnecessary expenses and restrictions, slowing us down just when we need to be our most impactive. In an attempt to preserve history, you may very well end up destroying a piece of the city.”The Strand says it needs flexibility “to do future upgrades and change with the needs of the community”, and that the proposed status would mean every repair and upgrade “would have to go through the slow bureaucracy of the Landmarks Preservation Commission” and cost money.The Strand’s position has been backed by writers including Art Spiegelman and Gary Shteyngart, who spoke at Tuesday’s hearing in support of Wyden’s position.“Without the Strand I would never have become a writer. The Strand is where I came to worship literature, to learn from literature … Those books made me a writer,” said Shteyngart. “It is a peerless cultural resource for New York City. It is a sanctuary. But like all remaining bricks-and-mortar bookstores, it is living in a fragile environment. If it doesn’t survive, the entire cultural ecosystem for downtown New York will be in danger.”The commission will make its decision in early 2019, according to the New York Post. A spokesperson told the New York Times that while most landmark designations are approved, “it is not a given, and the public hearing, a critical part of the process, is an opportunity for the commission to hear other opinions”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9491c0a69d6ee3e83f1a14de591f6e2fc4195882/25_122_1759_1055/master/1759.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ed96c4b9075373cf99efc862b72a78bf","title":"sir terry morgan resigns as chairman of crossrail and hs2","story":"Decision comes after he predicted he would be sacked from both roles ‘within days’Sir Terry Morgan, the chairman of Crossrail and HS2, who last week predicted he would be sacked from both roles “within days” due to delays and cost overruns, has resigned.The Department for Transport said Morgan, who became chairman of Crossrail in 2009 but had been in charge of HS2 for only four months, had stepped down from the senior posts.Morgan had become embroiled in a public row with the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, over Crossrail, an east-west railway through the capital that was due to open this year but is now delayed until 2019.The pair clashed after Morgan claimed Khan knew as early as late July that Crossrail would not be ready on time, with the mayor insisting he did not know of the delay until shortly before the postponement was announced on 31 August. The estimated final cost of Crossrail has ballooned this year from £600m to £15.4bn, forcing Transport for London (TfL) to borrow £350m.Whitehall sources told the  that the increase, announced shortly after Morgan took over at HS2, was among factors that convinced the government he was the wrong man to lead the construction of the UK’s second high-speed rail line.Morgan said last week that he expected to be sacked within days, just four months after transport secretary Chris Grayling said he would bring “world-class leadership” to the high-speed rail project.HS2 is slated to cost £55.7bn but has been subject to criticism and mounting concerns about cost overruns such as those that have dogged Crossrail. It is believed that Grayling and the chancellor, Philip Hammond, have since declared they have no confidence in Morgan’s chairmanship and urged the prime minister to remove him.Grayling said: “Sir Terry has been an integral part of Crossrail for almost a decade and I would like to thank him for his dedication and the expertise he brought to the role. I am also grateful to him for his work as chair of HS2 Ltd.”The shadow transport secretary, Andy McDonald, said: “While the boss of HS2 has resigned, passengers and taxpayers will be asking why the transport secretary Chris Grayling has not accepted any responsibility and why he is still in post.“Once again the Tories are proving themselves incapable of providing the leadership to deliver infrastructure investment on time or on budget.”Morgan will be replaced at HS2 by Allan Cook, a chartered engineer, former chief executive of Cobham and former government adviser.“It is a privilege to be asked to take on this crucial role on the UK’s biggest infrastructure project,” Cook said. “HS2 will transform Britain through the creation of jobs and skills across UK industry. It will improve connectivity and passenger experience as well as creating value for the UK economy.”A successor at Crossrail, which is overseen by Transport for London, is yet to be found."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bd7628d73c10e82d65c4cf8df2d907832d0721d1/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a7d5b42ab43d238d59c3562adf4673db","title":"kathmandu earthquake debt nepal","story":"Survivors of the 2015 quake that killed almost 9,000 people around Kathmandu now face another challenge they didn’t expectRatna Awale counts herself lucky. She and her husband, Prem, and their two sons survived the devastating 7.8-magnitude earthquake in Nepal on 25 April 2015 that killed almost 9,000 people.But her narrow four-storey home in Patan, a sprawling, historical city south of Kathmandu, was badly damaged. “There were big cracks from the back of the house to the front wall, and half the ground floor collapsed,” she says.The damage across the country cost Nepal an estimated $10bn (£7.8bn), cutting its already meagre economic output in half. The government subsequently offered hundreds of thousands of homeowners $3,000 (£2,300) each to rebuild their homes.The problem doesn’t stop with inidual homeowners. Durbar Square in Kathmandu is a stunning medley of Hindu and Buddhist temples, and a major draw for tourists. Many buildings, including the 18th-century Nautale Durbar palace, were badly damaged or destroyed.With the government heavily indebted, restoration in many cases is being provided for free by the Chinese and other countries. Though the Nepalese government has welcomed China’s help, Beijing’s influence over its small neighbour has risen dramatically. Some wonder whether it could lead to a so-called debt trap, as has happened in Sri Lanka, where the government has leased a key port to a Chinese company after struggling to repay it for building it.The challenges facing the authorities are enormous. Nepal is a mountainous country subject to chronic political upheaval, and only recently emerged from civil war. Repairing the damage from the earthquake is a monumental task and the $3,000 grants were never designed to fully cover the cost of rebuilding.“There are more than 820,000 houses eligible – the scale is massive,” says Siobhan Kennedy of HRRP. “It’s bigger than Pakistan in 2005 and Haiti in 2010 in terms of the number of houses that need to be rebuilt. In terms of scale, this is huge.”But just getting the money to those who need it can be difficult. “The biggest problem for us is that many people don’t officially own their own property,” says Rakesh Maharjan, an IT officer at the Earthquake Housing Reconstruction Project in Patan, which oversees the distribution of grants in the area. “They don’t have title deeds.”He says that in Lalitpur, the municipality that incorporates Patan, fewer than one-fifth of homeowners who applied for the government grant have received all three tranches.Authorities introduced deadlines that applicants had to meet to receive the payout. But that has led to unforeseen consequences: many homeowners are using the proceeds to hastily construct small, one-room buildings that are clearly unsuitable for families.For Santosh Maharjan, a 25-year-old student whose family began rebuilding their house in Patan last April, the biggest problem remains getting access to money.Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/08269dc241b0d12ab14b967388062d8955d7f6cb/0_574_4372_2623/master/4372.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=51ab63e9e43cc4d37f4b8f6dadcdc0c1","title":"rios squatter communities turn derelict buildings into homes in pictures","story":"As the city’s homeless population has grown, squatting projects have become more organised in an attempt to secure abandoned houses as homes for the poor.

But that would probably be annoying to the scientists, who surely adjusted for soul.This news is surprising because we assume that anything we mean to do yet don’t must be better for us than the thing we end up doing. Everyone means to go to bed earlier. Everyone means to get better at managing their time, so they are not shaking themselves awake at 6.45am because they forgot to put a wash on.

But the document, published today, does spell problems out in uncomfortably stark terms.No one is surprised to learn that the UK would not have a power unilaterally to dissolve “backstop” arrangements designed to avoid a hard border in Northern Ireland. That is what the backstop always meant. Still, it aggravates Brexiter displeasure to see the government’s own lawyer write that rule-taking alignment with the EU would “endure indefinitely until a superseding agreement took its place”.The published text makes the prime minister’s task in persuading MPs to back the deal that much harder, but that was no reason for it to have been secret. There is no constitutional principle that the prime minister must be spared embarrassment. Mrs May’s preference that the document not be shared was a point of self-serving political interest, not national interest. But there was, in the government’s resistance to publication, the kernel of a genuine dilemma. Parliamentary sovereignty can sometimes collide with the entitlement of ministers to receive advice in confidence that remains confidential.Transparency makes for better government, but transparency is not necessarily improved by a requirement to publish everything under all circumstances. If ministers expect their every written word to be shared with the widest possible audience, they will stop writing things down. Informal, un-minuted policymaking is not healthy for a democracy that expects matters of significance to be recorded. Those records make politicians more accountable for their mistakes and misdeeds.In this case, it was right that Mrs May’s government was held in contempt of parliament for refusing to publish that which the Commons had demanded to see. It should also never have required such an extreme measure. Labour’s Hilary Benn expressed succinctly the problem in the Commons – matters had escalated, the chair of the Brexit select committee said, as a result of “government’s marked reluctance to listen to the house, to trust the house and to share information with the house”. Last year, Mr Benn’s committee spent months trying to establish what risk assessments the government had made for different Brexit scenarios and then asking to see them. It met delay and denial. It is worth recalling that Mrs May did not initially think that parliament had a role in the activation of article 50 and was forced to seek Commons consent by a ruling of the supreme court. The provision of a “meaningful” parliamentary vote on final Brexit terms also had to be forced out of a reluctant Downing Street.This pattern reflects the closed methods of a prime minister who avoids sharing much beyond a tight circle of advisers. It is also a function of her having no majority. Fear of humiliation in whipped votes led the government to stop contesting opposition day debates, the theory being that Labour victories on non-binding motions are less shaming if the Tories don’t put up a fight. That tactic has backfired. This week’s defeats express more than opposition among MPs to Mrs May’s approach to Brexit. They are the culmination of brewing anger at her systematic disrespect for the legislature. The contempt is now mutual, a state of affairs that would damaging to any prime minister with a majority. For this prime minister in a hung parliament it could be fatal."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fb7536adf76b6e7bfb5f29f69dace7270251bd40/0_207_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8ee8b1618176d55f5432e420a9d70ed7","title":"how do you spend your time when youre stuck at home in winter","story":"With long nights and wet weather we’d like to hear how you stop yourself from going stir-crazy when you’re stuck at homeFrom Almaty to Zagreb, from London (England) to London (Ontario), the days are getting colder, the nights are getting longer and the clouds are getting lower.How do you cope when you can’t face the gloom, the rain, the wind or the snow, yet have already spent far too many hours at home?

It means emissions are heading in the opposite direction to the deep cuts urgently needed, say scientists, to fight climate change.The rise is due to the growing number of cars on the roads and a renaissance of coal use and means the world remains on the track to catastrophic global warming. However, the report’s authors said the emissions trend can still be turned around by 2020, if cuts are made in transport, industry and farming emissions.“The global rise in carbon emissions is worrying, because to deal with climate change they have to turn around and go to zero eventually,” said Prof Corinne Le Quéré, at the University of East Anglia,who led the research published in the journal Nature. “We are not seeing action in the way we really need to. This needs to change quickly.”The current Paris agreement pledges from nations will only limit global warming to 3C, while even a rise of 1.5C will be disastrous for many people, according to the world’s scientists. The International Energy Agency’s data also shows rising emissions in 2018. Its executive director, Fatih Birol, said: “This turnaround should be another warning to governments as they meet in Katowice this week.”“Every year of rising emissions puts economies and the homes, lives and livelihoods of billions of people at risk,” said Christiana Figueres, at the Mission 2020 campaign, who was the UN climate diplomat overseeing the Paris agreement. “We are in the age of exponentials,” she said, with renewable energy and electric cars expanding rapidly, but with the extreme weather impacts of climate change doing the same. “We have to ensure it is the solutions exponential curve that is going to win the race.”Prof David Reay, at the University of Edinburgh, UK, said: “This annual balance sheet for global carbon is comprehensive and scientifically robust. Its message is more brutal than ever: we are deep in the red and heading still deeper. For all our sakes, world leaders must now do what is required.”Harjeet Singh, at ActionAid International, said news of the emissions’ rise should galvanise those at the climate summit: “There’s way too much complacency in the air at these talks.”The “dark news” of rising emissions is merging with two other alarming trends, according to Prof David Victor, at the University of California, San Diego, in an article with colleagues also published in Nature on Wednesday.The Global Carbon Budget, produced by 76 scientists from 57 research institutions in 15 countries, found the major drivers of the 2018 increase were more coal-burning in China and India as their economies grew, and more oil used in more transport. Industry also used more gas. Renewable energy grew rapidly, but not enough to offset the increased use of fossil fuel.“There was hope China was rapidly moving away from coal power, but the last two years have shown it will not be so easy to say farewell quickly,” said Jan Ivar Korsbakken, at the Centre for International Climate Research in Norway.In the three years since the Paris agreement was signed, financial institutions have invested more than $478bn in the world’s top 120 coal plant developers, according to a report by the NGOs Urgewald, BankTrack and partners. Chinese banks led the underwriting of coal investments, while Japanese banks led the loans, the NGOs found.The global rise in emissions, even in rich, developed nations, is very concerning, said Antonio Marcondes, Brazil’s chief negotiator at the UN summit: “Emission reductions are like credit-card debt: the longer they are put off, the more expensive and painful they become.”Brazil reached its 2020 emissions targets early, but fears of a rise in deforestation under the new president, Jair Bolsonaro, could reverse this. But Le Quéré is optimistic that the rapid global rises seen in recent decades will not return: “This is very unlikely.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0dc013d9fa66b310c0ca28bd2783c520ce4b5ed8/0_0_1280_1890/master/1280.jpg?width=660\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f7103ea16155ec3b9f386839e1e81b81 660w","title":"beyonce ed sheeran and our expectations of men and women","story":"Why are people upset about the photos of Beyoncé and Ed Sheeran performing together? Michael, by emailAhh, to see a world in a grain of sand, as William Blake wrote. Just possibly, he was not referring to Ed Sheeran and Beyoncé, but also he possibly was. Who are we to impose limitations on genius? Anyway, last weekend, two of the biggest pop stars in the world, Beyoncé and Sheeran – Sheyoncé? Beeran? – performed Sheeran’s song Perfect together at the Global Citizen festival: Mandela 100 in South Africa. To use a rather au courant phrase, the optics were bad. There was Sheeran, looking as he always does, as if he just got out of a lock-in at the student union, and there was Beyoncé, looking as she always does, like a magical fairy queen from the land of Oz. She was wearing an extraordinary couture dress by the Lebanese label Ashi Studio that was really more ruffle than gown, on which the low-key part was the multi-layered extra-long train behind her. But, in case you are worried that all this frill and fabric meant Bey’s body was covered, allow me to put your mind at rest: beneath the ruffles was a mini-dress that was left frill-free at the front, so we could gaze upon Beyoncé’s thighs and cleavage. On top of that, there were the obligatory high heels, makeup and hair that looked as if it took at least four hours to style, and giant earrings. She looked, as ever, absolutely amazing.And then, standing next to her, warbling away, was Sheeran, who looked like he had just about managed to brush his teeth. So, while most of us accept to the point of no longer even noticing the absurd differences between what men and women have to do to look acceptable, the disparity here was so ludicrous that it verged on satire.Beyoncé and Sheeran have, if possibly unwittingly (although, again, far be it from me to impose limitations on genius, let alone Beyoncé) done us a favour. The two of them represent the extremes of their gender norms: he is the slob and she is the fantasy of ultra-high-maintenance femininity. By putting these two extremes together, they reveal a larger truth about the sexes. Let’s stick with the entertainment business for a moment, but go to what the kids might call a more basic level: British reality TV.As you might have heard, Holly Willoughby is standing in for Ant McPartlin and presenting this series of I’m a Celebrity ... with Declan Donnelly. Well, I say “presenting”, but what she is actually doing is modelling: every night, Willoughby wears a different cute little dress and funky boots combo (it’s the jungle, see), and cheerfully posts a photo on Instagram, whereupon the clothes instantly sell out. That she is standing in for a male presenter who is her professional equal provides us with a very convenient point of comparison. Ask yourselves: do you remember a damn thing McPartlin ever wore? Do you remember what Donnelly wore last night? Clearly not, because the clothes are not the point with them. But with Willoughby, the clothes are very much the point.The truth is, Sheyoncé looked like most heterosexual couples out on a Saturday night, albeit in exaggerated form. I remember going on a date in my early 30s, for which I did the pre-date bare minimum: I blow-dried my hair, had my eyebrows threaded and applied some makeup. Then, when I met up with the guy, I realised he hadn’t even brushed his hair. Women choose what they wear, and many love to dress up. But when the rules for what constitutes acceptable beauty are so fixed, and the pressure to look good is so overwhelming, where does choice end and obligation begin?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1a70f298acaf3f9c09e4d03125a25ee6aace8d9/0_21_4645_2787/master/4645.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ce1b393751630d71179a5408f0df5107","title":"a christmas less ordinary","story":"From the scorned vegetarian to the competitive card-maker, four writers reflect on their favourite bygone Christmases and unconventional traditionsOlia HerculesGrowing up in secular Soviet Union, south of Ukraine, Christmas was forbidden. My family never celebrated it. We put up our tree and opened our presents on New Year’s Eve, instead.But, when I was 10, in post-Soviet 1994, for Christmas, my family decided to take a pilgrimage to the tradition-laden Western Ukraine, a thousand kilometres away. We took a 16-hour train to get there, to discover our roots.We arrived to visit friends of friends on Christmas Eve. We were dropped off at a train station, in an outlandish location of dreams. For the first time, I saw a hill covered with a forest of Christmas trees with sparkling snow crystals.It was the mountainous area of the Carpathian Mountains.The friend of friends met us at the train station and said: “It’s not a long walk to the house, but there are no buses to take us there.” We said: “OK,” thinking it would take 10 minutes.Wrong. Little did we know, people who live in the Carpathians were used to walking or skiing everywhere. The “short walk” took an hour and a half in heavy snow.Exhausted, we finally arrived at a huge wooden house by a gushing brook, the sound of wolves howling in the distance. Inside, we were rewarded with a real traditional Ukrainian Christmas, full of colour. Guests wore beautifully made goat masks, violins were played and people were singing. The house was warm and cosy, with a roaring fire we stayed up by late into the night. We ate a traditional pescatarian feast: a mushroom borscht with wild mushroom-filled dumplings varenyky filled with potatoes and curd cheese local trout soft, yeasty buns called pyrizhky, filled with cabbage and prunes, and sweet ones filled with sweet poppyseed paste. It ended up being the most memorable Christmas of my life, and I long to recreate it.Stevie MartinWhile in most homes the giving and receiving of Christmas cards is a declining tradition, in our house – for my sister and I at least – it has evolved into a furiously fought competition. After the presents have been pored over while sat on my parents’ bed (I’m 30, my sister is 27, and we refuse to do it any other way), we give out Christmas cards. The rules are you can’t buy it from a shop, you have to make it yourself – and the loser has to make an extravagant breakfast.Gina, my sister, is an incredible artist. One year, she painted a picture of my parents. Another, she sketched an incredibly lifelike Father Christmas. Years ago, I figured out that I could win by making my parents laugh, seeing how little I could get away with. An A4 sheet of paper with a pine needle stuck on it using Sellotape above the words “HAPPY PINE-MAS”. Another year, I dribbled some gravy, drew a smiley face on it and dubbed the mess: “the gravy nativity”. Last year was blank, to represent the Holy Spirit.The only issue with this – apart from the fact that my cards get more traction than Gina’s, despite hers taking hours to create and mine taking roughly three minutes – is that I don’t know where to go after 2017’s blank card. It feels like I’ve reached the pinnacle of not caring. Do I give them no card? The world’s tiniest card? I suppose the only thing to do is go the other way – hire an artist and create an A0 canvas. Please pray for me – I’m terrible at making breakfast.Tom DugginsAs a vegetarian, Christmas sometimes feels like I’m under siege from otherwise well-intentioned friends and family who want to sneak meat into my food. If it’s not the yearly cry of “hang on, which gravy did we put the meat juices into?” (this tends to come mere seconds after covering my plate in the stuff), then there’s always the pleasure of arguing with my mum about whether the roast potatoes have to be cooked in goose fat or not. (No surprises on my position: olive oil and spuds go together like being vegetarian and only having one thing you can order on a menu.)That’s why, come 25 December, I like to focus on those parts of the traditional Christmas lunch that we can all get behind. Once the main course and pudding are all done with, there’s the vegetarian haven of the cheeseboard to look forward to.It’s like a culinary after-party taking place on your very own kitchen table. No one’s sneaking any sausage meat into the chutney or injecting pork grease into the soft cheeses and there’s no awkward discussion about who can have what, it’s just gorge time at the table and everyone’s invited.Christmas lunch tends to stress people out – getting the timings right is tough and there’s a lot of pressure overall. But with the cheese course, you’re ready to go in about five minutes: minimal effort for maximum satisfaction.Hayley CampbellAs far as I can tell, our only family Christmas tradition is pushing our oversized heads into too-small Christmas cracker hats until they split. We never wanted this tradition it was never planned. We have tried everything to get rid of it, short of having our skulls shrunk in questionable science experiments – such as balancing the hat on top of our spherical skulls and just not moving for the rest of the dinner, turning very slowly to address others at the table, the top of our bodies moving like Batman locked into his batsuit. But nothing works. The hats still split in two, or they topple into the gravy. It is an inevitability that we have given up dreading and merely succumbed to. If it’s just family at the table, we will turn the hats until the split is obvious, like a badge of big-headed honour. But we collectively fear work Christmas parties and being invited to Christmas dinner at other people’s houses. What if they make us put on the hats?Combining a creamy crumbly texture and mouth-watering garlic and herbs, Boursin is a welcome addition to any festive buffet – and a versatile soft cheese for your party season cooking, too.

Now Tom Cruise has set his sights on ‘motion smoothing’ – the TV effect that makes films look like soap operas – it’s only a matter of time before you tweak the settingsThis has been a landmark year for Tom Cruise. In Mission: Impossible – Fallout he made the action film of his career. He’s currently filming a sequel to one of his most beloved films, Top Gun. And it’s been rumoured that he has plans to make history by literally filming Mission: Impossible 7 in space.How on earth could Tom Cruise manage to top all this? Simple. He’s made a video urging you to switch off motion smoothing on your TV. For this, he deserves everything. Welcome back, Tom. We’ve missed you.At 9:46 last night, Tom tweeted an 87-second video in which he and his go-to director Christopher McQuarrie explained the concept of video interpolation and why it is the death of all good things. Video interpolation, they explained, is a digital video effect used to improve the quality of high-definition sport. “The unfortunate effect is that it makes most movies look like they were shot on high-speed video rather than film,” said Cruise. “This is sometimes referred to as the ‘soap-opera effect’.” They explained that most HD televisions come with video interpolation switched on by default, they explained how to switch it off, and then they both nodded with total sincerity.Now, it’s worth noting that Tom Cruise is by no means the first film-maker to rail against motion smoothing. Back when he was still the s of the Galaxy director, James Gunn tweeted that he, Edgar Wright, Rian Johnson and Matt Reeves were also peeved about the default nature of video interpolation, to which Reed Morano replied that she started a petition to fix the issue a number of years ago, to little avail.Why did it fail? Possibly because none of these people are Tom Cruise. Because Tom Cruise has made a career of total commitment. Take him to a premiere and he’ll spend hours on the red carpet, shaking every single hand until everyone’s happy. Put him in a movie with helicopters in it and he’ll teach himself to fly a helicopter to the level of a veteran stunt coordinator. Break his ankle on the side of a building, and he’ll stagger out of frame on his ruined legs rather than blow a shot.So you’d better believe that, if Tom Cruise wants you to turn off motion smoothing on your television, you will turn off motion smoothing on your television. This video is just the start. The next stage will be visiting your house personally and asking you nicely. After that he’ll visit your house and verbally threaten you. If you still haven’t switched off motion smoothing by then, Tom Cruise will force himself through your TV screen using willpower alone, like the girl from The Ring, grab the remote out of your dumb cow hands and turn off motion smoothing himself. He will do whatever it takes.The thing is, he has a point. Video smoothing is the worst. It’s too sharp and too cheap-looking, and undoes all the millions of dollars that go into making a film look nice. My younger brother Pete has a TV the size of his living-room wall, and he still hasn’t switched off motion smoothing. He invited me around his house not so long ago, to watch the Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson film San Andreas. And it was legitimately unwatchable. With video interpolation turned on, the whole film looked awful, like a kaleidoscope made of different types of migraine. Tom Cruise is doing a good thing here. He deserves our respect.Plus, you know, it’s just nice to see a Tom Cruise video appear online that isn’t somehow about Xenu. If nothing else, that has to count for something."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8f01f4bb5820b31f018a270a70901d7ec4661344/389_3512_6734_4040/master/6734.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7a31708e7c309acffd971e3af237f012","title":"gingerbread biscuits decorations recipe felicity cloake","story":"Gingerbread men are always a festive treat, for the tree and tummy alike, but why not mix things up this Christmas with stars, trees – or even a dinosaur?Forget glittery aubergines and hand-tied wreaths: the best decoration is an edible decoration, preferably homemade. Sweetly spiced gingerbread of the crunchy nut variety, rather than the sticky cake or crumbly Cumbrian kind, is the ideal material for stars and trees – or even the odd festive dinosaur. Decorate gaudily, tie with ribbons and try not to eat them all before the big day.Prep 20 min (assuming children might be doing this)Cook 10 minMakes about 30225g unsalted butter, softened, plus extra to grease340g soft brown sugar1 egg340g plain flour1 tsp baking powder½ tsp salt1½ tsp grated nutmeg1½ tsp ground cloves2 tsp ground cinnamon3 tsp ground ginger75g crystallised ginger or dried apricots, finely chopped225g icing sugar (optional)Hundreds and thousands (optional)Put the softened butter in a bowl and beat briefly to break it up. Add the sugar and beat again until there are no lumps and the mixture is well combined – you can use a wooden spoon for this if you’re feeling strong, or the beating tool on a food mixer, which will be quicker and easier.Break the egg into a cup or jug and beat with a fork to mix the yolk and white. Very gradually beat the egg into the butter and sugar mixture, a little at a time so it doesn’t curdle. If it does start to look grainy, don’t worry – just add a little flour to bring it back together.Put the flour, baking powder, salt and spices in a separate bowl and whisk to mix and help break up any lumps. Now stir them into the butter and sugar until the mixture comes together into a dough. Stir the finely chopped crystallised ginger or dried apricots into the dough as well.Spread a large rectangle of clingfilm on a work surface and put the gingerbread dough on top. Cover it with another large rectangle of clingfilm, then gently roll out with a rolling pin until the dough is about 3mm thick. Transfer to a baking sheet or chopping board, and refrigerate for 30 minutes.Meanwhile, heat the oven to 190C (180C fan)390Fgas 6 and lightly grease two baking sheets. Remove the top layer of clingfilm, cut out the biscuits using cookie cutters of whatever shape you like, then arrange on the baking sheets, leaving a couple of centimetres between each one, so they have room to spread out while they bake.Bake for 10 minutes. Make sure you have a skewer or cocktail stick ready and, as soon as you take the biscuits out of the oven, poke holes big enough to thread a ribbon through in the top – it’s important to do this when the biscuits are still warm, because if you wait until they cool, they will break.Very gently transfer the biscuits to a wire rack (they will still be soft, but don’t worry – they’ll crisp up as they cool) and leave to cool completely before you begin to ice them. If you put the icing on when they’re too warm, it will just run off.If you want to ice the biscuits, sift the icing sugar into a wide bowl to get rid of any lumps.

A few months into the reign of Unai Emery, the first post-Wenger season already looks like offering a more flattering reflection of Arsenal’s longest‑serving manager than the shared angst of his later years.Not that Wenger has been there to see it. It is a notable feature of his departure that this really has been a full stop. Wenger has been a ghost, an absence, spending his time being lionised in various exotic locales, doing TV work, and generally staying away from the reconditioned club he helped conceive, design and deliver.With encouraging results so far. If Sunday afternoon was the most energising experience at the Emirates for this new-build Emery team, Wednesday at Old Trafford represents the stiffest away trip yet, at a place where Arsenal haven’t won in the league since 2006. It is the next step in a daunting set of fixtures. As of last Sunday Arsenal have set off on a run of 11 league games to the start of February, five of which are Spurs at home, United away, Liverpool away, Chelsea at home and Manchester City away.Old Trafford is a huge occasion in that context, as it is in other, less tangible ways. Already there has been a shift here. Throughout the dog days of the Wenger years Arsenal were so often the fall guys in these heavyweight fixtures, extras in someone else’s narrative. But for the first time in a decade it is instead Arsenal who are the more fertile story here.There isn’t a great deal of interest left in this deathly Manchester United, beyond the exact detail and timing of what seems an inevitable exit for José Mourinho. This has felt for some time like another dead end, a process of entropy that has been in train ever since the departure of United’s own long-serving colossus.Talking of which, here’s an interesting idea. Perhaps Wenger left Arsenal in better shape than some may have wanted to see. It is a widespread mistake to assume Emery’s early success with this team reflects poorly on his predecessor, just as the agonies of David Moyes should reflect well on Ferguson.In reality there is a case that Wenger’s lack of pot-hunting sense, his obsession with processes and financial caution, indeed many of the things that brought such frustration towards the end, may have been perfect for succession planning, the ideal gift to his successor.If it has been easy for Emery to pull the loose threads and produce a team who are, with a little luck, unbeaten in 19 games then this is in part because he inherited an environment where the basics were already in place. The facts might not tally with the idea of Wenger running Arsenal into the ground. In reality he left the club with a strong squad of players, a fine and profitable stadium, an excellent training ground, sound recruitment structure (not all his doing) and good spirit with an absence of destructive egos. Plus, of course, no strings to bind his successor, no looming presence in the stands, just room to breathe and build from a sound base.Wenger gave a first-team debut to 10 of the 13 outfield players who beat Spurs on Sunday. He signed the league’s top scorer, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, whose movement was a striking contrast with that of Harry Kane in his current mode, which involves spending a lot of time walking backwards, reaching out with his hands for someone to grapple and spin off, like a man in search of the bathroom light switch late at night.Wenger also left some decent defenders and a good spread of age ranges, not to mention enough depth in midfield to allow Emery to become increasingly brusque with Mesut Özil. When Özil was awarded his new deal Wenger suggested this was the “cheapest” way of having a player of Özil’s type at the club. Which does overlook the option of hiring a handsomely groomed mannequin to sit on the bench or just not having a player of Özil’s type at all, which appears to be Emery’s favoured path.To his credit Emery saw instantly that this team needed a proper defensive shield. He is clearly a far better judge of that kind of player: Lucas Torreira has been a revelation, a different level of footballer to Mohamed Elneny, Francis Coquelin and other token Wenger-era midfield bolts.Emery has of course been helped in this by Sven Mislintat. The appointment of a head of recruitment may have irked Wenger at times but Mislintat is clearly an expert in talent ID, his presence making a strong contrast with United, where Ed Woodward and AN Other have presided over an increasingly scattergun process of spend and hope.These are the earliest of early days. But it does seem possible Arsenal might just avoid the angst-fuelled contortions of the immediate post-Fergie years, when the only really lasting gifts to the future were Moyes and a misleading final league title for an ageing, middling team. United are still strong enough to win on Wednesday night and ignite their own run through autumn into winter. But for Arsenal the progress made under Emery is still significant and a tribute to the structures already in place. Those more disgruntled supporters may well have “got back” their club but it still bears the stamp and shape of a manager who stayed too long, who became a little worn by the end, but whose departure has left hope rather than confusion in his place."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0a6b78a12ce81265d1cc5a6705a2e5ce5ba8674e/0_0_1000_600/master/1000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fc69c0fe306f6eff94d02a7e62e30a0e","title":"the 100 best female footballers in the world 2018","story":"Here are Nos 100 to 41 on the ’s list of best female players in the world.

This bravado is vital to their development. Combine it with a smartphone that gives instant access to a world of games and all sorts of video content, however, and you have a potentially tricky cocktail.“The internet is an amazing place and a wonderful resource, but, like all things, it has its dark side and its dangers,” says children’s commissioner Anne Longfield. “Parents have a vital role to play in making children aware of how to handle the challenges of being online.”Parents are understandably anxious and reticent about discussing some of these issues, but learning and behaviour specialist Noël Janis-Norton, who also founded calmerparenting, is adamant they should tackle the subjects early. “Don’t wait until something goes wrong,” she says. “The conversation needs to start before tweenagers even have a phone, so clear rules can be put in place.”It’s not a chat to be had on the fly either. “The more serious you can make the conversation feel, the more likely children will take it seriously,” she advises. “If there are two parents involved, both should sit down together, to make the message feel united.”Taking the issues seriously is one thing, but it’s important not to let the conversation become emotional or dramatic. “As adults we can really set the tone,” says chartered educational psychologist Dan O’Hare. “Do you want a child to learn that when they talk about subjects like this they make Mum or Dad scared and angry, or do you want them to learn that you can talk about difficult things together?”Dictating a list of how much screen time is allowed, or which apps are out-of-bounds, won’t work either. Instead, work together to agree a set of suitable guidelines or a contract – your children will be much more likely to stick to these rules. “Parents can learn a lot about the internet from their children, so it needn’t be a lecture or a telling off, but an exploration together,” says Longfield.It’s a view endorsed by O’Hare, who recommends that parents draw on the tricky online situations they’ve experienced personally. “If an adult talks about an upsetting post they’ve seen on Facebook they can then involve the child in discussing ways to deal with it. That collaborative coming together gives the young person a sense of responsibility.”How can parents know whether their messages and advice are truly getting through to their children? Janis-Norton recommends “think-throughs”, where a parent spends just a minute at a time encouraging a child to consider a situation and how they would respond to it. “Ask something like: ‘What can you tell a stranger online?’ or ‘How can you tell if somebody online is really a kid?’ to get your child thinking about things properly. Their brain will automatically start visualising what they should do, so it sticks in their mind much better.”Having set these guidelines, it’s vital that parents praise their children when they abide by them, such as by turning off their phones at mealtimes. “Parents can be so preoccupied that they don’t say anything when things are going well, and only notice when something’s going wrong,” says Janis-Norton. “Praise helps a child associate following the rules with their parents being pleased and there being a relaxed, happy atmosphere at home.”There’s a growing amount of practical tools that can help. The monqi phone management app creates a closed and entirely safe ecosystem that makes it easy for kids to get started online, using a handset such as the IMO S2 the app also enables parents to monitor what their children are up to online via their own phone, and set screen time limits. Then there’s the phone behaviour contract for families, created by tech expert Andy Robertson, and Childline’s Zipit app, which gives kids the tools to deflect unwanted online attention – with the help of downloadable gifs.Parents can take an active practical role here too. “It’s all very well telling a child to block someone on Instagram or report them on Facebook, but they need to know how to actually do it,” says O’Hare. “As adults we have a responsibility to learn how to do these things ourselves, so we can teach the children.”Of course, the discussion about online safety doesn’t end there. New tech, new trends and even new friends all bring fresh challenges that will need to be talked about and agreed upon. But by establishing open, relaxed ways of communicating about tricky issues, parents can keep healthy conversations going throughout childhood, into adolescence and beyond.Visit Tesco Mobile to find out more about the IMO S2 with monqi"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/841058cc8cd9af17a6167a3023c35614392e20a0/0_2_1960_1176/master/1960.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=890f10052caff9c4a2ae349b6c2a5d86","title":"legal analytics when big data meets big law","story":"Automated data analysis has changed how scientists think about health research, and is helping uncover inefficiencies in transport systems. Now it’s making waves in the legal sectorData is invading the legal system. In January, prosecutors in Germany presented a court with data from an iPhone suggesting a suspect was climbing stairs when it was alleged he had been dragging a body down a steep bank. It isn’t the only case of its kind: pacemaker data has been used in US courts as evidence against a wearer and data from fitness trackers has been used to indicate how, for example, a person’s lifestyle has changed after an injury.The amount of data being created by the devices people carry around has grown exponentially, and had a knock-on impact across multiple professions. For criminal lawyers, it has increased the potential evidence that’s available, and this increase in data has been mirrored across all branches of law. It’s a trend that has the potential to completely disrupt the legal profession. “The biggest impact,” says James Rogers, a solicitor at Norton Rose Fulbright, “will not be caused by big data alone – rather it will be the combination of big data with other innovations, such as artificial intelligence (AI) or distributed ledger technologies.”Data created through the legal process is already being digitised and combined with other tech. It has the potential to make the jobs of lawyers more straightforward. “We will be able to find pertinent cases more easily through better recommender systems that leverage machine learning,” says Wolfgang Alschner, an assistant professor in common law at the University of Ottawa. “Another area is document and compliance review, where computers can find patterns in large amounts of texts more reliably and quickly.”Everlaw, a legal tech startup that has raised more than $25m from Silicon Valley investors, is applying AI to historic legal reports to help lawyers prioritise and analyse documents. It is using computer science to visualise data from documents and predict the most relevant cases for lawyers to inspect.For such a system to analyse court cases and predict decisions, it needs data. But this has to be the right type of data. It needs to be easily read and understood by machines – scruffy handwriting can be tough to interpret, but clear check boxes on forms are easier for software to understand. If big data is machine readable, then AI systems can save the legal industry money and time.Rogers says it will initially have the greatest impact on areas that are “relatively formulaic and process- or volume-driven”. This includes disclosure, verification, first-tier due diligence review and similar processes. However, AI won’t be using data to formulate complex adversarial arguments at any point soon. “Human elements: intuition, judgment, emotion, memory, perception and so on, are all integral to that process,” he says.It’s already been proven that data can be put to work to speed up lengthy legal processes. In one instance, the UK’s Serious Fraud Office found itself with more than 30m documents to examine during a corruption investigation into Rolls-Royce.“The program was able to interpret and understand material from a range of sources, including emails, financial records, data tables and photographs – but, unlike a human team, it could work efficiently for days on end without interruption,” he says. The SFO won the case – its biggest investigation – and Rolls-Royce was ordered by a court to pay £497m, plus the costs of the SFO’s investigation.For the moment, AI and analytical platforms create an advantage for legal firms and clients that can afford to pay for it. But it also has the potential to democratise the sector. “It will make legal services more accessible to lay people by driving down costs and by fuelling the development of self-help applications directly targeted at non-lawyers,” Alschner says. “All this will transform the role of the lawyer and their day-to-day legal practice.”Stanford law student Joshua Browder has been pivotal in improving how legal data can be combined with technology to make the law easier to comprehend. He created a chat-bot “lawyer,” called DoNotPay, which allows users to contest parking tickets they have received. Browder says the system talks people through the legal steps required to make a complaint and automatically files their issue. It has won more than 400,000 cases. The DoNotPay system has since been expanded to tackle legal loopholes used when flights are booked, to help customers get automatic refunds.But there are some concerns around the use of big data. Data scientists, across multiple fields, have shown that automated systems inherit any bias that’s contained in the data they are trained upon. In some cases, AI has replicated racist and sexist language it has seen in data sets. Alschner argues that legal data needs to be freely accessible, while also ensuring that privacy laws are respected.“Law is a public good,” he says. “But most legal texts, from court decisions to filings, are only accessible through commercial service providers that do not generally share data in bulk.” The solution to the problem? “Large legal information providers can lead the way by sharing more of their data with academics, governments and legal analytics companies,” Alschner adds."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7bb1d4e5d4c1593500106dba8b5d92c7a7041a21/0_142_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bf43985a7fb660a8da53beb4032351b0","title":"community space council landlord kick us out","story":"In this series Poppy Noor discusses an issue concerning how we can build happy, well-run communities. But what do you think? Send us your thoughts and responsesWe run a community space and are being asked to leave by our landlord. Our hub has been home to many important charities and social enterprises, providing everything from community dance classes to communal lunches. But the space is lucrative and our landlord wants to redevelop it. In law it feels like there’s not a lot we can do – the landlord owns the property and despite us agreeing to all the rent hikes that have  been imposed, doesn’t want us to stay. We have fostered community relationships here and provided spaces and businesses that people benefit from (which we think  has contributed to the popularity of the area). As council services are cut back and funding to vital social services all over the city dwindles, social enterprises like ours are filling a really vital role in providing some of these services. We know the council  recognises this, too, and when we organised a big march it was very supportive.It just doesn’t feel right to kick us out. This is happening all over the country –  useful resources that are important to the community being forced out in order to turn a big profit there’s no support for the little guys. We are on the brink of being forced out, but think the role of the council should be to protect these facilities. Is there anything more we can  do to make it help?As you will know, this is a legal dispute that requires specialist knowledge, and for that you will need a lawyer who deals with landlord and tenant law. If there is anything untoward happening in this process, they will be the ones who can help you out.The council has been an ally. It has rejected development proposals that would turn the space into flats, so it sounds like it cares about what becomes of the building. But it doesn’t own the property, so its reach is pretty limited: this isn’t a classic case of a council shutting down a library it owns, or knocking down some flats.Still, exerting pressure can encourage a council to do the best it can: you saw this when you organised the march. There are tools that can be used, such as compulsory purchase orders, which allow the council to take the land over (or at least scare a landlord into using it in a certain way), but these are burdensome and costly, and have a very high bar for justification. Beyond just being a community benefit, for example, you would have to show there is no other way to deliver the service without the compulsory purchase. I’m not saying it’s impossible, but the council would really need to see the benefits of getting involved any more than it already is.Your other option is to turn the property into an asset of community value – which would also be decided by the council. This gives you six months to make the case for why the landlord should let you run the property, rather than it being repurposed.In the longer term, it’s a question about what you want your neighbourhood to look like, and it is the council that has control over this. “There will always be more lucrative uses of land. It’s hard to imagine a space that wouldn’t be more lucrative as a flat,” says public and environmental lawyer Sarah Sackman. The reason that doesn’t happen, she points out, is pretty much down to planning policy. Property law favours the owner, but planning policy is a hugely important tool for shaping communities. Sackman has worked on cases where spaces that make good neighbourhoods but don’t have obvious public benefit have been protected by the council: “It’s about having a hand in what you want your town to look like. And it’s probably the most powerful and imaginative lever you have.”• What do you think? Or have you got a question for Poppy and readers to consider?

But maybe it did have something to do in keeping her as long as I have, and thank God I have her. I do use other methods besides the medical world - I use electrical acupuncture, which is also a form of creating new stem cells. And I also use holistic medicine, which I\u0027ve found instrumental in one of my early illnesses that I had which other doctors couldn\u0027t cure, but this holistic doctor in Germany took away in two weeks.

On Wednesday, the home secretary, Sajid Javid, said it was “still his intention” to publish it this month – a choice of words opposition MPs met with groans and sighs.Defending the delay, Javid told MPs: “It’s worth keeping in mind that this is the biggest change in our immigration system in four decades. It’s important that we take the time and we get it right.”Javid also said freedom of movement would end, “deal or no deal” – in effect saying that while it was a key part of the deal, it was not strictly tied to what May was offering.He also said MPs had been given glimpses of what the post-Brexit immigration system would look like.The government is proposing a single immigration system that treats migrants from EU countries in the same way as those from non-EU countries. Highly skilled workers who want to live and work in Britain will be given priority.However, the government says the ability of people from abroad to deliver services and student exchange programmes will form part of future trade agreements.Javid said he would consider scrapping the current cap of 20,700 on highly skilled migrants as part of the post-Brexit vision.Applicants will need to meet a minimum salary threshold – for highly skilled migrants this stands at £30,000 – but Javid has hinted this will be reviewed.Successful applicants for highly skilled work will be able to bring their immediate families, but only if sponsored by their future employers.For tourists and short-stay business trips, the government is looking at developing a system of e-gate visa checks for all countries considered low-risk.Passports would be scanned in airports, train stations and ports. All security and criminal records checks would be carried out in advance of visits, in a US-style system."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2ccd10ff221f67a9c8f4d1212b29d2a527b3a875/0_4_1701_1021/master/1701.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6752e04a9b49db8194872866610cc2f3","title":"brexit debate pmqs legal advice may corbyn government to publish full legal advice at around 1130am politics live","story":"Rolling coverage of the day’s politics, as full legal advice released ahead of second day of Commons debate on Brexit dealHere’s some important news from the ERG meeting that’s currently taking place.The chief whip Julian Smith is set to speak at the ERG meeting later. Good evening to everybody reading and thanks to my colleague Andrew Sparrow. I’ll be updating the live blog on the latest Brexit developments throughout the evening.One person who doesn’t have much to say about day two of parliament’s Brexit debate is our former prime minister David Cameron. Meanwhile, the frantic behind-the-scenes lobbying continues. David Miliband, the Labour former foreign secretary, told LBC’s Eddie Mair show this afternoon that not holding a referendum on the Brexit deal would be a threat to the health of our democracy. Labour should embrace the idea, he said. He explained:I think that the movement inside the Labour party, amongst membership, is very strongly to say that the democratic health of the country, as well as its economic health, depends on getting this decision right. If we really want to settle this for decades to come, then we need to make sure that, whether or not you’re on the leave side or the remain side, what’s been voted for was anticipated, and therefore we embrace the trade-offs that are involved in it.I’ve heard people say, ‘Oh no, it would be anti-democratic to have a further referendum.’ I actually think the opposite. I actually think the danger now is that, since the deal on offer is neither one that leavers want nor that remainers want, the greatest threat to our democratic health is that no one gets what they want. That is, I think, very very damaging.That’s all from me for today.My colleague, Patrick Greenfield, is now taking over.The BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg has been interviewing Boris Johnson, the former foreign secretary and leading Brexiter.John McTernan, a former adviser to Tony Blair, wonders whether Boris Johnson is preparing for another U-turn.Michael Howard, the former Conservative leader, told the House of Lords in their Brexit debate that he could not support Theresa May’s deal. He saidI am not a natural rebel. I can count on the fingers of one hand the number of times that I have rebelled against my party in the 35 years during which I have had the privilege of serving in parliament and all of those were matters of hugely less importance. So I rise to make this speech with a heavy heart. But I was one of the 17.4m people who voted to leave the European Union and I did so because I wanted my country and its parliament to take back control over our nation’s future and its destiny.I am afraid that the agreement before us today does the opposite of that.Here is Arlene Foster, the DUP leader, on the attorney general’s Brexit legal advice.Ivan Lewis, who was elected as a Labour MP but who is currently suspended over misconduct allegations, is speaking in the Commons now. He says he is very sceptical about holding a second referendum. Those in the Labour party who are pushing the idea now and the same people who opposed the idea of having a referendum when Labour was considering whether to promise one in the 2015 manifesto, he says.He says he favours a Norway plus as the way forward.The Commons Hansard for today’s debate is available online here. It has everything said in the debate, up until about two hours ago, but it is being updated all the time.The Lords EU committee has published an 80-page report (pdf) on the withdrawal agreement. Among other concerns, it says that the joint committee that would oversee the agreement is too secretive. It says:The joint committee will be critical in ensuring the smooth working of the Withdrawal Agreement. It will be a uniquely powerful and influential body. Decisions adopted by the joint committee would be binding on the EU and the UK and would have the same legal effect as the withdrawal agreement. In particular, during the transition and for a period of four years thereafter, article 164 of the withdrawal agreement provides that the joint committee would have power to amend aspects of the agreement to take account of errors, omissions and deficiencies, and to address unforeseen situations. Even though changes that “amend the essential elements” of the agreement are excluded, this is a widely drawn power, and is not subject to clear scrutiny procedures or parliamentary oversight. Nor does it appear that the joint committee will operate in an open and transparent way. The relevant rules suggest that meetings would be confidential, decisions might not be published, and even summary minutes might not be made publicly available. This is an unsatisfactory state of affairs, given the significant role that the joint committee will play.In the Commons Nigel Evans, a Tory Brexiter, is speaking now. He says the UK is a leave country with a remain parliament. MPs should not tell the public that they must think again. That would generate real anger, he says.But he says he has concerns about the deal. He was opposed to the backstop, and has become even more hostile to it since he read the attorney general’s legal advice, he says.He also says that he he has heard talk that Theresa May could offer MPs a vote on whether the UK were to enter the backstop (as opposed to extending the transition - the other option available to the UK, under the withdrawal agreement, if a hard border in Ireland cannot be avoided by new customs rules.) See 1.23pm. But Evans says he does not want a vote on being able to enter the backstop what matters is being able to get out of it, he says.The Scottish parliament has overwhelmingly supported a motion expressing Holyrood’s opposition both to May’s Brexit deal a no deal Brexit.Following a similar vote in the Welsh assembly on Tuesday night, Holyrood voted by 92 to 25 to support the cross-party motion supported by the SNP, Labour, Lib Dems and Greens. The result was greeted by applause across the chamber.While Scottish Conservative speakers accused the SNP of trying to “weaponise” Brexit for their own pro-independence purposes, while attacking Labour and the Lib Dems for “caving in” to the nationalist agenda, the Scottish Greens co-convener Patrick Harvie suggested that the Tory opposition had more concern for the politics of the debate than the content of the deal.The Scottish government’s Brexit secretary Michael Russell said the motion was the result of a “unique collaboration” between four of the five parties in the Scottish parliament, and insisted that remaining a member of the EU is “still achievable”.John Redwood, the Tory Brexiter, has just finished his speech in the debate. The most interesting bit probably came when he took an intervention from Sir Desmond Swayne, a fellow Brexiter. Swayne said that, now that MPs have passed the Grieve amendment, the game was up for Brexiters. He said:Redwood said he hoped all MPs would agree that the referendum result should be implemented.There was some speculation last night that the passing of the Grieve amendment might make hardline Brexiters more likely to vote for Theresa May’s deal, because it would remove the prospect of the UK leaving without a deal, leaving Brexiters with a choice between May’s deal, a softer Brexit, or a referendum. As a theory it seems a little shaky (not least because the Grieve amendment may turn out to be not quite as consequential as some suppose - see 9.28am, 9.38am, and 10.33am), but Swayne’s comment suggests that at least some Brexiters are starting to think like this.Mark Harper, the Conservative former chief whip, is speaking in the debate now. In an article in the Daily  this morning he said that he would not support the deal, primarily because of the backstop. He wrote:Personally, I don’t think any UK prime minister should agree to such an arrangement, and I am not prepared to do so.This not only compromises the integrity of our country, but also breaches a promise in the Conservative manifesto, that the Conservative party would “ensure that as we leave the EU no new barriers to living and doing business within our own union are created.”Harper tells MPs that he is not an expert. He is just a “humble accountant”. But he says the full text of the attorney general’s legal advice to cabinet, released this morning, show that he is right to worry about new regulatory boundaries going up between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. He refers to this passage in the legal advice.Like Michael Fallon (see 3.50pm), he says May should go back to the EU and renegotiate the backstop.He also said that, even if the deal were to pass, the Conservatives would no longer be able to govern, because they would not have the support of the DUP and they would not be able to get their business through the Commons.With Fallon calling for changes to the backstop provisions (see 3.50pm), it is worth flagging up this Twitter thread from the ’s Europe editor, Peter Foster, explaining why he thinks the EU would never agree to change it. The thread starts here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f9b34a5bd51d25d5fe1adda234b3260c4b7b052d/0_0_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=436802c2a2ebd49ea2b88348fd924da3","title":"from plants to pets how to make your office a stress free zone","story":"Whether you bring dogs to work or introduce some greenery to your desk, these tips will help your workplace feel more relaxedNot every employer has the financial means for mass yoga sessions and relaxing off-site trips, but there are still ways to bring wellness to the workplace.“In simple terms, stress is the result of our mind preparing our body to respond to a perceived threat,” says Litzi Essler, founder of Happy Engine coaching. “The key word here is ‘perceived’ – as, in modern life, we spend a lot of time worrying about things that haven’t happened.” This can cause constant feelings of anxiety, as you prepare to deal with all the possible problems that may occur, she says.Whether you work on your own, you have a small business or manage hundreds of employees, making sure your colleagues and employees aren’t under undue levels of stress is critical to having a successful business. And it doesn’t have to break the bank.Scattering plants around the officeYou don’t need to be a botanist to realise the positive effect plants can have on an environment, and the workplace is no different. Plants that have been shown to have a de-stressing effect include aloe vera, peace lilies, bamboo palm, spider plants and rubber trees. Try dotting a few of these on your desk and around the office and see what the effect is on people’s moods.Allowing petsThe act of stroking a dog has been shown to increase levels of a hormone called oxytocin in both the dog and the human, while reducing cortisol levels in the person, too. Oxytocin is a happy hormone, whereas, cortisol is related to stress. So stroking dogs makes you happier and less stressed.At the UK Mars Petcare offices, dogs are a constant feature. “What’s amazing about having dogs in the office is the genuine relationship of support that can build over time between people and pets,” says Essler, who also works at a pet care company.“I often notice people taking short breaks in their day to stroke, cuddle or play with the dogs, which relieves their stress and over time builds a positive bond with the dog,” she says. “This unconditional relationship is extremely beneficial in challenging environments and often I see dogs seeking to comfort those who are having a difficult day.”Creating a stress-free zoneTaking time away from the threat – or perceived threat – that’s making you stressed has been shown to be one of the most effective ways to overcome it. This is why having a separate area that people can go to when they feel overwhelmed will help improve the wellbeing of people in your office. It doesn’t have to be anything fancy it might be a coffee area or simply a corner of the office with beanbags or cushions.Socialising“We’re only a small team, but spending time together outside of the workplace to relax, bond, laugh and reflect has improved productivity and team dynamics endlessly,” says Ben Barker, founder of cold-brew coffee company Artemis Brew.“It can be as simple, cheap and non-disruptive as you make it,” he says. His team has been to events such as escape rooms and independent film festivals, and it usually involves a beer or two afterwards.Playing musicMusic can be comforting, relaxing and it has been shown to increase productivity. Instead of having everyone listening to their own music through headphones, try playing music in your office to help people feel less stressed.“We have the radio playing in all areas of the building,” says Tracey Dawson, managing director at Daletech Electronics, a company with 14 employees.Or, if you’re in the mood for something a bit different, why not try a podcast?“We love having music on in the office, but more recently we’ve been putting podcasts on, too, which are a great alternative,” says James Gupta, founder and CEO at Synap, an online education platform.Communication is keyMaking sure everyone knows what is going on helps to manage stress, says Gupta. “At the beginning of every week, we have a team meeting to discuss what we’ll each be working on,” he says. “The development team get to see how their work is being received by customers, and the sales team have an understanding of when new features are likely to be available.”Provide healthy snacks“We try to encourage active, healthy lifestyles, so we supply free fruit and we have a company lunch together once a week,” says Dawson.Healthy eating has been shown to help stress levels decrease, and if someone is working to a deadline, having a quick, healthy snack might be exactly what they need to get through a busy morning. Offering caffeine-free alternatives to tea and coffee can also help keep tempers from boiling over and keep the jitters at bay.Celebrate success“Celebrating success is important,” says Gillian Rattray, entrepreneur acceleration manager at Royal Bank of Scotland.Recognising small wins such as hitting certain revenue targets or securing an important meeting helps even out the rollercoaster of running a business. “At the moment, we are looking carefully at celebration,” says Dawson. “As a first step, we have installed a ship’s bell that we ring each time an order leaves the building.”“In my own business, we had fizz days – we bought a bottle of sparkling wine when we made £1,000 or more in a day,” says Rattray. “The more revenue we earned, the more fizz we bought!”SEAT believes in helping people move forward by making it easier to get to the good stuff.

The trainer, who has already won the Aintree race twice in his 13 years with a licence, was keen to talk up the chance of the unheralded Borice when a party of journalists visited his yard here in County Meath on Wednesday.“He ran in all the good staying chases in France and was hitting the crossbar in a few of them,” the 40-year-old mused. “I just think he could be an English National type of horse. He’s got a lot of experience and a change of scenery might suit him. He’s turned inside out since he came over to us. I think he’s a nice horse.”Borice was so far below the radar in Britain and Ireland that no bookmaker quoted him in their lists for the Grand National until Elliott spoke. He has now been introduced as a 66-1 shot and most punters will understandably want to see him race before taking an interest.Previously based north of Bordeaux with François Nicolle, Borice has failed to win since June last year but has shown plenty of ability, including when a close third in a Grade Three at Auteuil in April. As he is a seven-year-old with plenty of size about him, Elliott hopes there is improvement to come.Elliott does not seem to hold out much hope of a repeat victory in the National by Tiger Roll, who clung on by a head in the big race in April. “It’ll be a massive ask he’s probably going to have close to top weight. But he’ll run it and he’ll have a good, sporting, each-way chance. To be honest, the cross-country race at the Cheltenham Festival will be his Gold Cup.”It seems there is no shortage of Aintree candidates at Elliott’s base north-west of Dublin. Off the top of his head he listed his other possible entrants as Bless The Wings, Monbeg Notorious, Don Poli, Noble Endeavour, Mala Beach, Woods Well, Folsom Blue, Space Cadet, Outlander and Ucello Conti.Two of those, Don Poli and Noble Endeavour, are expected to get a taste of the famous course when they line up in Saturday’s Becher Chase, which will mark a return to action for both after 20 months on the sidelines. Elliott appeared especially keen to get Don Poli, a dual Festival winner, going again after a successful schooling session over National-type fences at The Curragh on Tuesday.“He looks great. He’s a class horse. He might need the run this weekend but he’s been schooling well, so we’re very happy with him. He got a legafter the Gold Cup. We just had to leave him but, if you’d actually felt his leg, you wouldn’t have known the difference.“He’s in great order, so he is. He’d be the best I’ve ever entered in an English National. But it depends what way you’re weighted. The best horse doesn’t always win it.”Noble Endeavour is said to have had “niggly problems” rather than one significant injury and there are still hopes that the nine-year-old has another big day in him. But Elliott wondered aloud if he might be an “in between” horse, not good enough for the very best races but too high in the weights to land a major handicap.Elliott raised some eyebrows when mentioning in passing that Samcro would have “a lot of different entries” for the Cheltenham Festival. However, he then ruled out the possibility of those entries being for races over fences and appears determined to keep the horse on the Champion Hurdle path, despite a surprisingly thorough defeat in the Fighting Fifth on Saturday.“But that’s the way life is and, when you make a decision, you have to go with it and stand by it. And that’s where we are. End of story.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e5fdfbddc10cb60c973fe60ea03d7f561189c086/0_69_4164_2499/master/4164.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5284acc90d3de3e8548750084b5f1224","title":"a coach less wallabies team at the world cup its not as mad as it sounds","story":"With viable replacements for Michael Cheika scarce, it might be time to look outside the boxWith Rugby Australia’s board scheduled to meet on Monday to discuss the immediate future of Michael Cheika, one argument being trotted out for the retention of the Wallabies coach is that there is no genuine alternative. Most leading coaches are already locked up for the World Cup in Japan next year and Rugby Australia would need to resort to someone who has not been involved in the international game in recent years. Such a move would carry its own risks and rewards.But is there another option Rugby Australia should consider? If a suitable alternative to Cheika could not be found, might the Wallabies be better off without a coach? There is a precedent. In 1978 Wallabies coach Daryl Haberecht suffered a heart attack in the lead-up to the third Test against the All Blacks at Eden Park. The All Blacks had won the first two Tests and the Wallabies were desperate to avoid a series whitewash.Former Wallabies coach and then Queensland coach Bob Templeton was in Auckland at the time and offered to step into the breach and coach the team for the third Test, but Wallabies captain Tony Shaw rejected Templeton’s approach. The team closed ranks and coached themselves to an historic 30-16 win, which featured a record four-try haul to backrower Greg Cornelsen. Regarded as one of the greatest victories in Australian rugby history, the coach-less win was a milestone, sparking the rise of Australian rugby in the 1980s and 1990s.Should Rugby Australia consider a similar approach for the World Cup year, which involves just five Tests before the tournament kicks off in September? Cheika has guided the Wallabies to victory in just 17 of 42 Tests, an appalling record which would almost certainly have led to the sacking of his immediate predecessors. If the coach is not producing acceptable results, why have a coach at all?Former Wallabies 1999 World Cup-winning coach Rod Macqueen set out to develop a team that was capable of coaching itself. With the likes of John Eales, George Gregan and Tim Horan, among others, leading the way, the Wallabies became a self-determining team. Of course, this approach has the potential to backfire spectacularly if the players are not fit for the task and it represents a huge gamble in a World Cup year. But whether the current senior Wallabies possess the same leadership qualities as Shaw, Eales or George Gregan is an intriguing question.At the start of the international season in June, Cheika proclaimed he was empowering the senior Wallabies with more say over strategies and tactics. Their poor 4-9 win-loss record this year – the worst since 1958 – would suggest that the move towards player power has been unsuccessful. But it would have been difficult for the players to make a constructive contribution to the way the team played when the side was constantly chopped and changed, including three starting playmakers in Bernard Foley, Kurtley Beale and Matt Toomua – crucial on-field directors.Wallabies captain Michael Hooper led the NSW Waratahs to the Super Rugby title in 2014 and the Wallabies to the 2015 World Cup final, but there has been criticism of his leadership this year, particularly his decision not to kick for penalty goal in the 9-6 loss to Wales in Cardiff last month.Hooper and the likes of fellow backrower David Pocock and Foley, a vice-captain, are the best leaders in the Wallabies camp and an effective leadership group would be capable of running the team with the help of an independent selection panel, specialist assistant coaches and a strong manager, who ensured discipline and the team’s culture was maintained.In the modern game a team certainly requires the expertise of a back-up staff to make the side function, but does it really need a head coach if the players are capable of coaching themselves?It may be that Rugby Australia genuinely believes Cheika can turn things around just as he did in 2015 after taking over from Ewen McKenzie. Or maybe they will make changes after meeting with Cheika in Sydney next week, either to the head coaching position or the assistants.But if Rugby Australia is baulking at changing the head coach mainly because of the perceived lack of a viable alternative, then perhaps they have not canvassed all of the options, including the idea of the players coaching themselves. The Wallabies have done it without a coach before. Can the spirit of 1978 save the team again?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e23b77b24113cd482046d96ce46ef53fe76e1bb9/0_0_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=49792aefa5d31c7a48a70a0628554bbf","title":"choose your favourite stage show of 2018","story":"Which plays left you speechless?

Earlier this week, the head of MI6 also suggested the UK needed to decide if it was “comfortable” with Chinese ownership of the technology being used.In a statement, the UK telecoms group has confirmed it is in the process of removing Huawei equipment from the key parts of its 3G and 4G networks to meet an existing internal policy not to have the Chinese firm at the centre of its infrastructure. “In 2016, following the acquisition of EE, we began a process to remove Huawei equipment from the core of our 3G and 4G mobile networks, as part of network architecture principles in place since 2006,” BT said. “We’re applying these same principles to our current RFP (request for proposal) for 5G core infrastructure. As a result, Huawei have not been included in vendor selection for our 5G core. Huawei remains an important equipment provider outside the core network, and a valued innovation partner.”The news comes in the wake of the head of MI6, Alex Younger, questioning whether Chinese firms such as Huawei should be involved in UK communications infrastructure.He said that the UK would have to make “some decisions” about such firms after other governments had taken steps to block the firm. “We need to decide the extent to which we are going to be comfortable with Chinese ownership of these technologies and these platforms in an environment where some of our allies have taken a very definite position,” he said.Huawei was founded by a former officer in the People’s Liberation Army and questions have been raised about the firm’s links to the Chinese state.A recent report to the US congress by the US-China Economic and Security Review Commission suggested the Chinese government “exerts strong influence over its firms”, and could “force Chinese suppliers or manufacturers to modify products to perform below expectations or fail, facilitate state or corporate espionage, or otherwise compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability” of devices and networks that use them.Huawei has always denied any improper links to the Chinese government. In their own statement, the company said: “Huawei has been working with BT for almost 15 years. Since the beginning of this partnership, BT has operated on a principle of different vendors for different network layers. “This agreement remains in place today. Since it acquired EE in 2016, the BT Group has been actively bringing EE’s legacy network architecture in line with this long-standing agreement. This is a normal and expected activity, which we understand and fully support. Working together, we have already completed a number of successful 5G trials across different sites in London, and we will continue to work with BT in the 5G era.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ba6e448cbd6a435d0359f07c69323707d90a59aa/0_113_5354_3212/master/5354.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=923f3e2ec3c9fe75eb8ef15db21363d6","title":"facebook discussed cashing in on user data emails suggest","story":"Social network staff apparently conversed about removing data restrictions for big ad spendersFacebook staff in 2012 discussed selling access to user data to major advertisers, before ultimately deciding to restrict such access two years later, according to a tranche of internal emails released by the UK parliament.The internal emails were obtained by the Commons digital, culture, media and sport (DCMS) committee last month after they had been disclosed, under seal, by Facebook as part of a lawsuit against it by the American software developer, Six4Three.The emails are a selection, often with little or no context or continuity, showing Facebook staff, including the chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, discussing whether to trade access to user data for revenue, valuable trademarks or simple cash payments. The emails also cast new light on a number of other controversial practices at the social network:Damian Collins, the chair of the DCMS committee, which released the emails, said: “The files show evidence of Facebook taking aggressive positions against apps, with the consequence that denying them access to data led to the failure of that business.“It is clear that increasing revenues from major app developers was one of the key drivers behind the Platform 3.0 changes at Facebook,” Collins added. “The idea of linking access to friends’ data to the financial value of the developers’ relationship with Facebook is a recurring feature of the documents.”The emails show Facebook staff discussing how to use access to user data to extract concessions such as higher advertising spend from major clients, in conversations dating from 2012 and 2013.In one email to employees, Zuckerberg, said of the proposals: “Sometimes the best way to enable people to share something is to have a developer build a special purpose app or network for that type of content and to make that app social by having Facebook plug into it.“However, that may be good for the world but it’s not good for us unless people also share back to Facebook and that content increases the value of our network. So ultimately, I think the purpose of platform – even the read side – is to increase sharing back into Facebook.”The discussions occurred at roughly the time that Facebook decided to change the way third-party developers could access user data, which had the effect of closing the hole through which Cambridge Analytica’s UK parent company, Strategic Communications Laboratories’ partner GSR, had managed to extract the personal information of millions of Facebook users.Elsewhere, the filings suggest Facebook offered to extend the length of time Tinder could continue using the old, more permissive terms of access in exchange for a licence for the dating company’s trademark on the term “moments”.In emails, Zuckerberg discussed similar limitations, proposing that access to user data be restricted either to companies who were making content that would be shared with Facebook – or to those who were willing to pay for it.In an October 2012 email, Zuckerberg wrote that companies could pay the money they owed by buying adverts on Facebook, using the company’s payments infrastructure, selling items in its store, “or if the revenue we get from those doesn’t add up to more than the fees you owe us, then you just pay us the fee directly”.There is no suggestion that Facebook acted on the proposals to charge for access, and the company has always maintained that it tightened the restrictions on what could be done with its user data for privacy and security reasons.The filings are drawn from a set of Facebook emails obtained by Six4Three’s legal advisers in the discovery portion of its lawsuit against the social network, subsequently sealed by the Californian court. In late November, however, the UK parliament obtained copies of the emails from Six4Three’s chief executive and quoted from them during its questioning of a Facebook executive the following week.In a statement, Facebook’s director of developer platforms and programs, Konstantinos Papamiltiadis, told the : “As we’ve said many times, the documents Six4Three gathered for this baseless case are only part of the story and are presented in a way that is very misleading without additional context.” Facebook declined a request to provide the  with the emails in their additional context.Papamiltiadis added: “That said, we stand by the platform changes we made in 2015 to stop a person from sharing their friends’ data with developers. Any short-term extensions granted during this platform transition were to prevent the changes from breaking user experience.“To be clear, Facebook has never sold anyone’s data. Our APIs have always been free of charge and we have never required developers to pay for using them, either directly or by buying advertising.”On Tuesday, the day before the emails were released, Facebook reversed the policy under which it had banned Vine from its platform. “As part of our ongoing review we have decided that we will remove this out-of-date policy so that our platform remains as open as possible. We think this is the right thing to do as platforms and technology develop and grow,” the company said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cb058b4c84b60a1947ab2b4e1f4b9e57f7a8fa59/0_232_5274_3164/master/5274.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=947395587c347ddc8592c14028d2ed40","title":"share your experiences of lost footpaths","story":"More than 10,000 miles of footpath are estimated to have been lost from maps. We’d like your help in documenting their recoveryEngland and Wales have about 140,000 miles of footpaths, but it is estimated more than 10,000 have been lost from current maps. Volunteers have been working tirelessly to rediscover them and put in legal applications for the recovery of lost paths before a government deadline in 2026 after which claims will no longer be accepted.If you have already found a lost footpath, how did you find and identify it? If you put in an application for a path to be recovered we’d also like to hear about it.Below are some tips on how to rediscover a lost footpath:1. The first port of call is the Ramblers, whose website gives clear advice on how to identify a lost path and make an application. The method involves comparing new and old maps, plus examination of historical sources. Walking and exploration is involved, but don’t forget that a lost path has to be proven before you can use it, otherwise you are trespassing.2. It is also important to be sure you are not replicating work already underway. This government website can give you information on current applications.3. You may also know of paths that are used regularly, but are not on the definitive map (you can ask your local council to see that map). Any footpath walked by the public for 20 years without any attempt by the landowner to prevent access can be made a right of way. Check your local walking groups for people actively walking along unmapped routes to help establish this right.You can share your tips and stories with us in the encrypted form below.

They are being investigated for trespassing and visa violations.Two Indian journalists, D Anandhakumar and M Sriram, who had been assisting the French journalists with translation – but did not accompany them to Irel – were held by police for two days without explanation, and released after their detention became the subject of media enquiries. They have been asked to return to assist police with the investigation and fear they could be charged.A local branch of India’s ruling Bharatiya Janata party has put posters up in the area where Irel is based, warning: “There are French spies in Kanyakumari district. People beware.”India’s junior shipping minister, Pon Radhakrishnan, also told reporters last week the two journalists were spies who had arrived in India via “the sea route”.A report released on Wednesday by Article 19, a group that campaigns for freedom of expression and information, said such rights had declined more steeply in India in the past four years than in almost any other country.“Seven journalists were killed last year,” the group’s report said. “Journalists have been subjected to online smear campaigns and threats by Hindu nationalists, contributing to a climate of self-censorship.”"},{"url":null,"title":"charity prints from the irish times","story":" photographers have produced a gallery of images that will make a unique Christmas gift.

Video: BBCPanoramaFreddie Scappaticci sent a young boy “on a message”, as they say in Belfast, up to the home of 44-year-old Anthony McKiernan in January 1988, asking McKiernan to call by to see him.Not only were they neighbours, the Scappaticcis and McKiernans were also friends – the children of both families had sleepovers. That was the last McKiernan’s wife and children saw of him.Twenty four hours later, McKiernan was found shot dead on Mica Drive in Beechmount, not far from the Falls Road. He had been condemned as an IRA informer, something his family has always denied.McKiernan’s death was not the only occasion when Scappaticci shut down the normal inhibitions that prevent people visiting harm on others, let alone friends and neighbours, and scheming to do so in such a viscerally treacherous way.Scappaticci headed the IRA’s internal security unit – referred to fearfully as “the Nutting Squad” – during the 1980s, though his association with the IRA went back to the beginning.Vincent Robinson’s family had also been neighbours of Scappaticci. In June 1981 his body was found in a rubbish chute in the Divis flats, Belfast.His head had been struck at least five times on its left side with a rod-shaped instrument (like an iron bar) fracturing his skull while he was still alive. He had also been kicked in the stomach.Following Robinson’s death, Scappaticci had gone to the home of his sister, Meg, and her then husband, both fellow IRA members. Looking Scappaticci in the eye, she asked him if her brother had been tortured before death.She had heard that his body had been marked when it was found. Looking Meg Robinson in the eye, Scappaticci replied “No”. The truth about the beatings emerged only at the inquest. Robinson’s father went to Dublin to complain to the IRA, where he was told to shut his mouth.During a decade at the centre of the IRA’s internal security, Scappaticci has been directly linked to 18 killings.Today, his actions and those of the people in British military intelligence who “ran”him are being investigated by Operation Kenova, an inquiry headed by the chief constable of Bedfordshire, Jon Boutcher.The inquiry is not the first into the secret intelligence war. However, seasoned observers of the Troubles are sceptical it will run its full course if the evidence implicates too many senior members of the British intelligence services, but also the Republican movement. Boutcher counters this concern, saying “if any of this perceived resistance happens, I will challenge it”.By 2007, the conflict in Northern Ireland had claimed 3,720 lives. Due partly to Sinn Féin’s laser-like focus, attention on the 367 killed by British forces has eclipsed the 2,152 killed by the IRA and other republican groups.Very little attention, by comparison, has been paid to the 1,738 members of the security forces killed by the IRA, and none at all on those murdered by the IRA for spying – some 70 people.In Kenova’s sights are also those IRA leaders on the Provisional Army Council who sanctioned the “executions” for spying, as required by IRA General Orders.Appeals against the death sentence were required to be heard by the IRA’s adjutant-general with a signed copy of the verdict and sentence, and a summary of the evidence.Gerry Adams continues to deny he was in the IRA, but a multitude of ex-IRA members and police officers say otherwise, and they say that between 1978 and 1982 Adams was its adjutant general.So how and why did Scappaticci manage to survive at the heart of IRA’s action for so long? Why did he become a British informer? How did he survive after he was “outed”?Scappaticci was one of several thousand Republicans who were interned in Long Kesh (the Maze) from 1971. Following his release in 1973, he returned to Belfast. By the summer of 1974 had been promoted to the brigade staff of Belfast’s IRA.However, then he was rearrested. The Belfast ’s front page for August 16th, 1974, carried the headline “Troops capture top IRA officer” with “an Italian-sounding name”.Scappaticci swaggered back into his “cage” brandishing the newspaper as if he was 7ft tall (he is, in fact, 5ft-3ins). His fellow inmates saw it as his way of saying “you need to respect me”.His boastful conduct inside Long Kesh mirrored the “Big Bossman” persona he had cultivated with his brooding presence at the Jubilee Club in the Markets in Belfast where IRA members would drink on a Saturday night.Perhaps, in the gratuitous raw racism endemic to parts of Belfast even today, the fact that Scappaticci was called “The Wop” helps to explain his need to prove himself. He owed his Mediterranean looks to his Italian immigrant father who became a cook and owned a popular ice cream van with the family name emblazoned down its sideThose he shared his Long Kesh cage with have spoken of their dislike for a man who seemed preoccupied with status: “Scap’s world was viewed exclusively through the prism of his ego,” says one ex-detainee.Scappaticci had also been outspoken in his criticism of IRA leaders. “To Scap most of them were wankers,” another source explained. This, along with his overtly, often grotesquely pornographic language, did not endear him.Perversely, however, the confidence with which he critiqued IRA leaders may account for his appointment to his next IRA post, one from which most IRA volunteers ran a mile.In 1978 the IRA established a new security unit as part of a restructuring order designed by Gerry Adams and other IRA leaders after they were interned in 1972.The security unit’s job was to protect the IRA from penetration by the British as the IRA bedded down for the so-called “Long War” strategy. In one leap Scappaticci had access to the very heart of the IRA war machine.Following his release, Scappaticci had gone back to the building trade. However, he was arrested by the RUC over a VAT fraud. Spared prosecution, he agreed to hand over information.Later, he graduated from being a police spy to spying for British military intelligence’s Force Research Unit. He was given an agent number 6126 (referred to simply as ‘26’) and a codename: Stakeknife.Belfast today teems with rumours as to what led him to do this: revenge for being beaten up by members of the IRA over an affair with another member’s wife is a favourite.Equally, he was open to blackmail because of his notorious interest in pornography, including watching videos in his two-up, two-down terraced house in Farnham Street off Belfast’s Ormeau Road.Several IRA volunteers have told me, independently, that he had an unhealthy interest in pre-teen girls, peeping through cracks into the women’s changing room during IRA Belfast Brigade meetings in a leisure centre.A former special branch officer says he believes Scap was “a walk-in” – turning up one day to an army base to volunteer his services. Others say money explains his actions, though the money was not enough to get rich.In his book The Ulster Tales a former head of the army in Northern Ireland, General Sir John Wilsey, gave Scappaticci the fictional codename of “Kerbstone”, describing him as an agent who became “a priceless asset that would run and run”.General Wilsey invites us to believe that a resourceful intelligence sergeant befriended Scappaticci “sinking pints until the early hours” in “the clubs and bars frequented by republicans”.However, the notion that a British-accented soldier could have waltzed in and out of Republican clubs at will – and lived to tell the tale unless able to give a good account of themselves – is quite fantastical.So why did he inform? A British Army record says he was “opposed to gratuitous violence”. If that was true, then why did he put a brick in a sock and smash it over the head of a neighbour? The neighbour had had the temerity to complain about living “up Provie Hill”, because so many members of the Provisional IRA, including Scappaticci, lived in his street. His neighbour’s primary offence, however, had not been to mock the IRA, but to challenge Scappaticci’s authority.The conflict was the centre of life in the North and Scappaticci’s dual role put him at the centre’s centre. He was head of an IRA unit that entitled him to prod and probe everywhere, while doubling as the British “master spy”.His value to the British can be judged by the fact that he was serviced by a team of handlers separate from the rest of their colleagues in the Force Research Unit, or FRU.Scappaticci enjoyed an especially close relationship with his handlers. They worked hard to engender in him a sense of being bound tightly into one team, all “we” and “us”, united in fighting a cruel and ruthless enemy.For a while, Scappaticci also exercised a kind of psychological control, if not terror, over the general population of west Belfast which went beyond the strict limits of the IRA itself.He ran the IRA’s “Civil Administration” which policed parts of Belfast under IRA control. Ordinary “decent” crime (as it was known) was rife. Criminality gave Gerry Adams the opportunity to create “an alternative government”.Scappaticci ran the Civil Administration “with a heavy fist”, a former IRA man who had dealings with him told me. Joyriders and drug dealers were routinely kneecapped. Civil Administration put the fear of God into locals in order to enforce collaboration with the IRA.In Belfast, kneecapping became a weapon. A licence for an ordinary decent “hood” to continue living in the community was to ensure their future was spent limping up and down the street on crutches. Equally, they had to limit their statements to the police after the shooting to say only that “two masked men held me down and then shot me in the back of the legs, but I don’t know their names and I can’t remember their descriptions”.But, of course, the victim usually did know the perpetrator. The (usually) teenage culprit had actually turned up to Civil Administration HQ – better known as Sinn Féin’s HQ – at Connolly House by appointment with a parent.There, the parent would have pleaded with the gunman not to shoot his child “here” pointing away from the joint, but “there, please” to minimise lasting damage.Repeat offenders risked a “six pack” – six shots, one for each knee, elbow and ankle. One mother vividly described her meeting with Scappaticci after he had demanded that she bring her errant son to see him.Scappaticci told her: “The next time we hear he’s been at it or of any complaints against him, I will personally blow the head off him.” Adams, she says, sat beside him, saying nothing. Some years later her son was shot dead.The IRA’s hold still exists. In 2015, the widow of an IRA man executed for being a spy – which he was not – joined other relatives of Nutting Squad victims outside Belfast High Court to launch civil proceedings against Scappaticci.There, she was abused by a neighbour. “What the f*** were you doing?” She was looking for justice, something she had kept quiet about since she was spat at on her way to mass after her husband was killed three decades earlier.Scappaticci’s luck ran out in January 1990 after police agent Sandy Lynch was rescued from the clutches of IRA interrogators. The police thought Lynch was about to be shot after Scappaticci got him to confess.However, RUC CID officers, who did not know that Scappaticci was a spy, found a thumb-print belonging to him in the house where Lynch had been held. He fled to Dublin.There, Scappaticci and his British handlers concocted an alibi. When arrested in October 1992 on his return he told police he had been there doing TV repair work. The homeowner confirmed the story. He was released.By now, however, the IRA was suspicious and removed him from the security unit. With his access to IRA secrets gone, the FRU formally stood him down as an agent in 1995.How did he escape the same treatment at the hands of the IRA that he had helped mete out to others? His bullet-ridden body would have been an admission that the head of IRA security had been the biggest threat to the IRA’s security all along. It would have provoked too many questions.It would also have provoked internal isions, raising questions about the leadership. The IRA in south Armagh had long been suspicious about Scappaticci and had made their feelings known.However, a reluctance to kill him did not stop the IRA putting him in his place. Following his sidelining, he agreed to help the staunchly republican family of Anthony Braniff clear his name. Braniff had been shot as a spy in 1981.Scappaticci spoke up for Braniff at a private meeting of republicans in Belfast. To his embarrassment, the IRA’s most senior man in Belfast, Sean “Spike” Murray, suddenly appeared through a side door.Murray deliberately embarrassed Scappaticci with a volley of awkward questions. Later, one witness explained that it was the IRA’s way of reminding Scappaticci that he had been told to fold his tent.In 2003 Scappaticci was eventually outed as Stakeknife by a former military intelligence operative, Ian Hurst. He was spirited out of Belfast to England where MI5 offered him protective custody.Scappaticci, though, had lost none of his chutzpah. He rejected MI5’s offer and flew straight back to Belfast where he sought a meeting with the IRA. The IRA, he calculated, had every reason to support his denials.He gambled that Sinn Féin, by now engaged in the peace process, could not afford to admit publicly that he had been a spy. If so, it would undermine their official line that they had fought the British to an honourable draw.Any such admission would provoke the rank and file into questioning whether the IRA had been pushed into peace, paralysed by the penetration of agents like him.On his return to Belfast, Scappaticci met two of the IRA’s most senior representatives, Martin “Duckster”’ Lynch and Padraic Wilson. Ten years earlier, Wilson had said he suspected Scappaticci was an informer.Now, Wilson, Lynch and Scappaticci came to an understanding: Scappaticci would issue a firm denial which the IRA would not contest. To this day, this has been the IRA’s official position.Interviewed by detectives under the politan Police Commissioner Lord Stevens, Scappaticci stayed silent until the interview was formally over. Then, he asked if he could say something. Eagerly anticipating some new nugget, the two officers, both British, assented. Scappaticci said: “Look boys, I’m not the monster people think I am.” And that was it. That was all he said."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3720358.1543960561!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"miriam lord leo misses switching the lights on after the kylie excitement","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAn Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, Mr Varadkar’s partner Matt and friends with Kylie Minogue at the singer’s gig at the 3Arena Photograph: Tiernan BradyTwitterAfter the excitement of the previous night’s Kylie Minogue concert, the annual switching-on of the Christmas tree lights at Leinster House proved too much for the Taoiseach.He missed this particular gig for the second year in a row.Last time, he blew his first chance to be Treeseach at the annual ceremony because a Cabinet meeting overran. His people explained that he rushed across from Government Buildings but it was too late.On Tuesday, he was missing again.In Tara Street? The ? Sure that’s within a reindeer’s belch of Merrion Street.Perhaps Leo couldn’t resist the lure of Fintan’s latest oeuvre. Although that’s been launched more times than the Dunmore East lifeboat.Actually, no. It was The Sunday Papers: a History of Ireland’s Weekly Press edited by Joe Breen and Mark O’Brien. Because Leo Varadkar adores the newspapers. That’s why he mainly communicates these days via Twitter and lifestyle orientated social media platforms.It’s how we found out the Taoiseach was at the Kylie Minogue concert on Monday night, along with every other gay man in Ireland under the age of 50. Great time had by all, according to the Twitter machine and the photographs.Then our social media elves told us some lad went on Facebook and swore he saw Leo and his entourage tucking into a free meal at the concert before going off without leaving a tip.Like he would. As a rule, he always pays his way.Gawd, but there’s so much heavy stuff going on at home and in the world at the moment you’d really need a skewed set of priorities to get upset about that random sort of thing. Wouldn’t you?Anyway, the Treeseach missed the lighting up yet again and the Oireachtas staff choir, in spectacularly good voice this year, stoically coped with his absence. (It would never have happen in Enda’s day).Maybe Leo is allergic to trees. Or staff.It was a lovely ceremony. Short, as it always is, due to the cold. Done and dusted in around 15 minutes. But it was a little seasonal treat to get everyone in the mood. Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald made a valiant effort to get into the spirit by wearing a Santa hat and going on a selfie-spree. She was joined at the tree by Labour leader, Brendan Howlin along with the two women who head the Social Democrats – Catherine Murphy and Róisín Shortall.“Said the night wind to the little lamb: Do you see what I see?” sang the choir.No. No sign of Leo.The Fianna Fáil leader, Micheál Martin, raced in the nick of time to the tree, narrowly missing the switch-on but mercifully making the photo ops. “I didn’t know about it,” he protested. “I heard the carols above in my office and ran down. I’d hate to miss it.”Fine Gael couldn’t muster one senior representative to take part.Of course, the Ceann Comhairle is in charge at this yuletide event. Heaven forbid this might have a bearing on the Treeseach’s aversion to the tree ceremony.As always, Sean O’Fearghaíl conducted proceedings with brevity and eloquence.“As I think about this Christmas, I am conscious of the fact that very many people living in this country are back living the sort of frenetic lifestyle that they did during the Celtic Tiger. But I’m thinking alongside that, we have poverty and homelessness and disadvantage as we have never had before.”He said he was also conscious that people in “the Oireachtas community” know they are “at a point in the political calendar in the schedule of events where the ante is being upped” and they are under a lot of work pressure. But they also must look after themselves.“Because before we can help family and help the disadvantaged we have to be conscious of our own wellbeing. So can I just exort you all to take time for yourselves, time for your family and time for the needy.”Then the lights went on. And the choir launched into a medley of Kylie’s greatest hits.No, they didn’t. They sang a selection of traditional Christmas carols.Kylie, though, was on Leo’s mind. Or rather, the concert on Monday night in the 3Arena and the subsequent minor post on Facebook.After the book launch in the , where the canapés are supposed to have been wonderful and the wine plentiful, he found time to tweet this: “I’ve been made aware of a post on social media saying I had a free meal at a concert the other night. This is not true. There was no meal, we only had drinks and I paid. I have the receipt to prove it too.”Oh, thank God for that.Which reminds us. Barbra Streisand. Another great female artiste.

Video: UK Parliament TV\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritain’s attorney general Geoffrey Cox reacting as the outcome of a vote on a motion to find Government ministers in contempt of parliament is passed. Photograph: Getty ImagesFrom the Irish viewpoint, the conclusions of the legal advice to the UK government on the Border aspect of the Brexit withdrawal deal are merely a statement of the obvious.But in Westminster they are nonetheless greeted as incendiary.The full text of the advice from the attorney general (AG), released on Wednesday, warns the UK government that the backstop arrangement for the Irish Border – involving the UK entering a customs union with the EU – could last “indefinitely”.The so-called UK-wide customs union, together with some regulatory checks on goods moving from Britain to the North, are the measures set down in the agreement to apply if no other way is found to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland.This is the backstop – the insurance policy in relation to the border. The AG’s advice has highlighted the fact that this agreement, once triggered, could remain in place for a long time and tie the UK up in lengthy and potentially unsuccessful negotiations as it tried to escape.Accepting this risk has to be weighed against the desire to reach a stable agreement on their future relationship, the legal advice said. Striking this balance was “a political decision for the government,” attorney general Geoffrey Cox wrote.Interestingly, reports in London and comments by prime minister Theresa May suggest that she may be considering offering the UK parliament some kind of “lock” under which it would have to vote before the backstop came into place. But it is hard to see the EU side agreeing to this as anything which makes the backstop in any way contingent on a final UK go-ahead would threaten to completely undermine it. We will have to see how the plays out.The wider political point here is that both sides have said that it is not their intention that the backstop, if it was triggered, would be a permanent arrangement. Rather it would stay in place until another solution was found, presumably via a new trade deal between the EU and UK.However, the AG’s advice points out that there is no guarantee of another arrangement being concluded that avoids the need for border checks and so the backstop could remain in place for the long term.The backstop, in other words, could be for good and not just some temporary “fix”. As the AG put it: “Therefore, despite statements in the Protocol that it is not intended to be permanent, and the clear intention of the parties that it should be replaced by alternative, permanent arrangements, in international law, the Protocol would endure indefinitely until a superseding agreement took its place in whole or in part, as set out therein.”This shows the success of Irish negotiators in getting a rock-solid commitment in the draft withdrawal agreement. However it is this very fact – and its implications for the UK’s future room for manoeuvre – which is now causing such debate in Westminster.The warning by the AG of endless rounds of talks and negotiations relate to the review mechanisms proposed in the draft withdrawal agreement. This would be overseen by a joint committee including UK and EU representatives, with disputes ruled on by an arbitration committee.The AG’s advice appears to point to the risk of the UK getting caught in endless discussions and disputes about whether the backstop is still needed under whatever new arrangements emerge.For the backstop to end, Cox warns, a superseding agreement is needed to take its place “in whole or in part”. And he concludes that the Withdrawal Agreement “cannot provide a legal means of compelling the EU to conclude such an agreement”. In other words, the UK has no unilateral way out of the backstop, and never will.Of course if the Withdrawal Agreement is not signed, then the UK does not sign up to the backstop and the Irish Border issue would again be back under discussion.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward. I can\u0027t imagine celebrities would want to be associated with Philip Green. He\u0027s in a tricky situation.

coalition spreads confusion vaccinations sacking commission","story":"Since coming to power in June, Italy\u0026#39s coalition has sown confusion over its policy on vaccinesItaly’s populist coalition has plunged its already confusing stance on vaccines into greater uncertainty by sacking a commission of health experts.The decision was announced by Giulia Grillo, the health minister, who said it was “time to make room” for new people on the commission, which governments normally turn to for health advice.“We are the government of change,” she said. “I have chosen to open the door to other deserving personalities.”But it was not clear who the replacements might be.The government, which is made up of the hard-Right League and the anti-establishment Five Star Movement, has sent out confusing signals about health policies, and in particular the importance of vaccinations, since it came to power in June.Both parties have been accused of peddling conspiracy theories about the supposed risks of having vaccinations.Matteo Salvini, the interior minister and deputy prime minister, has called them “useless and in many cases dangerous,” playing on discredited claims that the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) jab can cause autism.The sacking of the health commission was met with consternation by health experts and criticism from opposition parties.Italy already has one of the worst records on measles cases and deaths from superbug infections in Europe. Both the Five Star Movement, led by Luigi di Maio (L) and The League, led by Matteo Salvini, have expressed scepticism over the need for vaccinationsRoberta Siliquini, the outgoing president of the commission, said: “Given the quality of the members that make up the council, I don\u0027t see any scientific reason for the decision.”Dr Siliquini, who is the head of the school of hygiene and preventive medicine at Turin University, said she had never met the minister since the government was appointed in June.Like the other members of the commission, Dr Siliquini was appointed last December by the previous, centre-Left government.Their term was supposed to have lasted for three years.“It’s a decision that leaves us frankly astounded,” said Maria Rizzotti, an MP with the centre-Right Forza Italia party.“We have no idea why the minister removed, two years early, the members who were appointed to the commission in December 2017.The decision appeared to be a “political purge”, she said. “An advisory body as important as the Higher Health Council must not be deprived of experts of the highest level,” she said.Vasco Errani, from the centre-Left party Free and Equal, said it was “incomprehensible” that the minister had never met the commission’s experts and accused the coalition of operating a “spoils system” of politically-motivated appointments.The government has said that vaccinations should be voluntary, not obligatory, despite the risk of infectious diseases spreading, particularly among children in schools and nurseries.The number of measles cases has risen dramatically in ItalyBut to add confusion to the government’s stance, Ms Grillo admitted during the summer, when she was pregnant, that she would definitely have her baby vaccinated.She said that parents should be allowed to “self-certify” that their children have had the required jabs at the start of the academic year in September, rather than be required to produce doctors’ notes.The commission of experts recommended just last month that 800,000 children and young adults should be vaccinated against measles amid what it called an “emergency” over the rising number of cases.At the time Ms Grillo, the minister, appeared to endorse that call.Rising scepticism over the need for vaccinations has resulted in a sharp rise in the number of measles cases in Italy, from around 850 in 2016 to 5,000 cases last year.Please review our commenting policyBrexit latest news: Legal advice reveals Britain will be trapped

Perhaps most intriguingly of them all is a big container that includes seeds and insect eggs and hence create living things that will have been born on the Moon.Nasa video says it is going back to the Moon –\u0026nbspand staying thereThe country’s space agency will blast off in just a few days, after\u0026nbspa series of successful tests. It sets off Saturday, 8 December, and is expected to drop onto the Moon early next year.It will head up towards the Moon, fly around it and then drop down, into a specially selected region of the Moon that will become its home.Once there, it will look to learn a whole host of things about that nearby but still largely mysterious world. It will measure the surface temperature, examine the chemicals that make up its soil, as well as looking up at the Sun.But the mission is possible because it relies not only on the lander that will touch down on the Moon. It is also made up of a set of other hardware – chief among them the\u0026nbspQueqiao satellite, which will serve as a bridge and relay information between the lander on the far side of the Moon and its engineers down on Earth.Just as with the world it will explore, much of the mission remains murky and unknown. The Chinese space agency has stayed largely quiet about details of what will happen, including where exactly on the Moon it will arrive.Its mission comes amid a new focus on the Moon – particularly as an important stepping stone on the way to other missions, deeper into the solar system. Nasa, for instance, has spoken about how keen it is to send humans back there, with the aim of eventually using it as a base for journeys to Mars.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Like, if someone cuts me off in a dangerous way, if I honk, they\u0027re like: \u0027Ellen?\u0027The comedian also recounts how a TV station manager once told her: No one is going to watch a lesbian during the day.I said \u0027Well, they weren\u0027t watching me at night, what time of day is good for a lesbian?\u0027 she continues.Created with Sketch.15 Christmas films to watch on Netflix  Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The Christmas Chronicles, a holiday adventure from producer Chris Columbus (“Home Alone”, Harry Potter) and director Clay Kaytis (The Angry Birds Movie), tells the story of sister and brother, Kate (Darby Camp) and Teddy Pierce (Judah Lewis), whose Christmas Eve plan to catch Santa Claus (Kurt Russell) on camera turns into an unexpected journey that most kids could only dream about.

It’s a hell of a lot of information, which you should download to ensure you never over-share on the social network again.There\u0027s a big question on where we get the revenue from, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in one email. Do we make it easy for devs to use our paymentsad network but not require them? Do we require them? Do we just charge a rev share directly and let devs who use them get a credit against what they owe us? It\u0027s not at all clear to me here that we have a model that will actually make us the revenue we want at scale.\u0026nbspThe parliament\u0027s Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee received the documents from app developer Six4Three, which had acquired the files dating from 2013-2014, as part of a U.S. lawsuit against the social media giant. The app developer is suing Facebook over a change to the social network\u0027s privacy policies in 2015 that led Six4Three to shut down its app, Pikinis, which let users find photos of their friends in bathing suits by searching their friends list.\u0026nbspFacebook users logged out as site stops working properlyFacebook responded quickly, saying the release was misleading.\u0026nbspThe documents Six4Three gathered for their baseless case are only part of the story and are presented in a way that is very misleading without additional context, the statement said. We stand by the platform changes we made in 2015 to stop a person from sharing their friends\u0027 data with developers. Like any business, we had many internal conversations about the various ways we could build a sustainable business model for our platform. But the facts are clear: we\u0027ve never sold people\u0027s data.In a summary of the 250-page cache, which includes internal emails involving Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg and other members of staff, Mr Collins highlighted a number of key issues.He claims the documents show Facebook chose to whitelist selected companies, allowing them to maintain full access to the data of a user\u0027s Facebook friends even after the company announced changes in 2015 to end such access.Mr Collins suggests the cache also shows Facebook regularly discussed the value of data on the platform, saying: The idea of linking access to friends\u0027 data to the financial value of the developers\u0027 relationship with Facebook is a recurring feature of the documents.He adds that the files also show Facebook knew an update to its Android mobile app that would allow it to collect user call logs would be controversial and to mitigate any bad PR, Facebook planned to make it as hard as possible for users to know that this was one of the underlying features of the upgrade of their app.The summary also accuses Facebook of using analytics app Onavo to conduct global surveys of the usage of mobile apps by customers, and apparently without their knowledge. It says the site used this data to assess how often people use these apps and then to decide on which companies to acquire and which to treat as a threat.Additional reporting by agenciesShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Because of that, Netflix is said to have paid $100m to keep the sitcom having initially been paying $30m a year.According to The New York Times, this new fee “reflects the thirst for content in the streaming age”. The report also states that Netflix pre-empted user outcry and began negotiations to keep the sitcom – which ran from 1994-2004 – months ago.Does this mean that Netflix’s library of classic shows will be reduced as newer streaming services arrive? It certainly seems so. Look no further than the recent cancellations of its Marvel shows, including Daredevil and Luke Cage, which is said to be a casualty of Disney’s forthcoming streamer, Disney+. It will host original shows featuring characters from the Marvel Cinematic Universe and its Star Wars franchise.Despite this, it’s not just old films and TV shows that get watched by Netflix users with chief content officer Ted Sarandos confirming that new film The Christmas Chronicles was watched 20 million times in its first week, marking what he believes to be a career first for lead star Kurt Russell.Friends arrived on Netflix UK in January 2018, three years after making its debut on Netflix US.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Huawei has a robust cyber security assurance system and a proven track record.Additional reporting by ReutersShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Apple has often held out on such upgrades initially, waiting until they are improved and perfected.iPhone X could come back after weak sales of new Apple phonesLike 3G and 4G before it, 5G is expected to offer a vast increase in speed and reliability. But it is also talked about in much more enthusiastic terms: it will be faster even than internet connections delivered over WiFi, and might improve connectivity in such a way as to fundamentally change the ways that phones work.Such upgrades have previously come with weak coverage and poor performance, putting customers off the new technology. 5G\u0027s proponents argue that the speed increase that arrives with the new technology will be worth such teething problems.Those backing 5G claim that it will fundamentally change how networks and communications are organised. Networks will be so much faster than WiFi that they could make the wireless technology useless, for instance, and data transfer will be so fast that it will allow people to have internet\u0026nbspconnections to places across the world.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Wait until we actually leaveMeanwhile, a volley of tweets from Donald Trump punctured the optimism in markets that had followed news of a truce between the US and China.Just days after talks between the world’s two economic superpowers the US president once again fired off warning shots over trade,\u0026nbsptweeting: “We are either going to have a REAL DEAL with China, or no deal at all - at which point we will be charging major Tariffs against Chinese product being shipped into the United States.\u0026nbsp“Ultimately, I believe, we will be making a deal - either now or into the future…”The president’s words helped to put downward pressure on the dollar as scepticism grew that Bejing and Washington would agree terms within the agreed 90-day window.Lukman Otunuga, research analyst at FXTM\u0026nbspsaid: “The tremors created from President Trump’s Twitter outbursts continue to illustrate how financial markets remain extremely sensitive to trade-related newsflow.“Although the Trump Administration has repeatedly blamed the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy tightening for the unfavourable investor mood in stocks, the key culprit behind the selloff witnessed yesterday was clearly the comment made by Trump on trade with China.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

But we know nothing about them directly, including what they might be physically made up of.An Oxford University scientist has suggested a new theory that would bring them together, solving a question that has haunted astronomers and astrophysicists for decades.Dr Farnes\u0026nbspsuggests that both dark energy and dark matter are a fluid that possess negative mass. That means in effect that it would be the inversion of normal mass: if you pushed it, it would be propelled towards you.We know even less about dark matter than we thought, scientists findThe implications of such a breakthrough suggestion are huge, offering a solution to what that vast amount of missing stuff might be.We now think that both dark matter and dark energy can be unified into a fluid which possesses a type of \u0027negative gravity\u0027, repelling all other material around them, said Dr Farnes.\u0026nbspAlthough this matter is peculiar to us, it suggests that our cosmos is symmetrical in both positive and negative qualities.Negative matter has been proposed before, since it would mean that the material would become less dense as the universe expands. That would contradict real observations, which shows that dark energy does not thin out over time.However, Dr Farnes\u0026nbsptheory suggests that new dark energy is being created all the time. Since more and more negative energy is constantly bursting into existence, such a fluid would not dilute even as the universe expanded.That proposed fluid appears to work exactly as dark energy does.The outcome seems rather beautiful: dark energy and dark matter can be unified into a single substance, with both effects being simply explainable as positive mass matter surfing on a sea of negative masses, he said.Researchers now hope the theory can be tested using the huge\u0026nbspSquare Kilometre Array, which is being built now and when finished will be the biggest telescope in the world. But if true it could fix\u0026nbspLambdaCDM, our current picture of the universe, explaining what exactly the dark matter and energy that has been so problematic for our physics is made up of.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

the former education secretary - has used her intervention in the Brexit debate to warn that Parliament will be gridlocked no matter what the Brexit deal.\u0026nbspMs Greening said the deal negotiated by the PM was the equivalent of asking someone to jump out of a plane without knowing if your parachute is there and attached.She said: If this was anything else comparable, for example a big infrastructure project, we\u0027d have a national policy statement that might be a thousand pages of detail for the House to consider.Here we\u0027ve got just 26 pages, a proposed deal on leaving the European union is perhaps the ultimate national policy statement, yet we\u0027ve virtually nothing, it\u0027s the political equivalent of being asked to jump out of a plane without knowing if your parachute is there and attached, it\u0027s like agreeing to move out of your house without knowing where your going to live next or not even having agreed the sales price but selling out and signing a contract anyway.None of us would do this in our own lives, yet this Withdrawal Agreement and Political Declaration asks us to do it on behalf of our country.In the Brexit debate, the Tory MP Grant Shapps warned the Irish border backstop proposal could remove power from the\u0026nbspCommons\u0026nbspand UK, adding: For the first time as a Member of Parliament I find myself at odds with my own Government.With no sign of a solution, certainly not in the Attorney General\u0027s legal advice, I am afraid I\u0027m left contemplating my vote on the Withdrawal Agreement next Tuesday.I\u0027m currently minded to vote against.Sam Gyimah - the former universities minister who resigned on Friday - is now speaking in the Brexit debates.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspIt became quite clear to me that this deal is not politically or practically deliverable -- it is a deal in a name only, what we have is a framework for negotiations, and aspirations.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThis deal is fatally flawed, he says. I believe that in voting for this deal we will be losing control of our destiny.\u0026nbspWe are setting ourselves for failure by going down this route.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspWe are at the foothills of a long and arduous process. Brexit will not be over a result of the vote next week.\u0026nbspHe says that we shouldn\u0027t rule out a fresh public vote on Brexit.\u0026nbspGyimah\u0026nbspsays he resigned because he knew it would be the biggest vote of his political career \u0026amp the national interest is not served by the deal.Responding to Sajid Javid in the chamber just now, shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, says there is nothing in the Brexit legal advice that compromises the national interest - as claimed by the government on Tuesday.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspMs Abbott said: On the question of security, assertions, aspirations, a wish list is not enough, we need a treaty.She added: The Prime Minister\u0027s red lines, one of which was the ECJ (European Court of Justice), may well prove to have been reckless.She went on: At the worst, the gaps and loopholes created under this exit agreement could create a situation in which organised criminals and terrorists in the EU might come to regard the UK as a relative safe haven from justice.Ongoing cooperation in cases and investigations may ultimately be compromised, she said, adding: On the basis of security concerns alone no member of this House should be signing off this deal.This from my colleague Benjamin Kentish, who has been poring through the Brexit legal advice the government has just been forced to publish:\u0026nbspThe legal advice published by the government today does not tell us much we didn\u0027t already know, but it spells out in black and white exactly why so many Brexiteers will vote against Theresa May\u0027s deal next week.The advice, provided by attorney general Geoffrey Cox to the Cabinet and published after Parliament demanded its release, focuses on the Northern Ireland backstop - by far the most contentious part of the agreement.In a passage that will be seized upon by Brexiteers, Cox said that, despite both the UK government and the EU insisting the backstop is designed to be temporary, it could endure indefinitely until an alternative is agreed.This is because the UK does not have the right to withdraw from the mechanism unilaterally.\u0026nbspThe withdrawal agreement, Cox said, does not provide for a mechanism that is likely to enable the UK lawfully to exit the UK wide customs union without a subsequent agreement.What\u0027s more, the attorney general suggested the EU could try to ditch the UK-wide customs union element of the backstop and keep only Northern Ireland under EU tariffs and regulations.\u0026nbspThat is anathema to the DUP, which is opposing the proposed deal on the grounds that it could see Northern Ireland treated differently to the rest of the UK. If talks over a future agreement break down, Cox said, the EU could submit a request that the GB elements of the customs union should fall away, leaving only NI in the EU customs territory. However, this would almost certainly be vetoed by the UK and would have to go to arbitration.It\u0027s not hard to see why ministers tried so hard to stop the legal advice being published. It confirms many MPs worst fears about Ms May\u0027s deal and makes it even more likely the draft agreement will be voted down by the Commons next Tuesday.Labour MP Chris Bryant asks Javid how any serious member of parliament could vote for a deal that is nothing more than a wishlist?Sajid Javid says Labour\u0027s six tests over whether they would back a Brexit deal are the wishlist - not the PM\u0027s deal.Chancellor Philip Hammond has told MPs he will deliver his spring statement on a date between February 26 and the end of March.The spring statement is the Chancellor\u0027s second most important annual parliamentary event, after the Budget. Its significance has been downgraded by Mr Hammond since he moved the Budget date to the autumn.Mr Hammond told the Commons Treasury Select Committee he had given the Office for Budget Responsibility the required 10 weeks\u0027 notice to prepare, adding: The spring statement will be some time between the end of the February recess and the end of March.As the statement is normally delivered on a Wednesday, it is likely to come on February 27 or March 6, 13, 20 or 27, in the run-up to the March 29 date of Brexit.\u0026nbspJavid says no one pretends this deal is perfect in every way - the PM herself admits that. But this is the best way to protect the Good Friday Agreement.\u0026nbspTory ex-chancellor Ken Clarke also offers him a boost, saying this is clearly the best way forward and it is pointless to protest until a better idea comes along.MPs have now moved onto the second day of debate on the Brexit deal, ahead of Tuesday\u0027s crunch vote.\u0026nbspOpening for the government, Sajid Javid, the home secretary, jokes that this is best way he can imagine to celebrate his 49th birthday.\u0026nbspHe says Ms May\u0027s deal is the best way to ensure a smooth exit from the EU and take back control of money, laws and borders. Today\u0027s debate will focus on security, hence Mr Javid kicking off proceedings.Please allow a moment for the liveblog\u0026nbspto loadThe Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Whether the UK had this power or not has been disputed, and campaigners had asked judges to rule.This isn’t a final legal ruling by the court, but judges usually endorse what the advocate general suggests. We should find out if this recommendation is confirmed within the coming weeks, with 17 December one date that is being talked about in Brussels.\u0026nbspIf it is confirmed, an accidental no-deal Brexit is effectively taken off the table – the government would be able to stop it in all circumstances if it wanted to.\u0026nbspThis is significant because the government’s main argument to remainer MPs to get them to support Theresa May’s deal has been that if they don’t, a disastrous no-deal Brexit could happen without anyone wanting it to. In one respect, the decision makes it harder for May’s deal to pass, because she won\u0027t be able to scare them into backing it.Meanwhile, in WestminsterAs the news from the Luxembourg court broke in the morning , MPs were settling in for a big day in Westminster. By the time they went home for the night, the Government had been defeated in three votes – a record bad day for Theresa May’s minority administration.One of these votes was about whether the Government was in contempt of parliament for refusing to release its legal advice about its Brexit deal. MPs decided that ministers were indeed in contempt – effectively forcing the government to release the legal advice. This is significant because the advice is expected to provide more ammunition for opponents of the deal, especially Brexiteers.But another vote lost by the government will likely have even bigger implications. MPs – including 26 Tory rebels – voted to give parliament more power if Theresa May’s deal is voted down.If the deal is voted down next Tuesday the Government has 21 days to come back to Parliament and lay its plan for what happens next. But under the successful amendment tabled by Tory Remainer Dominic Grieve, the Commons will also be able to vote on what it wants the Government to do. Though that vote wouldn’t technically be binding, it would be politically incredible for the Government to ignore it.\u0026nbspTaken together with the likely ECJ ruling that the UK has the power to stop Brexit if it wants, MPs would be expected to take no-deal off the table. They might also call for a so-called ‘plan B’ – a call for Theresa May to go back to Brussels and negotiate a different deal. Whether that would be successful is another matter.So what are the implications for Brexit?The overall effect of the events of Tuesday 4 December are to make a no-deal Brexit significantly less likely. Nobody thinks there is a majority of MPs in favour of a no-deal, and they will now control the Government’s response to its deal being defeated.\u0026nbspIf the ECJ decides that the UK does have the unilateral power to revoke Brexit, then no-deal is effectively off the table. But even if it doesn’t it’s unlikely member states would stand in the way and push Britain off the cliff.In one sense, the deal is also less likely to pass because of what happened: Remainers were being encouraged to vote for it on the basis that a no-deal might happen.\u0026nbspBut in a strange way, the deal might win more support – if Brexiteers decide that the defeat of the deal might mean Brexit not happening at all, they could swing behind it. A large number have already publicly said they will vote against it, however – so whether that will be enough remains to be seen.Is that everything that happened?No, that’s just the main thread. Plenty more happened that would have been big news on any other day.\u0026nbspNigel Farage also announced he was leaving Ukip – the party he has long been synonymous with – because of its increasing closeness to far-right activist Tommy Robinson.\u0026nbspThe BBC dropped out of plans to host a debate on Brexit between Jeremy Corbyn and Theresa May after the three sides couldn’t agree on a format.The Pound fell to an 18-month low after the Government lost the contempt vote, but then rebounded.\u0026nbspMeanwhile, former Bank of England governor Mervyn King wrote an article in which he likened Theresa May’s Brexit deal to the appeasement of the Nazis. All in a day’s work!\u0026nbspThe Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Even if the government decides to pursue no-deal, MPs\u0026nbspwould now have the power to oppose it. While such a vote would not be legally binding,\u0026nbspit would be almost impossible for ministers to ignore.Mr Grieve\u0027s amendment was\u0026nbspbacked by MPs from across the Commons, including 26 Conservative rebels.In addition to pro-EU\u0026nbspTories who have previously voted against the government, it\u0026nbspalso received support\u0026nbspfrom\u0026nbspMPs who have traditionally\u0026nbspbeen loyal\u0026nbspto Ms May.\u0027Arguable case\u0027 government guilty of contempt of Parliament - BercowSupporters included former cabinet ministers Sir Oliver Letwin, Sir Michael Fallon\u0026nbspand Nicky Morgan, as well as Ms May\u0027s former deputy, Damian Green.\u0026nbspIt was also backed by\u0026nbspNick Boles, who is garnering support among MPs for a Norway for now option that would see the UK remain in the European Economic Area (EEA) and customs union until a further arrangement was agreed with the EU.Many of the Tory MPs\u0026nbspwho backed the amendment did\u0026nbspso despite\u0026nbsphaving already said they will vote for Ms May\u0027s deal.\u0026nbspMr Grieve pushed the motion to a vote shortly\u0026nbspbefore Ms May opened five\u0026nbspdays of\u0026nbspdebate on her\u0026nbspproposed withdrawal agreement.\u0026nbspThe amendment will fundamentally\u0026nbspalter\u0026nbspthe sequence of events that will\u0026nbspfollow if the prime minister\u0027s deal is rejected by MPs.Under the terms of the EU Withdrawal Act, the government must publish a statement within 21 days of the deal being voted down outlining how it plans to proceed, and MPs must be given\u0026nbspa\u0026nbspvote on this within a week.The vote, though, would only be on a neutral motion simply saying\u0026nbspthe Commons had considered the matter. Crucially, MPs would not be able to amend the motion in order to express a view on what action ministers should take.Created with Sketch.Brexit march for a final say – in pictures Show all 65Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in London 20102018Red smoke from a canister hangs in the air as around 100,000 demonstrators march through London during a People\u0027s Vote anti-brexit demonstration savings banners and placardsMayor of London Sadiq Khan takes part in the People\u0027s Vote March for the Future in London, a march and rally in support of a second EU referendum.MP Chuka Umunna (left) and MP Vince Cable (right) as MP Anna Soubry (centre) addresses Anti-Brexit campaigners at a rally after the People\u0027s Vote March for the Future in London, a march and rally in support of a second EU referendum.

It says parliamentary rules stating that neutral motions cannot be amended should not be applied to\u0026nbspgovernment motions on\u0026nbspBrexit.\u0026nbspThat means MPs will be able to order ministers to change tack, for example by extending Article 50, reopening negotiations with the EU or calling another referendum.A similar motion has been tabled by the chairs of\u0026nbspseveral parliamentary select committees, including Brexit committee chair Hilary Benn. However, their amendment explicitly rejects Ms May\u0027s deal, meaning it is unlikely to be supported by Tory MPs who are backing the prime minister\u0027s plan but want Parliament to be given greater control\u0026nbspif the Commons rejects it.Speaking in favour of his motion, Mr Grieve told the Commons: The reality remains that we have an unsatisfactory procedure\u0026nbspto resolve differences of opinion in this House if we come to a point where the government does not succeed on its motion. The opportunity exists this afternoon to cure that anomaly.\u0026nbspIt is contrary to all sensible practice, and I have to say slightly disrespectful of the role of this House, that we should end up with a situation in which\u0026nbspwe have unamendable motions\u0026nbspfor consideration\u0026nbspat a time when Parliament ought to be fully focused on trying to find means of resolving outstanding issues.He said his motion would ensure that whatever the outcome next week, we have a means of continuing the debate thereafter if we need to.Speaking for the government, Andrea\u0026nbspLeadsom, leader of the Commons, told\u0026nbspMPs\u0026nbspit was not the time to pre-empt whether or not further motions are likely as a result of Ms\u0026nbspMay\u0027s proposed\u0026nbspdeal being rejected.\u0026nbspThe amendment secured\u0026nbspthe guarantees Mr Grieve\u0026nbspgeneral initially tried to extract from ministers during debates on the EU Withdrawal Act in June.UK \u0027can cancel Brexit by unilaterally revoking Article 50\u0027Final Say: Two-thirds of students demand referendum on Brexit dealPetition with 1m names goes to No10 demanding Final Say Brexit voteWhat would UK voters be asked in a referendum on the Brexit deal?Having\u0026nbsptried to ensure MPs would be able to amend the government\u0027s motion in the event the Brexit deal is rejected, the former attorney general eventually backed down after claiming he had received assurances that ministers would respect the sovereignty of Parliament.\u0026nbspIt comes as a senior adviser to the European Court of Justice said that the British Parliament could unilaterally revoke Article 50, thereby halting the Brexit process.Launching a People\u0027s Vote report outlining how Parliament could block a no-deal Brexit, Mr Grieve said: “All the evidence I’ve picked up is that the EU would give us a reasonable period of time to hold a referendum if we wish to do so.“If Parliament expresses a view that it wishes to have a People’s Vote then unless the government has taken complete leave of its senses, it is possible for us to put in place the necessary procedure to hold such a referendum. And, more over, to make the necessary changes to the EU Withdrawal Act very simply to make sure that we don’t crash out on 29 March.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

What happens if Theresa May\u0027s deal is voted down?  What are the alternatives to May\u0027s deal?Click to followIndy PoliticsWe are entering one of the most uncertain periods in the modern history of Britain, with even the most experienced\u0026nbsppoliticians and commentators unsure of what the immediate future holds.This article will help you get to grips\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspwith some of the various outcomes from Brexit that the UK faces, and how we might get to them.It\u0026nbspwill be updated regularly as the picture shifts day by day...1 What are the key dates? December 11: This is the day of the \u0027meaningful vote\u0027, when MPs\u0026nbspwill\u0026nbspdecide in the House of Commons whether to accept or reject Theresa May\u0027s deal.December 13: A summit of the European Council will start in the wake of the meaningful vote in the UK. If British MPs have rejected the deal May agreed with other member states, this could be an opportunity for her to request changes, to allow it to become more palatable to MPs.December\u0026nbsp20: This is when the House of Commons breaks up for Christmas. If May\u0027s deal has been rejected the week before, and she wants\u0026nbspto put it to MPs\u0026nbspa second time before the holidays, it must happen before this date.January 7: The House of Commons returns, but to what? If the deal on the table has been blocked once, there may still be a chance for a second vote at this point, the prime minister may or may not have resigned and MPs\u0026nbspmight or might not have attempted to pass an amendment for a second referendum.January 7 to March 29: If those points above haven\u0027t been addressed before the Christmas break, they likely will be in this period. You may also see a push for the UK to opt for a Norway-style relationship.March 29: Brexit Day. Under terms of Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, if a country triggers the withdrawal process from the EU, they have two years to try and conclude negotiations on how it happens before their membership automatically ends –\u0026nbspand it ends regardless of whether those negotiations have been successful or not.2 What happens if Theresa May\u0027s deal is voted down?The big question to which no one knows the answer. There are lots of possibilities if\u0026nbspMay\u0027s plan falls as expected. Here are those likely to be pursued or rejected early on...\u0026nbspRenegotiation:\u0026nbspThere will be an opportunity to renegotiate within days at a summit of the European Council, but pretty much everyone at the meeting has been adamant there will be no further changes to the package agreed, even if MPs vote it down.That does not mean it is absolutely impossible –\u0026nbspboth sides currently have an interest in saying the deal cannot be renegotiated,\u0026nbspto encourage MPs to back it.\u0026nbspBut the incentive to find a different deal will become greater if the current one is rejected.The prime minister pushes the deal to a Commons vote...again: It may be that the PM does win some small further\u0026nbsptweak to the language in the withdrawal deal that means she can go back to the Commons and ask for it to be voted on a second time.\u0026nbsp Alternatively, the plunging pound and disruption to financial markets if the deal is voted down a first time, could also give May a reason to ask MPs\u0026nbspto vote again and pass her deal in the national interest.This course is only likely to be open, if the first defeat is close. If her administration loses with 100 Tories voting against her,\u0026nbspgoing back for a second attempt will look pretty futile.General election:\u0026nbspTheresa May could try and take a stand, calling an election, saying her deal is the foundation of the Tory manifesto in a bid to win a popular mandate for it. If she could, it would make it difficult for her MPs\u0026nbspto rebel against it. But there\u0027s a fundamental flaw in the plan. Under the Fixed Term Parliament Act a prime minister no longer has the power to call an election at will. Either they have to win a vote in the Commons by a two-thirds majority, or they lose a vote of no confidence by a simple majority. For both of these things lots of Tory MPs\u0026nbspneed to vote for an election, and with their seats at risk and a left-wing Corbyn government waiting in the wings, they are not likely to do so.\u0026nbsp3 What are the alternatives to May\u0027s deal?If it finally sinks in that the PM\u0027s strategy is dead, other possibilities start to arise...A second referendum:\u0026nbspThere will at some stage be a big push for a new referendum.\u0026nbspThe Independent\u0026nbsphas campaigned for the public to have a\u0026nbspFinal Say, with more than one million people signing its petition. The\u0026nbspPeople\u0027s Vote\u0026nbspcampaign has galvanised the support of politicians, celebrities and millions of people across the country.The new referendum would, however, have to be secured through a vote in the House of Commons and it appears that there is no majority for it at this time. Lots of Conservatives are opposed. Labour appears to be moving towards possibly backing one, but the party is split and leader Jeremy Corbyn is said to be against the idea. Even if Labour does back it, there are likely to be up to 20 of the party\u0027s\u0026nbspMPs\u0026nbspwho still vote against it, because their constituents so heavily backed leaving the EU that it would risk them being ousted at the next election.Time could change this situation. As other possible outcomes are whittled away and the prospect of an economically damaging no-deal Brexit looms, more\u0026nbspMPs\u0026nbspmay feel compelled to back a new referendum. The question of timing will be critical. Some backers feel the issue should be pushed to a Commons vote, as an amendment to the \u0027meaningful vote\u0027, fearing that waiting will mean other outcomes take hold and become more likely. Others say if the vote is brought to the Commons too soon, without enough support, and it falls – then supporters will lose their only chance of making it happen.\u0026nbspThere is also not a consensus on what the question should be in a new vote – in or out, May\u0027s deal or no deal, no deal or Remain. Some suggest a three-way vote on May\u0027s deal, no-deal and Remain, with the option receiving the fewest votes being knocked out and votes redistributed, as in the \u0027alternative vote\u0027 electoral system.\u0026nbspEven if a proposal for a new referendum is passed, there is every chance Leave could win again of course.Plan-B (Norway):\u0026nbspThere are those – including some in cabinet – who believe that once the deal is ditched the best plan would be for the UK to enter a Norway-style arrangement with the EU – either as a temporary state until a wider trade agreement can be arranged or as a permanent solution. It would mean leaving the EU, but staying in the single market. A \u0027Norway-plus\u0027 route could also see the UK remaining in the customs union.But this is likely to enrage half of the Tory party in parliament, and probably all of the more\u0026nbspBrexitish\u0026nbspmembership, as a less than full break from Brussels. It also does not end \u0027free movement\u0027, risking a backlash from Leave voters for whom immigration was the key issue in 2016.An extension to the Article 50 period:\u0026nbspThe EU has indicated that the March 29 Brexit day could be postponed, but only if there is a set course of action to postpone it for. In other words they could delay it for a new referendum or an election perhaps. It is not clear if they would do it for a late renegotiation.No Deal:\u0026nbspThis is the default. If May\u0027s deal is voted down and the government and\u0026nbspMPs\u0026nbspdo, or are able to do, nothing else, then on March 29 Britain will fall out of the EU with no deal in place. Many\u0026nbspMPs\u0026nbspare looking for ways to stop that from happening, but this is in the territory of the legislative wing of government trying to act as the executive, and so there are complications.In the Commons on December 4,\u0026nbspMPs backed a move that will allow them to amend a motion bought forward by the government, setting out its plans if May\u0027s deal is rejected.This gives MPs\u0026nbspthe chance to express a clear view of what should take place next and means that view could include any of the above options including opposing no deal, backing a new referendum or going into a Norway-style status.This motion would not be legally binding on the government, but it would be impossible to ignore. Certainly doing so would create a major political crisis.Then again, we are already going through\u0026nbspconstitutionalpoliticalsocial\u0026nbspcrises of sorts, so predicting exactly what will happen is extremely difficult.\u0026nbspThis is something that could occur at any time. She may feel that if her deal is rejected by\u0026nbspMPs\u0026nbsponce, or even twice, then the collapse of her strategy means she should quit and let someone else have a go. Tory rebels may also try and force her out.Under party rules they need to secure 48 letters from Conservative\u0026nbspMPs\u0026nbspdemanding she stand down, to trigger an internal vote of no confidence in her leadership. But so far rebel attempts to achieve the letters have verged on the incompetent. Even if they can get them May\u0027s team think they can win the overall vote.There is the question of successors too. Boris is unpopular in the parliamentary party, other Brexiteers do not seem credible. A\u0026nbspRemainer\u0026nbspis unlikely to win. It is not clear Jeremy Hunt or\u0026nbspSajid\u0026nbspJavid, the other two frontrunners, have a plan that would somehow eliminate the problems May faces.The reason May lasts through the toughest period yet, could be the same reason she has lasted up to now. No-one in their right mind would want to come in and be the prime minister to sort out the mess that is Brexit. Better to let May take the hit, and then come in to look to a brighter future afterwards.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

The court’s advocate general this morning issued an opinion to that effect, and the court usually follows such\u0026nbspadvice.\u0026nbspIf confirmed, this would make a new referendum easier because a vote to remain in the EU could be implemented straight away – and our membership of the EU would continue under the existing terms, the UK rebate on contributions included.\u0026nbspUK ‘can cancel Brexit by unilaterally revoking Article 50’However, the UK government would still have to apply for an extension of the Article 50 deadline so that it could hold a referendum in the first place – and that would still need the unanimous agreement of the EU27 countries.\u0026nbspSome enthusiasts for a second referendum might think that the ECJ’s likely decision would allow the UK to cancel Brexit and then hold the referendum. But that would mean, if the vote were for Leave again, that we would have to start the Article 50 process all over again. Which might fall foul of the advocate general’s opinion, which says that revocation of Article 50 notice is allowed provided it “does not involve an abusive practice”. Revoking and invoking our notice might be seen by the ECJ as precisely that: an illegitimate negotiating tactic.\u0026nbspIf the UK asks for more time to hold a referendum, the\u0026nbspEU27\u0026nbspare highly likely to agree to an extension to the timetable.So the significance of this opinion is indirect. It makes a possible referendum simpler because it would present a choice between two definite options: Theresa May’s Brexit deal versus remaining in the EU on existing terms.\u0026nbspThat would take away one of the arguments against a second referendum, namely that, if “Remain” were on the ballot paper, it would not be possible to guarantee what it meant because – without this legal opinion – we would need to ask permission of the EU27 to stay in the EU. That would probably be granted, but it might be complicated to secure an agreement to that effect before a referendum.\u0026nbspIn the next few days, as MPs debate the prime minister’s Brexit deal, the advocates of giving the people the final say can therefore propose a new referendum that seems credible and well defined.\u0026nbspThey know that, if the UK asks for more time to hold a referendum, the EU27 are highly likely to agree to an extension to the timetable. They want us to stay and want to make it easy for us to do so.\u0026nbspHowever, that EU law is interpreted in a way that suits the cause of integration – “ever closer union” in the words of the founding treaty – does reinforce the argument of Leavers that the EU will always seek to become a single superstate.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

The key issue that we’re\u0026nbspsaying\u0026nbsptoday, and that’s why we’re delivering a petition signed by a million people in this country, is that those choices are ones that should be made by the British people.“Parliament is gridlocked ... This is no way to decide the most fundamental question facing Britain for the next 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 years.“It is time that we now put the clear choices to the British people and allow them to decide.”Thornberry contradicts Jeremy Corbyn and insists Labour could still back Final Say Brexit referendumThe two documents were handed in to officials at 11am by Ms Greening, politicians from three other parties and The Independent‘s editor Christian Broughton.\u0026nbspLabour’s\u0026nbspChuka Umunna, a champion of the People’s Vote campaign, said: “The biggest issue that we’ve had since the Second World War is being left to MPs. And the problem we have with MPs\u0026nbspin parliament, is\u0026nbspthat they can’t come to a view of what should happen in this situation.“The bottom line is how else are you going to resolve impasse in Westminster if not by referring it back to the people. I don’t know anyone who has come up with a viable alternative.”\u0026nbspLiberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable said the “let’s-just-get-on-with-it”\u0026nbspattitude is a “fallacy”, because “even if we accept the government’s deal we’re not just getting on with it”.“We’ll be spending years in negotiation of what kind of arrangement we’d want with the European Union – the problem isn’t going to go away,” he said.The prime minister has repeatedly said that she will not countenance a further referendum on Brexit. But with no option carrying a majority in the Commons, a new vote has become\u0026nbspa more likely way to break the political deadlock.\u0026nbspReferring to calls for a new referendum on Monday, Ms May said: “People are talking about a second vote when we haven’t even delivered on the first vote.“I think we need to deliver on the first vote.

In recent days she has outlined how her proposals will deliver on the\u0026nbsppublic’s desire to end EU free movement.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

When you first see it, you just gasp because it’s just this huge hole in the ground.”The opening itself is 100m long and 60m wide, big enough to fit an entire football pitch.\u0026nbspWhen a team tried to climb down inside the huge chamber in September, they descended\u0026nbsp80m\u0026nbspbefore being stopped by the flow of an underground river.John Pollack, an archaeological surveyor who has visited the site, said it was a “nationally significant” find.Sarlacc in its pit in the Star Wars film ‘Return of the Jedi’ (Lucasfilm)“I’ve been in some of the biggest caves in the world, and this thing has an entrance that is truly immense, and not just by Canadian standards,” he told Canadian Geographic.The exact depth of the monstrous cave is not yet known but the water which flows in a torrent at the top of the shaft is believed to flow in a river underground for more than 2km and emerge some 500m\u0026nbsplower.\u0026nbspThis suggests the chamber would be among the biggest caves in Canada.\u0026nbspThe massive shaft which leads down from the surface is thought to have been carved out of the rock over many years by melting ice from nearby glaciers.\u0026nbspDuring its peak in the spring and summer, as much as 15 cubic metres per second of water could be rushing over the edge into the cave, Mr Pollack said, equivalent to two dumper trucks full every second.The exact location of the cave has not been revealed in order to protect the undisturbed site while officials prepare for a formal exploration and survey in 2020.But even if the public knew where to find the unspoiled marvel of nature, Mr Pollack said it is almost inaccessible.\u0026nbspMs Hickson said it was inspiring to know there was still much left of the world to discover.“Even in this day and age, when we think we know everything and we’ve explored every place, we can be surprised.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Critics have spoken out against the measures as well, with two dozen health care providers, insurers and hospitals across the state warning they could pose unintended consequences to Medicaid.The measure passed 17-16 with all Republicans in the legislature except one in support. All Democratic legislators\u0026nbspvoted against the bill.\u0026nbspRepublicans plan lame-duck power grab before Democrats take controlMr Walker has previously expressed his support for the measure, which would prevent his Democratic replacement from withdrawing a federal waiver request to implement the work requirement for able-bodied adults younger than 50.\u0026nbspAmong the proposals related to Medicaid, the bill requires new legislative oversight of waiver requests related to health care made by the governor, a move Democrats decried as a power shift designed to handcuff the new administration.The bill would weaken the governor’s ability to put in place rules that enact laws and shield the state jobs agency from his control until September. It would also limit early voting to no more than two weeks before an election, a restriction similar to what a federal judge ruled was unconstitutional.“Why are we here today?” Democratic Assembly Minority Leader Gordon Hintz said as the debate of more than nine hours began late Tuesday night. “What are we doing? Nothing we’re doing here is about helping the people of Wisconsin. It’s about helping politicians. It’s about power and self-interest.”As debate resumed at 5:00 am local time, Democratic Senate Minority Leader Jennifer Shilling said, “This is a heck of a way to run a railroad.”She added, “This is embarrassing we’re even here.”Republican and Assembly Speaker Robin Vos countered that the bills would ensure a balance of power between the Legislature and the executive branch.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The flag-draped casket of former US President George HW Bush is carried by military pallbearers past US President Donald Trump, first lady Melania Trump, former President Barack Obama, former first lady Michelle Obama, former President Bill Clinton, former first lady Hillary Clinton, former President Jimmy Carter and former first lady Rosalynn Carter as it arrives at his state funeral at Washington National CathedralHigh school students burn a barricade in front of their high school during a demonstration against French government Education reformsSully, the service dog of former US President George HW Bush in his final months, lays in front of Bush\u0027s casket at the George H Lewis \u0026amp Sons funeral home in Houston, TexasCourtesy Office of George HW BushReutersDemonstrators march in Brussels to \u0027claim the climate\u0027 as world leaders meet in Poland to discuss the Paris climate agreement targetsA protester moves to lob a tear gas canister during a protest in Paris today against rising fuel pricesUS President Donald Trump, Britain\u0027s Prime Minister Theresa May, French President Emmanuel Macron and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe wave hands in front of other leaders during a family photo at the G20 leaders summit in Buenos Aires, ArgentinaFirefighters battle a blaze on Fingerfield road at the Deepwater National Park area of Queensland.

The company, which is also phasing out the use of plastics, cited concerns about environmental degradation and deforestation, which is destroying the habitats of many critically endangered species, such as the orangutan.A freedom of information request by Unearthed\u0026nbsp– Greenpeace’s investigative journalism unit – revealed, six days after Iceland’s announcement, British diplomats had written to colleagues in Indonesia and Malaysia about how to handle the nations’ apparent concern over the supermarket’s move.Norway to heavily restrict palm oils linked to deforestationIndonesia is at the brunt of US laws to reduce fossil fuel dependence Why is palm oil bad for the environment, and how can people help?One email read: “The Indonesians and Malaysians need to recognise that these developments are being driven by (legitimate) concerns about the environmental impact of palm oil production, which they have not adequately addressed. It is not for us to argue the case for palm oil.”Emails exchanged between officials at the Foreign Office, the Department for International Trade (DIT) and the Department for International Development (DfID) at around the same time, suggest diplomats had been urged by the Malaysian and Indonesian governments to intervene with Iceland over its opposition to palm oil.Iceland has since made further headlines, after releasing an advertisement in collaboration with Greenpeace that featured a cartoon orangutan mourning the loss of his rainforest home, and which was voiced by the actress Emma Thompson.The ad was banned after it was deemed to have breached political impartiality rules.The ban intensified attention around the issue, though, sparking debate over advertising standards and the impact of palm oil, and providing Iceland with significant publicity – the ad has been watched more than 30 million times online, Greenpeace said.Malaysian officials took the unusual step of celebrating the UK regulator Clearcast’s decision to uphold the ban.Teresa Kok, Malaysia’s primary industries minister, said: “We will not be cowed or stand by idly\u0026nbspwhen nasty advertisements by Iceland mislead people in markets that are crucial to us. We will fight back with facts from scientifically researched data.”Another FOI request by Greenpeace this year\u0026nbsprevealed some of the other methods by which the Malaysian government had\u0026nbspattempted to maintain its European export markets.In May, British diplomats warned the UK government backing a proposed EU ban on imports of palm oil could put a lucrative arms deal between BAE systems and the Malaysian government at risk.British officials said supporting the ban could prompt Kuala Lumpur to rule out a multimillion pound deal to replace its fleet of fighter jets with British built Typhoon aircraft.Over the last 15 years, demand for palm oil has soared\u0026nbspand the product is found in a huge range of foods and toiletries. It is now thought to be present in around half of all supermarket products, leading the industry to launch attempts to certify it is sustainable.But Richard Walker, Iceland’s managing director, said\u0026nbspthe supermarket had decided to remove palm oil because there was none available on the mass market that could be verified as sustainable.Created with Sketch.

The entrance to the tunnel is hidden by a canopy of oak trees that cover the mountainside. Inside, dim lamps lead the way down a narrow passageway into a warren of small rooms where the air is cool and damp. There is a kitchen, a bedroom with mattresses laid out, a prayer room and a command centre where orders are barked through a crackling radio.This is what the inside of a Hezbollah tunnel looks like. The Israeli army – the militant group’s greatest foe – launched an operation this week to destroy tunnels much like this one, which it had discovered running underneath the border and into Israel.But this tunnel in Mleeta, southern Lebanon, remained undiscovered in the nine years it was used by Hezbollah fighters to launch attacks against occupying Israeli troops. Today, it is part of a sprawling interactive museum complex that glorifies that fight.“Israel didn’t know about this tunnel until we opened it up to the public in 2010,” says Ahmed Mansour, a spokesman for the museum. “It was kept hidden for all that time.”At a time when Hezbollah’s subterranean activities are under renewed scrutiny, the museum at Mleeta serves as a reminder of the crucial role that tunnel warfare has played in the group’s past, and will likely play in its future.Work began on the tunnel here at Mleeta in 1989, seven years into Israel’s 1982-2000 occupation of Lebanon. It took 1,000 men more than three years to dig, and when completed it became an important outpost for the group, allowing fighters to move undetected by drones and jets.“There was a big difference in strength between the two sides,” says a guide at Mleeta who did not want to give his name. “The tunnels were simple but very effective.”Mleeta in Lebanon, on 5 December, 2018\u0026nbsp(Sam Tarling  The Independent )When Israel eventually withdrew from Lebanon, Hezbollah quickly began preparing for the next battle. The Iran-backed group built hundreds more complexes like this across the south.“Between 2000 and 2006, Hezbollah constructed a very elaborate and comprehensive underground infrastructure in the south Lebanon border district, consisting of bunkers and tunnel networks,” says Nicholas Blanford, author of Warriors of God: Inside Hezbollah\u0027s Thirty-Year Struggle Against Israel.Israeli army launches operation to uncover Hezbollah tunnelsThose tunnels were used to great effect in the devastating 2006 war between Hezbollah and Israel, in which more than 1,000 Lebanese civilians and 44 Israelis were killed, according to Blanford. The conflict ended in a stalemate, which Hezbollah touted as a victory.“They were able to launch rockets from underground facilities close to the border with Israel and to ambush Israeli troops that penetrated Lebanese territory,” he says.That tunnel network could be utilised to even more deadly effect in the event of another war, a point that has become more relevant in recent months.Mleeta in Lebanon\u0026nbsp(Sam Tarling  The Independent )Over the past few years, Hezbollah and Israel have taken their rivalry to the battlegrounds of the Syrian civil war. But as that conflict is winding down, Lebanon is again becoming a focus for them both.Israel has watched with concern as Hezbollah has emerged from the Syrian conflict significantly stronger. The group’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah, claims to have built up an arsenal of longer-range and more accurate missiles.The cross-border tunnels add another dimension to Hezbollah’s threat. If utilised, the group would be able to send fighters to attack Israeli towns and villages.The Israeli army began digging on its side of the border on Tuesday, and announced later in the day that it had destroyed one tunnel that began in a home near the border village of Kfar Kala and stretched some 40 meters into Israel. \u0026nbspThe discovery has raised tensions along the border, which has been relatively quiet since 2006. Speaking on Tuesday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the tunnels “an unacceptable act of wanton aggression.”These cross-border terror tunnels were built by Hezbollah with a direct support and funding from Iran. They were built with one purpose in mind: to attack and murder innocent Israeli men, women, and children,” he said.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The flag-draped casket of former US President George HW Bush is carried by military pallbearers past US President Donald Trump, first lady Melania Trump, former President Barack Obama, former first lady Michelle Obama, former President Bill Clinton, former first lady Hillary Clinton, former President Jimmy Carter and former first lady Rosalynn Carter as it arrives at his state funeral at Washington National CathedralHigh school students burn a barricade in front of their high school during a demonstration against French government Education reformsSully, the service dog of former US President George HW Bush in his final months, lays in front of Bush\u0027s casket at the George H Lewis \u0026amp Sons funeral home in Houston, TexasCourtesy Office of George HW BushReutersDemonstrators march in Brussels to \u0027claim the climate\u0027 as world leaders meet in Poland to discuss the Paris climate agreement targetsA protester moves to lob a tear gas canister during a protest in Paris today against rising fuel pricesUS President Donald Trump, Britain\u0027s Prime Minister Theresa May, French President Emmanuel Macron and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe wave hands in front of other leaders during a family photo at the G20 leaders summit in Buenos Aires, ArgentinaFirefighters battle a blaze on Fingerfield road at the Deepwater National Park area of Queensland.

He wants to create a distraction to take people’s minds off the issue,” he says.Kafr Kila, Lebanon. The Israeli military launched an operation on Tuesday to expose and thwart tunnels it says were built by the Hezbollah militant group that stretch from Lebanon into northern Israel\u0026nbsp(AP)But Netanyahu has found a sympathetic ear in Washington, with the administration of US President Donald Trump. In October, Mr Trump signed new sanctions against Hezbollah, promising to “target, disrupt, and dismantle their operational and financing networks.”He said of the group, which was behind a 1983 bombing of a US barracks in Beirut that killed 241 Marines, “No terrorist group other than Al-Qaeda has more American blood on its hands.”At a time when the group is already under financial strain for its involvement in the Syrian civil war, those sanctions may do more damage than the destruction of a few tunnels.“The exposure of the tunnels for Hezbollah is not the end of the world,” says Blanford. “It’s quite possible they will have tunnels that the Israelis won’t know about, and won’t be able to detect.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

There is no point in the Government trying to hide that fact.The Democratic Unionist Party has vowed to oppose any new checks on goods passing between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.Irelands Foreign Minister, Simon Coveney, said that EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier indicated that the European Union will allow extra time for talks about the border.Mr Coveney said he was frustrated and disappointed that it was going to take more time than people had hoped.At the start of a key debate in Parliament on her Brexit plan, the Prime Minister said the backstop was not a trap for Britain.The backstop is not a trick to trap us in the EU, said Mrs May.It actually gives us some important benefits of access to the EUs market without many of the obligations and that is something the EU will not want to let happen, let alone persist for a long time."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/NINTCHDBPICT0004530379701.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"celebrating freedom european union","story":"It is a crying shame that nobody in Government has put their heart into a vision of a truly global Britain. The PM is in Buenos Aires rightly extolling our virtues to world leaders, but it’s hard to shake the feeling that her Cabinet are afraid that Britain cannot make it on its own. That weakness has been exploited time after time by EU negotiators.If only they shared the faith of those who voted for a brighter future.The scandalous lack of planning for a clean break, as James Forsyth makes clear on this very page, is a result of the Government only ever looking for pitfalls — rather than grabbing the opportunities that are so obviously out there for a reinvigorated Britain.It’s not too late. If the PM loses the crunch vote in Parliament, we must step up preparations to leave without a deal by several notches.And that might well see Brussels bureaucrats, for all their harsh words, coming back to the negotiating table.The disgraced tycoon Max Mosley, via his family trust, has pledged to keep funding this so-called independent body for years to come, as he continues his vendetta against the free Press.Labour donor Mr Mosley is no fan of the papers, and not just for exposing his extra-curricular activities. The media also uncovered his racist past, including pamphlets warning: “Coloured immigration threatens your children’s health.”When that bile came to light, the Labour Party promised not to take another penny from him. But he’s spent years bankrolling their Deputy Leader Tom Watson’s office to the tune of hundreds of thousands of pounds.Isn’t it time the cash was handed back, Mr Watson Ms Bibi, a Pakistani Catholic, was acquitted last month of blasphemy charges — a charge which had left her on death row. Whilst she’s in hiding, hardline Islamists have been parading around the country’s streets with images of her in a noose. It is clear she will never be safe in Pakistan.We should be proud of the fact that Britain is open to those of all religions and none, and give her a home here.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We must be duly punished.EU leaders can see — apparently more clearly than our own abject leaders — just how well we might do and how much of a threat a prosperous, independent Britain would pose to their Grand Project.Nobody can be certain what will happen after next Tuesday’s crunch vote.A snap election or a second referendum are unthinkable but possible.Returning to full EU membership is both unthinkable and impossible.There are alternatives... the Norway Option, Canada Plus... but they are fraught with complications.Yet there is a way we could avoid Mr Gove’s “turbulence” and leave in an orderly fashion without any deal at all.We don’t have to “crash out” or drive off a clf like Thelma and Louise.Neither option would be good for Britain — or the EU.It should be possible to negotiate a  to -month window to prepare a deal which suits both sides — and pay an appropriate sum to Brussels for the extra time.First, of course, we need a new leader and a new Prime Minister.That is almost as complicated as Brexit.DISGRACED Labour MP Kate Osamor has finally quit Jeremy Corbyn’s team, but only after proof she lied about knowing her son Ishmael was a convicted drug handler.Ms Osamor told a Times reporter who confronted her with the evidence: “I should have come down here with a bat and smashed your face in.”“F*** off,” she added and chucked a bucket of water.Two questions. Is it any surprise Ishmael grew up with contempt for the law And what would have happened to a Tory MP who behaved like that to ahack Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And because it keeps us in a customs union preventing us enacting our own trade deals.Despite the persuasive efforts of Attorney General Geoffrey Cox yesterday, we just don’t believe the EU will seek to avoid the backstop — or let us leave it.It will do anything to prevent an independent free-trading powerhouse on its doorstep. And once we’ve paid our £billion “bill” our leverage is gone.Why did our negotiators not demand a way to exit this trap  Because they didn’t think Brussels would agree. Such has been the feebleness of our efforts since David Cameron first had a go.Mrs May is now reduced to claiming we CAN do our own trade deals before the backstop kicks in. And yes, we can sign them . . . but they may never come into effect.The PM should not waste a week trying to sell this bad deal to the public.She shouldto Brussels and tell them it won’t work.GIVEN how many terror attacks MI has helped foil in Europe, you’d think Brussels would want the UK’s security and military might onside.Instead, out of spite, they are freezing us out of the Galileo satellite project we have invested £.billion in.Theresa May still insists we “will remain committed to Europe’s collective security” after Brexit.Pity the Brussels pygmies can’t say the same.IMAGINE the outragea Tory MP abused and threatened areporter with a savage beating for asking questions.That politician would be toast.Yet somehow Corbynista Kate Osamor is still a Labour MP.She employed her son in Parliament despite his serious drugs conviction, then lied about when she knew of it.When a Times reporter challenged her she swore at him, threatened to beat him with a bat and threw a bucket of water over him.She’s even banned from editing Wikipedia for doctoring her own entry.For now, she’s off Corbyn’s front bench.

Most are keen and eager to learn. That’s why teaching can be a really rewarding job, but there’s no doubt it is also a tough one.Today I will be launching my annual report, which will show that, overall, schools in England are doing a good job.The vast majority of children are attending good or outstanding schools, which is as it should be. Young people get just one shot at childhood — leaving no room for complacency.Yet in recent years it feels like more and more is being asked of schools and teachers, which could put this improvement at risk.They are being asked to do things that should be done at home by parents, as they used to be.This is making the job of schools harder. It takes up too much precious time and stops teachers from doing their actual job — teaching.One of the most shocking examples I hear about is the growing number of children beginning their reception year still in nappies.I’ve asked about this in primary schools this year, and each time I’ve asked I’ve been told it is a real problem.This is dficult for teachers, embarrassing for the children concerned and disruptive to their classmates.Quite simply, it is wrong. Toilet training is the parents’ job. It should not be left to schools. Only in the most extreme cases should parents be excused from this most basic of parenting tasks.And this isn’t the only area that concerns me.We all know about the growing problem of childhood obesity. By the start of primary school, almost a quarter of children in England are overweight or obese. This is at the age four or five.This rises to more than a third by the time they go to secondary school.It is estimated that nearly , young people in the UK are now suffering from type  diabetes, an unpleasant disease normally only seen in people over the age of .Schools have an important role to play, teaching children about the importance of healthy eating and exercise. Kids need to get out of breath during PE.But schools can’t do it all. It is lazy for us to rely on schools to change kids’ habits.And the reality is, that as Ofsted research shows, schools on their own can’t make the dference. The answer to the obesity crisis, particularly among younger children, lies in the home, and parents need to make sure their offspring eat healthily, go outside, and don’t spend all day playing on electronic devices.There is no point in teaching about healthy choices, making sure school meals are healthy or having rules about what goes into a packed lunch,for breakfast, dinner and all weekend children have a supply of junk food.One of the saddest things I’ve heard about recently is cases where children have leftover fast food, cold chips or chicken nuggets, in their packed lunches the following day. With the best will in the world, schools cannot fight this single-handedly.Sadly, in some parts of our country, schools are also at the forefront of tackling a very dferent kind of risk: kne crime and gang culture.Thankfully most schools are safe, and of course they can help educate young people about the dangers of knives and how to avoid being drawn into gangs.But they cannot be expected to solve the problem alone. Preventing kne crime requires people working together — police, youth services, health services — to protect children and to do everything to bring those who cause harm to children to justice.However we must not forget the role of parents here either. This is about taking responsibility for your child. I accept that many families are busy and that some children have dficult and complex problems to deal with.But that doesn’t excuse parents from the basics of teaching their children right from wrong, giving them proper boundaries and security. And that means not trying to be their “best friend”.One answer may be to introduce more parenting classes. We know these can work and help parents who might otherwise be struggling.These shouldn’t be for schools to run, but perhaps to run in schools.

The rest of the year, she says, “is really normal most of the time”. Which, to Prince William, who has grown up amid the pomp and circumstance of stuffy royal traditions, must feel like a slice of sheer heaven.Instead, poor love, he and Kate are expected to join the rest of the royalsat Sandringham, where the Queen et al stick to the German tradition of opening gts on Christmas Eve before dressing for a “formal dinner” from which, oh dear, the women eventually retire to another room while the men enjoy a port or brandy.Then it’s off to the highly publicised visit to St Mary’s Magdalene church on Christmas morning, followed by a turkey lunch and a communal viewing of “Granny’s” speech at pm.It’s unclear when William and Kate will head off to see her family, but what’s the betting they get in the car with fixed grins before mumbling “thank God that’s over for another year” the second they hit Norfolk’s A  And that’s why, whatever the truth behind the rumours that Kate and Meghan aren’t getting on, it won’t matter one jot to the admirably grounded Duchess of Cambridge who, thanks to her idyllic childhood, knows exactly who she is.Meghan, on the other hand, has no such cosy alternative to retreat to. Her parents orced when she was just six years old and it’s no secret that she’s now estranged from her father Thomas and his highly vocal, deliciously off-message side of the family.So, however well meaning she is, all her charitable grandstanding and repeated declarations of being “an independent woman” suggest she finds validation from being regarded as a, yawn, groundbreaking feminist role model rather than, as Kate is dismissed by some, a dutul we and mother, who toes the royal line and doesn’t make waves.But Kate has no need to virtue signal because she’s rooted in the love and respect of her tight-knit family — a set-up she’s replicating with William, who, after his own fractured childhood, clearly adores the normality of le Chez Middleton.And of course, they’re both equally secure in the knowledge that, post-“King Charles”, the top job is theirs.Harry, on the other hand, has chosen a bride who, despite her efforts at reinvention, has a chequered pastand a burning desire to be seen as more than just a pretty appendage to the sixth-in-line to the throne.That’s understandable.

The genetic editing also produces a higher muscle mass which means more meat is yielded and it also a lot less fatty.Kim and his colleagues originally produced more than  piglets.However, new images from a the farm in Banteay Meanchey, Cambodia shows the giant pig business is booming with pens packed full of porkers.The farmer raising the pigs is even offering to sell the sperm to others looking to breed the giants.He also shared video footage of the muscle-bound animals squealing as they fight over food.Scientists insist the mutation is safe because rather than transplanting genetic information from one species to another they have simply edited genes.However, at the moment no country allows its people to eat the genetically modied products.The EU bans any importing of genetically modied food into member states amid fears for the safety and quality of the meat.The UK Food Standards Agency said all genetically modiedfood has to undergo a rigorous safety assessment before it is permitted to be placed on the EU market.Animal-lovers reacted with a mixture of horror and fury after viewing the images online.One wrote: “This is grotesque! Obviously bred like this. Are there no laws to stop this sort of thing. Ugh!”Another called the images “unbelievably disgusting”.And a third commented: “What the f*** is this nightmare!!!!   ”Animal rights organisation Peta also blasted the “disturbing” images of the “double-muscled” animals. PETAs Mimi Bekhechi  told Sun Online: “Hulk-like pigs are the stuff of nightmares, not meals, and those who are genetically engineered are also likely to be born with painful health issues. “When South Korean and Chinese scientists created  double-muscled piglets in , only one was considered even marginally healthy. “We urge anyone disturbed by the thought of eating manipulated and mutilated pig flesh to bypass the bacon.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/NINTCHDBPICT000454128887.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"welsh council take away pupils christmas meals","story":"Ysgol Y Parc School in Denbigh did not approve the notice before it was sent out and Denbighshire council has apologised for its mistake.The letter states that eventhe pupils turn up on the day with the £. to pay for the meal, they wont be given the food, it will simply be taken off their debt.Parents called the letter threatening and intimidating and it was brought before the full council in a meeting yesterday.This isnt the first time parents of Ysgol Y Parc pupils have received threatening letters about dinner money debt.At the start of the school term, a single mum was threatened with social service action when she had a debt of £. unpaid.The recent letter said: It is Ysgol Y Parcs school Christmas dinner on December  and for your child to partake in this please ensure that all dinner money arrears are paid up to date.Im afraid WE WILL NOT accept £. on the day - or leading up to that date.

The online system is riddled with faults, complications and delays.There can be no doubt, continuing with this roll-out will leave many of the most vulnerable families destitute by Christmas, and I am asking you to intervene as a matter of urgency.His area is currently seeing the full roll out of Universal Credit.But Amber Rudd blasted the letter as scaremongering.She said tonight: Theres no requirement for a UC claimant to have ID, butyou do purchase one we can actually reimburse you.Where people wont have ID our terric work coaches use many methods to identy someone and get their claim started right away.Many Brits have said they are finding the verication process online dficult - and hundreds of thousands of people have abandoned the online application because they couldnt finish it, recent figures revealed.Only half of claimants said they were able to make a claim online for benefits without help.IF youre experiencing trouble applying for your Universal Credit, or the payments just dont cover costs, here are your options:Apply for an advance - Claimants are able to get some cash within five days rather than waiting weeks for their first payment. But its a loan which means the repayments will be automatically deducted from your future Universal Credit pay out.Alternative Payment Arrangements- If youre falling behind on rent, you or your landlord may be able to apply for an APA which will get your payment sent directly to your landlord. You might also be able to change your payments to get them more frequently, or you can split the paymentsyoure part of a couple.Budgeting Advance - You may be able to get help from the government to help with emergency household costs of up to £youre single, £youre part of a couple or £you have children. These are only in cases like your cooker breaking down or for help getting a job. Youll have to repay the advance through your regular Universal Credit payments. Youll still have to repay the loan, evenyou stop claiming for Universal Credit.Cut your Council Tax - You might be able to get a discount on your Council Tax or be entitled to Discretionary Housing Paymentsyour payments arent enough to cover your rent.Foodbanks - If youre really hard up and struggling to buy food and toiletries, you can find your local foodbank who will provide you with help for free.

Devastating advice from AG.He said the text proved that Northern Ireland would be in full EU customs union while GB is not - putting in a barrier between Northern Ireland and the rest of the country.And Lib Dem Brexit spokesperson Tom Brake blasted: “Nobody voted for Britain to be trapped in a Brexit hamster wheel, constantly haggling with close partners on trade as the country gets poorer.Today Commons leader Andrea Leadsom said MPs will live to regret forcing the Government into publishing it.It was just one of three votes Theresa Mays administration lost last night.The news comes as:She said it undermined decadesnot centuries of convention where ministers were able to receive advice in secret.And she would only back Mrs May as PM at the moment.The Prime Minister will face PMQs in the Commons later today, followed by the continuation of the debate on her Brexit deal.MPs will have their crunch vote on it next week - where the PM is all but certain to lose.Ms Leadsom said today thatthe PMs deal was thrown out in the vote next week, Britain would leave without a deal.Other MPs are determined to stop that happening, saying theres no majority for that to pass in the Commons.Unless government were to do something completely dferent to change tack, or indeed to pass this deal, then we will be leaving the EU on  March next year without a deal, so it defaults to no deal, Ms Leadsom said this morning.Last night MPs won the power to block No Deal and call a second referendumthe PM lost the vote.  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

and very tricky to win votes on other issues too.CAN SHE WIN THE VOTE ON THE DEAL As many as  Tory backbenchers have said they wont back Mrs May when the withdrawal agreement comes up for a vote on Tuesday.With the DUP voting against, the PM would need to attract support from a large minority of Labour MPs to have any hope of winning.Right now, it looks like Mrs May is on course for a heavy defeat in the Commons next week.To win, dozens of MPs from both main parties would have to change their minds over the coming days.Without any drastic changes to the deal, its hard to see why so many rebels would fall in line at the last minute.WHAT HAPPENS IF THE DEAL FALLS Theres an EU summit in Brussels starting next Thursday - just two days after the Commons vote.If the PM has lost, she is likely to ask European leaders for tweaks to the withdrawal agreement.She will demand a way of Britain leaving the hated Irish backstop without getting trapped in the EU customs union indefinitely.Mrs May could thento the Commons and try to win the vote the second time around.Alternatively, she could pivot to a Norway-style Brexit - leaving Britain in the sngle market but taking us out of the customs union.That option is supported by senior Tories, but would be controversial because it would keep the UKs borders open.Otherwise, the country will be on the path to No Deal - unless Remainers force a second referendum on Brexit.COULD MRS MAY LOSE HER JOB OVER THIS If the PM is defeated by a margin of more than , she will be under intense pressure to resign.She would then continue as acting PM until a new Tory leader is elected by members - or be replaced by another interim leader, probably her no David Lidington.Evenshe wanted to stay at No, she could face challenges from inside or outside the Tory party.Rebellious MPs could succeed in getting the  letters they need for a vote on whether she can continue as party leader.And Labour would launch a confidence vote in the Commons -

In a stinging attack the Labour leader accused the Tories of creating a hostile environment for those on benefits. He referred to a string of photographs of Tory MPs at foodbanks in their constituencies which have been promoted on social media in recent weeks.Mr Corbyn was visibly angered when the Prime Minister dismissed again the findings of the UN Special Rapporteur who said the Government’s policies and drastic cuts were “entrenching high levels of poverty and inflicting “unnecessary” hardship in one of the richest countries in the world. Asked which part of the report she found most shocking, Theresa May responded: We have been clear ashas been, that we dont agree with this report because what we actually see in our country today is absolute poverty at record lows, more people in work than ever before, youth unemployment almost halved, wages growing - and thats because of the balanced approach we take to our economy.  In his report Mr Alston, said the Government’s policies and drastic cuts were “entrenching high levels of poverty and inflicting “unnecessary” hardship in one of the richest countries in the world. His damning report said ministers were “in denial” about how the Universal Credit had pushed people into poverty. Today Mr Corbyn said the Government does not agree with his findings because the report presents an unpalatable truth. He added: The new Work and Pensions Secretary seems to have taken a lesson from her and created a hostile environment for those that are claiming benefits.  One of the Governments policies that is causing the greatest anxiety and poverty is Universal Credit, the UN rapporteur Professor Alston said it was fast falling into universal discredit. When will the Prime Minister demonstrate some of her professed concern about burning injustices and halt the roll-out of Universal Credit   Mrs May responded by saying the Government had listened to concerns about the benefit and had made changes. Fury erupted on the Tory benches after Mr Corbyn, during his final question, said: When I hear a Prime Minister talking about dficult decisions, what always happens afterwards in this context is the poorest lose out in our society - . million disabled people are now in poverty, , were hit by appalling cuts to the Employment Support Allowance benefit alone last year. This Government labelled disabled people scroungers, it called those unable to work skivers... Mrs May could be seen saying outrageous, while Tory colleagues shouted Withdraw! at Mr Corbyn, which prompted Commons Speaker John Bercow to intervene.  Mr Bercow took against Home Secretary Sajid Javid for offering advice, adding: He should seek to discharge his own obligations in his office to the best of his ability - I require no advice fromon the discharge of mine. Be clear about that. Mr Corbyn added: This Government also created a hostile environment for the Windrush generation. Mrs May faced MPs after bruising triple defeat in the House of Commons on Tuesday night. The SNPs Ian Blackford accused the Prime Minister of concealing the facts on her Brexit deal after her government became the first to be found in contempt of Parliament.

The MP for Ross, Skye and Lochaber asked: Is it time that the Prime Minister took responsibility for concealing the facts on her Brexit deal from members in this House and the public  Will she take responsibility  Mrs May insisted the full legal advice the government was forced to publish was the same as the shortened statement made earlier this week.

We vote for representatives, then ask them to rely on their judgement to decide everything until we demand they rely on ours. But with Brexit the whole things gone cockeyed. We voted for those who suggested our relationship with the EU was simple. Parliament voted enthusiastically for a simple referendum. The people gave a simple answer, the government issued a simple letter. The courts were the first ones to decide it was complicated and journalists have spent the past two years failing to explain much at all. Its hardly surprising were now in a world where simple people still demand a simple Brexit and that politicians rely on the people to figure it out for them. A ComRes poll shows that people oppose remaining in the EU, oppose leaving with Theresa Mays deal, oppose a second referendum and oppose leaving without a deal. Their big idea instead is to renegotiate, despite the fact weve done that for two years and all the clowns achieved was a joke buttonhole that squirts water at the EU infor poundbillion. Politicians are now so confused about whos supposed to be doing what that the Disgraced Dr Liam Fox says theres a real danger that MPs may attempt to stealBrexit from the British people, and Michael Gove said that not delivering a simple thing that isnt possible because its more complicated than that would be a fatal blow to faith in democracy. Andrea Leadsom smilingly added that Parliamentarians who want to be in government in the future will live to regret the decision they took last night, as though she were a Mafia consigliere threatening painful retribution against those who disrespected the Prime Minister. Lets just stop there. Lets go back a bit, and explain. In  there was a massive, global, banking crash. Had it been ignored by politicians everyone would be living out of dustbins by now. All right, Richard Branson would be in Necker and Alan Sugar on his yacht, but it would be dustbins for them too.   Politicians worldwide did their jobs and figured out a solution. Two years later there was a general election and the people couldnt pick a team, so politicians had to form their own. Bizarrely, the party that came second wasnt part of it. The not-quite winners teamed up with the actual-losers and took power with barely a flicker of democratic concern.In the years that followed they housed immigrants in areas that rarely voted for their parties. Despite the fact such people produced more tax than they spent, they cut services in those places more than in friendlier ones. The aim, and result, was that Labour-voting areas became more xenophobic and more likely to turn Tory on immigration issues. They declared the previous administration profligate, then accumulated so many debts theyve started selling them off. They promised a northern powerhouse, while investing poundbn in the south and cutting investment by poundbn in the north.Thats not normal behaviour for politicians of any stripe, as theyre usually fully aware they can be sacked at short notice. But THIS lot established fixed, five-year contracts, which meant democracy was limited.When we were finally allowed a vote, the people picked the team which had been doing all the above but pretending that it wasnt. That team then opted to protect itself - not the country - by offering a referendum on leaving the EU which it thought no-one would want to do. But the people, now thoroughly confused by lies, theft, quantitative easing, Question Time, austerity, bananas and everything  hurled at them for years, picked the easy road - the f*** it road. The team captains ran away, the pound noseed, and those left on the field started barking the chaos was all Project Fear and could be completely ignored.   A new team captain activated Article  and told Parliament it had no say. The courts intervened to say Parliament was sovereign. Newspapers said judges were the enemy. Parliament was cowed into backing Article , even though it was vague and fully-revokable.The government then spent two years not negotiating a deal that isnt actually a deal, before telling the people and Parliament its the only option when it isnt. Few people notice that were preparing to leave the EU with , more people in poverty than we had  years ago, or have asked whether Brexit is in their interests.When the four estates of a democratic nation are in such turmoil and acting in direct opposition to their normal roles, there is nothing to do but hold on and hope for the best. And now, the ship of state is righting itself. Journalists are explaining complexities and detail. Judges are regarded as refuge. And Parliament has, finally, begun holding government to account.   For the first time in history, those ruling the country have been proven to be in contempt of our democratic processes. For the first time since the Brexit vote, the government has been forced to bow to the will of those figuring things out on behalf of the people. And for the first time in  years the Mother of Parliaments is acting like a grown-up - something that happens when loyal MPs rebel for a principle, when politicians seek to listen to one anothers arguments, when the people take an interest in what is being decided on their behalf. Nothing is perfect. We live in a world where racists claim the same freedom of expression as journalists, and believe that makes it all right to hurl homophobic slurs at a columnist while chasing him down the street, to threaten Jewish MPs online, to cause BBC reporters to need bodyguards. In the past decade, the confusion in our system has been fed by fake news, populism and idiots. The reason that these things - more properly called propaganda, fascism and the unelectable - do not dominate our world is because the system self-corrects. Each part pushes and pulls against the others, and the result is stable, slow, progress.  That is what happened in Parliament yesterday. Its what, hopefully, will continue this week while they vote on Brexit. Remember ityou are asked to vote again. Remember it when a journalist tries to explain, when judges rule, when MPs rebel and amend and argue. Elsewhere, with Parliaments that do not scrutinise the government, dictators hold power. Where journalists cannot explain, the people are kept in ignorance. And where those things are actively attacked, the world grows dark -  journalists were murdered this year while  languish in jail, most of them for crimes against the state. While Putin and Bin Salman high-five after the dismemberment of a journalist, remember that reporters are the first bit of democracy that dies. In their wake come the opponents, the judges, and then the people. However confusing and chaotic your democracy is, hold on to it. Be glad you have an MP, especiallythey dont always do as theyre told. Seek out a journalist whos explained well and say thank you, because the occasional pat is the only encouragement they need to keep headbutting walls. Note what happens when people dont vote, and make sure you do. Above all, be glad you have an opportunity to argue about your nations direction, and that youre not the only one steering the ship.

The Tories have  MPs, plus she has a confidence and supply deal with Northern Ireland’s Democratic Unionist Party, so all will be well for the Prime Minister, yes  Emphatically, no. In fact, she appears doomed to certain defeat, unable to cobble together the numbers to force her blueprint through the Commons. Thanks to Mrs May needlessly squandering David Cameron’s hard-won,fragile, majority at last year’s snap general election - the one she never needed to call - she has to rely on the DUP to win parliamentary votes. But despite the poundbillion bung she conjured up for the Ulster hardliners, the DUP will not support the pact because elements of the deal would make Northern Ireland dferent from the rest of the UK. That strips away the PM’s stitched-together majority in a trice. In her own party, insiders believe up to nine Tory Remainers could vote against the deal, piling further pressure on the premier.   And then there is the European Research Group, a seemingly innocent name for the Conservatives’ hardline Brexiteers. Scores of its members are set to revolt unless Mrs May conjures a compromise. Sources estimate up to  Tory MPs could vote against the deal. While some Labour MPs may rebel against Jeremy Corbyn and offer their support, it is highly unlikely to be anywhere near enough to save the PM’s pact. What happened in the Commons yesterday  Theresa May lost three crucial votes. MPs backed a Labour amendment which held the Government in contempt for refusing to publish its full legal advice on the Brexit plan. The advice will now be released, and could confirm the worst fears of the Brexiteers – making even more of them likely to vote down the deal. Then MPs backed an amendment by Tory MP Dominic Grieve which would give MPs a say on what happensTheresa May’s Brexit deal is voted down. This means they could block a no-deal Brexit, send the Prime Minister back to the negotiating table or even call for a second referendum. The PM is no longer in control of Parliament or the Brexit process.   Can Brexit be halted  Remainers have seized on the provisional findings of the The European Court of Justice’s advocate general, who said the UK can decide on its own to cancel its withdrawal from the EU. It is not a binding judgment but suggests the ECJ will come to the same conclusion in its official ruling. This would allow us to revoke Article , the two-year mechanism Mrs May triggered which started the countdown to our departure on March , . What happens next  The key moment is on Tuesday when MPs vote on Mrs May’s Brexit plan. Unless she persuades Tory rebels to change their mind she is heading for almost certain defeat. More than  Conservative MPs, the DUP, the vast majority of Labour MPs,  Lib Dems and the SNP have all said they will vote down the proposal. But some Brexiteers may take fright at Mr Grieve’s amendment, fearing it could scupper Brexit. What does the Prime Minister doshe loses  We are in uncharted territory. The law says Mrs May has toto Parliament within  days with an updated response. Much will depend on the scale of defeat. If it is close she could try to wring further concessions from Brussels. If she is heavily defeated she will be under intense pressure to resign.   Where does that leave Brexit  Nobody knows. MPs could send the PM back to Brussels but that would need the EU to agree to extend Article . Or Mrs May could call a snap election. This is a high-risk move for the Tories as it could land Jeremy Corbyn in No . MPs could also decide only a second referendum can break the deadlock. The default is that we crash out without a deal. But most MPs will do everything they can to prevent what they see as an economic calamity.

He told the Treasury Committee: “The signicant things that would need to be done at Doverwe are to have a WTO type arrangement with the European Union would involve some very signicant infrastructure works that could not be done in a matter of months. It would be years to complete.” Askedit would take two years, he said: “Well, I would suggest the planning system might struggle to approve such signicant infrastructure changes in two years, let alone get them built. So I think it would take quite a lot longer to deliver the kind of major infrastructure changes that would be neededwe were going to be looking at a long-term WTO-type relationship.” The Chancellor also revealed he plans to hold a Spring Statement before the end of March. The UK is set to leave the EU on March .  He told MPs that modelling conducted by the Treasury and other Whitehall departments showed that the UK would be worse-off economically under any Brexit scenario. But Mr Hammond insisted that it was worth taking what would be a very small economic hit under the Governments preferred Brexit in order to avoid the political and societal harm from cancelling EU withdrawal. The Chancellor told the Commons Treasury Committee: The analysis clearly shows that leaving the EU under any scenario that we are modelling has a cost - an economic cost. But he added: My own judgment is that we need a way forward which heals our country. We are a deeply fractured country, with opinion heavily polarised and trust in the political system correspondingly damaged. I would suggest... that ided countries are not successful countries. I have thought long and hard about this, and I have come to the conclusion that the future success of our country depends on us executing the instructions of the British people in the referendum, leaving the EU, but doing so in a way that minimises the impact on our economy and maximises the opportunity that we have in the future, so that we can come together as a nation and work together to exploit those opportunities in the future. Any solution which left the country ided, left a large segment of the population feeling betrayed, in my view, would have a negative political and societal impact that would far outweigh the very small economic impact that the White Paper scenario is showing.

But as our story in this paper tells today – she also wanted to look a little dferent more curvy, younger, perhaps like she’d done a few years back. And that terrible quest to look a little dferent has ended in her death from a cardiac arrest following a bottom op or ‘bum lt’ at a clinic in Hungary. She’d initially only wanted a tummy tuck, breast lt and liposuction. But the offer of a freebie bum lt was presumably too good to resist.  There are few of us in our late s who’ve been through the ravages of childbirth and all that follows who don’t wish we were a little more taut or toned. . And while cosmetic surgery was for a long time regarded as an shyindulgence for the young, vain or feckless – it’s now within the budgets and imaginations of us all. Which is why the realities of its dangers need to be in the minds of us all too – and why today’s warning by Kirk so needs to be heard. For Tryce’s terrible story is by no means unique. Only last week we told the story of how another mum – -year-old Louise Harvey – died after developing a blood clot following a boob job.

And with the average grandparent having four grandchildren, that adds up to a total of pound.. With an estimated . million nannas and grandpops set to celebrate Christmas this year, that means they could spend a staggering pound,,, across the nation on presents. Ian Atkinson, director of marketing at SunLe, which commissioned the research, said: “Grandparent spending looks to have increased from last year. Grandparents are spending around pound more per grandchild than they did last year, according to our research from  months ago. “Everyone knows a grandparent loves to spoil little ones at Christmas – but they can also struggle to know what they might want and end up buying presents that are either unwanted or inappropriate, we have a free grandparent’s gt guide.”  The study also found four in  grandparents say their favourite thing about the Christmas season is spending time with their grandkids, while almost one in five love to give people presents.

And more than one in twenty even have times where they worry they’ve not spent enough on gts.

Ian Atkinson added: “With over pound billion being spent, grandchildren today can certainly look forward to more at Christmas than their own grandparents did, and their expectations have probably never been higher.

This Tory Government is a shambles. I am reminded of this every time I walk into the House of Commons and look at the Tory frontbench. Do they see the country as we do  Do they care that young families are living off foodbanks  How do they explain to their kids why more and more people are sleeping on our streets  Can we trust the Tories with the future of our country  Since  the answer has been no. And that’s why Labour MPs will vote against this Tory Brexit next week. We have to end the need for foodbanks.  We have to get people off the streets. This should be the priority for towns all over Britain. Until there is a solution to that, no one should trust the Tories on our future. Worse than that though, May’s Brexit deal isn’t even a plan. Brexit has already taken up two long years in which the Prime Minister couldn’t even get the Tories in her own Cabinet to agree, let alone her MPs. The House of Commons is in deadlock. That’s why all she is offering now is a vague ‘political statement’, which tells us nothing about the future. If we vote for it, we will be voting for two more years of wrangling and greater uncertainty. It will drag on and on and on. Many Labour members and voters are coming to the conclusion that the only way out of this mess is to let the public have the final say.  Parliament has ground to a halt. Meanwhile poverty is rising. If we can’t boot the Tories out with a general election then let’s take power form their hands and give the final verdict to the public. Has Brexit been a resounding success  Do we trust the Tories with our country  I think we all know the answer to that.

National Express Coach Managing Director Chris Hardy said “Christmas is a time for friends and family, and for thousands of Brits, it’s the only time this year that the entire clan is gathered around one table. “We understand that le often takes us far away from home, and can separate us from our hometowns and family.  “We also know that Christmas can be a particularly challenging time to travel, and making your way across the country to see friends and family can sometimes feel impossible. “We aim to make it easier for families who may find themselves separated by hundreds of miles this Christmas, by helping to bring them together.” National Express is the only national public transport network fully operating across the UK throughout the festive period with services on Christmas Day, Boxing Day and New Year’s Day. And more than , extra seats are being added to services over the festive period. The average Brit will travel  miles on their trip home for Christmas to visit family.  And four in five of those surveyed look forward to the journey home for the festivities. Twenty nine per cent enjoy the feeling they get when they are closer to home, and one in five feel relaxed as they make tracks back to their hometown. Though only  per cent believe it will be possible to see everyone they want to reconnect with this Christmas.

Alexander Heavens waited until his partner had nodded off in bed before placing her thumb print on the iPhones home button to access her texts and emails. The -year-old then woke her up to interrogate her throughout the night as to who everyone was. He has now been convicted of psychological abuse. In the last year of their six year romance, Heavens, from Failsworth, near Oldham, Greater Manchester, would also demand the pin code on her phone to check her messages. And during rows he bit her on the arm and bent her fingers back so far that she thought they might break. At Manchester Crown Court, Heavens admitted engaging in controlling and coercive behaviour in an intimate relationship. The court heard the couples relationship soured in Christmas  after he suffered bouts of paranoia due to his cocaine use. Prosecutor Rob Smith said: [She] always had issues with his temper but had never taken things out on her. She said things started to change when he met new friends in November . He began spending time with these new friends and subsequently taking drugs.  He started taking his anger out on her and was paranoid about her actions. The first incident in , the defendant became angry because she was spending time with her family rather than him. They rowed about it and he kept arguing with her about it until he bit her and bruised her upper arm. After  his behaviour worsened with her, particularly when he alleged that she had been with other men. During arguments, he began bending her fingers back so far that she thought they were going to break. When she was asleep he would grab her finger and use it to unlock her phone as it had her fingerprint ID code. He used this to check her phone messages and go through her contacts. He would wake her up and ask who everyone was and keep her up all night. Her work became affected and she became sleep deprived. On one occasion she was going to sleep when he asked her a question about something on her phone, and when he didnt get a reply he punched her in the face. She remembers being pushed to the kitchen floor, stood on and trampled on. He called her on another occasion whilst she was in bed and woke her up asking for her pin code to gain access to her phone. One morning she woke to find him watching pornography on her phone, which he had been doing all night. In March  she found messages suggesting he was seeing someone . When he responded to her he began screeching at her, ran to the kitchen and he got hold of a kne and held it to his stomach. She tried to calm him down but he was continuing to shout at her so she decided to leave. She was worried he would use the kne on her or himself. After this he continued getting angry with her and his behaviour worsened even more to the point that whenever she said something he didnt like, he punched her twice to the face.  She decided she had enough, she said she was shattered and ended the relationship on her birthday in October . When he was arrested he denied all allegations and said it made him laugh to say he was controlling as he had never lay a finger on her. In a statement, the partner said: I have always tried to help him but he has responded with abuse both physically and mentally. He sent numerous messages, he visited me at home and he would always call me when I was with my family.In mitigation, defence lawyer Stuart Duke said: The defendant accepts he is guilty of controlling behaviour. This was his first long term relationship. He accepts he behaved badly. He was drinking a lot after the breakup, he took it badly, and he was taking cocaine. Deferring sentence for six months, Judge Martin Rudland said: The public needs to be aware that this sort of behaviour wont be tolerated. This behaviour needs to be properly met with an appropriate sentence. I have come to the conclusion it is in the public interest that this sort of behaviour must be acknowledged, but not today. I have no doubt he has suffered with his own demons, and he hasnt helped himself by the consumption of alcohol and cocaine. He needs to put some distance between him and these events. The court needs to see what he can do by way of addressing the problems he has. He needs to put this behind him and stabilise his le. This doesnt mean he wont get an immediate sentence. He can get a lot of self help here. This will still be hanging over him. Addressing Heavens he said: Please be under no illusion, this is an extremely serious course of conduct. This course of conduct often takes place behind closed doors and is dficult to detect. Victims are often too afraid to go to the police, doctors or hospital and so it goes undetected for some time. I am going to defer your sentence, which means you can address your problems and you need to grasp those demons that come with them. You must understand Mr Heavens, this has been a close run thing. You have been given a chance to address your issues, and your family can support your through this. Heavens was banned from contacting his ex under the terms of a restraining order.

When she was outside the Warrant Officers and Sergeants’ Mess, Kate chatted to Rhian Davis, , who was carrying -week-old daughter Dorothy in a sling. Rhian said: She asked whether she was sleeping through the night and she told me that Louis is starting to wave.  Kate sharpened her look for the occasion, wearing black flares and a green blazer.

One year old Mia Williams frowned at the Duchess, who laughed and told her: Its scary meeting new people. Mum Christine Williams, , said: Im so excited. It means loads - just that they know we are here and appreciate all we are doing. Its lovely to see them. It makes it all worthwhile.  Kate received flowers and a teddy bear and made a beeline for Harrison Brown, eight, who was wearing a jacket covered in dinosaurs, telling him it would go down well with her son, Prince George. The schoolboy was not too clear on who she meant though and he said: She said she know someone, called George I think, she said he would like the jacket. Samantha Sahota, five, told Kate she was upset the Duchess had not worn pink or a crown or arrived in a carriage. Her grandmother Helen, who has run a jewellery shop on the camp for the past  years and met previous royal visitors including the Queen and Princess Anne, said: Kate promised that next time she would weara pink dress and a crown.

Researchers announced they have carried out , “whole genomic sequencing” on volunteers which can diagnose the lelong risk of cancers. Genetic data from five million Brits will help decide how best to treat tumours and predict how they will react to surgery or chemotherapy. The test, which currently cost around pound per person, also means people at risk of a certain cancer can alter their diet or take pills so they never develop it. Scientists say the gene sequencing could become “routine” and one day replace the current heel prick test at birth. It could lead to genes from every child being sampled in a bid to invent a cancer cure.   The Government says the NHS is the world’s first healthcare system to role out sequencing the human genome on such a scale. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: “Sequencing the ,th genome is a major milestone in the route to the healthcare of the future. “Britain has led the world in this amazing technology and we do so again today as we map a course to sequencing a million genomes.Understanding the human code on such a scale is part of our mission to provide truly personalised care to help patients live longer, healthier and happier lives. The DNA sequencing of five million Brits will be taken in the next five years including the comprehensive whole genomic test on one million of the volunteers. Many tumours will not spread but it is dficult to know which are harmless and which will become deadly.Biopsies, chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgery can sometimes do more harm than good.  Anonymised DNA data from the patients along with their medical history will allow computers to predict how a tumour will react to ious treatments. Sir John Chisholm, chair of Genomics England which leads the project, said: “The results of this will be felt for many generations to come as the benefits of genomic medicine in the UK unfold. “It should become routine at some point in the future that your health record will contain some form of genomic test,” he added. DNA tests are already carried out on the NHS for a specic genetic mutation or risk. Whole genomic sequencing tests are dferent as they look for mutations linked to  dferent cancers and , other diseases. Since the , Genomes Project was launched in  around , of the , volunteers had rare unexplained diseases diagnosed for the first time.A further , were diagnosed with cancers and given more effective treatment. Professor Mark Caulfield, chief scientist at Genomics England, said genomic sequencing could replace the current heel prick test which tests for devastating neurological conditions. “Currently they do the heel prick test to look for nine dferent conditions,” he told a briefing in central London yesterday. “There may be potential in the future to look at much more and thereby avoid early le harm. “There are some conditions thatyou know about them could change the trajectory of the le of the child. There might be potential in the future to look more at avoiding whole le harm. “We might not feed [the information] to them in childhood but there are some conditions thatyou knew about them at birth could change the le of the child.   “There are examples where we can put children on a special diet or be given a treatment.” Health bosses said in future patients DNA data could be used with wearable biometric devices to flag up the risk of disease before it develops. They also admitted their had been attempts by hackers to access the DNA database. Foreign hackers were behind the unsuccessful attempts to get hold of the genomic data could be lucrative for firms to develop new treatments. Sir John said: “For sure these attempts have come from overseas.” Security measures adopted to protect patient information included employing a company to mount a simulated firewall assault. Since  when the first human genome was sequenced the cost of the process has plummeted from pound billion to just pound.   As the cost falls further whole genome sequencing will become more commonplace and wide-ranging, said the project leaders. A complete genome includes all of a person’s genes plus the DNA that does not directly code for proteins but may influence gene activity. Hidden within the genome may be altered elements of DNA that can trigger or worsen disease, or cause adverse reactions to medicines. Since  when the project was launched automated systems have been sequencing patient genomes at a rate of  a day. The initial target of , genomes has now been met with , sequences officially recorded. The number exceeds that of the , patients who contributed their DNA because every participant with cancer has three genomes sequenced.

Pupils arrived at Flowery Field Primary School in Hyde on Tuesday to find a crime scene, including drops of fake blood, as part of a writing exercise. The schools headteacher, Ian Fell, said the eight and nine-year-old children loved playing detectives in the engaging and exciting writing exercise, reports Manchester Evening News. However, some parents have been left concerned and one mum claims her daughter suffered nightmares as a result of the extreme project. The mum, who asked not to be named, said: There was a crime scene in one of the classrooms.  There was police tape and a table had been knocked over, and there were blood smeared on one of the tables. The idea was elf had been murdered by another elf. My daughter came home and she was absolutely traumatised. Im not the only parent who felt like that. A lot of the kids in Year  were unsettled by it. I am very open with my children and I understand you cant protect them from everything. But my child was very upset last night and had to sleep in my bed. The school says a crime scene had been set up in one of the classroom.  Headteacher Mr Fell said: The children were all excited and they really did buy into it. One of the children said to me I am definitely being a detective when I grow up. Of all of the  children who took part, none of them showed anything but full engagement. I am delighted also that the topic appealed to children with SEND dficulties or those who find accessing work more dficult too. I have been a teacher for  years and this is, in my judgement, an appropriate, engaging and exciting thing that children aged eight and nine have done. They have been so up for it.

Sophie White suffered severe chest pains, a painful three-month cough and severe tiredness, but says she was repeatedly turned away by her GP.The teenager was battling the worsening symptoms as she took her A-Levels, incredibly managing to get the grades for her first choice uni.versity. It was only after eight months of fighting that the keen runner got an X-Ray which revealed she had a cm tumour in her chest – news that turned her heart to “sludge”.She was forced to put her le on hold for a year to beat the disease and thankfully the resident from Basildon, Essex, got the treatment she needed. But she has urged other youngsters not to give up and fight for answers from doctors.Miss White said: “You know your own body better than anyone so trust what you feel and keep going until you get the answers you need.“Just keep on fighting. When I got the call that they had found a mass on the right side of my chest I felt my heart sunk to a sludge.“I never expected that to happen, it was quite frustrating for me and my family as I had been so many times.“In a way I was relieved as I knew something was wrong with me and could be done about it, but I was petried.”She added: “It should have been picked up earlier as I had been to the doctors five or six times over eight months before I was diagnosed.” After being diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma the brave youngster was referred to the Teenage Cancer Trust unit at the University College of London in September .A gruelling chemotherapy and radiotherapy regime followed which she bravely endured whilst her friends were enjoying their first year of university.And whilst they were styling their hair for nights on the town, she lost her locks as she endured six cycles of chemotherapy and  days of radiotherapy.“Losing my hair was the worst thing at first as that is what you associate with cancer but it does get better, you just adapt to it,” she said. “Being in the ward made it better as you realise you are not the odd one out and seeing everyone there being comfortable with no hair.”And added: “It was hard to watch my friends go off to uni and have the best time.“I made a friend who was in the same situation as me and it helped to be able to talk to her about it.“She knew how it felt to see people carry on with their lives while we were stuck in a little bubble.“Because my friends were all away at university, they couldn’t visit as much and when they were back it was hard to catch upI was feeling unwell.“That made my friendships with people I met through Teenage Cancer Trust even more important as I didn’t feel isolated.” Thankfully she got the all clear in the summer and was able to go to get her le back on track and is now studying Biological Sciences at Reading University.“I was so ready, I was just waiting to go to university,” she said.“I love my course and after having a year of being so dependent it is nice to be free.” And she has heaped praise on the Teenage Cancer Trust who helped her.“You wouldn’t expect it, but the Teenage Cancer Trust units have such a happy atmosphere and my friends could visit at basically any time, which was brilliant,” she said.“You’d always have people coming in to talk, like the ward school teachers, and music teachers, who didn’t come in to talk about anything medical, just to talk to you in a friendly way. “I feel so lucky to have been given my treatment at a Teenage Cancer Trust unit. It changed my outlook on my situation.”The Teenage Cancer Trust has urged others to follow in her footsteps and to keep fighting for a diagnosis.Sasha Daly , deputy director of policy and influencing said: “Cancer, whilst rare in young people compared to adults, is still the biggest killer of young people by disease.“We know that early diagnosis can make all the dference.“We too often hear heart-breaking stories about young people who are diagnosed with cancer too late.“We want this and future generations to be armed with the right information, so they are more likely to feel confident to visit their GP or talk to their familythey have any health concerns.”"},{"url":null,"title":"final horrific hours little boy","story":"NewsFinal horric hours of little boy tortured to death by his mum and her boyfriendWARNING: UPSETTING IMAGE Anthony Avalos, , was allegedly murdered by his mum and stepdad in Calornia, US, after coming out as gayShareCommentsBySophie Evans:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC NewsAnthony Avalos, , was allegedly murdered by his mum and her boyfriend \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe horric final hours of a little boy allegedly tortured to death by his mum and her boyfriend have been revealed in court papers.Anthony Avalos, , was murdered by his mother Heather Barron and stepfather Kareem Leiva after coming out as gay, prosecutors claim.And in the last hours of his short le, he was allegedly subjected to brutal torture, leaving him with injuries all over his small body.Grand jurors in the US heard how the youngster was found with sunken eyes, small burns and circular marks below his nipple. He also had scabs on all four of his extremities, was so thin that his ribs were exposed, and had bruises on his buttocks and back.The coroners report documented injuries all over Anthonys body, assistant district attorney in the case, Jonathan Hatami, told jurors.   There were injuries to Anthonys side and his hip area, both his left hip and his right hip, and his arms, and even injuries to his feet. Mr Hatami also said the coroners report suggested there was blunt force trauma to the boys head and brain, Eyewitness News reports.And he suffered multiple blunt force trauma to his body.The shocking allegations have come to light after a Calornia judge ordered the unsealing of grand jury proceeding transcripts.Barron, , and Leiva, , who is ft in, have both pleaded not guilty to charges that they tortured Anthony and murdered him.

He claimed that the two defendants caused injury to Anthony by beating him with objects such as belts and a vacuum hose. They also allegedly used wrestling moves and chokeholds on the little boy, made him kneel on rice and locked him in his room for days.And they reportedly withheld food or water from him.The prosecutor said the evidence heard in the case will clearly show Barron and Leiva are ultimately responsible for Anthonys murder. They brutally tortured and intentionally murdered him, he said.The documents were unsealed on Monday on the order of Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Kathleen Kennedy, Fox  reports.

They allegedly had to fight the youngster and keep watch “so he would remain standing or kneeling”. Mr Hatami wrote in an indictment: “At one point Anthony could not walk, was unconscious lying on his bedroom floor for hours, was not provided medical attention, and could not eat on his own.”  Anthony had previously said that he “liked boys”, the deputy director of the Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family Services confirmed.Sherf’s deputies were called to the little boys home a day before he died - with his mum allegedly claiming he had fallen down the stairs.

This is perhaps why one mum was left feeling rather shocked after two midwives started openly discussing her pubic hair while she was in hospital.  The revelation came as part of a thread on Mumsnet about pubic hair, in which a woman pondered why some people are obsessed with shaving and waxing their lady garden. Hundreds took the time to respond to the original post, sharing their own personal grooming methods. One mum started by saying that she thinks most women completely remove their pubic hair nowadays. She then went on to explain that the reason she thinks this, is because of a bizarre experience she had after giving birth.  The woman claims that while her midwives were stitching up a vaginal tear, they told her they thought her full head of pubic hair was unusual. I think full removal is really common, she wrote. The MWs who stitched up my second degree tear were both discussing my full head and how unusual it was these days. My womens health physio said the same. People on the thread were outraged by her words and slammed the midwives for being so unprofessional.  One said: I hope you told all three of them to shut the f*** up and then reported them to their superiors  Another commented: Agree, it’s not on for them to comment. Also, shaving can cause ingrown hair and infection and that’s not what you think any when pregnant. A third posted: OMG Im due no. in April and I will be mortiedthe MW starts discussing my full bush!

A video shows four real-le pets sitting alongside the automated animals, making it hard to pick out which dogs are real and which arent. The clip was filmed in Sao Paulo, Brazil, where three Golden Retrievers and a Bernese Mountain Dog make themselves at home in the heart of the festive display. And the well-behaved dogs sit perfectly still among the ten mechanical Golden Retrievers. The video has been widely shared online, with the person who posted it writing: A group of friends who own Golden Retrievers, along with a friend who owns a Bernese, were in the mall to see the Christmas decorations with the Goldens tree.  In order to participate in the Goldens Christmas, the Bernese was disguised as a Golden Retriever as well. One Golden Retriever is seen sitting on a red sofa, while the three others sit shoulder to shoulder with the robots, who appear to be nodding.  There is also a Father Christmas towering over the pets, holding a bunch of red flowers. The friendly-looking dogs crowd around Santa in the popular clip.

It can really hurt teams,” said Jim.“We didn’t utilise Jesse and Calvin’s pace nearly enough at Hibs but they are still young and they are still learning their positions.“We have that pace, though, andyou take our three midfielders last Saturday, although Paul McGowan doubled up as a striker because of the system we wanted to play, you look at Martin Woods, you look at Glen Kamara you look at Paul McGowan, every one of them can pick a pass.“They are clever players and they can spot a pass, sowe make the runs early enough we can use that. We have Kenny Miller’s nous as well because he makes clever runs up front.”Looking towards Wednesday’s vital home clash with Hamilton, Jim will have the same squad as was on duty in the capital to pick from.“There were a few bumps and bruises but nothing serious and they should all be OK.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/12/5c06792c48e51.jpg ","title":"charlotte 12 calls on dundee parents to embrace electric vehicles for sake of their children","story":"A young girl who travelled almost  miles to Dundee to see how the city has embraced electric vehicles has called on parents to consider making the switch for the sake of their children.Charlotte Smith, , has been made an honorary member of pro-EV body EVA Scotland for her efforts to encourage the uptake of electric cars at home in Solihull, near Birmingham.Together with dad Steven, Charlotte made the -mile journey to Dundee to meet a group of local EV owners and give them her own handmade “thank you” cards in recognition of their efforts to reduce harmful emissions.Charlotte has thanked more than  EV drivers at home and gave out dozens of cards on her visit to Dundee.Speaking to the Tele, she said: “When I was a bit younger I started getting a cough and I didn’t know why.“I did a research project on it for school with my dad and he said that it could be the emissions.

That’s a big part of the game, but then it’s got to be equal measure of praise as well and that’s important.”It’s something Jim wants from his squad as a whole because he knows most will be called into action during a December programme that will bring seven games in just three-and-a-half weeks.A run of games that starts with Hamilton on Wednesday and ends with the pre-winter break Tayside derby against St Johnstone on December , will stretch resources but the gaffer is viewing it as a chance to pick up vital points.“It’s the same for everyone. It’s just about making sure you are recovering well between games and getting ready to go.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn#t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry#s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say ,. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don#t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormousof coastline. Scotland#s coast is about , kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate # an enormously expensive system both in money and CO emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant # it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September  is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are , people with dementia in Scotland and , people with dementia across Argyll and Bute.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

We have ended up with the worst of all possible outcomes, with England and Wales voting to leave and leaving, Northern Ireland voting to remain and retaining a foothold into the EU and Scotland who voted to remain being completely dragged out against its will.No one should fall for this  choice being desperately spun by this isolated Tory Prime Minister, that seeks to force us to choose between a #bad deal# or a #no deal# at all.Brendan O#Hara MP, Argyll and ButeSir,We expect over  schools to be represented at next year’s Scottish Schools Pipe Band Championships, based on the number of school pupils being taught in programmes run by the Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums Trust .The trust now has projects going in  council areas supporting lessons to over , young people.We are getting a large number of enquiries from schools wanting to come along to the event on March  in Livingston.SSPDT aims to safeguard our wonderful musical traditions and to help young people develop skills for le, learning and work, with a focus on deprived and remote areas, by helping to introduce piping and drumming tuition to state schools on a par with orchestral instruments.We established the championships in  to offer a positive and friendly experience for players who are new to competition, and as a forum for bands at the very top of their game.The trust has resources to support more state schools in Scotland to introduce piping and drumming tuition, and we invite local education authorities, teachers and parents to contact us.All enquiries can be made via our website sspdt.org.ukAlexandra Duncan, chief executive, Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums TrustSir,Having campaigned extensively for the re-opening of the A after a landslide in October, I welcome Cabinet Secretary Michael Matheson’s commitment to identying a permanent solution to disruption on the road, whilst continuing to invest in shorter term mitigation measures.Closures to the A lead to untenable ersions and re-routing of traffic onto other roads, which is why is absolutely essential for permanent measures to be put in place to end these closures.The safety of the people who use this road has always been the top priority for the Scottish Government, and I am grateful to all those who have been involved in working towards a practical solution to make this road accessible for local people, visitors and businesses in my constituency.Michael Russell MSP, Argyll and ButeSir,The withdrawal agreement with the European Union has now been published.Our industry has consistently called for clarity over what that UK’s new relationship with the EU will look like in practice, particularly on the continued protection of geographical indications, customs procedures and future trade policy.The provisions set out in the withdrawal agreement provide us with a credible foundation on which to build in the next phase of the negotiations, during which a number of critical issues remain to be resolved.A no-deal Brexit would cause the Scotch whisky industry considerable dficulties and would force cost and complexity into production, distribution and exporting.  The withdrawal agreement is a compromise, but it is a positive step towards much needed business certainty.Karen Betts, chief executive, Scotch Whisky AssociationSir,I am struck by the comments of Theresa May that her Brexit plan will stop EU migrants #jumping the queue# when it comes to working in the UK.How low the UK has sunk that its Brexiteer government is now resorting to spreading resentment towards European citizens, classing them as #queue jumpers#. These iniduals took no part in this mess and work here legally and contribute to the country in so many dferent ways.They have the same general right of freedom of movement that allows British people the opportunity to work in Berlin and Paris, or retire in Spain.Even so, their reward seems to be an increasingly hostile atmosphere. Ms May makes no mention of those British #queue jumpers# in other EU countries, symptomatic no doubt of the same attitude that classes those Brits abroad as #expats#, while those from the other EU countries who come to work here are #immigrants#, an increasingly negative term.Since the referendum in  there has been an alarming increase in both veiled and more explicit verbal abuse to EU nationals, and this will no doubt increase as the negative impacts of Brexit become clearer and scapegoats will be required. Step forward those innocent EU nationals in our midst.The UK has taken a wrong turn, as exhibited by the dog-whistle politics of Theresa May and her Tory government.As the UK enters full panic mode, the victim of a bitter and corrupted Etonian gamble gone very wrong, we must do all that we can to support those EU nationals in our midst and defy this vile populist rhetoric.Alex Orr,  Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"south argyll schools reach bowl final","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Subscribe NowSouth Argyll Schoolstravelled to Eastwood High School in Glasgow on Tuesday November  to play in the Scottish Schools Bowl semi-final.The game was played in good conditions and the team were looking forward to building on their recent quarter final performance.The game started with an early converted try for SAS but they were pulled back to - by half time.

No wonder he looked nervous.The boys got to grips with the dferent handling characteristics of Willie Senior#s car and started to up the pace in the afternoon bringing the car home in a respectable th overall and third in class three. This result was enough to secure second position in the overall championship in class.Jamie Miller continued the learning process with the little Citroen C-RMax with Ian McCulloch pointing him in the right direction. A very neat rally from Jamie with very few mistakes saw him finish a creditable th overall and second in class two, only beaten by the Scottish Tarmac Champion for  Michael Harbour in his similar Citroen, who was only one place above him after seven stages.Innes Mochrie was once again out on the stages in the Mightyand this time he had someone whom he might listen to in the co-driver#s seat. His daughter, Kirsty, had elected to fill the silly seat for this event and they, after a few first stage detours, managed to keep speaking right to the end and brought the class one pocket rocket home in th overall and a brilliant second in class. The mind boggles as to what the result could have been , as Kirsty was heard to remark, she had #someone who would listen to her#.Jonothan MacDonald and Chris Wareham were out in the beautully prepared Mull of Kintyre Cheese sponsored Peugeot . Their pace was good enough for th overall and fourth in class three.Mull pair Malcolm MacDougall and Stuart MacLean were out in the class one Vauxhall Nova and were getting visibly quicker as the day went on, a trend that had repeated itself over the course of the year with confidence and technique increasing with every stage mile covered. They finished th overall and a commendable fourth in class one.There were three Argyll co-drivers directing their pilots around the airfield. Ian Parker, recently announced as one of seven # and the only Scot # co-drivers to be selected to join the MSA Academy for , was back in the Honda Civic of Fraser Smith. The Civic screamed its way round the stages with minimal fuss, other than perhaps a lucky trip on two wheels after clipping a tyre, to finish in nd overall and fourth in class two.The final Argyll man out was Eoghan Anderson from Cairnbaan who was shouting left and right for Greg Inglis of Montrose in his quick and agile Lotus Exige. Eoghan had been co-driver for Alan Kirkaldy in the earlier Granite Stages Rally, also held at Leuchars, and they had been first overall that day, so no pressure there, then.Greg found the Lotus was almost perfect for the stages on the day with a great balance of handling, braking and pace when needed. They were surprised, perhaps unjustly, to find out they were sitting well up the leader board after the first few stages.

Darren Boyd, of Thornyflat Street in Ayr, admitted to assaulting David Mackie on July  this year at McLean Street in Ayr. He also owned up to uttering threats of violence towards him. Boyd appeared before Sherf Scott Pattison at Ayr Sherf Court last week. The court heard how the -year-old ‘repeatedly punched’ Mr Mackie on the head. Depute Fiscal Andrew Lazzarin explained: “At around pm, the complainers were at their home when they heard a noise and went to see what it was. There was a household item lying in the garden. They went to speak to the neighbour about why this was there. “The accused was in the neighbour’s house and assaulted the complainer by repeatedly punching him on the head. “The complainer then went home and the accused went back into the neighbour’s house. The police were contacted and the complainer had a small cut on his lip - he was taken to AE. “Police were unable to find the accused as he had left the neighbours house at that time. “On another occasion, it seems that the complainers were driving to the locus and the accused was shouting towards them saying, “I am going to kick your c**t in”.  “Police were contacted again about these matters.” Defending Boyd, Tony Currie added that Mr Mackie was the neighbour of his partner and there had been “ongoing issues” between them. He said: “These incidents were because of his partner’s ongoing issues with the complainer. “She was receiving ongoing complaints from them. “He had been at his partner’s house at the moment the complainer came to the door, who was kicking the door and was challenging towards his partner. “She was heavily pregnant at the time.” Mr Currie added that there has been no further issues in the interim and the couple are hoping to relocate. Sherf Pattison said: “I was considering sending you to jail - you need to know that this type of violence cannot continue.” As an alternative to custody, Sherf Pattison ordered Boyd to carry out a community payback order with  hours of unpaid work to be completed in nine months.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13689315.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_JS170228854.jpg","title":"ayr uniteds somerset park football","story":"NewsAyr Uniteds Somerset Park football ground damaged as car ploughs into turnstilesThe vehicle smashed into historic Somerset Park shortly before pm last night.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC NewsSomerset Park damaged after car crashes into ground\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA football clubs stadium has been badly damaged after a car ploughed straight through its turnstiles.

Chemo treatment is to be axed at either Ayr or Crosshouse Hospital, a health board meeting heard on Monday. Heath bosses at NHS Ayrshire  Arran are considering a huge shake-up of cancer services.  Previously it was proposed Crosshouse Hospital would be home to the cancer unit but bosses insist they are now considering Ayr too. Peter Maclean, clinical director, cancer services, said: “The next stage is to determine where the site will be.” The NHS Ayshire  Arran health board meeting was told a new model for cancer treatment is being proposed across the whole of the West of Scotland. Non-executive board member Ian Welsh said there is concern about moving services away from Ayr. As well as the main cancer unit, new outreach treatment hubs could be available where but they would only cater for low-risk cases. Nurse director Professor Hazel Borland said the outreach service could be located at Ayrshire Central Hospital in Irvine. She added: “For the next  to  months there will be no change. It continues as it is.” Councillor Joe Cullinane raised the issue of consultation and said any change at Ayr would become political. He added: “At the end of the day cancer touches most people’s lives in our community.” Chief executive John Burns said the ambition was to deliver the “best care we can to our population”. He added: “We need to think of it as a pathway, not just a building.” Councillor Laura Brennan-Whitefield wanted more information on the outreach cancer treatment. She said: “There has been a question mark over Ayr Hospital since . For me it is such a big thing. We have to have a sight of what the final result will be.” The chosen hospital would undergo an upgrade to host the cancer unit. A paper presented to the board said it was proposed: “NHS Ayrshire  Arran would have one cancer unit and should seek to determine optimal provision of outreach services as appropriate.” The proposed West of Scotland service model was endorsed by the board.

Alexander MacKenzie, , of Galloway Avenue in Ayr, was caught with a sick collection of illegal material involving animals and others showing children thought to be as young as one-year old. Police discovered the sick creep had a total of approximately  images. One involved two women and a black dog. And images displayed naked kids – the youngest aged between one and three. Ayr Sherf Court heard at an earlier hearing that police carried out a search on September  last year and uncovered a USB stick and HP computer terminal storing MacKenzie’s disgusting collection. Officers attended at the home MacKenzie shares with his elderly mother. She stated he was at work and told officers she only used the computer for online banking. His mum told officers that MacKenzie used the computer everyday – to go online, for Facebook and “something to do with animals”.  Mackenzie, who has a previous conviction, appeared at court last Wednesday for sentencing. Solicitor Chris Munro said: “This is something that has spiralled, causing him to possess the images. “It’s a fairly low volume of images. “This is a matter of possession rather than distribution. “He appreciates these are particularly serious matters and custody may be on your lordship’s mind. “He resides with his mother and Mr Mackenzie is her registered carer. “She clearly would face some problemsMr Mackenzie was sent to prison today. “He has a relatively close bond with his mother.” Sherf Desmond Leslie replied: “[I have] concerns with the previous conviction and the superficial appreciation of the disposal that was made at that time.”  Mr Munro replied: “There is clearly a risk here but that can be managed in the community.” Stepping back from custody, the Sherf imposed a y community payback order. The perv was sentenced to three years supervision and as a requirement must attend the Moving Forward Making Changes programme. He was tagged for nine months where he must remain in his home address from pm - am. And he was also placed on the sex offenders’ register for five years. MacKenzie pled guilty to being in possession of a quantity of extreme pornographic images depicting in an explicit and realistic way bestiality between adults and animals between June ,  and September , . He also admitted having in his possession indecent photos or pseudo-photos of children from June ,  and September , .

Only the councillors who have spoken in this debate are saying that.ldquoCouncillor McAteer, the door is not slammed on Hawick, and it is mischievous of you to suggest that.ldquoHawick is getting a new high school as quickly as humanly possible as this council is able to deliver it.ldquoIt seems strange that a councillor from Tweeddale is having to stand up in this chamber and say that Hawick is still a proud seat of learning.ldquoIt has a fantastic staff, and some fantastic people doing some incredible things.

However, when the fall of communism led to the break-up of Yugoslavia, war came to Bosnia in , driven in part by Serbiarsquos desire to create a lsquoGreater Serbiarsquo, including large parts of Bosnia, from which they planned to remove Croats and Muslims in what became known as lsquoethnic cleansingrsquo.Our delegation leader Resad Trbonja was , living in Sarajevo. On April , , he woke to find his city under siege, surrounded by Serbian artillery and snipers on the mountains overlooking the city. The siege would last four years, the longest in modern warfare, longer than Stalingrad. An average of  mortars landed in the city every day, , on the worst day.Resad, who lived through, and fought in, the siege, explained that Sarajevo regressed two centuries overnight ndash no water, no electricity, no phones. The Serbian army allowed minimal UN aid into the city sporadically but nothing .The survival of the siege is a story of human courage, spirit and defiance.Our first visit was to the remnants of a tunnel, dug under Sarajevo airport to reach Bosnian-held territory on the other side. This tiny tunnel was the only way in or out for four years.Through this tunnel extra aid came, for example from Edinburgh Direct Aid, who drove lorries of supplies from Edinburgh to help Sarajevans. My own predecessor, John Home Robertson, then MPfor East Lothian, spent several Parliamentary recesses as a volunteer lorry driver. It was dangerous work and one of his colleagues died on the notorious road known as lsquoSnipers Alleyrsquo.Perhaps the most affecting visit in Sarajevo was to the War Childhood Museum, where those who grew up in the siege display the things they kept to remind them of what it was like, and tell their story.A homemade cardboard knightrsquos breastplate made by a brother who later died a cuddly toy from a UN delivery, cuddled threadbare because it was the only toy a homemade lsquounormrsquo for a childrenrsquos choir which rehearsed and performed in defiance of bombs and bullets the remains of a playpark lsquojungle gymrsquo kept to remember the day a mortar tore it apart and killed your friend ndash no one who visits this museum will forget it.That is true too of Srebrenica. This was supposedly a lsquosafe havenrsquo protected by UN troops. Yet on July , Serbian paramilitary units overran it. Thousands of Bosnian Muslims sought refuge in the UN base at a disused factory.When we visited the museum now sited there, survivor Hasan Hasanovic explained to us how UN soldiers stood by as women and children were herded onto buses and deported, while their men were separated and removed in lorries. They were systematically murdered nearby. Thousands more who tried to escape through the forest were hunted down, shepherded into a meadow, and shot. In all, , Bosnian Muslim men and boys were slaughtered at Srebrenica.Finally, the international community acted. In a matter of days, air strikes lted the siege of Sarajevo, drove Serbian paramilitaries out of much of the territory they had occupied, and forced agreement to a peace deal signed in Dayton, Ohio.Srebrenica was not the only genocide in this war, but it is emblematic because it happened under the noses of the UN and because of the bravery of the Mothers of Srebrenica, who ed home to find out what happened to their husbands and sons, refused to be silenced, and demanded justice.This led to the International Commission on Missing Persons and the forensic anthropology unit in Tuzla, where we saw the incredible work done to identy remains using DNA. More than , victims of genocide have now been identied, allowing their families to grieve and to bury them at the final stop of our visit.We arrive at the cemetery at Potaceri, outside Srebrenica, as the sun sets. On the hillside, , stark white tombstones bring home the enormity of what was done over only a few days a mere  years or so ago.More than , died at Srebrenica , perished in Sarajevo , women suffered rape as an act of war millions fled their homes, some even finding their way to the refugee reception centre at Cheylesmore Lodge in North Berwick.All the survivors I met asked the same question: why did so much suffering have to happen before the international community acted to stop it  In telling us their story, they relived their own pain.

An intergovernmental concordat, setting out the proposals, is due to be published later this week.Appearing before the Commons Scottish Affairs Committee, Mr Mundell told MPs he would welcome a move to more joint trade delegations as this would produce better value for taxpayers.It was pointed out how on some occasions UK and Scottish Government representatives had visited the same country but separately.ldquoI am very open and conducive to working together, declared Mr Mundell. ldquoThere is continued scope for closer working. Irsquom sure thatrsquos what business and industry bodies want.Later, when quizzed about the possibility of the Prime Minister and First Minister going on joint trade missions, the Scottish Secretary told The Herald: \"I see no reason why that shouldnt happen. Businesses shouldnt have to choose whether they work with the UK Government or the Scottish Government. I see no impediment to that...Businesses would welcome that combined approach.\"George Hollingbery, the International Trade Minister, giving evidence alongside Mr Mundell, stressed that at present the UK Government ldquoengaged widely with the devolved administrations but suggested there would be more liaison going forward post Brexit, referring to the intergovernmental concordat, which, he explained, would ldquoincorporate the Scottish Government into the way the UK Government approached new trade deals.Askedthis meant Scottish Government ministers would be inside the negotiating room, Mr Hollingbery replied: ldquoThe offer we are making is a full and fair one and that will satisfy any reasonable observer that the devolved authorities are having a full part in the process of not only creating the outlines of our future trade agreements but also having a role further down the line.The SNPrsquos Pete Wishart, who chairs the committee, noted how people were waiting with ldquogreat excitement about what was about to be announced.However, the minister noted how one or two of the Scottish Governmentrsquos proposals to be involved in post Brexit free trade agreements were at the ldquofar end of the bargaining scale and that their suggestion of the need to get Edinburghrsquos consent was ldquonot on the table and will never be on the table.Mr Hollingbery later stressed: ldquoItrsquos not right, however close we want to bring the devolved administrations, to take their advice and for them to represent the interests of their particular areas and responsibilities, to allow them to have an effective veto at any stage.

They really went global and this will be a huge relief for them.The Cromarty Rising group, who led the protests and petition, gave a message of gratitude to all those who had supported the campaign: ldquoThanks to all who gave their support in a hard fought campaign. It is not an admission of defeat by the Port but the nearest we will ever see in print.ldquoFor whatever reason, itrsquos great for the communities and environment of the Inner Moray Firth that this project has finally be dropped and testament to the what people can do when we get together for a common cause. In the meantime, Cromarty Rising will remain vigilant to ensure this proposal is never resurrected.The plans were described by the Professor Paul Thompson, a leading expert in marine le at the University of Aberdeen, as: ldquoThe least appropriate location on the whole coast of Europe to undertake this activity.Despite this, the proposal was submitted to the Marine Coastguard Authority, based in England, which Scottish politicians have no power over since it is not devolved.Ms Forbes said this was ldquosuch a clear illustration of the dficulties of having some powers devolved and some powers reserved.Bottlenose dolphins, of which only several hundred live in British waters, are protected, with the Moray Firth being a conservation area under EU law.A spokesperson for Scottish Natural Heritage said: ldquoThis decision will signicantly reduce the risks to the worldrsquos most northerly population of bottlenose dolphins.ldquoThe Moray Firth Special Area of Conservation is extremely important to this species, and a large proportion of the local population use these waters all year.

I think thatrsquos a big challenge, that we need to look more deeply at the dferences between students.Despite facing a lower benchmark for participation from students of less well-off backgrounds, University of Aberdeen has pledged to meet the % target by next year.University bosses plan to introduce a number of measures to help it surpass the % target two years ahead of schedule, including a plan to provide more places for students from widening access backgrounds.The university will also accept applications from SIMD students after the UCAS deadline of January .Funding will be made available to assist applicants and offer-holders with travel costs to the universityrsquos recruitment activities and events, such as Open Day or Articulation Day.The university will continue to offer free accommodation for the first year of study for students from SIMD areas.University Principal George Boyne said: ldquoThis university was founded on the guiding principle of being open to all, and it is for this reason that we have set this ambitious new target to recruit % of our Scottish students from SIMD areas, from September .ldquoOur commitment to widening access to higher education has resulted in a number of initiatives to open up pathways to university for students from disadvantaged backgrounds, however, we undoubtedly face unique challenges here in the north-east, which I was pleased to discuss with the minister during todayrsquos visit. Despite these challenges, our new target provides a renewed impetus to our widening access activities, which I consider to be a priority area for the university.ldquoAlong with the introduction of several new measures ndash including our plan to promote more opportunities for students from SIMD backgrounds through clearing this is a signicant step in our journey towards greater inclusion.Richard Lochhead, the Scottish Governmentrsquos Minister for Further Education, took part in a discussion with Mr Boyne yesterday which covered the challenges faced by the university in attracting students from widening access backgrounds.Mr Lochhead, said: ldquoI welcome the University of Aberdeenrsquos commitment to recruit more students from disadvantaged backgrounds to this impressive institution. The Scottish Government wants every young person in Scotland to have an equal chance of success, no matter their background or circumstance.

Golspie is operational   three days a week.\"The writer states that the letter represents the feelings of paramedics and technicians in Easter Ross, and they are calling for six more staff to make Alness and Tain   and ldquogive the residents of Easter Ross a fighting chance in their hour of need\".The Scottish Ambulance Service hit back however. A spokesman said: ldquoThe claims are untrue. We have ambulances working a   sht at Dingwall, Golspie, Lairg, Wick and Thurso ndash a crew is also available at either Tain or Alness stations and often both at the same time, depending on sht patterns.ldquoPatients in this part of Scotland can also rely on the air ambulance helicopter, a team of emergency response doctors based in Tain, Dornoch and Dingwall, and our teams of community first responders to provide an emergency response within a matter of minutes.ldquoWe closely and continuously monitor our staffing levels, through our demand and capacity review, to ensure we can provide safe patient care in all parts of Scotland and continue to invest in our workforce.Contacted for comment, Highlands and Islands Labour MSP Rhoda Grant said: ldquoStaff have raised concerns with me which I in turn have raised with the ambulance service. I believe that we do require more ambulance resources throughout the Highlands and Islands.ldquoCrews have to travel long distances to transfer patients and with specialist services becoming more centralised that will only increase.ldquoIt is right that crews who are fatigued sign off and ideally we should have more stations covered without the use of on call staff, who are in greater danger of becoming fatiguedthey have already undertaken a long transfer.ldquoI know from SAS that they are using Inverness crews to do some of these transfers where that is clinically safe.ldquoObviously in an emergency the nearest crew must respond.

However, he continued in the same vein.In response, Mrs May said the copy of the full legal advice he was holding was “no dferent” to the statement the Attorney General Geoffrey Cox made on Monday.She added: “I have myself said on the floor of this House that there is indeed no unilateral right to pull out of the backstop.“What I have also said is that it is not the intention of either party that a the backstop should be used in the first place, or ... b thatit is used, should be anything other than temporary.”©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4839407.1543952049!/image/image.jpg","title":"alexander mccall smith time to wake up and smell europa s coffee","story":"Alexander McCall Smith recalls a strange dream involving the ancient Greek goddess Europa, who looks a lot like Angela Merkel, and the emergence of a new nation state.Our dreams, no matter how vivid and surprising, are usually of scant interest to others. It is best not to talk about the creatures of the night, and how we engage with them, other than with one’s psychoanalyst and, at a push, one’s more tolerant friends. The absurd world of dreams is neither here nor there – which is why the memory of our dreams fades very fast. Of course, there are exceptions. The dream recounted by Freud’s Wolf Man still makes for entertaining reading, and any dream we have of seven fat cows and seven thin ones should be perhaps be mentioned – just in case. But, in general, dreams are a private inconsequential business best kept to oneself.So, it is with considerable hesitation that I mention the dream I had last night. It is, I think, a dream that others might have had. It could be, in a Jungian sense, a manestation of some collective unconscious. That is perfectly possible, indeed probable. Having reiterated the self-denying ordinance of not revealing dreams, I hesitantly write about it here, knowing that not many people read my column anyway, and so this is virtually a private reflection.In my dream I was in Brussels. How did I know that  Well, the dream was preceded by one of those images that they use in film to signy location. A London scene is usually preceded by an image of Big Ben, or possibly Trafalgar Square. Passing double-decker buses may remind the dozier members of the audience of the milieu to which they are being transported. Paris is easy: the Efel Tower is spotted in the distance and there is French accordion music. But Brussels  In my dream there was a large road sign that said Bruxelles. That made the location of what followed quite clear.It being a continental dream, there was a pavement café. I looked for a table, but could find none and was about to turn around when the waiter summoned me to offer a seat at a table where a large woman in a voluminous blue dress was already seated. In the normal – or the normally abnormal – dream, Freudians would unhesitatingly tell you that this figure is your mother. Of course it is. Except in my dream it became immediately clear that she was in fact Europa, we of no less a personage than Zeus. We do not hear much from Europa these days, but she is there, deep in our mythic consciousness, often riding on a white bull. Every so often she surfaces.: Alexander McCall Smith: Should there be second referendums on Brexit and independence Europa was very welcoming, and offered to buy me a cup of coffee. I asked for decaffeinated and she said that this would be perfectly possible. I should not think of her as a threat, she said. If you want decaffeinated coffee, you can have it. But then she added, “But you must have coffee.”I was a bit taken aback by this. Could one not sit at her table and not drink coffee  No, she said. That is not possible. That is a fundamental demand. My coffee arrived. It was delicious. “There,” she said. “See.”Now I must add another detail. It is not important, but it did give texture to the dream. Dreams with texture are generally better than those without. In this case, the texture-conferring detail was this: Europa looked terribly like Mrs Merkel! That, I think, is purely co-incidental, and would be of no interest even to the most symbol-sensitive dream analyst. There are plenty of women who look like Mrs Merkel. Some people even have mothers who look like her. As I sat there with Europa, I felt a certain sense of embarrassment creep over me.“I must say how sorry I am about all this business,” I said. “You do know, don’t you, that Scotland behaved dferently ”She nodded. “I’ve heard as much,” she said.“And I wouldn’t want you to think that Scots voted that way largely because we rather enjoy voting the opposite way from that in which the Government in Westminster tells us to vote.”Europa smiled. “Of course not!” And then added, “Perish the thought!”“I liked the coffee,” I said.She smiled again. “Good. And please don’t feel in any way awkward. No damage done. Or not too much. You’re going to vote again, you see.”I thought I should clary the situation. “You mean a general election ”“Oh no,” said Europa. “Another referendum. You’ll vote again and voilà, a dferent result. You can’t leave, you see. Look at history. The consolidation of states prevents that. Germany used to be a whole lot of little entities, as did Italy, France and so on. Look what happened to the kingdom of my son, Minos. Existing countries become passé. That’s what’s happening here, you know. We are witnessing the creation of a new state. And every such creation involves birth pangs, and one or two protests. We’re feeling those at present, but everything will be all right. Reason will prevail.”“Are you sure ” I asked. “Perfectly,” she said. “You’ll see.”I have no idea of the meaning of this dream. Even as I write about it, its memory fades. I mentioned it, though, to a friend.

That is just another  promise.“In fact the uncertainty flowing from the Prime Minister’s deal would last until the end of the transition period, which will not be in December , no-one believes that, more likely December  or even later.“That’s at least four years of uncertainty to add to the two-and-a-half we’ve already had.”He added: “Scotland needs and deserves better than the Prime Minister’s blindfold Brexit.“For in truth this deal is about saving the Prime Minister, not about saving her country.”But Conservative MSP Adam Tomkins said the Prime Minister’s deal was the only credible proposal to have been tabled since the EU referendum.He said: “Either we leave the EU on the basis of the orderly withdrawal agreement that the Prime Minister and her team have negotiated, or something very close to it, or we crash out of the EU on a no-deal basis that would be a disaster for the economy.”: SNP blame ‘toxic’ Tory Government for stirring up anti-immigrant feelingHe said the motion put forward by the other parties to oppose the withdrawal plans and a no-deal Brexit is “just noise” and rejecting the withdrawal agreement makes a no-deal Brexit more likely.“We want a better alternative, says the motion, without any clue as to what that alternative would be and how could possibly be delivered,” he said.He accused the SNP of trying to “weaponise” Brexit in the service of independence and said Labour and the Liberal Democrats have been “hoodwinked” into giving their support.Labour’s Neil Findlay said the Prime Minister’s deal was “doomed” and called for a general election.He said the overwhelming feeling was “uncertainty” and accused the Conservatives of bringing in “utter chaos” through the EU referendum.He said: “For the sake of the country, our economy, our jobs, our children, our environment and the rights we enjoy the Prime Minister should admit the game is up and let democracy prevail in a general election.”MSPs voted - in favour of the motion.©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4839405.1543952021!/image/image.jpg","title":"tourist route the north coast 500 is beautiful but do locals love it","story":"On a trip that began as a tribute to Edwin Muir#s Scottish Journey, James McEnaney found the NC was not without its bumpsI was never the wee boy who wanted to be a footballer or a fireman or a racing car driver. The only thing I can remember always wanting to do, at every age and stage, through every phase and passing fascination, was write.And then, at the age of , I finally got the chance to produce a book. I had been inspired by Edwin Muir’s Scottish Journey, a fascinating piece of work – part travelogue, part polemic – which I had first encountered in . I was , a newly-qualied English teacher at Arran High School, and had been handed the challenge of teaching the Advanced Higher curriculum. I immediately fell in love with the book and thought even then that a modern version could make a worthwhile contribution to contemporary Scotland – although I did not for a second ever think I’d have the chance to make it happen.The first big job was planning the route, which was a long, complicated and frustrating process. In its earliest incarnations, the journey was an attempt to replicate Muir’s movements eight decades earlier, following the same twists and turns, and finding the same stopping-off points, as the man himself. However, I realised that, in this form, my work could only ever be an echo – an inescapably pale imitation of a great, though under-appreciated, piece of writing.After this realisation, my plans mutated – an extra village here, a bypassed motorway there – until I finally settled on a project that was really mine. My Scottish Journey would use the Scottish Parliament as the start and end points for a ten-day, clockwise, broadly coastal loop of the country in the spring of . Where Muir travelled alone in a borrowed Standard car, I’d be on a -year-old motorbike. Instead of hotels and BBs, I would stay with local people in places including Gatehouse of Fleet, Ullapool and Aberdeen, incorporating their thoughts and feelings about their homes and gathering up, to borrow Muir’s phrase, my own “bundle of impressions”.Over those ten days I experienced Scotland’s incredible, infectious beauty in all its hues, from sparkling waters beneath the brightest, bluest skies to prehistoric peaks shrouded in gathering storm clouds. Wrong turns introduced me to a millennium-old site of worship on Orkney and the beautul Art Deco remains of Tarlair’s enchanting outdoor swimming pool, while recommendations I picked up along the road took me to a location from film The Wicker Man and the best hot chocolate I have ever tasted. I visited an amazing outdoor nursery on the west coast, and in the east was introduced to long-forgotten artwork left behind by Polish airmen during the Second World War.Best of all, in every corner of the country, I met generous, warm-hearted people, many of whom had been born where but found a home in Scotland, who were willing to share their passions, their stories and, in many cases, their homes with me. It was a privilege, and one for which I will always be grateful.So much of what I saw during my journey surprised me. I didn’t expect the brutal snow storm on day two which very nearly ended my trip, or my emotional response to the Orcadian island of Wyre, where I stood in Muir’s boyhood home. I hadn’t anticipated the anger I felt in Helmsdale, in Sutherland, standing beside The Emigrants statue remembering those forced from their homes during The Clearances. Matters of local democracy and the alienation felt by many of Scotland’s communities became consistent threads running through the fabric of my story, despite my insistence that I did not want to write a political book.I had realised during the planning stage that I would be covering the majority of Scotland’s shiny new “ultimate road trip”, the North Coast . Like everyone  I was aware of the increasing buzz around this initiative – a few friends had already completed the trip, and in  the journalist Peter Ross had written a typically wonderful piece about it for National Geographic. Having only ever completed isolated sections before I was looking forward to experiencing the whole route for myself and hoped I might be able to tell my own version of what appears to be a quite incredible success story. But the reality that I encountered was very dferent from the rhetoric.Day five of my adventure began with an early departure from Geary in the north of Skye, with an ultimate destination just south of Ullapool to be reached by early evening. I arrived in Lochcarron, ready to cross the famous Bealach na Ba towards Applecross, just before lunchtime and decided to stop for a cup of tea and some fuel. I had only joined the North Coast  route a few minutes earlier but already couldn’t miss it: outside the Lochcarron Hotel stood two huge advertising flags and even here, in this tiny West Highland village clinging to the shoreline, I had several opportunities to part with my cash in exchange for a iety of route-related merchandise.I had lunch at the Applecross Inn where I spoke to Alison Macleod, a community development worker, who told me about le on this beautul, isolated peninsula. She spoke honestly and passionately, and offered some pretty cutting observations about the local council, the Scottish Government and ious infrastructure companies, all of which have failed communities like hers in a iety of ways.But she reserved particularly harsh words for the North Coast , saying: “It’s been awful. The whole thing has been a nightmare.”She wasn’t alone in expressing serious reservations about the purported benefits of this new tourist draw. My hosts that evening were Ailsa McLellan and her partner Joe Hayes, whose driveway joins directly onto one of the many roads that makes up the route. They echoed Alison’s criticisms, highlighting above all the lack of appropriate infrastructure of investment to make such a scheme sustainable even in the medium – never mind long term. The ultimate fear is a simple one: that carelessness will transform these amazing, must-see nooks and crannies of our country into over-crowded, over-exploited shells that travellers decide aren’t worth the hassle.These sorts of concerns have been echoed in a number of conversations I have had since writing the book, and have reinforced some of the thoughts I had at the time. In some places – such as along the northern coast of the Applecross peninsula, or the stretch of road around Drumbeg – the narrow and contorted Tarmac presented a challenge even on two wheels. While negotiating some of the particularly uncompromising sections I remember wondering how large cars, never mind tour buses and American-style campervans, could possibly cope – and how bad things could gettwo people with no experience of passing places met head on.It is easy to understand the appeal of “Scotland’s Route ” and there’s no denying that it showcases some of the very best that Scotland has to offer. For many people, that -mile northern loop, carving through scenery which, at times, seems able to transcend the very idea of beauty, will be unlike anything they have previously experienced. We live in an astonishing corner of the planet and should be proud to show it off, but in the rush to celebrate success we also risk forgetting, as we so often do in Scotland, that apparently “remote” areas are still the centre of the world for the people who actually live there, and not just a holiday playground for the rest of us.©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.The project, costing around £ million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in .

It is part of the Year of Young People activities.The youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.Year of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to  years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, #What do you enjoy about Shetland #, #What makes you proud of Shetland #, #What is Shetland famous for #.# Send any ideas, before Friday th July , to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.The SIC#s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.#This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People .”Are they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be doneI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish##.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc###and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of le or some other pointless title.Over the years art has very much lowered its standards signicantly to make and justy it becoming more commercially viable####.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called # limited edition rubbish #.I would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at###atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.No doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and le experience###..despite the fact everybody  looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.Love the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of le. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.HGIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the # shock value # when it comes to expressing what art is or should be Personally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it # And the winner of the Turner Prize is#. #. lol“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is###. ”.Go on David,since you are consumed with what is appropriate why not have a go yourself  You said “ personally , I would just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it “ And the winner of the Turner Prize is##.David Spence.

LoLThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.Based on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear..."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.It is rare enough for a local game to end -, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.Astonishingly, Delting’s - triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 25 ","story":"Those responsible finally saw sense this week, reversing the ridiculous decision to play both Scottish League Cup semi-finals at Hampden Park on the same day.Celtic, one of the four sides involved, had indicated that a draw should be made to determine which game was moved to Murrayfieldthe original plans were scrapped.But the holders’ game against Hearts will now take place in Edinburgh at .pm on Sunday th October. The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"lerwick harbour traffic continues to rise ","story":"The downturn in offshore operations had an ongoing impact on overall freight handled in the first nine months, compared with the same period in .Statistics for January to September, released by Lerwick Port Authority, show that vessel arrivals jumped by . per cent to ,, with tonnage up . per cent at . million gross tonnes.

He deserves all the support possible.Tomorrow’s match, despite being outside the Six Nations, should still be hotly contested. In the absence of Hogg and Barclay, English-based Sean Maitland and David Denton, and half-backs Finn Russell and Greg Laidlaw who now ply their trade in France, it gives an opportunity for some youngsters to make their mark.Those include Blair Kinghorn and Adam Hastings who have been named in the starting line-up, while Darcy Graham, George Horne and Matt Fagerson may get their chance later in the game.He won’t be making an appearance on this occasion as he plays for Welsh side Scarlets, but I am particularly interested in seeing Kiwi import Blade Thomson in the next three tests.

He had represented Cunningsburgh, Ness United and ious Shetland select sides, once making a trip to Faroe with a county squad.Alastair was probably a wing-half in his early days, but after the change from -- to modern formations he usually formed part of the central defence.He played alongside the late Ian Manson for Ness, while for Cunningsburgh his long-term partner was Douglas Halcrow. They were part of a team which enjoyed many successes in Southern League football, and also which won the Parish Cup in  and .Cunningsburgh had a number of outstanding players in that era, not least twins Billy and Malcolm Adamson and the late George Adamson, but Alastair was definitely one of the most consistent.Very similar to his -year career at The Shetland Times, he was as dedicated as it was possible to be, someone you could always count on whatever the issue.As former goalkeeper Peter Farmer said after the funeral last Friday, “I played behind Alistair for  years and he was so reliable, the way he read the game.”Football runs in the family. His younger brother Gordon also played for Cunningsburgh and Ness while another brother Jim represented Shetland in  and . Nephews Raymond and James Aitken and Tony and James Johnston did likewise, with the latter becoming the county’s equal most-capped player.When the Times started a works league team in the s Alistair was persuaded to come out of retirement and take part in the very first match, a friendly against Bressay. That was where his we hailed from and I recall him saying that “I better no score a goal or Margaret will nivver spaek ta me again”.He also came with the works team on a trip to Orkney. He was a bit unsure about that and actually got injured in one of the matches, but as far as I recall he had as good a time as anybody where the after-match entertainment was concerned.Alastair and Margaret had three daughters, Wendy and twins Susan and Alison. They were all musically gted while Susan and Alison excelled at hockey.One of his grand-daughters, Sophie Moar, is a top athlete. At the island games in Jersey three years ago she won a bronze medal in the long jump and was a member of the gold medal-winning # metres relay squad. Alastair and Margaret were there to see it and I would imagine that was one of his proudest ever moments. After his retiral in  our paths crossed a few times but unfortunately not all that often. He was always friendly and good company.The last time I saw Alastair was earlier this year when I visited him and Margaret at Bremmer in Cunningsburgh. It was a very dficult experience as by then the dementia had taken its toll, and he was a shadow of the vibrant figure he had been. He still knew me though, which made it worthwhile.Alistair was a tremendous guy. I know Margaret, their daughters and grandchildren, and the other family will miss him greatly, and I would like to give my condolence to them all.: : : : : : : :News came this week that Crystal Palace footballer James McArthur had retired from Scotland duty as he believed it was the only way he could “continue to play at the top level”.There was a time when representing your country was considered the “top level” but sadly that is not a view shared by an increasing number of people in the game.McArthur, who won the last of his  caps a year ago, says he has found it increasingly dficult to manage a number of physical issues. He is only .The Crystal Palace midfielder will continue to turn out for his club in what could be -odd games a season. However, he has deemed the half a dozen or so he could be required for his international side to be just too much.McArthur follows in the wake of a number of Scottish players who have taken this decision, the highest profile being Celtic captain Scott Brown. Others, such as Alan Hutton, are still performing regularly for their clubs.There were also the recent instances where both Leigh Grfiths, Robert Snodgrass and Kieran Tierney asked to be released from the international squad because of perceived “fatigue”.No doubt McArthur, like the others mentioned, has his reasons for arriving at this decision. But I cannot help thinking that players from a dferent era would never have done so.Some, notably Denis Law and current Scottish boss Alex McLeish, have said they have never retired from their country. They would still be availablerequired. Attitudes have definitely changed, and not for the better.: : : : : : : :The Australian Cricketers’ Associationthis week called for the bans to be lted on the three players who were involved in ball-tampering in South Africa earlier this year.The association has laid part of the blame for the incident at the door of Cricket Australia, who it has labelled “arrogant and controlling”.Steve Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft were all “contrite men who have suffered enough”, a review carried out by the ACA stated.Smith, who was captain at the time, and vice-captain Warner are seven months into their one-year bans, while Bancroft, who carried out the cheating, will be eligible tonext month.While the three may have endured both a degree of humiliation – Smith’s tearful confession was felt by some to be meaningful – and financial penalties, lting the ban now would send all the wrong signals.Cheating in sport, however apologetic the protagonists may appear in the aftermath, is an anathema which needs punishing.

stand-off.The breakthrough follows \"extremely positive and constructive\" high-level discussions between the hotel group and Highland Council.Local Highland High Leusers have been unable to use the leisure pool since the end of August when access ended because of a funding wrangle.Macdonald Hotels chairman Donald Macdonald and deputy chairman Gordon Fraser met with the councils new chief executive Donna Manson in Aviemore on Tuesday and reached a one-year agreement to resolve the stalemate.HLH users will not have to pay any additional charges which had been one of the options on the table as attempts were made to break the deadlock.There is further good news with confirmation that HLH swimming lessons for children and aquafit will also resume.Details of the funding arrangements have not yet been made public nor when the doors will re-open.Speaking after the meeting, Mr Fraser said: \"Were extremely encouraged by the positive and constructive approach taken by Donna Manson

November, in which Councillor Ian Cockburn put forward a motion whereby the local authority would determinefunds were available for design work to begin on replacement options to the bypass. This motion was agreed. earlier this week, the chair of the EDI committee, Councillor Allan Henderson said that the council was putting pressure on the Scottish Government to have the route classed as a trunk road. However, during Thursday’s meeting Councillor Cockburn was quick to dismiss the likelihood of this happening: “Who in their right mind would take  miles of the worst road in the Highlands” He said. “After six and a half years we still only have two options… and the delays and the consequences for the wider community have been absolutely shocking.”The SNP member for Wester Ross, Strathpeffer and Lochalsh also went on to question the tendering process behind the work at the bypass, saying: “Was it necessary to shut the road during the day  I believe there was a tender on the table that would have allowed the road to open during the day.”He went on to argue that the council needed to release money straight away to enable design work on the replacement options for the current bypass to begin, adding that it was a matter of urgency due to the risks identied in the  annual sloping report which detailed four very high-risk rock slopes at the Stromeferry bypass.In response to Councillor Cockburn, the council’s head of infrastructure Colin Howell said that the council did receive an alternative tender from a contractor who said they could carry out the required works at night, however, Mr Howell said the cost was signicant and due to concerns about these plans it was decided it would be wise for some of the work to be undertaken during the day.Mr Howell said that while there were ongoing issues with rockfalls and managing slopes, he believed that the council had done a good job. He went on to add that the council were prioritising the high-risk slopes and currently working on the cost and details in relation to stabilising those areas which would be delivered at the next EDI committee meeting. He added that there were “three optimum solutions” in respect to replacement options and said that the committee had “decided to leave those three on the table# and seek dialogue with Scottish Government for funding. He said: “The administration is looking for feedback, we are working on slopes with high risks and will come back to the next EDI with the costing.”Councillor Derek MacLeod described the current situation as “one episode in a long, long history of problems with the route#, and in contrast to his fellow ward member, Councillor Cockburn, he argued that the route should be “trunked between Auchtertyre and Garve” as he believed it to be strategic in linking the ferry points of Uig and UllapoolCouncil Leader Margaret Davidson told the committee that she would be meeting with the Transport Secretary Michael Matheson and would report back “what options have been put on the table.” Councillor Davidson said that the council were “acutely aware of what’s needed” and were working towards a long-term sustainable option for Stromeferry.

While a full list of attendees is not available it is probable that he was at the founding meeting of Sinn Féin in November . In  O’Kelly was appointed editor of the Leinster Leader in Naas, County Kildare. He founded a branch of Conradh na Gaeilge in the town and was active in Sinn Féin locally. He welcomed republicans to his home during the annual Wolfe Tone commemorations in nearby Bodenstown. O’Kelly’s first book of stories was published in  and his first play was produced the following year. Several of his plays were produced at the Abbey Theatre. Constantly busy with literary and journalistic work, O’Kelly was subject to poor health.

The historic gathering came in the wake of the campaign in support of the H-Block and Armagh prisoners, the epic Hunger Strikes, the intervention of prisoner candidates, North and South, in  and Sinn Féin’s electoral rise in the Six Counties in  and .The party’s performance in the October  Assembly elections – when five republicans were elected to the body set up by British direct ruler Jim Prior – caused alarm to the SDLP and their supporters in the Establishment parties in the  Counties. Sinn Féin’s lead in boycotting the Assembly was followed by the SDLP for fear of losing further support to republicans. The Fine Gael Labour Government, led by Garret FitzGerald, set up the New Ireland Forum in Dublin mainly as a  for the SDLP. In June , the political establishment in Ireland and Britain was rocked by the election of Sinn Féin Vice-President Gerry Adams as MP for his native west Belfast. For long a leading republican activist, Adams advocated the deeper politicisation and popularisation of the republican struggle and the building of Sinn Féin across the  Counties.The British Tory government of Margaret Thatcher was also concerned at the rise of Sinn Féin. In the week before the Ard Fheis in November , Prior told Tory MPs that Ireland could become a “Cuba off Britain’s west coast”. He said he feared Sinn Féin could overtake the SDLP electorally and “we must do all we can to strengthen constitutional nationalism”. When the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis gathered in the Mansion House in Dublin on  and  November, it was set to elect a new leadership. Ruairí Ó Brádaigh had been president since  and he announced that he would not be seeking re-election. He said the four-province federal Ireland plan, of which he had been a strong advocate, had been rejected at the  Ard Fheis and his approach on other issues, including electoral strategy, had been rejected by the Ard Chomhairle.In his address, the new party president, Gerry Adams, dismissed media claims of a ‘Northern takeover’ and said:“We are not a Northern, nor a Southern party – we are an Irish republican party organised throughout Ireland.”The main theme of his speech was the need for republicans to break out of political isolation and “get among the people in the basic ways which the people accept”. In line with this approach, the Ard Fheis voted to contest European Parliament elections with the intention of taking seatsthey were won. This followed the expansion of party electoral strategy the previous year. The Ard Fheis coincided with a by-election campaign for the Dáil seat of Dublin Central, which was contested by Sinn Féin candidate Christy Burke, turning in a creditable performance. There was further controversy after the Ard Fheis, and discomfort for Fianna Fáil leaders in particular, when Gerry Adams was confirmed as the main speaker at the annual Kilmichael commemoration in west Cork. Gerry Adams was elected president of Sinn Féin at the Ard Fheis of November ,  years ago.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27495  ","story":" Robbie SmythOver the last  years Irishsociety has evolved and transformed in many ways.

Ireland north or south was never a concern yet we will all pay the cost for generations to come.Brexit represents a huge threat to the social, economic and political le of this island. The outworking of Brexit could be the imposition of hard border.That is why the people of the north - from all communities and backgrounds - voted to reject it.They knew it would devastate the economy, strip away rights and undermine our political agreements.And that is why, in the immediate aftermath of the referendum result, Sinn Féin embarked on a diplomatic offensive across Europe warning of the dangers of Brexit and putting forward our demand for a unique solution for the north which would respect the majority remain vote.Through intense lobbying in Brussels, Strasbourg, Dublin and London, Sinn Féin led and built support for the idea that our unique position and peace agreements required a unique Brexit solution.Our case for special status for the north within the EU sought to ensure there would be no hard border, that citizens rights would be upheld and the Good Friday Agreement protected in all its parts.As the prospect of a no deal Brexit became more likely, we made it clear the north needed to remain in the customs union and single market in order to prevent our economy being driven off a clf by the Tories and their DUP allies.That was reflected in the backstop which was agreed by the EU and the British government. But as soon as it was agreed the British government, as they always do, began trying to renege on its commitments.Our position remains now as it was then. That backstop must be maintained and protected. It provides the bottom line and is our insurance policy against the worst excesses of Brexit, which we know will be a disaster for this country.The backstop is not perfect and neither is the withdrawal agreement. There is no such thing as a good Brexit after all.There are still issues of concern and clarication required, particularly relating to the issues of rights and representation.Over the course of the last number of days Sinn Féin has met with An Taoiseach and An Tanáiste and have been in contact with Theresa May about all of these concerns.The pro-remain parties represent the majority of people in the north and are fighting on their behalf.By contrast, the DUP are actively trampling the best interests of people and business in the north in their reckless cheerleading for an as yet  Tory Brexit.Sinn Féin will continue to stand with all other parties who advocate for citizens’ rights, our economic interests and our agreements in the face of Brexit.  We will continue to put pressure on the Irish government to act in the interests of citizens, north and south and hold the Taoiseach to his pledge that the people of the north will never again be left behind by an Irish Government.Whatever twists and turns the Brexit debacle takes next, the backstop as agreed must be maintained. It cannot be sacriced in an attempt to save the ailing career of Theresa May or to serve the hard-line agendas of the Brexiteers in the Tory party or the DUP. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27499  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonGUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers# rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.- Declan Kearney MLADimitrios Papadimoulis is a Greek MEP who represents the Syriza party in the European Parliament.He has spent a le time involved in left wing political activism in his native Greece and has been a member of the Syriza central leadership which brought the party from opposition into government in , while the country was still in the midst of its financial and economic crisis and subjected to extreme political and economic pressure by the European Unionestablishment.Dimitrios is ‘laconic and philosophical in the way of Sparta’ – to borrow a phrase he used during a contribution at a recent conference which we attended together in Brussels, organised by GUE-NGL the European Parliamentary group to which both Sinn Féin and Syriza are affiliated.This meeting brought together leadership representatives and MEPs from twenty of the most signicant political parties on the progressive Left in the EU to discuss the future direction of GUE-NGL and future political strategy and co-operation among left wing and progressive parties including the  European elections, and the next term of the EU parliament.During one of our conversations at the conference Dimitrios recalled a story from - years previously, when he was travelling to deliver a speech.Dimitrios told his taxi driver what he was planning to say at the meeting.The taxi man replied:“Remember, you are a politician, not a prophet. Do not promise me things it will take  years to achieve. Make change for me tomorrow.”Dimitrios immediately decided to change his speech. He learned a lesson that day from the taxi driver which has stayed with him ever since.Theories or notions, and even visions for changeremain just that unless they can translate into concrete change in society.People want change which makes a material dference in their lives for them and their families.And thats how it should be.Fair wages high quality education and health services free at the point of delivery and a clean sustainable environment should not be dreams. They need to become realities.So political activists who are committed to transformational change need to be grounded in the real world.They have to understand what they can deliver in the here and now, and then to have a plan to achieve even more.But the progressive Left can only make change when it has the strength to do so.That means setting realistic objectives and priorities, and then devising strategies which work.I said in my opening comments to the conference that Europe is at a crossroads.The political direction, policy orientation, and increasing need for reform of the EU coupled with, and often fuelling the rise of the extreme right wing, now presents an existential threat to the principles of the progressive Left.Social democracy has effectively collapsed both politically and electorally across Europe.There is a need to build a progressive Left alternative, and to popularise a new political narrative or common sense based upon core ideas: To include:·         That economies serve the many and not the few:·         That human and democratic rights are inalienable:·         That the global environment is protected:·         That Europe should act as a force for international peace and solidarity: and·         That racism, sectarianism, misogyny, homophobia and xenophobia are opposed.These ideas should be a common  for expanding the political strength of the progressive Left.However, that potential faces many challenges.Some of these are beyond the control of the progressive Left, but others are not.All of this was under discussion at the GUE-NGL conference.There were many notable contributions.Arnaldo Otegi, the General Secretary of the EH Bildu was in attendance.He had just received the ground breaking judgement from the European Court of Human Rights, which ruled his prosecution was wrong.During Arnaldos presentation he provided a powerful critique of global capitalism and the importance of defending community and social values.Panos Skourletis has been a senior minister of the Syriza government.In a highly signicant move several months ago, he moved from that role to take up the position of Secretary of Syrizas Central Committee.Panos set out an analysis of the situation in Greece and wider Europe and argued that it is time for a common front of left parties and other progressives and democratic forces in Europe.Earlier I argued that unity and cohesion are essential between parties and democratic forces on the left in Europe: and that we must focus on what expands unity, whilst respecting our dferences and uniqueness as parties and national movements.Sinn Féin believes that GUE-NGL has successfully enabled progressive parties from the left to co-operate within the European Parliament, whilst recognising the autonomy of political delegations.This is one of GUE-NGL’s strengths as a parliamentary group and deserves to be consolidated.Unanimity is not required on all issues, all of the time but progressives cannot afford to be disunited.Political sectarianism undermines political strength, solidarity and fraternity on the progressive Left.The collective strength of the progressive Left in Europe stems from the domestic relevance and political strength of its constituent parts.The left will only be as strong in the European Parliament as progressive Left and republican parties are relevant and strong in their national contexts.The success of a real progressive Left alternative,  depends upon securing strategic beach heads of political strength and influence.This is why support for Europes only left wing government in Greece is so politically important.Whilst progressives need to be in a hurry to make change and in pursuit of a social and more democratic Europe, we also need to be realistic and pragmatic.The distinction between strategy and tactical positions need to be understood.Alliances with others are indispensable to the process of changing the overall balance of forces.Rigid or dogmatic ideological positions can prevent agreement upon shared objectives and securing unity among the widest cross section of progressive and democratic opinion.The political discussion and focus upon an emergent European Progressive Caucus embracing the Left, social democrats, and environmentalists is such an innovative and welcome initiative.I proposed to the Brussels conference that a strategic consensus among the progressive Left and others should be based upon support for national independence, social emancipation, citizens rights, and democratic control over the economy.For our part Sinn Féin will contest the European election in  on an agenda which advocates for the creation of a Social Europe.We will be emphasising the need to protect rural and fishing communities the promotion of economic democracy enhanced environmental policy, human rights and social justice as well as defence of the Irish peace process and support for a united Ireland.The onset of Brexit has changed the political and social landscape in Ireland, and also signicantly influenced political discourse within the EU itself.It has swept away all of the established constitutional, political and economic assumptions about the status quo in Ireland and refocused international attention upon the democratic case for Irish unity.During the conference I highlighted the denial of citizens rights and blocking of political democracy in the north of Ireland by the DUP and British Tory government. The point was made that this existential rights crisis, combined with the imposition of Brexit represented the most serious threat to the Good Friday Agreement, and the democratic option for managing change in the north of Ireland.The European Parliament  EU institutions have become strategically important forums within which to promote the democratic aim of a united Ireland and to encourage support for an Irish unity referendum. The level of interest in, and support for constitutional change in Ireland is now at an unprecedented high level across the EU.Sinn Féin will continue lobbying to make the case for a united Ireland a priority for the progressive Left and within other sections of democratic opinion represented in the European Parliament. Irish unity is integral to the vision of a new Europe.Going forward, the progressive Left in Europe needs to focus its collective efforts upon maximising representation and influence in the next parliament.GUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.That is what the shared ambition of a New Europe should mean. Sinn Féin has a central role in promoting that vision.The progressive Left across Europe has much to do.We need to be people in a hurry.The future cannot wait.We need to plan, organise and attract the popular support to make change for all tomorrow: To build a New Europe - a Europe of Equals. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27500  ","story":"• John James Kelly, Jimmy Joe Reynolds and Charlie #Cathal# McCafferty Staff ReporterThe three men were in a back room in the house of Patrick Kelly, brother of John James, when the explosion blew away part of the walls and roof.On  November , IRA Volunteers blew up six customs posts along the border in Counties Armagh and Fermanagh.

BelfastBrexit survey: Have your say and you could win a £ Amazon voucher UUP leader Robin Swann said his party was prepared to look at all the alternatives to Theresa Mays \"unacceptable\" current deal but he stressed that any solution must be \"UK-wide\".Sinn Fein said the DUP couldnt negotiate their own agreement and there already was a Brexit deal on the table. NI boss is called ‘Tory cow’ for May support Speaking to BBC Radio s Today programme yesterday, Mrs Foster said she would not support calls for a second Brexit referendum, as the UK had already voted to leave and \"we respect that\". Repeating the DUPs opposition to Mrs Mays deal, she urged the Prime Minister to \"not waste time\" on it and instead look for a better solution to the border question.She hinted thatthe current Withdrawal Agreement failed to get through the House of Commons, her party could be open to a Norway plus style arrangement, where the whole of the UK stayed in the customs union until an agreement with the EU is reached on future trading relations. Would membership of the EEA work  Ms Foster said the DUPs \"one red line\" was to make sure Northern Ireland was not dferentiated from the rest of the UK in terms of customs and was \"not prescriptive\" about other potential options on the future relationship with the EU.But a Norway plus-style arrangement has been rejected by the TUV leader.Mr Allister told the Belfast : \"It would retain us fully within the EU single market, subject to all Brussels-made rules - adjudicated by the European Court of Justice - and maintain free movement of labour and require ongoing payments to the EU. That is not Brexit. Brexit: Ulster Farmers Union remain amenable to alternate Withdrawal Agreement proposal \"But for us it would be worse, because the Norway plus that is being talked about would additionally keep Northern Ireland in the customs territory of the EU - completing the repudiation of the Brexit that was voted for. Thus, the backstop would essentially still apply.\"Mr Allister continued: \"The core of the backstop is that Northern Ireland alone remains part of the customs territory of the EU.\"With the EU likely to only agree a Norway-style deal which had this add-on, it would leave us incarcerated in the EU in perpetuity.\"The UUP did not appear to rule out a Norway plus style arrangement. Mr Swann said: \"The Ulster Unionist Party cannot give our support to the Withdrawal Agreement and its disastrous backstop. However, we will look at every option and assess its merits - but the bottom line for the Ulster Unionist Party is that any solution must be UK-wide in its entirety.\"Sinn Fein MLA Mairtin O Muilleoir said: \"There already is a deal on the table - its not perfect but it avoids physical infrastructure on the border.\"The DUP cannot negotiate their own deal. Nor can they back a deal that isnt there.\"The EU has recognised that a unique solution is needed for the north because of our historical and geographical concerns. The backstop recognises that - that must be maintained.\"Mrs Foster told Radio  that Mrs Mays deal would see Northern Ireland \"erge off from the United Kingdom\" and she urged the Prime Minister to \"look for a better deal\" that \"takes back control of our money, of our borders and of our laws\".The DUP leader said: \"All the things that made us vote for Brexit are the things that are going to be imposed on Northern Ireland.\"Reiterating that the DUPs  MPs would not back the Withdrawal Agreement on December , Mrs Foster said it would create a \"huge democratic deficit\" in Northern Ireland.Mrs May yesterday rejected a suggestion that the failure to get a deal with the EU would see the UK stuck with the Northern Ireland backstop plan permanently.She was responding to Andrew Murrison, the Tory MP and chair of the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee, who compared it to a \"post-war pre-fab\".He said: \"Its sold as temporary, its built to last, and its likely to outlive us all.\"However, the PM dismissed his comments and told the House of Commons Liaison Committee it would only ever be a temporary solution.She added: \"Neither side thinks the backstop is a good place to be.\"Mrs May admitted that it would not be possible for the UK to unilaterally withdraw from it, though. But she said this was a guarantee to the people of Northern Ireland there would never be a hard border in place.Mrs May also rejected the claim that passing her Brexit deal in Parliament without the DUPs support would lead to the end of her partnership with Mrs Fosters party.\"Actually, the DUP have themselves said that the confidence-and-supply agreement remains in place,\" she stated.Mrs May refused to be drawn on what would happenMPs down the Withdrawal Agreement.

It will be confined to a roughly -square-mile area in and around Phoenix, including the neighbouring cities of Chandler, Tempe, Mesa and Gilbert.Although Waymo has been driving passengers without humans behind the wheel in its free pilot programme, it decided to be less daring with the new commercial service.“Self-driving technology is new to many, so we’re proceeding carefully with the comfort and convenience of our riders in mind,” Waymo chief executive John Krafcik wrote a blog post heralding the new service.The ride-hailing service is launching in the same area where a car using robotic technology from Uber hit and killed a pedestrian crossing a darkened street in Tempe, Arizona, seven months ago. That collision attracted worldwide attention that cast a pall over the self-driving car industry as more people began to publicly question the safety of the vehicles.The Uber robotic car had a human safety driver behind the wheel, but that was not enough to prevent the accident in March."},{"url":null,"title":"christmas charity extravaganza specialist joinery group weekend","story":"If you are looking for a magical family Christmas event, then please support this wonderful charity Santa Experience.This weekendMaghera based company Specialist Joinery Group are hosting a MEGA family Christmas day out inside their stunning new , ft² headquarters on the Coleraine Road.

The latter opened last year at a cost of poundm.ldquoSuch facilities are important in the provision of sport and recreation, especially to young people who are just starting out in their sporting activities, the council chairman continued.ldquoFacilities like the Down Leisure Centre provide a gathering place around which social activities occur. They provide a sense of pride of place and belonging that can add value to community and indeed the entire district.ldquoThe council is committed that all people in Newry, Mourne and Down enjoy good health and wellbeing via the districtrsquos community plan and that the lsquoBe Activersquo campaign is a superb way to help support this outcome.Cllr Murnin added: ldquoA healthy and active lestyle contributes positively to physical, mental and social wellbeing and as an organisation we want to encourage all our citizens to be active every day.Council officials are delighted with the new centre and the initial reaction of the public to date.One of the key features is the teaching pool which will allow the new centre to provide more swimming classes and education training for teachers, allowing full access to the main pool for other swimmers.Mains gas has also been connected to the new multi-million pound building which also boasts a combined heat and power source, helping minimise its carbon footprint. Photovoltaic cells which have been fitted on the roof help heat the water in the pools and shower systems across a number of changing room areas.In addition, air source heat pumps sucks in cold air from the outside and turns it into warm air, while so-called ocalux glass allows natural light to stream into the building, with everyone associated with the new centre, from the designers to builders and the councillors who supported it financially, delighted at the opening of a new chapter in the history of local leisure provision..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ballygalget on the ball helping families dealing with dementia  ","story":"BALLYGALGET GAC has been recognised for its effort in helping people who live with dementia in an award ceremony recently.John Mitchelrsquos GAC received the award after teaming up with the Alzheimerrsquos Society to become the first GAA club to take on the Dementia Friendly programme.This award recognises the work members do to ensure everyone affected with dementia in their parish and beyond gets the support they need.Brendan Birt, a spokesperson for the club, explained that the club had been crossing every cultural and religious ide since it was founded in .He said that in that time the club had attended to the needs of everyone who live in what is a very rural part of the Ards Peninsula.ldquoWe are delighted to win this award in recognition of the work that has been done by our club and in the community, he remarked.ldquoThe first initiative of our new award-winning health and wellbeing centre was to become a dementia friendly community. We already have  trained dementia friends and that is growing.ldquoAs the first GAA club, we wanted to get involved because of the many people within our community who are living with dementia. This has raised the profile and understanding of dementia within our club and parish.Although this project is in its infancy, two dementia friendly community workshops have already been delivered creating  dementia friends, not only in Ballygalget but in the surrounding areas too.Future plans include extending the dementia friends initiative to two neighbouring GAA clubs and to hold a workshop in the local primary school.Bernadine McCrory, Country Director for Alzheimerrsquos Society, said: ldquoIt is amazing that John Mitchelrsquos GAC has won the Championing Diversity award and it is a testament to their tremendous work they do.ldquoThe level of nominations received this year was truly phenomenal and there were some exceptional stories heard at the awards ceremony.ldquoWe want everyone affected by dementia to know that whoever you are, whatever you are going through, you can turn to Alzheimerrsquos Society for support, help and advice.She added: ldquoAll the finalists and winners at the Dementia Friendly Awards have demonstrated how we can unite against dementia and support those affected by the condition..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ballynahinch edge derby tie  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH secured an ugly derby win in front of a large home crowd and banished a few memories from the three defeats to Banbridge last season which cost them promotion.The home side were almost at full strength, with Peter Nelson at full back, Kyle McCall ing in the front row and Johnny McPhillips sprung from the bench in the second half. Conor Kelly was the only signicant absentee, with Richard Reaney taking his place on the wing.Banbridge were without most of their Ulster contingent, fielding the team which had propelled them through the leagues over the past few seasons, and they will feel that they should have beaten a jittery home side.Defence dominated an attritional match and both sides were guilty of giving away penalties when in strong positions. Nelson kicked his side into the lead after five minutes, following a positive start, but Banbridge cranked up the pressure and had an excellent ten minute spell. They were held up over the line following some excellent driving play and continued to pile on the pressure, a charge down leading to a succession of m scrums. Despite some heroic defence, Banbridge scored when Stevie Irvine was driven over in the nd minute.Ballynahinch followed this with their best spell of the match, with excellent carrying from forwards and backs, pinning Banbridge in their own . When it seemed they had finally stretched the Bann defence to the limit, a knock-on gave the away side some respite.As lsquoHinch began to build another wave of attacks, scrum half Rhys OrsquoDonnell spotted a gap around the ruck in the centre of the pitch and ran under the posts untouched for an excellent try.Nelsonrsquos simple conversion made it -, but lsquoHinch failed to push on and there was more defending to before half-time. Banbridge missed a penalty just before the break and the home side turned round with a narrow three-point cushion.McPhillips replaced Hilton Gibbons at half-time and knocked over an excellent penalty early in the second half to stretch the lead to six points. However, Banbridge had already shown their intention to move the ball and they looked increasingly dangerous with ball in hand, especially from scrums.Centre Andy Morrison looked dangerous every time he received the ball and Banbridge upped the tempo with lsquoHinch looking increasingly nervous. A yellow card for number  Conall Boomer in the rd minute following a collapsed maul invited pressure and only sensational home defence with  men kept them out.The home try line was eventually breached in the th minute when Morrison went over following a missed tackle in midfield. The missed conversion gave Hinch a leline and despite more pressure form a superbly well drilled Banbridge team the final score remained -. Relief rather than elation from the home supporters as they made their way home.Ballynahinch Banbridge AIL DIVISION B.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Chairman gives his backing to ‘green’ off road paths scheme  ","story":"A CAMPAIGN to connect Downpatrick with the Rowallane area via a series of off-road paths has secured the backing of the districtrsquos first citizen.A delegation of residents met recently with Newry, Mourne and Down Council chairman Mark Murnin to discuss extending the existing Quoile River walk towards Killyleagh. A motion on the issue will be tabled at next monthrsquos meeting of the local authority.The council chairman was presented with a consultancy report on the merits of the proposal and the minor costings of delivering the scheme which have not yet been made public.The delegation was led by Downpatrick councillor Cadogan Enright, who was joined by David Flinn, from the Ulster Ramblers Association.The report on extending the existing Quoile River walk into Rowallane was commissioned by the Downpatrick-based Stream Street Residentsrsquo Association, which was represented at the meeting by Anthony Trainor.Also taking part was Peter Smyth from the Downpatrick Community Collective, a body which represents all community and residentsrsquo associations in the town. It is also supporting the proposed initiative.Cllr Enright described the off-road paths proposal as a ldquosimple, affordable and detailed plan to restore linkages lost in the s and s.He continued: ldquoIt has long been the desire of all political parties to restore the Ulster Way and reconnect Killyleagh, Delamont Country Park, Downpatrick, Castle Ward and Strangford.ldquoImplementing the reported does not require actual money at all, but simply the local council using its powers under the Countryside Order to remove some of the obstructions that have grown up in recent years.Cllr Enright said the network of paths would reconnect Delamont and Castle Ward with Downpatrick. He explained the route would require two or three short sections of boardwalk similar to those near the Belfast Road to reconnect paths or overcome boggy ground.ldquoAll this needs is a resolute approach by council management to reflect cross-party consensus over the priority of this project, he added.Cllr Murnin said the loss of official Ulster Way status in  for an area stretching from Killyleagh to Downpatrick and from Downpatrick to Strangford was a ldquohuge blow to East Down.He continued: ldquoSince then, local authority staff have intended to re-assert off-load links to recreate these vital routes, but this project has not been prioritised.ldquoWe can re-establish East Down as the centre of a network of off-road community trails that would be both regionally and nationally signicant. I will be lending my support to the cross-party motion in council to prioritise these three inter-linked routes.Mr Smyth said funding for the off-road paths study was obtained though the Stream Street Residentsrsquo Association, with the project supported by the Downpatrickrsquos Collective which surveyed hundreds of users of existing pathways around Delamont and the Quoile River.He added: ldquoThere is clearly overwhelming public support for this proposal that would cost a small fraction of the money recently invested in providing so-called greenways in the Newry, Warrenpoint and South Armagh areas to link into the Cooley mountains..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Congratulations all round at Saintfield High School  ","story":"SIXTY years of providing outstanding education are being celebrated at Saintfield High School.The school proudly opened its doors in  as Saintfield Secondary Intermediate School with  pupils and five teachers.The school has seen many changes, including extensions and additions, the subjects offered to pupils, the ied members of staff and, of course, the generations of pupils.Miss Sarah-Lucy Hynds, principal, said the th anniversary was being marked ldquowith a real sense of pride in our past, and an excited and positive outlook for the future.She continued: ldquoIt is an absolute honour and privilege to lead such a thriving and active school community a school with a highly commended academic, pastoral, sporting and cultural history.The school has been instrumental in the development of the wider community during the last  years mdash in the citizens that it has produced and in the many and ied achievements of pupils, both past and present.Mr Johnston Young was appointed as the schoolrsquos first principal in .

When he was included in the play, he was absolutely lethal and too hot for Killough to handle.Alas, Killough were masters of their own downfall. They had the major share of possession throughout a feisty encounter, but were never going to be as ruthless as Celtic up front with too many chiefs in midfield and not enough Indians up front and any time they did threaten, goalkeeper Nathan Curran was there to deny them.Celtic started in a hurry and were - up after only four minutes. Stevie Galbraith, who led the line with distinction, linked up with McCoubrey out on the left before cutting inside Chris Fryer.He had only one thing on his mind as he entered the box and an angled right-footed curler, that seemed to take a bit of a deflection, beat Gerard Gormley all ends up.Killough tried desperately to get back on level terms and with seven minutes gone they went close when Fryer let loose from just outside the box. Curran did well to take the sting out of the shot and did even better to retrieve the loose ball ahead of the lurking Tony McIlhone.Two minutes later at the other end a McCoubrey cross was met at the back post by Sean McMahon, but he failed to get a good connection with his head and the chance was wasted.With  minutes gone the same combination dovetailed perfectly again, but McMahonrsquos cross hit the crossbar. McCoubrey was back in the thick of things minutes later when he had a shot well saved by Gormley, but Killough continued to threaten at the opposite end as well with McIlhone again being denied by Curran.Killough were starting to edge midfield and with  minutes gone Curran prevented Liam Graham from equalising after a tidy pass from Michael Burns. Just as Killough started to believe they could get back into the game, they shot themselves in the foot.As they dithered at the back, getting the ball forward, Celticrsquos pressing game bore fruit and McCoubrey took full advantage to race away and beat Gormley with a clinical strike.Four minutes into the second half McCoubrey made it - after Galbraith picked him out with a delightful pass that split Killough wide open.The exciting teenager could have added to his tally on a couple of occasions as Killough gamely tried to get back into contention, but he was out of luck with two cheeky efforts that went narrowly wide.McCoubrey eventually completed his hat-trick in the th minute when Celtic again caught Killough napping at the back and there was only going be one outcome when the talented youngster raced through to beat Gormley.Celtic Bhoys: Nathan Curran, Sean Megahey, Conor Doherty, Matthew Carson, Michael Rice, Jordan Curran, Jordan McCoubrey, Ricky Kerr, Stephen Galbraith, Sean McMahon, Chris Mullan, Subs: Terence Bell, Caolain Boyd, Andy Baggley.Killough: Gerard Gormley, Chris Fryer, Conor Black, Michael Burns, Colm Stranney, Kevin Groves, Liam Graham, Tony McIlhone, Ross Armstrong, Gareth George, Jack McLaughlin.

A comprehensive design scheme would also have to be worked up.NI Water officials have also confirmed Saintfield is one of a number of towns across the Province which requires signicant investment to upgrade the existing infrastructure to carter for current and future demand.Rowallane politicians fear the moratorium on new development in Saintfield could potentially be in place for two years and have urged senior NI Water officials to do all they can to expedite the work that is required. They say the current ban will not only have a major impact on residents and developers, but the townrsquos economy.NI Waterrsquos Stephen Blockwell confirmed to Newry, Mourne and Down councillors that the drainage study will not be completed until next December. He said the study will look at the causes of the current issues in Saintfield and outline solutions.Pointing to sewage spills at the Old Grand Jury Road, Mr Blockwell, NI Waterrsquos head of investment, said the study was part of NI Waterrsquos approach to wastewater capacity and described it as a tool ldquoto get timely solutions.Mr Blockwell continued: ldquoIn terms of the drainage plan we need to get the right analysis to come up with solutions and the model we are working on will be ready in December . It takes time to do this work and analysis and get the right solution. If there is available funding, we will be able to bring schemes forward.ldquoThere are under capacity issues across Northern Ireland in relation to wastewater treatment works but there are parts of the Saintfield area like Darragh Cross where development is not restricted.Mr Blockwell added: ldquoUnfortunately for some current residents in Saintfield when there is heavy rainfall, there is restricted toilet use. This is very unpleasant and we sympathise with them. We will work to ensure everything is in place to develop a solution to this issue.Rowallane councillors Billy Walker and Terry Andrews have urged officials to ensure that the study is not only completed on time, but that money to implement its ious recommendations is available. They argue it is not unrealistic to suggest that the development ban could be in place for up to two years.ldquoIt is very concerning that work on the study will not be completed for another  months with no guarantee that the money needed to provide a st century sewerage system in Saintfield will be available, said Cllr Walker.ldquoThis is a very serious issue and one that must be urgently addressed. The ban is impinging on the future development of one of this districtrsquos leading towns and we currently have situation during heavy rain that raw sewage is backing up into peoplersquos gardens.Cllr Walker said it was his understanding that Saintfield is one of  towns in Northern Ireland which requires major investment to upgrade sewage treatment plants and the sewerage network.He added: ldquoSaintfield must be at the top of NI Waterrsquos priority list and the money needed to upgrade the sewerage system must be available. Given that the study will only be completed next December, by the time it takes to draw up detailed designs and secure money to carry out improvements, the development ban could be in place for at least two more years.

It has also argued that the current application represents the ldquobest value for money.ldquoThe RNLI applies the highest standards and practices to all its applications for its facilities. The site chosen, from what was available, is the one that represents the best location and value for money for the Institution.That assertion is one that has been challenged by the LEYC who has said in its letter to members: ldquoWe also believe that the cost of the new site will be considerably more expensive overall with higher ongoing maintenance and cost and therefore a waste of donations.The LEYC also claim that the RNLI have changed their mind over the site of its proposed new station: ldquoWhen we originally discussed the proposed site with the RNLI they told us that they preferred to build as part of a bigger development as originally it was submitted as part of a bigger development plan. They later changed this to saying that the newer site would give them more visibility and potential footfall despite it being obvious that the original site was much more public facing.The LEYC also asserts that the original site it refers to would not require as much dredging as what is being proposed by the RNLI. In its letter however the LEYC stated that ldquowe are supporters of the RNLI and any objection we have is only to the proposed siting of the boathouse and should not be interpreted as any fallout with the local volunteers who we respect and support.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

She had added: “I will be making it crystal clear to President Juncker and others that we will never do so.”Mr Swann said in a statement that despite her promise, “that is exactly what she has done”.He said: “The legal advice vindicates the concerns the UUP has been expressing for  months now. If the Prime Minister’s Withdrawal Agreement is allowed to proceed it would see Northern Ireland cast adrt.“While the Government has been trying to downplay our concerns - even as recently as last week when we met both the Prime Minister and then Cabinet Office officials – the legal advice that was sitting on their desks from the Attorney General tells us we were right to reject this deal because of the damage it could cause to Northern Ireland and its place in the United Kingdom in the long term.“It is unbelievable that this or any Prime Minister would even consider signing the United Kingdom up to what is on the table at present. It reinforces our position that the backstop should not have been allowed to be included in December  in the first place.“The Prime Minister should reflect on the damage that has been done to trust by her Government’s approach to this deal.What was the point in them spending the best part of a year saying they shared our concerns,all the while they were negotiating a deal that contains everything we were concerned about ”He added: “Just as I warned,and when it comes to Great Britain fully departing from the EU, at the cost of leaving Northern Ireland behind, there won’t be much thought given that equation by some in the Conservative Party.“There is no point in the Prime Minister continuing to flog this dead deal. It is pitul that the legal advice had to be dragged out by Parliament. Is this Government determined on death by a thousand cuts  “Running down the clock in a vain attempt to make it a choice between a bad deal and no deal is totally reckless.”Cost of Primark security is revealed Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch     .               ..

The backstop will come into force on the conclusion of the transition period while negotiations are continuing for an agreement that supersedes it and “unless and until” that “subsequent agreement” is applicable.“. While the UK as a whole will form a single customs territory the arrangements as a whole apply dferently in GB and Northern Ireland.“. Northern Ireland remains in the EU’s customs union and will apply the whole of the EU’s customs acquis and the Commission and the European Court of Justice will continue to have jurisdiction over its compliance with those rules.Therefore, goods passing from GB to NI will be subject to a declaration process.“. Northern Ireland will remain in the Single Market for Goods and the EU’s customs regime and will be required to apply and comply with the relevant rules and standards.Herein opens up regulatory ergence in the future.“. The implication, as outlined by the Attorney General, of NI remaining in the EU Single Market for Goods while GB does not is that for regulatory purposes GB is “essentially treated as a third country by NI for goods passing from GB into NI”.This is totally unacceptable and economically mad in that it will be erecting internal economic and trade barriers within the United Kingdom.“. The backstop will continue indefinitely and cannot be exited by the UK.Mr Cox says “Therefore despite statements in the protocol that it is not intended to be permanent and the clear intention of the parties that it should be replaced by alternative, permanent arrangements, in international law the protocol would endure indefinitely until a superseding agreement took its place in whole or in part as set out therein.” The truth is now laid bare for all to see in that the backstop will not be temporary in nature.MPs need reassurance over ending the Irish backstop says powerful Tory MP in Brexit debateHeartbreak as teenage Syrian refugee dies suddenly Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"“. In paragraph  it appears possible that the EU could apply that the protocol is no longer necessary “in whole or in part” and consequently it is possible that the GB elements of the customs union could fall away leaving only Northern Ireland in the EU customs territory as the minimum necessary.“. The legal advice makes clear that the current drafting of the backstop does not provide for a mechanism that is likely to enable the UK lawfully to exit.”Mr Dodds added: “This advice concisely sets out the stark reality of the operation of the backstop.Its publication demonstrates how the Prime Minister has failed to abide by the commitments she gave in that the United Kingdom as a whole would leave the European Union and that she would ensure there would be no customs or regulatory ergence within the United Kingdom.“This backstop is totally unacceptable to Unionists throughout the United Kingdom and it must be defeated and arrangements renegotiated that uphold the commitments which the Prime Minister and her government has in the House of Commons.”try catch     .               ..

the risk Brexit could be stopped, the risk we could crash out with no deal.”She said it would not be in the “national interest” to block the Withdrawal Agreement, adding: “The only certainty would be uncertainty.”MPs’ decisions over the next week would “set the course our country takes for decades to come”, she said.Mrs May told them: “I promise you today this is the very best deal for the British people, I ask you to back it in the best interests of our constituents and our country.“And with my whole heart I commend this motion to the House.”In a speech repeatedly interrupted by MPs attacking her deal, the prime minister pledged to give Parliament and the devolved administrations a “greater and more formal role” in forthcoming negotiations with the EU over trade — but declined to say whether MPs would get a vote on that deal.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said Mrs May’s deal would “make this country worse off”.• Morning View, page JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings  Terms and Conditions  Disclaimer  Privacy  Cookies Policy    d.onerror  d.onload  d.src  [\"secure-uk.imrworldwide cgi-bin m ciuk-hcgccsi\", escape, \"rp\", escape, \"tscompactrnd\", .getTime].join"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_auto,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.newsletter.co.uk/webimage/1.8676194.1544022275!/image/image.jpg","title":"opinion","story":".... , , , , Would you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Newsletters\"Would you like to receive more information from Johnston Press , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"By clicking on register, you will be creating an account with Belfast Newsletter and agreeing to Johnston Press# Standard Terms and ConditionsWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from Johnston Press , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \" addCustomTextToCreateAccountTemplateNewslettersWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from Johnston Press , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"  \". s .  \". s  \". s  \".after+text+ .+text+ .before+text+ .after+text+  Opinion   Jobs Cars Homes  Directory  Announcements  Advertise My Business NewsletterRegisterLoginEdit Account\"Sign Out\" --\"    --       News Opinion Politics Crime Farming Education Business Transport Environment Health Your Say Offbeat News Politics Crime Farming Education Business Transport Environment Health Your Say Offbeat Sport Football Rugby Union Cricket Golf Motorcycling Boxing More Sport Whats On Music Theatre  Comedy Arts TV  Film Eating Out Lestyle Nostalgia People Family Gadgets  Tech Outdoors Travel Cars Read This           Opinion      Gibraltar values being British as much as Northern Ireland doesGibraltar and Northern Ireland are united by more than British heritage, ideals and freedoms.

.removeAttr  .html  .html.valThe DUP#s Westminster leader has said he would be #happy# to have another general election to prove the party has support in Northern Ireland for blocking the PM#s Brexit deal.Nigel Doddsreiterated his party’s opposition to the current proposals, saying in the House of Commons yesterday: “In terms of the views of the people of Northern Ireland I’m quite happy to put it to a test any time.DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds MP“We will happily go to the electorate and put our views to the peopleneeds be, and I’m quite certain we would be ed in greater numbers than today.”The comments were in response to independent MP Lady Sylvia Hernon , who said the pro-Brexit DUP does not represent the views of the majority in Northern Ireland.Mr Dodds added: “So I’m quite happy to take on the challenge that has been put down.”Mr Dodds also said it is not the job of a government minister to decide what is in the national interest, as Theresa May’s administration was held in contempt of Parliament for failing to publish its full legal advice on Brexit.The North Belfast MP was speaking during yesterday’s debate, after his party joined forces with Labour, Liberal Democrats and SNP MPs to force the government to disclose the Attorney General’s advice in full.While the DUP deputy leader praised Attorney General Geoffrey Cox for offering the “unnished truth” as he was grilled by MPs in the Commons on Monday, he added: “This does not fulfil the order that was passed by this House, which was for the final and full advise provided by the Attorney General to the Cabinet to be published.”Mr Dodds told MPs: “The government may not like the fact that this was passed by this House, but it can not simply wish it otherwise.“Surely this is one area where the government must respect the will of Parliament.”He said that one of the arguments against publishing the full advice – that it is protected by privilege - was “bogus”.“I have heard the argument that this is privileged, but of course in the lawyer-client relationship, privilege belongs to the client, not the person giving the advice. If the client waives that, then the lawyer is quite at liberty to disclose,” Mr Dodds said.“It is not the duty or the job for any government minister to decide the national interest, the House has decided what it wishes to do and it is not for a government minister to override that.”Gunned down in front of terried school kidsMPs need reassurance over ending the Irish backstop says powerful Tory MP in Brexit debate Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"He added that parts of the legal advice had already been leaked to the media by members of the Cabinet, so therefore MPs should be entitled to see it as well.DUP Brexit spokesperson Sammy Wilson said that government had “scored an own goal” by refusing to release the legal advice.The East Antrim MP told the Commons: “This secretive approach only confirms in people’s minds that there is something to hide.”try catch     .               ..

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community. Itrsquos been le-enhancing for us, and wersquove made all sorts of friends.ldquoPenarth town is a really good place to train a guide dog puppy, with a small arcade and local shops. People are very amenable and love being part of Gemrsquos education. We have the Esplanade, beaches and country parks, and wersquove even taken her to Ikea.\"People are very interested in the puppy and we rarely go on a walk without someone enquiring about what we are doing. Gem is so sociable and would like to say hello to everyone.The couple remember vividly the arrival of their first guide dog puppy, a yellow Labrador retriever named Gilly.ldquoWe were excited, very well prepared, and fell in love with her straight away, said Mrs Arthur. ldquoIt was the most joyful and wonderful experience, but you have to be prepared to put in the hard work to train the puppy.ldquoHanding her back after a year was hard, but we were kept informed of her progress and wersquore proud that she is now a qualied guide dog.The charity is seeking more puppy raisers in the Vale of Glamorgan area. Volunteers need access to a car and must be free to spend time with the puppy for most of the day. Their yard or garden will also need to be securely fenced so that the puppy remains safely within its confines.Guide Dogs supplies basic equipment, covers all veterinary and feeding expenses, and provides a network of support and advice.To find out more about becoming a puppy raiser for Guide Dogs, ring Steve Kersley on   and leave a message, or email Steve.Kersley@guidedogs.org.uk article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Here Emma Deighan scours some of the top NI venues to see how they are catering to the corporate Christmas Arguably the most anticipated social event in the work diary, the Christmas ‘do’ has evolved over the years.And many of Northern Ireland’s top hosts agree and have widened their offering in response.Event managers and venue owners say everything from the format of the Christmas party to its timing have changed to accommodate the demands of employees today. How, when and where we celebrate are top priorities.Take the evening do, for example. For many, that age-old three-course setup doesn’t cut the convenience factor, prompting my employers end the work day early to take advantage of lunch dates. It’s a favourable move that delivers on two fronts – it offers time-poor workers the relief of a shorter day but doesn’t infringe on family obligations.Owner of Bishop’s Gate Hotel in Derry and former president of the Northern Ireland Hotel’s Federation, Ciaran O’Neill agrees. “Christmas has changed over the last number of years for our industry with more businesses looking for lunches, as opposed to the traditional party nights of old,” he said. “We do still have ‘big nights’, but these tend to occur on Fridays and Saturdays.”Ciaran says he has also noted an increase in smaller party sizes over the years.“We are seeing less private large events and more small groups dining with us. Employees are arranging ‘get togethers’ with colleagues or teams that they work directly with.”Bishop’s Gate, which has become Derry’s hospitality jewel attracting the AA Hotel of the Year- accolade, among many other awards, pairs an historic setting with parties for Christmas.The Bullitt Hotel in Belfast is setting the scene for the experience-savvy hipster workforce – and this Christmas Bullitt’s ‘experiences’ reflect the discernment of its guests.General manager at Bullitt, Michael Sullivan has seen a spike in ‘experience’ events, upgrading the turkey feast to a cooler, more casual event.“We have had a number of enquiries for informal gatherings in our Good Room event space, with a festive lunch to follow. The Good Room is the perfect space to blur the lines between work and play for intimate company get togethers ahead of a more traditional Christmas do,” he said.“We’ve also had enquiries for private gin and whiskey tastings and can also organise a number of unique events and team-building activities for groups, from candle-making to chunky knitting workshops for a truly memorable Christmas party.”This December Bullitt has a range of packages to suit private and shared s – from sit-down meals in its restaurant Taylor and Clay to VIP packages in its Baltic Bar or secluded enclaves above in Babel – its rooftop bar. And its ‘Tipsy Tea’ is geared towards the day-time revellers. Prices range from £. to £. a head.“Bullitt has brought something new and exciting to the traditional Christmas party market, with a range of novel spaces set within cool, contemporary surroundings. We like to think that we’re helping to shake up the scene somewhat by offering something a little dferent,” Michael said.If you want to push the boat out with your corporate squad, Titanic Belfast is ready for boarding. Its play on Belfast’s shipbuilding heritage and the fateful Titanic is always a crowd pleaser. Laura Cowan, head of sales at Titanic Belfast said: “We host bespoke private Christmas party nights, which are tailored to our clients’ needs across all of the Titanic venues – Titanic Belfast , SS Nomadic and the Titanic Exhibition Centre. “These can range from private dining, iconic tailored experiences, drinks receptions and gala dinners. We also host our traditional Christmas party nights – featuring a Christmas cocktail reception on arrival followed by a delicious four course banquet and live entertainment.”For sheer luxury, the more refined office workers take to the Cathedral Quarter in Belfast to sample the Merchant’s opulent offering.And Clare Mullin, meetings and events manager there, said the hotel’s renowned afternoon teas are bucking the turkey dinner trend but are every bit as fancul. “Over the years we have seen an increased demand for Christmas parties and festive events that offer something a little dferent, memorable or exciting. People increasingly seem to be looking for something out of the ordinary.“We have seen a trend for corporate bookings where companies are looking for alternatives to a traditional evening dinner. For example, our Festive Afternoon Tea is very popular – especially the Champagne iety. Festive drinks in our famous Cocktail Bar continue to be a popular option for the corporate market too, with bespoke offerings such as our Redbreast whiskey flight extremely popular. gtClient lunches in The Cloth Ear and Berts Jazz Bar are also growing in popularity.”Casual begins in its neighbouring Cloth Ear from £. a person, retro at Berts Jazz Bar will cost you £. for lunch or £ for dinner.For private s The Roof Garden Alpine Lodge at the Merchant can cater to  and for the more luxurious three-courses will be served in the Rita Duffy Suite for £ a person.The newly revamped and extended Ten Square is another setup that combines afternoon tea with tradition.Swapping caffeine for mulled wine and pastries for mince pies, Ten Square’s Loft, located on its top floor and flaunting some pretty impressive city centre views, plays the backdrop to this year’s festive afternoon teas at £ a head, from pm to pm.It also offers more familiar packages in its Linen Hall suite where tradition mingles with s DJs to live bands.And for those who really want to go that extra mile, Belfast’s newest Hastings sibling is ready and waiting.The Grand Central Hotel on Bedford Street boasts unrivalled views from sky-high Observatory, where afternoon tea takes on a Christmas theme or tradition can be celebrated at its Seahorse Restaurant and ground floor Grand Cafe. Allyson McKimm, events director of Hastings Hotels said expectations for hospitality environments to up their game get higher every year.She said Hastings Hotels had “reached new heights this year to keep the format fresh and exciting with new entertainment and new twists on the menus and lots of exciting extras including the traditional and limited edition Christmas ducks.”Allyson said a growing trend for lunch events inspired Europa’s ‘Christmas Caberet Lunches’ with Motown entertainment. The live tribute act theme travels across its entire portfolio. “Once again, our guests have asked usthey could continue the celebrations after Christmas once the party season is over, and to meet this demand, we have launched a whole range of tribute shows between Christmas and the New Year at all venues including ever popular All American Buffet with Elvis at the Europa, Jersey Guys, ABBA and our favourite George Michael and Robbie Williams Tribute Show at the Ballygally, Stormont and Everglades Hotels.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/john1.jpg","title":"majority of ni firms expanding workforce in ","story":"Posted on Friday  November  by John Mulgrew More Northern Ireland firms say they will take on new staff next year than compared to the UK as a whole, according to a new survey. Recruitment firm Hays says among NI-based employers, % said they expect to hire additional staff in the next year, compared to a UK average of %. That’s the highest percentage in the last five years. Meanwhile, % of firms polled said they had experienced some form of skills shortage within the past year, against a UK average of %. The survey also showed that some Northern Ireland employers are finding it harder to recruit staff, due to lower levels of unemployment leading to a rise in wages. John Moore, managing director of Hays in Northern Ireland, said: “Employers in Northern Ireland told us they are pressing ahead with business plans and are generally optimistic about the wider economic climate for the next two to five years. Recruitment expectations are at their highest levels for five years, for both temporary and permanent roles. “Increased competition for talent coupled with skills shortages has helped support above UK-average salary growth in Northern Ireland. While that is positive for those seeking new employment it also has downsides, including negative impacts on productivity, staff morale and the ability to deliver projects. “Given the intense competition and, at times, unrealistic salary requirements from candidates, it’s never been more important for employers to understand the complex factors that influence employee movement. “Salary is still a top consideration, but candidates are now influenced by other benefits, such as le balance and career progression opportunities. However, only % of employers surveyed saw work le balance as a priority, compared with % of employees.” The survey is based on responses from almost , employers and professionals working in a range of industries, including almost  in Northern Ireland.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/les_1.jpg","title":"a word from the wise les mccracken","story":"Posted on Monday  November  by Ulster Business Name: Les McCracken Position: Managing director, McCue Crafted Fit How did you get to the position you are in today I’m a big believer in work ethic. When I was young,  or so, I had a summer job on a farm. I would have milked  cows, morning and night, in addition to general duties around the farm. I was probably working  hours a week at that time, plus cycling five miles back and forth. It has stood me in good stead throughout my le. If you apply yourself, you can do anything.What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  In short, people. They are the greatest assets to a company but they can also be the biggest challenge. I’ve been fortunate enough to build a fantastic team around me at McCue but that has taken time. I’ve been here over  years and we’ve organically grown over that period from  employees and a turnover of £, to  employees and £m. It is also worth noting that in our sector there is a lack of skilled people, when you train them up some leave, which is disappointing but you have to train them and hope they stay. More must be done to engender the younger generation in to these skilled jobs. Too many are still going aimlessly in to third level education not knowing what they want to do, whereas they can earn as you learn in a trade, and that is much needed across the manufacturing sector.How would you describe your management style  I like to think I have a good management style, most of the time I’m very easy going and I do believe in autonomy. I expect those with responsibility to be capable and willing to do their job to the highest of their ability. I also have an open door policy allowing anyone to come and discuss problems but please bring with you a solution too.This allows my team to complete projects around the world from Vienna to Milan to Stockholm. We’ve been very fortunate to work with great brands, both in retail and hospitality, and on some fantastic projects from Ten Trinity Square in London to Danske Bank in Belfast and around Northern Ireland.What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  Of course, who wouldn’t say things could be done dferently, and better  Nobody is perfect, there’s always room for improvement. If I was to work until I was  years old, I would still learn something new every day.Have you done it all on your own  No, of course not. Who does  After  years I’ve a fantastic team who are very competent and trustworthy. But it has taken hard work and graft to get here. Today is very dferent to  years ago and for me I chose the right path. Today, you can enter this sector via a trade, an apprenticeship or a university background it’s about the right fit and enjoying what you do.How would you like your business to be remembered  McCue Crafted Fit is bigger than I. It’s been going for  years and providing unquestionable quality work. Like Jimmy McCue, who set this company up, when I choose to go, I hope to be remembered as a good leader who left the company in the best possible shape. Thirty years is a long time to be managing director and I have seen many changes in skill base, technology from hand drawn floor plans to full colour D fully explosive plans. It certainly has been an interesting three decades or so. I’d also like to note that McCue weathered the recession very well. I took some strategic decisions in  and , which ensured we not only held our own, but grew as a company.What piece of advice would you give to a -year-old you Be patient. Time will come.

And boss Brendan Mooney says it is “disappointing” that a political argument around Brexit is “over-shadowing” the business case, which is largely supportive of the withdrawal deal currently on the table. The company, which has it headquarters in Belfast, saw adjusted pre-tax profit rising % - from £.m to £.m, in the six months to the end of September. It says much of the increase is down to the expansion of its Workday business throughout Europe. It says “to support the continued expansion with our Workday-related business, in Europe we continue to grow from our recently established offices in Frankfurt and Copenhagen, alongside our existing offices in Amsterdam and Gdansk”. “In North America we continue to expand our presence in Boston and Atlanta and we will open an office in Toronto in the next few weeks.” Brendan Mooney, the firm’s chief executive, told Ulster Business “There is no single reason or new reason .” He said the firms government commercial work was still a very strong part of the business, with a move towards digitalisation. “In Workday, as it rolls out across the world, there is great demand for the service as well. “There is underlying geographical expansion and signicant revenue outside the UK – we are seeing growth across Europe.” The company has grown its workforce to , – up again on the previous year, and has continued to grow. Of that,  workers are based at its Belfast and Londonderry offices which Brendan says “are a very important part of our business, and that trend will continue”. On Brexit, from a company perspective, Brendan says the services it provides to government are “not linked to Brexit”. “For us, it doesn’t get impacted by the Brexit direction – we are pragmatic on that. “In terms of Northern Ireland, the reality is… conversations about a political impact, they are over-shadowing what businesses are talking about and that’s disappointing.” He said looking forward at the next five years, the rise in demand for areas such as machine learning could form a much bigger part of the business.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/223.jpg","title":"lunns opening m rolex store in city","story":"Posted on Thursday  November  by Ulster Business Luxury watch and jewellery business Lunn’s is opening a new £m Rolex store in Belfast city centre. The family-owned firm is taking on an empty unit at the front of Queen’s Arcade at Donegall Place. It already has its flagship store at the arcade. It comes as the company has unveiled a new Rolex workshop at its Belfast base, which means it can carry out servicing of the watches in-house. Earlier this year, it was announced that Queen’s Arcade would undergo a major £m facelt. Peter Lunn, chairman of Lunn’s Jewellers, said the decision by Rolex to open in Belfast is “a huge endorsement for the city”. “Rolex is one of the world’s true super-brands and to have their store on Donegall Place, the city’s main retail thoroughfare, is a major expression of confidence. The store will offer customers a truly immersive experience of the brand. “We are also very excited to be opening a fully accredited Rolex workshop, which will help owners to maintain the value and ensure the quality of their watches by having them serviced by skilled technicians on site at Queen’s Arcade. It represents a big investment in Rolex parts and machinery, but we believe it is an essential part of the authentic Rolex experience.” Richard de Leyser, managing director, Rolex UK, said: “I’m delighted that Lunn’s continues to invest in our partnership and excited at the prospect of expanding the Rolex offering in Queen’s Arcade. “The plans to extend the space dedicated to Rolex and provide a new and engaging customer experience will perfectly position Lunn’s to meet the challenges of a rapidly changing retail environment. “The contemporary space will complement the historic architecture of Queen’s Arcade and provide a fitting home for Rolex.  We are proud to partner Lunn’s in this new development which will further enhance the unrivalled service to our customers in Northern Ireland.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/chamber_1.jpg","title":"outline your alternative to brexit deal says ni chamber president","story":"Posted on Thursday  November  by John Mulgrew It’s now time for political leaders opposed to a draft withdrawal agreement on Brexit to “outline alternative proposals” as an overwhelming majority of Northern Ireland’s business community back the plans, an industry leader has said. Ellvena Graham, president of the Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said Prime Minister Theresa Mays deal on the table is “definitely much better than a no-deal scenario”. “After a long period of negotiation we now have a draft Withdrawal Agreement which is undoubtedly a welcome step forward for the majority of businesses in Northern Ireland,” she said. “We want the outcome that’s best for businesses, for consumers, for the economy and for the future stability of Northern Ireland – and we’ll do everything we can to ensure that we get it. “We therefore encourage our political representatives who support the draft agreement to do everything in their power to influence political representatives in Britain to join them. “For those that are not in support of the draft agreement, it is now time to outline your alternative proposals. We are willing to listen.” Ms Graham was speaking at the NI Chamber’s President’s Banquet at ICC Belfast. And as Northern Ireland approaches two years without a devolved government, she said that while there is a “vibrant and innovative business community that wants to invest and grow” that it is “stymied because of the prolonged absence of a regional government and the endless Brexit bickering”.

A deal is on the table, though.Nick says that, aside from issues around getting staff, a transition must be in place after March  for export certicates, otherwise he can’t sell product outside the UK.“I have an ambition to get it to the mid-s . We are growing our EBITA from the £m average to about £m.”Pre-tax profits have cracked the £m mark in the last year, while turnover has soared by almost £m to £m.Nick says he turned his attention to attracting back some of the farmers which it has lost to other competitors.“At one point we had a billion litres of milk, now it’s around  million. We hadn’t been paying a particularly good milk price. “What ithad done is invested in itself quite heavily, and invested in the future, and had made a really brave strategic decision in , long before I came here, to get out of producing milk powders, and getting in to cheese and whey.“Now, that cost them £m to do that. That was really brave.“The first thing we did was get out to farmers, and explain to them what their business was.“We have paid a leading milk price, and that has brought genuine pride.“We needed to get into the business. The most fundamental change – it’s a people agenda. We were a very centralised business and all decisions came from the top, and went out.“Now, we have put the business into seven strategic business units and we are getting more adept with strategy, day-to-day, and developing people within the business to take ownership.”Nick says it’s about getting the right people into the business, and helping mentor and develop strong teams to ensure Dale Farm’s success.“We have spent a lot of money on additional people in the business. It’s not about numbers, it’s not about capacity, it’s about capability. We are really trying to find world-class people. gtHe said the firm will spend another £m on its people this year. Meanwhile, data and decision making is another area it’s expanding and developing. gt“We have a little bit of latency in the business, and I’m saying how do I get live information to those people ”That includes looking at new markets and products. Nick says the business had been focusing on the macro, and perhaps missed potential opportunities.“We have massive opportunities for growth,” he said. “The EBITA growth isn’t necessarily about growing your top-line, although it will grow a bit. We process  million litres of milk. Are you making sure you are making products which will give you the most profit from that – the answer to that is no.“We can switch categories and products, and we can make a whole lot more money with the  million litres. “It’s looking at consumer trends by getting out of commoditised type products and getting in to more value-added products. That’s about understanding your consumer.”He said the business has made “serious traction” in the last two years, as a company. As for growth in the future, with March  around the corner, Nick says it will continue “as long as there isn’t something mad and disruptive from Brexit”.“That could happen. A ‘no deal’ and no transition Brexit is mad and disruptive and changes everything. I don’t think people have really looked at it, and really understand what it means. We have looked at it, and it’s very challenging.”For Dale Farm, Nick’s Brexit concerns centre around staff and people – with around % of the workforce EU nationals.Nick says the company has struggled to get lorry drivers when milk supply is at its peak.But for Dale Farm, and other food processors, there is a concern over the certication process, following Brexit. “It’s basically an export certicate for dairy products. You are not allowed to export without this certicate,” Nick says.“For example, we have signed a quite public announcement with Lidl. We are supplying Lidl all over the world. If Lidl were to ask me in the morning, can you guarantee that you can supply my countries outside the UK on April   I actually can’t.“It’s nothing to do with tarfs or costs. If I don’t have animal health export certicates approved well-ahead of Brexit – these things take about six months to negotiate.“I’m screaming at DEFRAand DAERAhere to get this done now.”“Why don’t you agree the wording, and have the work done, so when the agreement is or isn’t made… now you can start. “It’s a huge risk for this industry here,we can’t get stuff off the island.”Around % of Northern Ireland’s dairy output goes to the EU and the rest of the world. “In milk, milk keeps flowing. We can’t say to farmers ‘we can’t sell the product, can’t get the certicates, tell the cows to take a break for a few weeks’. It doesn’t happen.“I’m going to have to reassess... ‘how long can I survive not selling my % of dairy off the island ’“If there is a no-transition no-deal Brexit it will be really bad for business. Supply chains will be severely disputed and you’ll have a shortage of products everywhere.” ■View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/sk_123.jpg","title":"more than  of business group members back brexit withdrawal deal","story":"Posted on Monday December  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland’s business community has overwhelming thrown its weight behind a withdrawal agreement on Brexit – with almost % of one major lobby group’s members in favour, it can be revealed.The CBI, Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce, Federation of Small Businesses and IoD are among the groups which have backed the deal on the table. Meanwhile, farming unions in Northern Ireland and throughout the UK have also issued their support for the deal.It would essentially provide a backstop, and create a deeper customs union between Northern Ireland the EU, along with a closer alignment in the single market.Stephen Kelly, chief executive of Manufacturing NI says that the agreement is “the only show in town.”He said a poll of its members showed .% of those who replied were in support.“This is the only show in town. The rules are clear – in order for the UK to move to the most productive discussion on what the future relationship will be, we need a withdrawal agreement. The options are the agreement, or no deal,” he told Ulster Business.“Business in Northern Ireland and agri-business have made it clear that no deal is not an option.”Other business groups backing the proposed agreement include the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, Retail NI, Hospitality Ulster and the Freight Transport Association.Writing in the Belfast , Prime Minister Theresa May said Northern Ireland will thrive under the proposed Brexit deal, and its position as part of the UK “is guaranteed”.She said her agreement with Brussels “puts Northern Ireland in a fantastic position for the future”, and moved to reassure unionists that “Northern Ireland’s constitutional status as part of the United Kingdom is guaranteed.“Under this deal the future is certainly bright for Northern Ireland.”On the backstop, Ms May said three things made it “an acceptable insurance policy”.She said the transition period could be extended instead of entering the backstop, regulations would be the same across all of the UK, and Northern Ireland would not be treated dferently.Meanwhile, in a joint statement, the Ulster Farmers’ Union, NFU Scotland, NFU England and NFU Cymru, said:“The draft Brexit withdrawal agreement, while not perfect, will ensure that there are no hard barriers on the day we leave the European Union, and will allow trade in agricultural goods and UK food and drink to continue throughout the transition period largely as before. This opportunity needs to be taken.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
