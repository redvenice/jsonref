Smith, pictured here in 2001, promoted Australian-produced food at his supermarket chainMore recently, he founded the media firm Smith \u0026amp Nasht in 2010.In addition, Smith has  authored several books detailing his aviation ventures, including ‘The Earth Beneath Me’ in 1983, ‘Dick Smith Solo Around the World’ in 1992 and ‘Above the World: A Pictorial Circumnavigation’ in 1997.Who is Dick Smith’s wife?Smith’s wife is Phillipa Aird McManarney. The couple has two children together, Jenny and Hayley.Food company closureOn July 26, Smith announced the closure of his food company Dick Smith Foods in the wake of increased competition.\u0027It is my melancholy duty to inform everyone that after 19 years, I\u0027ve had to make the decision to close Dick Smith Foods.\u0027In two years’ time we will go out of business, so I\u0027m closing it down now when times are good.\u0027It\u0027s a decision forced on me because most people just want the cheapest prices and the cheapest prices will always come from overseas,’ the longtime businessman announced.Smith specifically blamed German supermarket giant Aldi, saying its practice of ‘extreme capitalism’ had ultimately ‘forced’ him to close the company he founded in 1999 as the only means of avoiding bankruptcy.          Smith specifically cited the German supermarket Aldi as to why his food store will be closingHowever, IBISWorld Senior Industry Analyst Bao Vuong said that there were many factors at play in the demise of the Australian supermarket, not just Aldi’s rapid expansion in the country as of late.He states: \u0027There\u0027s a lot of factors behind the downfall, it\u0027s not solely placed on Aldi. Coles and Woolworths and Aldi - they all had an effect on the downfall of Dick Smith Foods because consumers are price conscious.\u0027Vuong also believes that limited brand awareness hurt Dick Smith’s food company in particular, saying: \u0027It\u0027s the company itself, it\u0027s not a prominent or well-known company with Australian consumers. The lack of brand awareness contributed to the downfall over the decade.\u0027In addition, Vuong also noted that Dick Smith Foods’ higher prices compared to its competitors was a ‘large contributor’ to its closure.Despite his successful career as an entrepreneur for decades, Smith’s announcement of the upcoming shuttering of his food company wasn’t the only blow his Australian business empire has suffered in recent years.His oldest brand, Dick Smith Electronics, went into receivership in 2016.Jabong sale 2018: All you need to know about the Big Brand SaleEuroMillions results: Lotto numbers for Friday, July 27MoviePass was down because it ran out of money and couldn\u0026#8217t afford to pay for ticketsOrange Is the New Black: The crimes that landed the inmates in jail revealedWill Taylor Swift be invited to Karlie Kloss and Joshua Kushner\u0027s wedding? Mercury Prize: Nominations, date and moreMeghan Markle has to follow the Queen\u0027s bedtime rule when staying with herI Am Paul Walker documentary: All you need to know after trailer releaseWill Priyanka Chopra continue acting after her marriage to Nick Jonas? UK heatwave: How you can help the homeless in the hot weatherWhy Meghan Markle can\u0027t eat carbs at Buckingham PalaceGuru Purnima 2018: Everything you need to know Dick Smith\u0027s net worth revealed as Australian businessman closes food storesWho is Rocio Oliva?

A teacher, or a guru, is someone who is thought to be able to remove all the darkness from our lives.Today, it is still believed in Hindu, Jain and Buddhist teachings that the mother is the first teacher of a child and the guru becomes the second mother. A person is first born as a result of the union between their mother and father and is then believed to be born again when they are accepted by a teacher, who will teach them how to become a human being.The Kathopanishad states: ‘In order to learn the transcendental science, one must approach the bona fide spiritual master in disciplined succession, who is fixed in the Absolute Truth. Thus, it has been enjoined herewith that in order to receive that transcendental knowledge, one must approach the guru.’          Today, it is still believed in  Buddhist teachings that the guru becomes the second motherGuru Purnima usually falls on the day of Ashada Shukla Purnima in the Indian calendar, when Srila Vyasadeva, the son of Parashar Muni and Devi Satyavati appeared. The story associated with this celebration sees Parashar stopping by the banks of the river Yamuna while travelling one night.He stayed at the house of the fisherman chief Dusharaj and asked his daughter to ferry him to his next destination. Entranced by Matsyagandha’s beauty, which means one who smells like fish, he used his powers to give her a son.A boy with a dark complexion was born on an island and according to scripture, would then ide Vedic literature into four parts, Vyasa, which is why he was later named Krishna Dwaipayana Vyasa.After this, as the Srimad Bhagavatam states: ‘Thereafter, in the seventeenth incarnation of Godhead, Sri Vyasadeva appeared in the womb of Satyavati through Parashara Muni, and he ided the one Veda into several branches and sub-branches, seeing that the people in general were less intelligent.’Srila Vyasadeva is considered the spiritual master of all teachers of Vedic wisdom because he made all knowledge of the acharyas to the entire world. He went on to ide the original Veda into four: the Sama, Yajur, Rig, Atharva, which were there explained in different texts, such as the Mahabharata.          Guru Purnima usually falls on the day of Ashada Shukla Purnima in the Indian calendarAs Vedic language is difficult to understand, he then wrote appendices, now referred to as the Puranas and Upanishads, so that the everyday man could follow the teachings practically.Guru Purnima 2018Guru Purnima falls on Friday, July 27 this year on the day of Ashadha Shukla Purnima, which is also considered to be the day Lord Buddha gave his first sermon on the full moon day after five weeks of enlightenment sitting under the Bodhi tree in Sarnath, Uttar Pradesh and to this day, Buddhists worship him and his teachings on this day.In addition to this, the Hindu god Shiva is thought to have offered his knowledge of yoga to his disciples, of the ‘Saptarishis’, seven sages, on this day. The festival is celebrated in India, Nepal and other countries of Buddhist, Jain and Hindu influence.Teachers would be given gifts on this special day after visiting temples to offer their gurus respect and seeking their blessings. Jabong sale 2018: All you need to know about the Big Brand SaleEuroMillions results: Lotto numbers for Friday, July 27MoviePass was down because it ran out of money and couldn\u0026#8217t afford to pay for ticketsOrange Is the New Black: The crimes that landed the inmates in jail revealedWill Taylor Swift be invited to Karlie Kloss and Joshua Kushner\u0027s wedding? Mercury Prize: Nominations, date and moreMeghan Markle has to follow the Queen\u0027s bedtime rule when staying with herI Am Paul Walker documentary: All you need to know after trailer releaseWill Priyanka Chopra continue acting after her marriage to Nick Jonas? UK heatwave: How you can help the homeless in the hot weatherWhy Meghan Markle can\u0027t eat carbs at Buckingham PalaceGuru Purnima 2018: Everything you need to know Dick Smith\u0027s net worth revealed as Australian businessman closes food storesWho is Rocio Oliva?

Meghan and her husband Prince Harry already have their own apartment, Nottingham Cottage, in Kensington Palace and York Cottage on the Sandringham Estate.And the Queen has also given the newly-married couple Adelaide Cottage in Windsor Castle as a wedding gift.The cottage was built in 1831, but its most famous resident was Group Captain Peter Townsend, who famously had an affair with Princess Margaret.The bedtime protocol is not the only thing the new Duchess of Sussex will have to adjust to.Along with not being able to eat certain foods in certain places, including her favourites at Buckingham Palace, it is unlikely that Royal fans will see Meghan with dark nail polish or a dress that exposes her knees, both things reportedly disliked by the Queen.It is also highly unlikely that one will see Meghan in wedges anytime she is near Her Majesty, given the monarch is famously not a fan of them. Jabong sale 2018: All you need to know about the Big Brand SaleEuroMillions results: Lotto numbers for Friday, July 27MoviePass was down because it ran out of money and couldn\u0026#8217t afford to pay for ticketsOrange Is the New Black: The crimes that landed the inmates in jail revealedWill Taylor Swift be invited to Karlie Kloss and Joshua Kushner\u0027s wedding? Mercury Prize: Nominations, date and moreMeghan Markle has to follow the Queen\u0027s bedtime rule when staying with herI Am Paul Walker documentary: All you need to know after trailer releaseWill Priyanka Chopra continue acting after her marriage to Nick Jonas? UK heatwave: How you can help the homeless in the hot weatherWhy Meghan Markle can\u0027t eat carbs at Buckingham PalaceGuru Purnima 2018: Everything you need to know Dick Smith\u0027s net worth revealed as Australian businessman closes food storesWho is Rocio Oliva?

So why is such a glamorous property at the centre of a controversy?One reason has to do with the owner himself, the notoriously combustible Gordon Ramsay (hence the culinary joke in the blurb) who has not always endeared himself to locals.Ramsay, it would be fair to say — a man who could start an argument in an empty room — is about as popular among some Cornwellians as the food served up at one of the sub- standard establishments featured in his Kitchen Nightmares TV show.Incidents such as the following encounter have not helped. When a resident spotted Ramsay in town and excitedly asked to have a ‘selfie’ taken with him, the irascible restaurateur is said to have pulled his cap down over his face and turned away in a hurry.‘He said he was on holiday and didn’t want to be disturbed,’ reveals a friend of the person who was left disappointed by his fleeting meeting with the celebrity chef.‘Fair enough, I suppose, but it wouldn’t have taken long to do a quick picture.’EXCLUSIVE: Hotshot Sydney recruiter is revealed as the man...Tana Ramsay reveals she has forgiven her father for hacking...Share this articleThere is a more fundamental reason, though, why, aside from his forthright manner, Ramsay is not flavour of the month with everyone in Cornwall. For a start, his luxury holiday home in the picturesque harbour town of Fowey, which is being rented out, is his third property in the county.Second homes provoke strong feelings in places like Cornwall. The invasion of wealthy middle-class second home owners from outside has been blamed for pushing up property prices, forcing locals out of the housing market in the process, and turning parts of Cornwall into Chelsea-on-Sea in summer and ghost towns in winter.So being a second home owner three times over is unlikely to win you many friends in this part of the world.One woman summed up the opinions of many in the local community when she said that Ferrari-driving Ramsay, fined £500 not so long ago for speeding on Bodmin Moor in his Range Rover, was just ‘showing off with his money’, adding: ‘Why do you need three places in Cornwall?’          Ramsay\u0027s first property, purchased for £4,400,000 in 2015, in the village of Rock          Ramsay bought this £4million beach house in Trebetherick in 2016 to stay in while work is carried out on his residence in Rock          The latest addition to his Ramsay\u0027s Cornish portfolio: Formerly Fowey’s last bank, Ramsay acquired the building for £1.9million last year and converted it into a stunning seaside retreatFather-of-four Ramsay, 51, has certainly splashed the cash around. His first property, purchased for £4,400,000 in 2015, was in the village of Rock, a favourite haunt of the young Princes William and Harry.He had this demolished, despite objections from neighbours — who are still furious with him — and got planning permission to replace the traditional beachfront home with a bigger ‘Grand Designs’ mansion currently under construction.The following year, Ramsay bought a beach house (also £4million) a few miles away in Trebetherick, simply to stay in while work is carried out on the Rock residence.The latest addition to his Cornish portfolio was formerly Fowey’s last bank but had closed before Ramsay acquired the building (for £1.9million) last year and converted it into a stunning seaside retreat.Potential customers are cordially invited to ‘breathe in the beautifully-scented sea air and soak in the calm’ by the agency marketing the rental property.Of course, this ozone comes at a price: £7,000 a week, to be precise, or £3,525 for a long weekend. There’s an extra £30 charge if you have a dog. This is a standard fee, apparently, in holiday rentals, charged by the cleaners for wiping up mucky paw prints (or worse).‘It’s mad money, but people seem daft enough to pay it,’ said Paula Trewick, steward of the Fowey Gallant Sailing Club, this week.  Jetsetters: Ramsay steps out with his wife Tana in sunny Los Angeles on WednesdayHad the old Lloyds bank been so profitable, it would probably still be open today. Instead, the income from the Fowey townhouse — which has received ‘lots of inquiries’ since recently coming onto the market — will boost Ramsay’s already fabulous wealth.His restaurant empire alone is worth in excess of £46 million. He also has homes in London and Los Angeles and owns no fewer than eight Ferraris.He rakes in a fortune from his many TV commitments — including a new deal with Fox and the Discovery Channel to make a ‘Bear Grylls meets Kitchen Nightmares’ type series, which will see Ramsay travelling to the ends of the earth on culinary adventures.‘Cornwall is the place where I see Gordon really relax,’ his wife Tana said in an interview with the Sunday Times last week. But how much time does he actually spend in Rock, Trebetherick or Fowey?‘The reality is that he spends most of his time in LA,’ a source close to Ramsay told us this week.‘When he’s not there, he’s either on the road filming or working and socialising in London. Cornwall comes a very distant fourth.’          TV chef Ramsay is not flavour of the month with everyone in CornwallIt’s a familiar story. More than a third of properties in Fowey (population around 3,000) are now second or rental homes. This has helped push the average price of a flat to over £300,000 and a detached house to more than £400,000.Yet, the typical wage across the county is less than £19,000 and household incomes are below 75 per cent of the EU average. Cornwall is among the poorest regions in Northern Europe — despite its image as a playground for the rich and famous.Only last month, residents in the fishing village of Mevagissey voted overwhelmingly to ban the purchase of second homes. The result, said councillors, proved people ‘want strong and positive local planning legislation to protect’ the area.The precedent for such a policy was set in St Ives. In 2016, the High Court ruled that St Ives could keep its ban on new-build second homes after the town voted to reserve new homes for full-time residents.The fact that Ramsay is also making a handsome profit out of the Fowey property, which shut as a Lloyds branch three years ago, has served only to inflame the debate.‘This is the sort of c*** which prices locals out of their own town,’ said Fowey resident Kerri Lee, in language Ramsay would probably recognise, on the Cornwall Facebook page. While Sarah Carter said: ‘He’s giving the impression only Hooray Henrys visit Cornwall and that simply isn’t the case.’Joseph Ryan, 18, who works in a chip shop in Fowey, believes the town is going the same way as neighbouring Polperro where ‘you can only see ten lights on in winter because all the other houses are second homes’.Second home owners are encouraged to make a donation to the Cornwall Community Foundation to help pay for affordable housing for locals.Among those to have contributed to the charitable scheme is Alex Polizzi, presenter of TV’s The Hotel Inspector, who owns a cottage in St Mawes. Gordon Ramsay indicated he would consider contributing after the scheme was launched two years ago. So did he? The Foundation declined to say when contacted this week.Second homes are also an issue in Rock but, over here on the north coast, Ramsay is embroiled in a more old-fashioned dispute.Neighbours were up in arms when they found out he was going to demolish the ‘historically impressive’ 1920s Arts and Crafts-style home he bought three years ago and build a modernist villa with white walls and a zinc façade, comprising a gym, pool, cellar and a guest annexe.In all, there were 17 separate objections. Among the fiercest critics was the tycoon who lives next door. Ironically, Andrew Nisbet, head of kitchen equipment firm Nisbets, is one of Ramsay’s biggest suppliers.Mr Nisbet’s views are spelled out in a legal letter filed at Cornwall County Council. In blunt Ramsayesque language (minus the use of the F-word), it describes the project as ‘inappropriate, unsympathetic and unneighbourly’.Mr Nisbet and his wife Anne took particular exception to the planned annexe, claiming it will compromise their privacy because the ‘window to window distance between the annexe and their residence is just 25 yards’.          Father-of-four Ramsay, 51, has acquired an impressive Cornish property portfolioThey also said that Ramsay’s plans to increase the height of the chimney will lead to smoke being blown towards their windows.Nevertheless, the original house has now been bulldozed and work has begun on a new main house and annexe.Until recently, at least, a sign on the site read: ‘Gordon Ramsay Construction.’ We were unable to establish if this was a genuine firm or whether Ramsay was just having the last laugh at his neighbours’ expense. Not surprisingly, you can cut the atmosphere with a (chef’s) knife in this corner of Rock.Annie Haynes, whose home overlooks Ramsay’s, said: ‘The house he bought was a wonderful place, but he has just stuck two fingers up to the concerns of those of us who have to live here all year round.‘The whole of Rock has changed in recent years. A lot of properties overlooking the estuary have been sold and more of them are being knocked down and new houses put up. Many are monstrous — all metal and windows.‘The old traditional homes no longer seem good enough for the people who come down here a couple of times a year. In winter, the place is deserted.’When the dispute first erupted, a spokesman for Ramsay said that ‘Gordon, Tana and the family are very much looking forward to spending time in their new home in Cornwall. They are committed to, and delighted to be investing in, the future of the Cornish community they will hopefully be part of for many years to come.’Ramsay, dressed in shorts and a T-shirt, is a regular customer at cafes and pubs in Rock.‘He has been very polite so far,’ said one local. ‘We get the feeling he is on his best behaviour because there has been a lot of anger about him knocking down the house. But that’s what the rich do around here. They buy somewhere for the view and tear it down so they can put something trendy up.’Ramsay thrives on controversy, though. Indeed, he has made a career out of it — both on and off camera.He was once inseparable from his father-in-law, Chris Hutcheson, who managed Gordon Ramsay Holdings, until they fell out when Ramsay accused Hutcheson of plundering £1.4 million from his business and sacked him.Hutcheson was jailed for six months last year after an expert hired by Ramsay discovered he had hacked into the company’s computer system following his dismissal.As someone who worked closely with Ramsay for many years says: ‘Gordon will go to great lengths to get what he wants and feel that he’s winning.’A fact which will undoubtedly fill his Cornish neighbours’ hearts with sorrow. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/02/22/17/497CBE1E00000578-5422621-image-a-39_1519320046999.jpg","title":"Builder leaves time buyer couples home looking like bomb site demands paid","story":"    The couple entrusted a builder to tile their new bathroom at their property in Longhill, after advertising his skills on a workman website          To the couple\u0027s disgust, he left the property in a complete mess, with rubbish piled in every room of the house          To their amazement, though, the couple say the man still wants to be paid in full for the workThe couple say the man still wants to be paid in full - and has refused to give them their house keys back until they hand over the cash.The houseowner and mum-of-one, aged 24, said another tiler had initially started work on their property but had to leave as he was overbooked, leaving the couple looking elsewhere for another tradesman to finish the job.\u0027We asked around for recommendations but nobody knew of anyone who could do the work,\u0027 she said.\u0027We found a guy on mybuilder.com that said he could do the work at a decent price, so we agreed to take him on.\u0027The first night on the Monday we checked into the house to see how he was getting on, as we aren\u0027t living in it at the moment until it is all done up, and it all looked fine.\u0027We didn\u0027t have time to call in on Tuesday, but on the Wednesday when the work was meant to be finished, we walked in to an absolute bomb site.\u0027\u0027He trashed it.\u0027\u0027She wanted to be good at everything\u0027: Heartbroken uncle of...Mother-of-two rescued by US Coast Guard from Oregon cliff...Share this articleShe says the tiler left a mess in nearly every room of the house, and thinks what he has done in the home is \u0027completely disrespectful\u0027.\u0027Grout was all up the walls, the tiles were wonky, the mosaic doesn\u0027t go all the way up the ceiling and the floor tiles are ruined,\u0027 she said.\u0027We\u0027re also going to need a new bath as he let grout fall in there and took the protective peel off it, and now all the grout has hardened and scratched it.\u0027He trashed the bedroom that will be my son\u0027s by leaving all the rubbish in there and he left the kitchen in a state with grout splattered all up the walls where he mixed it for the tiles -I just can\u0027t understand why he didn\u0027t go outside to mix it. \u0027He also left mucky hand prints on the fridge and had unplugged it after helping himself to all our drinks.\u0027The carpets in the rooms were also left a mess where he had walked about and left tile cuttings.\u0027The tiler who left the mess behind still quoted £360 for the work, but the homeowners say they are not paying it and estimate it may now cost another £500 to put right his work and replace items he ruined.

A massive sell-off would be expected to create a spike in yields, raising the cost of borrowing for the US government. The spike above in mid-May represents a seven-year high, but soon stabilizedThe third possibility is that Russia predicted a move in the market, and hoped to take advantage. If so, such a market move has yet to materialize.If the Treasuries dump was an attempt to drive up the cost of US borrowing, it failed. The 10-year yield rose only 11 basis points from the end of March to the end of May.\u0027The market now has the answer to what would happen to Treasuries if a major holder decided to sell everything,\u0027 Ian Lyngen at BMO Capital Markets jokingly told Chappatta.

Richard Kellawaythe chairman of Mrs May\u0027s Maidenhead Conservative association Richard Kellaway said if Brexit plans were diluted further they would not be acceptableSome of the key features of the plan being pushed by the government are a new free trade area based on a \u0027common rulebook\u0027- requiring the UK to commit to a treaty to match EU rules.But this would not include banking or legal services, meaning the UK could set our own regulations.Also a new \u0027facilitated customs arrangement\u0027 removing the need for customs checks at EU-UK ports.It would allow differing UK and EU tariffs on goods from elsewhere in the world to be paid at the border. And continued use of the EHIC health insurance card.The details hammered out at Chequers became part of the government\u0027s Brexit White Paper which was released to much criticism. The plan upset senior Conservatives who favour a harder Brexit, leading to the resignation of Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and Brexit Secretary David Davis.New rules ending freedom of movement but allowing UK and EU citizens to travel freely without visas for tourism and temporary work. David Davis,supposedly warned the Prime Minister about the position she was taking.He said: : \u0027On customs and on goods the paper is not in line with the Government\u0027s core promises to take back control of its laws and to have an independent trade policy.\u0027He added: \u0027The Government should be up front that this meant the harmonisation of legislation with the EU and being a rule taker for swathes of the economy.\u0027The levels of discomfort among grassroots members of the party is sure to alarm the Prime Minister and her team during the summer break.Despite the concerns the Prime Minister seemed to be in good spirits on her week long walking holiday. The Mays were spotted arriving at a luxury hotel on Lake Garda, the shores of which are home to a host of exclusive hotels.The PM is well known for her love of walking holidays and last summer went to the Swiss alps. Theresa May, who is well known for her stylish footwear, stepped out in £50 white canvas flats for the walk on the shore of the fashionable Lake Garda.The photograph taken in Desenzano del Garda continued the less posed style she has adopted since being in Number 10, in contrast to images released by her predecessor David Cameron when he went away.She paired her trainers with beige three-quarter length trousers, a white short-sleeved shirt and large square sunglasses for a low-key look as they took in the small resort town that the couple visited last year.Philip walked beside her wearing dark blue trousers and loafers, with a short-sleeved blue checked shirt and smaller sunglasses.The couple will spend around a week in Italy before she returns to work in her constituency and Downing Street. Mrs May is also due to attend a First World War memorial event to mark the battle of Amiens, which began on August 8 1918 and helped to secure victory.They will then jet off for two weeks in Switzerland. The holiday plans are a repeat of last year\u0027s getaway for the couple.But in slightly more positive news for Mrs May and just prior to her holiday, she managed to secure the agreement of Austrian chancellor Sebastian Kurz who said that Brexit should be discussed by EU leaders at an informal meeting in Salzburg on September 20.It means that the Prime Minister has an extra gathering of leaders of the EU 27 in which to convince them to support her Brexit plan.

She was a cheeky, happy and smiley child with a lot of heart.\u0027She achieved a lot in her short life and her father is very proud of her.

A massive sell-off would be expected to create a spike in yields, raising the cost of borrowing for the US government. The spike above in mid-May represents a seven-year high, but soon stabilizedThe third possibility is that Russia predicted a move in the market, and hoped to take advantage.

The struggle over the past is really the struggle to define the present and future. As the country prepares for a general election, the shadows of Big Men from Cecil John Rhodes to Emmerson Mnangagwa obscure the histories of ordinary people.No novelist has dealt more extensively with Zimbabwe’s history than Yvonne Vera, who died aged 40 in 2005. In her fifth and final novel, The Stone Virgins (2002), Vera writes of two sisters who suffer and survive the violences of Gukurahundi, the 1980s massacres of more than 20,000 Ndebele “dissidents” by the Korean-trained Fifth Brigade of the Zimbabwean armed forces. Dense and opaque at times, Vera’s interrogation of the suppression of memory and language in “the years of deafness and struggle” invites us to explore how we listen to the silences that continue to echo in the aftermath of Zimbabwe’s violent past and present.Novuyo Rosa Tshuma’s epic satire House of Stone (2018) is driven by one Zamani’s almost pathological desire to replace the missing son of the Mlambo family. In Tshuma’s beautiful interweaving of personal and national history, we learn of successive generations burdened by sins of their fathers. In Zamani’s desperation for family, rooting and history, it is not hard to miss Zimbabwe’s own constant search for “Fathers of the Nation”.Tsitsi Dangarembga stepped into this national arena with his 1988 novel Nervous Conditions, which opens with the memorable line: “I was not sorry when my brother died.” For 13-year-old Tambudzai, her brother’s death offers the promise of education – an escape from her family’s poverty in a 1960s Rhodesia where an all-out liberation war is about to take place. The book, whose title is taken from Jean‑Paul Sartre’s introduction to Frantz Fanon’s The Wretched of the Earth, highlights the ways in which fiction transformed our view of the colonial subject as necessarily male. It forced us to expand our vision of liberation beyond the masculinist tradition.The music historian Mhoze Chikowero’s African Music, Power, and Being in Colonial Zimbabwe (2015) provides a fascinating new way to think about liberation. Chikowero helps us understand revolution beyond the gun as he moves from the conquest in the 1890s through music of the missions, mining company dancehalls, townships, the armed struggle campsites and more to chart a social history of how black people continually made and remade themselves through music, dress, drink, spirituality and politics.Another interrogation of Zimbabwe’s national self-making is Brian Raftopoulos and Alois Mlambo’s Becoming Zimbabwe: A History from the Pre-colonial Period to 2008. The editors aim to upend the notion of an “unquestioned national identity” through the first comprehensive history of Zimbabwe, ning the years from 850 to 2008, in order to track who and what “Zimbabwean-ness” has and hasn’t meant over this broad historical period.• Panashe Chigumadzi’s These Bones Will Rise Again is published by Indigo."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f9285404518bfcb2aace396ffa91807f518ebe49/3348_2506_4270_2562/master/4270.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4db81bbee9fabeff0c462fe4f78d81d9","title":"discount grocer lidl plans build 3000 homes school planning permission new stores","story":"Property development is latest tactic in bid to gain planning permission for new storesLidl is planning to lead the development of more than 3,000 homes and a primary school in the discount supermarket’s latest tactic to secure planning permission for a flurry of new stores around London.The German retailer has toyed with developments involving housing since 2008, but has so far built just 335 homes. It now wants to increase its involvement in mixed-use schemes to include offices, hotels, student accommodation and flats. Deer Park primary school in Richmond will have a new home over two floors above a Lidl store, including an outdoor playground with space for games such as football and hockey. The project is expected to completed next year.Property experts said Lidl’s plans were likely to be fuelled by the difficulties in gaining planning permission for new stores in London at a time when existing retailers are struggling to make ends meet.The discounter wants to open at least 50 stores a year around the country and also aims to relocate to larger stores in some city locations as it rides a consumer switch towards cut-price chains.Promising to build flats and facilities such as schools can help to persuade councils that a new development could be beneficial to their community.Lidl’s home-building spree echoes a technique already widely adopted by the mainstream supermarkets, particularly Tesco and Sainsbury’s. Tesco built hundreds of homes above its stores in Woolwich, south-east London, and Streatham, south-west London, while Sainsbury’s was part of a joint scheme with Barratt Homes involving 700 homes in Nine Elms, near Vauxhall, south-west London, and recently won permission for a £200m project in Redbridge, east London, involving 683 homes. Morrisons has also entered the game, winning permission late last year for a plan to build nearly 600 homes as part of the redevelopment of its Camden store in north London. Supermarkets have also been involved in hundreds of small-scale urban developments, such as transforming moribund pubs into local convenience stores with a few flats above.With profits under pressure as a result of rising costs and sluggish sales, retailers are keen to maximise the income they can make from the sites they own. Selling or renting out homes or other developments above the shop can help to ensure a site is profitable.“Lidl and Aldi both need to aggressively push into the south-east, especially London, and the only way they can afford to pay a premium for development sites is to also do residential,” said Tom Edson, a supermarket expert at the property consultancy Colliers. “Having people above the shop is not a bad thing. It means you have got a ready customer base,”Under its UK managing director, Christian Härtnagel, who took the helm in 2016, Lidl has developments linked to 476 homes in the pipeline, about half of which will be linked to a store in Alperton, north-west London. A store with six flats above it is also due to open in Dartford, Kent, next week and more will go up in Epsom, Surrey, by 2020.Lidl is planning to build some of the homes itself while others are part of wider schemes led by developers. It is understood that the firm wants to focus on affordable homes rather than luxury developments, in line with its money-saving image.Härtnagel said: “We’re proud that our stores are increasingly helping to pave the way for mixed-use developments, which in turn are supporting important initiatives. It continues to mean a great deal to us that we are able to support many of the communities that we’re a part of by providing added value above and beyond affordable food.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dc5a89db5b024ee4bf29bb4a854424214d2489cd/167_0_2807_1685/master/2807.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d4de5d9db456e0904d82e3157a3b810d","title":"fate of new moorside nuclear power station in cumbria in doubt","story":"Delay in sale of consortium behind plant leads Toshiba to lay off 100 UK project staffDoubts have been raised over the fate of a new nuclear power station planned for Cumbria after it emerged that most of the project’s 100 UK staff had been laid off.Toshiba has been trying to sell the NuGeneration consortium behind the Moorside plant since it had to write off billions of dollars because of problems with its US nuclear business last year.The Korean state-owned firm Kepco appeared to swoop to the rescue last December by agreeing to buy NuGen but the sale, which was meant to complete this January, was then delayed until the spring. The transaction has still not closed, and uncertainty has been created by a change of government in Seoul and the appointment of a new Kepco chief executive.The delay has forced Toshiba, a Japanese corporation, to look again at the consortium’s running costs, leading to a decision on 27 July to cut many of the venture’s 100 jobs across Manchester and Cumbria. The job losses will be subject to consultations.Toshiba is believed to have spent hundreds of millions of pounds developing the project so far. In a statement NuGen said: “It has been decided by the NuGen board to re-profile the organisation at this point in order to pursue alternatives.”It remains unclear whether the South Koreans will go ahead with a deal that looked a certainty last year. Kepco officials are due to arrive in the UK on Monday, and the UK government has been in talks to save the deal. A source close to the process said: “The Kepco deal is not dead yet.”If the acquisition were to collapse the failure of the Moorside project would leave a large hole in ministers’ wishes to encourage the construction of as many as six new nuclear power plants to meet climate goals. Unions said the problems showed that a recent sector deal between government and industry did not got far enough to ensure nuclear installations were built.Sue Ferns, senior deputy general secretary of the union Prospect, said: “Despite the welcome nuclear sector deal it is increasingly clear that the government needs to do far more to reassure the nuclear industry and support them in developing the next generation of low-carbon energy sources in the UK.”A spokesperson for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: “We continue to engage with new-build developers, though the detail of these discussions is commercially confidential.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/35224d0fe9832329942f547a66fe1d4882efd546/0_285_5600_3361/master/5600.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=af474be6e61c46bf7127a46bf8222a3c","title":"most capital cities are well off but london is like another country","story":"Incomes in inner London are five times as high as in the Welsh valleys or CornwallAll countries have their regional differences. States in the American Deep South are poorer than those in New England. In Germany, Bavaria is richer than Brandenburg. The struggling parts of Italy are south of Rome.But Britain is in a class of its own. The gap between the richest and poorest parts is wider than in any EU country. Incomes per head in inner London are five times as high as in the Welsh valleys or Cornwall.There are two sides to this story. One is the stupendous growth of London – a city that is now fit to bursting. The other is the sluggish performance of Britain’s older industrial towns – the bits of the country that were worst hit by de-industrialisation and have been slowest to recover from the recession of 2008-09.As Fothergill notes, it would be surprising had there been no employment growth at all during a period when the economy was expanding. “But with job growth so much slower than in the cities, and far slower than in London, the evidence is that the economy of Britain’s older industrial towns is essentially stagnant.”Pay and conditions in older industrial towns are often poor: a direct consequence of the slack in the labour market since it allows employers to dominate when it comes to setting pay and conditions. Low pay means the Treasury has to foot a hefty bill for tax credits, which are running at £6bn a year in the older industrial towns. Increasingly, they are becoming dormitory towns for people who work elsewhere.What the report clearly shows is that London has effectively become a separate country, with stronger job links to the international labour market than it has to the rest of the UK. There was an 800,000 increase in the number of London jobs between 2010 and 2016, accompanied by a 530,000 increase in economically active people from overseas of working age.In the past, the sort of employment growth seen in the capital between 2010 and 2016 would have sucked in workers from the regions but during the post-recession period the number of UK-born workers living in London dropped by 320,000. These people – driven out of the capital by over-crowding and rocketing property prices – moved to the home counties and commuted into London.International migration is a prominent feature of recent trends in the towns, although not nearly to the same extent has been seen in London. At an estimated 160,000, net international migration of economically active working age adults was roughly three-quarters of the 220,000 job growth in older industrial towns between 2010 and 2016.As the report notes, without the net inflow of migrants from abroad the size of the workforce in the older industrial towns would have declined. The increase in the number of workers from overseas filled skills gaps and also probably allowed some firms to expand faster than otherwise would have been the case. “But in adding to labour supply, migrant workers may also have eased the pressure on employers to offer better pay and conditions,” it adds.A number of conclusions can be drawn from this report. The first is that urgent action needs to be taken to tackle London’s over-heating. Primarily, that involves building more homes, either in London itself or within easy commuting distance.The second is that there is a need to bring more well-paid jobs back to the towns that make up a quarter of the country’s population. That means the right mix of macroeconomic (competitive exchange rate), regional (active industrial strategy) and educational (focus on training and skills) policies.The third is that in the absence of serious action to tackle London’s capacity constraints and to revive the old industrial towns, there will be political pressure to curb immigration. As Beatty and Fothergill note, there is scant evidence, other than through the tax revenues generated by London that are recycled in public spending, that London’s spectacular employment growth since 2010 has had any positive benefit for Wales, Scotland and the north.The north-south ide is becoming more pronounced, with the old industrial towns feeling ignored, separate and un-listened to. Given the history of the past four decades, that’s not surprising."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ba91982e27c0cc2d2f289b7526d09d8a1cc8250/124_162_2867_1721/master/2867.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3dbe995342428a6c83b4df61e59afeaf","title":"oh for the days when it was always brussels fault brexit jeremy hunt","story":"Jeremy Hunt blamed our Brexit shambles on the EU – the favoured whipping boy that has served British politicians for decades. That won’t wash any more…Who would have thought Jeremy Hunt was such a massive nostalgic? I mean, he’s not called Jeremy Hostalgic! Seriously though, it turns out he’s a real old softie and I fancy there must have been a tear in his eye on his visit to Berlin last week.I’m not saying he misses the Nazis! Honestly! I know hyperbole is fashionable at the moment, so it’s probably worth making clear that I don’t think Jeremy Hunt is a Nazi. I mean, he’s not called Jeremy Hazi! Seriously though, the man’s not a fascist, even if I don’t much like his politics. Having said that, English is all about usage and I reckon the word fascist is regularly used online to mean “someone whose politics you don’t much like”. Which, oddly, makes it a synonym for communist.Bless you, but you can’t do that any more, Jeremy. Those days are gone. When we chose to leave, the EU’s duty of care over our country came to an end. It isn’t supposed to look out for our interests any more – it’s not accountable to the people you say will blame it. You might as well say that Sainsbury’s shareholders will blame the CEO of Tesco if their investment loses value. So what.I understand how he must feel. For his whole political career, the EU has been there for him. Despite favouring Remain in the referendum, Hunt subsequently told LBC that he’d changed his mind due to the “arrogance of the EU”. But in Berlin the other day, he said that, if Brussels allowed a no-deal Brexit, “it would lead to a fissure in relations which would be highly damaging for that great partnership we have had for so many years, which has been so important in sustaining the international order”.He doesn’t seem to realise that that’s all happening anyway. The “fissure in relations”, the complete ending, not just damaging, of the “great partnership” is what we have nationally decided to do. Which means that’s all good, isn’t it? It’s the will of the people, Jeremy, it’s lovely! The poor man is so confused and emotional, he’s started talking Britain down.We’re witnessing the end of a way of life. For decades, our political leaders, both Tories and Labour, have been able to blame things that went wrong, things they failed to do, anything that seemed unfairly constraining, or frighteningly liberating, on the Brussels bureaucrats. Anything that smacked of globalisation and corporate power, but also anything that seemed overly statist and controlling, anything that was bad for business and anything that left the inidual citizen too exposed. Put simply: anything.It was a sweet little scam: the people in charge only admitted to being in charge when it suited them. They were good cop. Bad cop was some Belgians you never met. And Brussels is an excellent receptacle for blame. It has an aura of irritating blandness and pedantry, but not of frightening or acquisitive aggression. We could project enmity on to it without getting too scared and, for several decades, without creating the political momentum for anything to be done.This is why, despite the stratospheric importance of the question of whether or not Britain is in the EU – not just in terms of economics and geopolitics but of the hearts, minds and self-image of millions of Britons – the two main parties haven’t fought a general election on the issue for over 30 years. They’ve argued endlessly about privatisation and NHS funding and tuition fees and foxhunting and MPs’ expenses, but they’ve both avoided the main problem, this colossal, festering unresolved question and left it as a personal matter for inidual members. That’s like having decades of religious debate in the 16th century between two groups both of which refuse to say whether they’re Catholic or Protestant.But it worked well for the politicians – Brussels was there to be slagged off and there was no threat to party unity. The British people have paid a lot for the unity of their politicians’ groupings and, more than anything else, that of the Conservative party, which should perhaps be renamed the “Self-Conservative party” as that appears to be the only political aim on which its MPs are agreed.The Labour leadership could probably have told its membership “Look, if you don’t like the EU, join another party” years ago and stayed pretty much intact. But the Tories would have fallen in half and turned from the electoral juggernaut of the first-past-the-post system to two Lib Dem-sized groups with little hope of office without major electoral reform of the sort Tories have been resolutely helping to block ever since the Earth’s crust hardened.So, with the rise of Ukip, and the pre-eminent importance of Conservative party unity in mind, David Cameron rolled the referendum dice. It is the most egregious example of putting party before country in British history and he also screwed it up. It was cynical and it was stupid, the work of a second-rate chancer.And the long political tradition of Brussels-bashing left him in an awkward position for the campaign. He could hardly say: “You know all that stuff that we’ve been saying is Brussels’ fault for as long as you can remember? Well, it’s Westminster’s fault, it’s my fault.”“Your problems are my fault! So do what I suggest!” is a flawed slogan. He’d probably banked on Labour being a bit more effusively pro-EU. Yet another thing that poisonous little prick got wrong.But when I look at Jeremy Hunt, still trying to blame the EU for everything even now – like an orphaned calf nuzzling the festering corpse of its mother, because it’s his instinct and that’s all he’s got – I take some comfort. At least the politicians are losing something too."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0c2badb05d9f8269d4d735eb298064e7b6e043d1/0_92_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6b5b5acf2be8053d9e9c0f1fdf29524c","title":"zimbabwe rival parties results election","story":"“Mugabe has gone. Things will never be the same again.” For pretty much the average life expectancy of many Zimbabweans, one man has ruled the country with an iron fist. Eight elections were held during his rule – and every time, that fist ensured victory for Robert Mugabe.On Monday Zimbabweans go to the polls to elect his successor. The current president, Emmerson Mnangagwa, 75, the man who finally ousted Mugabe in a bloodless coup last November, has also crushed his enemies ruthlessly in the past – but his iron fist lies within a well-padded velvet glove.Mnangagwa goes head to head at the polls with Nelson Chamisa, 40, who took over as leader of the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) after Morgan Tsvangirai died earlier this year.Whoever wins, this election heralds a new dawn for Zimbabwe. Mugabe has gone. Things will never be the same again. Certainly Mnangagwa brings a lot of baggage from the Mugabe era – having been the former president’s righthand man. But he is different in many significant ways – today, Mugabe even urged voters to turn their backs on his leadership, and went so far as to wish Chamisa well. Most importantly, Mnangagwa understands business and is determined to resuscitate Zimbabwe’s moribund economy and give the people what they so desperately want and need – jobs.He is primarily a soldier, having left Zimbabwe as a teenager in the early 1960s for military training in China. He has fashioned himself after the former communist leader Deng Xiaoping, who modernised China and laid the foundations for the economic powerhouse it has become, while maintaining a strictly authoritarian regime.Deng abandoned many orthodox communist doctrines to incorporate elements of the free-enterprise system. Mnangagwa seems determined to do the same for Zimbabwe. He is a wealthy man in his own right, having run Zanu-PF’s and his own businesses since the early 1980s. He has been mentioned in a UN report on the plundering of mining and logging resources in the Democratic Republic of the Congo together with General Sibusiso Moyo, who is now the foreign affairs minister.While Mugabe was a consummate manipulator, skilfully playing people off against each other and weaving a complex web of patronage, Mnangagwa is a much more of a strategist. He will be prepared to make tough decisions that could ultimately benefit the economy. He has certainly been more successful in attracting foreign investment in the short time he has been in power than Mugabe was in decades of berating the west.The MDC’s Chamisa is just as pro-business as Mnangagwa, and to his credit has surrounded himself with several capable technocrats. There is no whiff of corruption about him and he has been drawing massive crowds in many rural areas which, under Mugabe, were no-go areas for his party. And of course the MDC’s democratic and human rights credentials are well established – while those of Zanu-PF are a constant cause for concern.Should Chamisa win the election, there is no doubt that the world would welcome Zimbabwe back into the fold with open arms. But Mnangagwa is smart enough to realise that international recognition of his government can only come if this election is acknowledged as free and fair by the global community. While Britain has been unswervingly supportive of the post-Mugabe regime, the US has reserved judgment – recently renewing its sanctions on Zanu-PF leaders and companies, but promising to lift them once credible elections have taken place.And there’s the rub. Many believe it is impossible for the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission to run a free and fair poll. It is accused of rigging every election since it was established in 2004 it is still staffed largely by the military and Zanu-PF loyalists and it has shown shameful bias towards the ruling party in recent months. For example, the law says the ballot paper should be in alphabetical order, which places Chamisa second on the 23-person list. The commission cleverly formatted the paper into two lop-sided columns, in order to place Mnangagwa at the very top of column two.So this election could bring three possible results: if Mnangagwa wins, the MDC already has enough ammunition against the electoral commission to cry foul. If Chamisa wins convincingly, it will be a new dawn indeed – but the military might not accept this, as the generals have already invested a lot in Mnangagwa.But if there is no clear winner, the most sensible way forward would be for the two protagonists to agree to a marriage of convenience – otherwise known as a government of national unity.• Wilf Mbanga is the founder, editor and publisher of The Zimbabwean weekly, published in the UK and Johannesburg"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1c03114b054c5913a40589dd799d965301d15db5/0_0_3035_1819/master/3035.jpg?w=1200\u0026amp;h=630\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;crop=faces%2Centropy\u0026amp;bm=normal\u0026amp;ba=bottom%2Cleft\u0026amp;blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly9hc3NldHMuZ3VpbS5jby51ay9pbWFnZXMvb3ZlcmxheXMvNTM4OGZjODViNTQ0N2E4M2NmMWNlMTg5YTVhMjE1NzMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026amp;s=10e1bf774b812163224c73cc898c7bba","title":"denver nuggets where to eat and drink in colorados capital","story":"From the best pizza to the finest brewpubs, if there’s a restaurant or bar worth knowing in the Mile High City then chances are that local food doyen Kade Gianinetti has tried it out.

Since co-launching coffee company Method Roasters in 2013, the gourmet-entrepreneur has opened food truck-turned-LoHi-hotspot American Grind, two bars (the Way Back and Wayward) and the recently opened daytime diner, Wendell’s.So what’s delicious about Denver? “It’s starting to be taken seriously as a foodie city,” he says. “The food being served here is on par with any in the country. You’re getting high-quality stuff and people who really care.” City-wide, people are pushing to make local, sustainable food accessible to all. “It’s not just fancy farm-to-table restaurants or high-end cocktail bars,” says Gianinetti.  “Diners and neighbourhood restaurants are stepping up and creating really cool options that are supporting our local farms and a range of other local businesses.”And what’s on Denver’s menu next? “We’ve set groundwork for some of the most creative food and beverage offerings that we’ll see in any city over the next five years, with each neighbourhood boasting its own identity and personality and unique food scene.”Cart-DriverAnybody coming to town who wants to get a feel for what Denver is should do themselves a favour and go to Cart-Driver.

Go-to order: the clam pizza.SpuntinoTheir food is incredible, but it’s super-passionate owner Elliot Strathmann’s knowledge of digestifs and aperitifs that makes Spuntino. He has a vintage collection of spirits, and if you’re nice enough to him he’ll let you sample some really old Italian amaros.Ratio BeerworksThis is an awesome microbrewery, with a beautiful patio right on Larimer Street. Rather than focus on fringe, crazy varieties, they make the sort of easy-drinking beers that Denver is really loving right now.Western Daughters Butcher ShoppeWhat sustainable, local food should be. If you’re looking to buy meat in Denver, I don’t think anybody does it better than Western Daughters. Owners Kate Kavanaugh and Josh Curtiss have some of the best connections in Colorado for beef, pork and poultry – they don’t compromise on where they source from and what they pay their farmers. And they sell house-made sausage.Hop AlleyChef and owner Tommy Lee knows what people like and delivers it in a really creative way. It’s traditional Chinese food served family-style, but he pushes people’s boundaries at the same time by the end of your experience, you’ve tried something new.

Aaron Millar lists his favourite watering holesDenver is known as the “Napa Valley of Beer” for good reason: more hoppy delights are brewed here than anywhere else in the country. Add to that five gold medals at this year’s World Beer Cup Awards (or the Olympics of brewing, as it’s known), more than 100 artisan tap rooms, and the simple fact that beer tastes better looking at the mountains, having climbed mountains or talking about going to the mountains tomorrow. Like a brew with a view? Here are some of Denver’s top hop spots: Tivoli Brewing Company Denver’s oldest brewery has been serving up frothy refreshments since the first settlers arrived in 1859. Check out their historic taproom for a glass of Tivoli Helles Lager, a favourite of the early pioneers, which is still poured to this day.Wynkoop Brewing Company Established in 1988, this is Colorado’s first craft brewpub, and still one of its best and most notorious. Try their Rocky Mountain Oyster Stout, brewed with its namesake (bull’s testicles to you and me the region has no oysters).Ratio Beerworks Set up by a trio of former 90s punk rock touring musicians, this industrial-style taproom in the hip RiNo (River North) Arts District has taken the Denver craft beer scene by storm. Expect slick brews, a sweet patio and one of the coolest live music, arts and event line-ups in the city. Their Dear You French saison is already a classic beer.Denver Beer Trail With four walking routes – each through a different downtown neighbourhood – covering 14 miles and 35 taprooms in total, this is the ultimate craft-brew pub crawl, a half-marathon of beer. Great American Beer Festival Held in Denver each October, this is the largest beer party in the country, with more than 3,500 artisan, classic and rare brews on show. Want a sip of each? Well, good luck: a 1oz sample of every brew on display adds up to 220 pints, or about three bathtubs’ of beer.Telluride Blues \u0026amp Brews The best blues musicians on the planet alongside the best craft beer in the state, all served up in one of the Rockies’ most beautiful towns. It’s every Coloradan’s favourite end-of-summer brews event, and with good reason.If you prefer your glass with a stem, then here’s something to celebrate: with 300 days of sunshine a year, low humidity, and crisp mountain nights, Colorado is overflowing with wine as well as beer. From rieslings and cabernets to wines made from peach, cherries, honey and plums, its high-altitude vineyards – the loftiest in the US – produce a unique regional style.For the best wineries and tours, head over to the Western Slope.

By the time of his death in 2011 at the age of 72, he had amassed an astonishingly comprehensive collection of vintage film posters.Now that collection, featuring some of the world’s best-loved stars, including Clint Eastwood, Sean Connery and Harrison Ford, in films such as Hitchcock’s Vertigo and Spielberg’s Raiders of the Lost Ark, will go under the hammer at a Surrey auction house on Thursday.East had been a film fan while growing up in the small town of Milford Haven in Pembrokeshire, often seeing six different releases a week in the local cinema. During his life as a schoolteacher he carried on the hobby, sharing the enthusiasm with his partner Pat, until her early death. At that point, in grief, East immersed himself in the world of film memorabilia professionally and set himself up in the collecting and dealing business, recruiting his brother, Alex, to help him run a series of small stalls.He collected a vast range of posters, portraits, stills, magazines and books, and from the early 1990s ran a Saturday stall at the Electric Ballroom in Camden. From there he moved to a grander plot at Westminster Central Hall, attracting clients from Europe.“This is a truly eclectic collection that has mass appeal because of the extensive crossover interest,” said Alastair McCrea, a specialist valuer at Ewbank’s.Highlights of the sale include a large scale poster for Thunderball, the 1965 James Bond film starring Connery, with a guide price of between £1,500 and £2,500. A poster for the classic film noir 1971 British gangster film Get Carter, starring Michael Caine, is expected to fetch a similar amount.Other highlights include posters for sci-fi films such as Warlords of Atlantis and At The Earth’s Core, the 1960s classics Easy Rider and How To Steal a Million, starring Audrey Hepburn and Peter O’Toole.

He talks ‘wokeness’, vindication and Trump’s AmericaSpike Lee has heard all his film-making life that he is preoccupied with race. Sometimes the criticism has not come from obvious voices. Back in 2000, when Lee suggested that a lot of African American comedy and music – including gangsta rap – was not far removed from minstrel shows, the actor Jamie Foxx observed: “I think it’s getting to the point where nobody cares, because he talks about it so much that now he’s just become the angry guy, the angry black man.”For a long time, Lee has been proposing an idea of America – that its stories should be told in the context of its violently racist past – that not everyone wanted to hear. In the present political moment, however, with the president that he calls Agent Orange in the White House, he is, obviously, unrepentant. People are rethinking films of his, he suggests, that they previously might have dismissed. And having mostly been ignored by the major award juries for the past 30 years, Lee, aged 61, is once again picking up prizes.Often the criticism of his work has been coded. Two weeks ago, I mentioned to Lee in his studio office in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, that, having read a selection of three decades’ worth of reviews and profiles before our interview, the description of him that surfaced most often was “provocateur”. That word sometimes seemed to be used as a euphemism for “uppity”.“I can just about live with provocateur,” Lee says, weighing me up with his sparky, seen-it-all eyes from behind outsized, orange-framed glasses (in person he is anything but angry – considered, thoughtful, quick to laugh). “The one that gets me is ‘controversial’ – ‘the controversial director.’” He dislikes the tag because it suggests he sets out only to shock. Mostly, Lee believes, over the course of more than 40 films – beginning in bravura style with the liberating She’s Gotta Have It in 1986 and continuing through Do the Right Thing and Malcolm X and Clockers and Miracle at St Anna – he has simply been telling it like it is.Many of those films have been conceived in this building – a pair of brownstone houses converted into a three-storey studio space, only a couple of blocks from where Lee grew up and from where his father, Bill, a jazz musician, now 90, still lives. The office is something like a museum to the director’s obsessions, or a glimpse inside his head – the walls are lined with paintings and artwork relating to Jackie Robinson and Muhammad Ali, Malcolm X and Michael Jordan and Michael Jackson, as well as posters of his own films. You have the sense of him circling around these reference points, feeling for what has changed, and what has not.Lee’s latest expression of the facts of American life – BlacKkKlansman, which was awarded the Grand Prix at the Cannes film festival – is the true story of Ron Stallworth, the first black detective in the Colorado Springs police force who, in 1978, went undercover with the Ku Klux Klan. The story began bizarrely enough, when Stallworth saw a recruitment ad for the KKK in the classifieds of the local newspaper. He called the number, raised the pitch of his voice a couple of notches, and made up a tale about his disgust at his white sister dating a black man. He was immediately invited to join up. Working as a double act with a white Jewish cop – Stallworth on the phone, his partner in the hood and robes – he infiltrated the group, and, in a series of unlikely twists, not only ended up being proposed as leader of the local chapter, but also became the telephone confidant of David Duke, the “grand wizard” of the white supremacists. Duke eventually came to Colorado Springs personally to initiate Stallworth into the Klan.The film, like all of Lee’s films, enjoys some wicked shifts of tone, in this case designed to make his audience smile at some of the historical ironies even as they are asked to confront the vivid extremes of American bigotry. Lee is a master of comic caricature and the Klan members offer scope for a full range of racist imbecility. In Stallworth’s memoir, the undercover cops foil a planned nail-bomb attack on a gay bar. Here, the targets of the Klan’s plotting are black student activists who invite Stokely Carmichael, the former Black Panther, to speak at their campus, which allows Lee to appropriate some of the style of the post-blaxploitation era.In a coincidence not lost on the director, at the same time that Stallworth was infiltrating the Klan, Lee was involved in some anti-fascist action of his own.In the summer of 1980, in his first few weeks at NYU graduate film school, Lee’s class was shown DW Griffith’s 1915 epic The Birth of a Nation (for more than a century the film, which depicts the rise of ritual white nationalism, has been a defining cultural symbol and recruitment tool for the Klan). Lee’s class were taught not about that violent social history, however, but rather asked to use the film to examine the technical innovations that made Griffith the “godfather of American cinema”. “That disturbed me,” Lee says.His response was a student film – his first – called The Answer, in which a young black director is hired by a Hollywood studio to remake The Birth of a Nation from his own viewpoint. Inevitably, that vision becomes compromised by the studio and the young director pulls out of the film. Along the way he becomes a target for the Klan himself. The final scene of Lee’s student movie involved a cross-burning on the lawn outside the director’s window, prompting him to head out, with a knife in his hand, to confront the Klansmen. When The Answer was shown at a faculty screening, some staff members were reportedly shocked by the “aggressive” tone of the film two recommended, unsuccessfully, that Lee should not be invited back for the final two years of the doctoral programme.If that sounded far-fetched in 1978, it sounds tragically less so now. “This guy in the White House,” Lee says, “has given the green light for the Klan, for the alt-right, for the neo-Nazis to come out in the open. There is no need for the so-called dogwhistle any more, they are in full daylight.”BlacKkKlansman ends, in a typical Spike Lee payoff, with graphic news footage from the violent Unite the Right march in Charlottesville last August, which ended with the death of Heather Heyer, who had been protesting against the torch-lit rally. He also uses footage of the president’s shaming assertion that “both sides” were to blame for that violence, and of Duke himself, the racist undead, endorsing Trump’s rise (while suggesting that a few of Trump’s ideas – building the wall, America First – had been stolen direct from his own manifestos).Lee didn’t start shooting his film until last autumn. When he watched those scenes in August, it was obvious, he says, that the news had written his film’s ending. He contacted Heyer’s mother for her blessing to use footage of the fatal moment when the neo-Nazi James Alex Fields drove his car into the crowd of anti-fascist protesters, killing her daughter.That must have been a tough phone call to make, I say.“It was a harder call for her. She lost her daughter in an act of terrorism. One hundred per cent American, apple pie, fourth of July, homegrown terrorism.”The film is due to be released in the US on 10 August, to coincide with the first anniversary of the Charlottesville march. There are plans for another Unite the Right rally, this time opposite the White House.For a long time, Americans have wanted to see white supremacism as ancient history, Lee suggests, but it has never been that.“The whole foundation of this country is wack,” he says at one point, on the subject. “It’s bullshit. If you go to the constitution it is written that slaves were counted as three-fifths of a human being, chattel, like cows or chickens. Unless we can come to grips with how this nation was formed and be honest about it we will never go forward.”Because Lee has been associated so closely with Brooklyn as a film-maker, it is easy to forget that he was born in the south, in Atlanta, Georgia. His father’s family was from near Selma, and the terrorism of slavery and lynchings and Jim Crow were close to home.Watching Lee’s films again, I find myself drawn to the two documentaries he has made about the south – both exceptional films – Four Little Girls, about the 1963 Birmingham church bombings, and the four hours of When the Levee Broke, his intensely human appraisal of the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans. It seems to me that his film-making always wants to have journalism somewhere near its heart. He agrees that those films were pivotal in some ways to how his methods have developed.In some ways, Lee – irrepressible, steeped in history – was born to that role of inquisitor of white power. His father, like his grandfather before him, went to Morehouse College in Atlanta, a celebrated African American arts institution, and was a contemporary of Martin Luther King Jr. Lee studied alongside Martin Luther King III at Morehouse in the class of 1979.Though civil rights politics were never far from the dinner table, his parents had other, equally formative impacts on him. Lee’s love for music comes from his father, who played standup jazz in Greenwich Village, and was a good enough session musician to record with Bob Dylan, Aretha Franklin and Duke Ellington among others. His mother, Jacquelyn, who died when Lee was 20, was a high-school teacher of art and African American literature, and gave him his love for cinema. “My father did not like movies – there were no films about black people and he didn’t want to see the Hollywood stuff,” he says, “so as the eldest son I was my mother’s date.”What did she take him to see?“One of the first was Bye Bye Birdie at Radio City Music Hall,” he says. “It’s funny, that opening scene of Do the Right Thing, in which Rosie Perez dances to Fight the Power, that came, I realised later on, from the opening of Bye Bye Birdie and Ann Margret singing about Birdie being drafted.”That attitude – that he could rewrite the history of American cinema in his own way – seemed fully formed from the beginning in Lee’s film-making. In the past year or two he has reconnected directly with those early films by remaking She’s Gotta Have It as a Netflix series.It was the idea of his wife, Tonya Lewis Lee, a film producer. “She watches a lot of series, Amazon, Netflix,” he says. “And she could see a way to do it. We shopped it around and Netflix said OK.” After a successful first run, he has just finished working on a second 10-part season following Nola Darling’s love life.The space between the series and the original film documents not only subtle changes in sexual and racial politics, but also the dramatic gentrification of his Brooklyn neighbourhood. The original film was as much a collective expression of the group of artists and actors he lived among here in the mid-80s as anything else. Does he still feel that community is possible?“It is,” he says, “but it depends on there being a place where artists find it affordable to live. A young Andy Warhol in Pittsburgh, or even a young Madonna in Michigan, could not make it to New York and exist here now.”He doesn’t believe online hubs can replace those communities.“It’s gotta be face to face. We were all bumping into each other on the block here.” He fetches a picture from the studio’s bathroom wall of the coolest-looking Bloomsbury set of all time and runs through the names: “Chris Rock. Joseph Simmons from Run DMC. Bill Stephney from Public Enemy. A few of them are still around.”It is an irony not lost on Lee that the look and success of his own film first made Fort Greene attractive to property developers. If you walk up from his studio across the park to his old house now, it is full of children’s nannies pushing state-of-the-art buggies, and financiers and lawyers jogging with focus, or pulling along exotic dogs. The brownstone houses have mostly been tricked up in heritage paints and sell for many millions of dollars. Lee has been a fierce critic of this process, which he inadvertently set in motion, and has been given to public rants about it, such as this infamous one to a local gathering a few years back: “There were brothers playing motherfuckin’ African drums in Mount Morris Park for 40 years and now they can’t do it any more because the new inhabitants said the drums are loud. My father’s a great jazz musician. He bought a house in 19-motherfuckin’-68, and the motherfuckin’ people moved in last year and called the cops on my father. He’s not – he doesn’t even play electric bass! It’s acoustic! Here’s another thing: when Michael Jackson died they wanted to have a party for him in motherfuckin’ Fort Greene Park and all of a sudden the white people in Fort Greene said: ‘Wait a minute! We can’t have black people having a party for Michael Jackson to celebrate his life. They’re gonna leave lots of garbage.’ Garbage? Have you seen Fort Greene Park in the morning? It’s like the motherfuckin’ Westminster dog show.”He is less animated about the fact when we meet. How does he feel walking around here these days? “It’s like all over,” he says. “It’s like Brixton, where I used to hang out in London. I guess it’s safer now, but it’s not the same.”Though he maintained his studio here, Lee and his wife and two children, then toddlers, moved out 20 years ago when they bought a 8,292 sq ft town house on the Upper East Side on Manhattan that used to belong to the painter Jasper Johns and, before that, to Gypsy Rose Lee. He has never been shy of accumulating or displaying his wealth, though in the past he has tried to claim, somewhat ridiculously, that he is not “rich rich”. “Rich is Spielberg. Lucas. Gates. Jay-Z! Oprah Winfrey,” he once observed, “that’s a ton of money. Compared with them, I’m on welfare.”Still, he can just about remember what it was like to have nothing. She’s Gotta Have It was shot in summer 1985 in two six-day weeks for a begged and borrowed $175,000 – and made $7mI wonder if, looking back, he knew when he took that gamble he would end up where he is at 61?In all that time, more than two dozen movies, he never seems to have been undone by doubt?“There is no way I could be in the position I am now, if I had doubt,” he says. “That came from my parents and grandparents – even if they had thought it, they never once said: ‘You can’t do that.’ They said: ‘We support you, but you gotta work hard.’ You had to bust your ass.”He shows no signs of stopping. The spur is never a fear of failure, he says, but simply storytelling. There are always more stories crowding in to be told.We talk a little about the horror show of American politics. On the day we meet, Trump is in the UK Lee is amused by the fact that the English have been able to take out their World Cup sorrows on the presidential visit: “Perfect timing.” He wants to make the point, too, that his film is not exclusively or “quintessentially”, as Cate Blanchett said in handing over the award at Cannes, “about an American crisis”.“This stuff is happing in France, Germany, Italy, Britain. The rise of the right. You have Brexit. We just do it bigger and better than anyone else! But you start to rally your nation around the scapegoat, the villain, the immigrant, we know how that ends, right? What was the first thing Trump said? All Mexicans are rapists. That’s where it began.”His own antidote to that is the two-word phrase that has been a feature of almost every film he has made, beginning with the last words of his second feature, School Daze, which ended with Laurence Fishburne’s character exhorting his audience to “Wake Up!” Does the contemporary urgency to be “woke” make him feel vindicated?“I get no joy from being right,” he says. “I want to be wrong. I wanted there to have been some progress. ‘Wake up’ has been like a refrain for me. And I’m still saying it.”I suggest to him that if we’d had this conversation a decade ago, he might have begun to believe that things were changing. Barack and Michelle Obama had grown up with Lee’s philosophy – they had gone to see Do the Right Thing on their first date in 1989 – and they were on their way to the White House. In a New Yorker profile of Lee in 2008, at the time of Obama’s nomination to the Democrat ticket, he declared that their progress was “ordained – it’s providence. I think this is going to be such a pivotal moment in history,” he said, “that you can measure time by BB, Before Barack, and AB, After Barack.” When I quote that to him now, he rocks back in his seat, and lets out a roar.“I was wrong about that! Though in one way it’s true in that Agent Orange – his only agenda is to dismantle everything Obama did. I think it goes back to that correspondents’ dinner when he sat there in the audience and President Obama tore him another anus. After that, as soon as he put his right hand on that lying Bible, he was getting rid of everything that Obama had done.”How does he see the next year – or the next week – going?“My friends call me Negrodamus!” he says, laughing broadly. “Negrodamus! But I can’t help thinking it’s going to be ugly. What is really amazing is these house Republicans. How do they sleep at night? They are up there co-signing this hatred. You have to think these guys just kneel and pray at the altar of the almighty dollar. They would put their mother on the corner. That is what we are up against.”What about hope?BlacKkKlansman is out in the UK on 24 August.

Night and day compared to when I was growing up.”At 16, Ross did not play in a formal league. School success triggered a happy coincidence, assisted of course by her talent. “The coach at Falkirk Girls came to see his daughter play in a school game. He couldn’t believe it when I said I didn’t play for a team. I played there for a year and scored 50 goals. It all kind of happened by accident. I had never chased football or had ambitions of playing for certain teams.“I didn’t know anything about women’s football when I was growing up. It was just a hobby at that point, a chance to be out with my pals at the weekend kicking a ball about.”Glasgow City, after several failed attempts, coaxed Ross from struggling Newburgh Ladies in 2007. Anna Signeul, at that point recently installed as the Scotland manager, was on a mission to raise the bar. The club became the dominant force in the Scottish women’s game and European regulars.“Anna came in, had a vision for women’s football and was kind of ruthless in terms of what she expected from people,” Ross recalls. “If you didn’t meet those expectations, you weren’t part of it. She revolutionised the amount we trained and increased coach education. She should get a lot of credit but clubs like Glasgow City picked it up, believed in it and invested in it. The players started believing as well, we could see the chance to go and achieve things.“At that time we trained two nights a week if we were lucky. Some players could only make one session. So you felt as though that was a big commitment at that point. We started being more successful, Eddie Wolecki Black came into Glasgow City and Anna was demanding more from the national team players.”One of many remarkable aspects to Ross’s story is her versatility she has played in every outfield position for club or country. Her stunning goals haul arrived despite playing for just a single season as a striker.“I didn’t even know I was nearing that mark, to be honest,” Ross admits. “It was the club’s social media stuff on the morning of the game – ‘Can she get the 250th?’ – that told me.“The only record I have known is that Suzanne Lappin was the club’s record scorer with 232, so there was a lot made of that when I got close, the pair of us had a bit of banter about it as well. But there hasn’t really been anything this time around.”No trophy, no memento. Not that Ross seems remotely perturbed. “I’ve never had personal targets in terms of goals for the season or anything like that,” she explains. “If I can contribute to the team doing well, I’m happy.”Ross is brilliantly candid regarding current challenges. She may yet sample them in another role, having recently completed her Uefa B Licence coaching studies. “I think women’s games can come and go and people wouldn’t know about them,” she says. And the solution? “I’m a great believer that if people have role models, people they can aspire to be, then they are likely to try and follow in their path. So for me, it’s about promoting those playing now to a high level. You can show young girls that the opportunity is there.”Scotland’s key domestic issue is straightforward: a major talent drain to major clubs in England and abroad has an impact on the league. Ross says “it helps those iniduals in terms of playing at a higher standard” but the knock-on effect at home is obvious.“We need to keep looking at our league and how we can make that better,” Ross says. “Glasgow City have had the best players in Scotland, we have done well in the Champions League, so of course people have put themselves in the shop window. Why would they not move on if given the opportunity to be a professional elsewhere? We have had to restructure ourselves every year, bring in new players and improve them to get back to the standards we were at.”One simple fix relates to simply paying wages to female players in Scotland, which has never been customary. “We have had to work all the time as well as play,” Ross says. “That is a difficult choice, it has never been easy to balance a job and football to the standard we have been trying to play at. The girls now deserve to be paid if they are going to be training as hard as a guy is training. Until that situation changes in Scotland, we are going to struggle to keep our players here.”Ross has been there for the long haul. Scottish football should appreciate her more than has already been the case."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/41fbcc7f17597588ca8bc454ad107d606c857557/293_0_5996_3598/master/5996.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4724699d29bf93e6670fb335d5c8a459","title":"qatar 2022 bid team sabotaged world cup rivals whistleblower says","story":"Whistleblower tells Sunday Times fake propaganda spread by PR agency and ex-CIA operativesA senior MP has called for a “proper independent investigation” into claims Qatar launched a secret campaign to discredit its rivals to host the 2022 FIFA World Cup.Damian Collins, the chair of the Commons digital, culture, media and sport select committee, said on Sunday that Fifa should address allegations that the Gulf state hired a PR agency and former CIA operatives to disseminate fake propaganda about its main competitors, the USA and Australia, more seriously than it handled earlier corruption allegations.The claims came from an anonymous whistleblower, who alleged to the Sunday Times that a smear campaign had been orchestrated on behalf of Qatar’s bid committee, which included paying a professor $9,000 (£6,900) to write a damning report on the economic cost of a US World Cup, recruiting journalists and bloggers to promote negative stories in the US, Australian and international media, and organising grassroots protests at rugby matches in Australia, to give Fifa the impression of a lack of support for bids in their home countries.The leaked documents purport to show that a group of American PE teachers had been recruited to ask congressmen to oppose a US World Cup on the grounds the money would be better spent on high school sports.Fifa’s rules of conduct for the bidding process state that bidders should not make “any written or oral statements of any kind, whether adverse or otherwise, about the bids or candidatures of any other member association.”.Qatar will host the 2022 World Cup in the winter to avoid games being played in summer temperatures, which means domestic football schedules in Europe and elsewhere will be interrupted.Fifa has already investigated corruption allegations involving the Qatar bid, but did not find any evidence that it had bought votes so the tournament is set to go ahead as planned. It will be the first time the event has been hosted in the Middle East, even though Qatar has no history of playing top-class football.The Sunday Times published an email, purportedly from Michael Holtzman, the president of the communications and PR company BLJ in New York, who was working for Qatar 2022, to Ahmad Nimeh, an adviser on Qatar’s bid team. Dated 17 May 2010 and under the subject line “strategy”, it says: “For the past 4 months, we have undertaken an extensive campaign to undermine the 20182022 candidacies of competitor countries, particularly Australia and the US.”Holtzman said: “We have a group of pro-rugby students in Melbourne, Australia, who will start appearing at rugby matches with signs ‘Hands off our rugby! No to World Cup!’ in June.”Collins told Sky News on Sunday: “I’ve met the whistleblower myself and seen the evidence that he’s brought forward. I think these are serious matters and there needs to be a proper independent investigation of them.”He said there had been a significant loss of confidence in Fifa as a result of corruption allegations and that the latest claims represented an “opportunity to demonstrate that Fifa takes these issues much more seriously than it has done”.Lord Triesman, England’s bid chairman in 2010 when the country campaigned to host the 2018 finals and a former chairman of the Football Association, urged Fifa to look at the evidence thoroughly, and said Qatar should not be allowed to host the World Cup if the country is shown to have broken Fifa rules.Fifa said: “Concerning the 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cup bidding process, a thorough investigation was conducted by Michael Garcia and his conclusions are available in the report. Generally speaking, complaints regarding potential breaches of the Fifa code of ethics may be filed via Fifa’s confidential reporting mechanism.”Qatar’s organising committee said it rejected the allegations. “We have been thoroughly investigated and have been forthcoming with all information related to our bid, including the official investigation led by US attorney Michael Garcia,” it said in a statement. “We have strictly adhered to all Fifa’s rules and regulations for the 20182022 World Cup bidding process.”BLJ has been approached for comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db395978ad1bef6be6669cfdb44a7f3404226ea4/0_0_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d7191d7d497e289ecf55b6246e348002","title":"france croatia final trophy russia 2018 ends on high world cup football daily","story":"Max and co discuss France’s World Cup final triumph over Croatia, another penalty, another controversial VAR incident, the tournament’s highs and lows and players taking shots to the conkers"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/57ea32879205e50f3cc8b899668df4f84d17a179/0_752_4498_2698/master/4498.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=178fcf0c29518196859c7d60ad5bd116","title":"leaders of the pack expert guide to what you need to take on holiday","story":"Large suitcase in the hold? Or just a change of underwear and a scarf that doubles as a hat? As the holiday season begins, five intrepid travellers reveal their packing secretsMy grandmother, Ludmilla, once disembarked in New York accompanied by two children and 32 suitcases. Taxi drivers on the quay cursed with wild amazement, but what looked to them like reckless extravagance turned out to be natural and understandable. In how we pack is who we are.Ludmilla had been a child refugee, a White Russian whose mother took her by circuitous routes to Shanghai, where they were poor and stateless. Marriage brought more wealth than happiness. Internment during the war reduced her to the corner of a hut and few possessions. Her packing regime in subsequent years of plenty suggests Ludmilla’s things were her security suitcases were defences against uncertainty that began in a childhood on the road.“Our things can become imbued with our essence,” says the psychologist Dr Christian Jarrett, “and associated with strong personal memories. We use them to convey our identity. With packing there is the mundane aspect of not wanting to forget anything practical, but there is also sometimes a deeper anxiety around more meaningful possessions.”Ludmilla idolised America. No wonder apprehension about her status and her reception there drove her to pack pretty much everything.Jarrett goes further: “For particularly cherished items there may even be the anxiety over whether it is better to take it with you (and risk losing or damaging it) or to reluctantly leave it behind, thereby temporarily letting go of a part of ourselves in the process.”To my grandmother, it seems, the idea of having things, or not having them, was more important than their use. As suitcases come out all over the country, there is something of Ludmilla in many of us. The anxiety of packing, for those who find it stressful, would seem to come partly from a pressure to ide a self which is represented by possessions. At some level we are selecting those aspects of ourselves that will not only serve us in Scarborough or the Seychelles, but which will also define us there.“Huh!” I hear you snort. “Check the weather, take something comfy, something smart and a costume for the beach.” But then there are toiletries, outfits, chargers, electronics, shoes for different activities, coat or not, books, hat, the luggage allowance to consider, and you haven’t even thought about the children’s stuff yet. Or, more likely, you have sorted them out and left your packing until last. How many hold bags are you checking in? Are you going to trust they all get there, or ide essentials between them? As allowances have shrunk, security increased, travel exploded and possessions multiplied, to pack a bag in 2018 is now a fine art. We need an expert.“Packing is one of those many things that I feel I know more about than any other person living,” says the narrator of Jerome K Jerome’s Three Men in a Boat, who was spared those mean little measuring cages and airlines devoted to wringing cash out of every kilo. After much mishap he concludes: “It is lumber, man – all lumber! Throw it overboard.” This is the philosophy of the accomplished packer who resides within, squabbling with our inner Ludmilla.For men: “One good shirt with a collar, and a really good toothbrush” is your baseline, according to a man I met who once rowed a boat around Spitsbergen. For women: the novelist Louisa Young recommends one silk dress: “Rolls up tiny, in case an ambassador invites you to tea.” She took the tip from her sister, who went around the world on a motorbike.Frequent travellers and female flight attendants recommend a shawl or pashmina, for the same reason Buddha got by on a sarong – what garment is more versatile? During years of travel writing, a cotton scarf has been my hat, sunshade, eye-mask, pillow and towel. In common with the millions of fans of Lee Child’s Reacher novels, part of me yearns to roam the world toting only a toothbrush, free of clutter, master of my own fate, or of my possessions, at least.The luggage industry understands this yearning for control and has helped us to overcomplicate things in the name of simplification. Enter the packing cube, plastic wallets that fit inside a suitcase – bags to go inside bags, extra packing for the neurotic packer, and environmental lunacy, but they have their fans.Experienced travellers treat shoes as packing cubes for underwear, socks, spectacles and breakables. Few recommend vacuum packing. If you find yourself kneeling on (another) plastic bag, sucking the air out of your smalls with a hoover, you may be taking too much.For, in packing, there is also the chance of psychological liberation, an echo of leaving home or moving house. “At a key juncture, old belongings are shed like a carapace, fostering the emergence of a new identity,” as Christian Jarrett puts it. You are not just going on holiday. You are becoming another you.So how do you do it? No doubt you are accomplished in your own method, but packing practice is a whirl of eccentricity and insight. Thom Jones, an international educationalist, travels much: “I pack a harmonica for work and pleasure. I judge a country by whether their customs staff demand that I play it,” he says.Gina Balta, a maritime historian who finds packing stressful, starts with a suitcase, then packs “clockwise from where I’m standing, and I continue to the rest of the house, always clockwise!”Simon Worrall, traveller and writer, provides a sensible rule: “If you hesitate, leave it at home.” Wide-travelling women counsel sticking to one colour palette. Deirdre O’Donnell, international consultant paediatrician, advises on having one set of clothes in your hand luggage, allowing your case to go on its travels without marring yours. “All my clothes go with each other (weird navy wardrobe) and only ever two pairs of footwear. Rolling definitely works. And never pack a towel.”A sarong fan, she is one of many who insist that rolling clothes beats folding. The more often you travel the less you tend to take.“I keep a bag ready to go,” intones the priest and presenter Richard Coles, a man constantly on the move. “Contents: change of knickers and shirt, toiletries (including hand cream), sharp knife, sleeping pills, bathplug, wet wipes.” Note the bathplug – standard kit for travellers enjoying adventurous retirements who relish transforming an imperfect hotel into a bathing spot.My wanderings yield tips from erse places. A Berber camel driver in the Moroccan Sahara watched me faffing and then gently intimated that packing is the art of putting like with like: plastic, paper and fabrics with their own kind. On this principle my luggage is a sports bag with toiletries collected from hotels in one end, notebook, guidebook, novel in the other, clothes in the middle, and it all goes hand luggage, weight being the enemy of pleasure.Travelling overland from South Africa to Wales in pursuit of migrating swallows, I found the most useful item to be a paper clip. It sounds silly, but it replaced buttons, hung mosquito nets, repaired zips and excavated splinters. I met my partner on the journey. Rebecca always takes packs of cards, transforming delays into Canasta or Go Fish tournaments.If packing for travel is essentially a reflection of a state of mind, then the best advice yet was given to me in the Kaokoveld desert, by a Namibian guide. I was about to undertake the swallow journey, following the migration route of the bird, at the end of which I would have almost nothing more than the clothes I wore. (Pilgrims and overland travellers arrive with a fraction of their initial burdens. Travel teaches the substitution of experience for possessions.)“What should I take?” I asked.“Go with a level head and a humble heart,” he said. “You’ll be fine.”I took my son abroad last month. Midway through cramming my suitcase with every conceivable solution to every conceivable problem that could possibly arise during the course of a single 96-hour trip, I was struck by a sudden epiphany. ‘You know,’ I thought, bashed between the eyes by a rare thunderbolt of common sense, ‘I bet they sell nappies in Portugal.’They do. And medicine. And sun cream. And most of the other stuff I was trying to crush into luggage for the benefit of an uninterested toddler. I’d been going mad with anticipatory panic, deluded into thinking that the UK was the only developed country on Earth, but it was all for nothing.This, I think, is a remnant of how we used to travel when every journey was a blind leap into the unknown. That uncertainty has gone. Google Maps exists now. You can locate every supermarket in a 10-mile radius before you leave home. You can trace the route there on Streetview. You can find their website to see if they stock the things you want to take. There are very few surprises with modern travel.Going anywhere with young children is stressful. They tire easily. When they want something, they want it now. Buy most of what you need when you arrive. You travel lighter. In the end we just took four changes of clothing, a day’s worth of nappies and an iPad for the entertainment on the flight. This only works to a degree, however. My brother is getting married in Bali soon. Bali is 18 hours away. I have two children under the age of four. Please forgive me for ignoring my own advice and packing a giant suitcase rammed with Ambien and gin. Something tells me I’ll need it.Stuart Heritage writes about film, music and TVI’m a night-before packer, and chaotic. I throw everything in. I’m pretty relaxed about it, and I have a separate wardrobe in a different room for my holiday clothes.I’ve been caught out by technology in the past. I now leave all my global adaptors, a couple of chargers, a hairbrush and spare hair tongs in my suitcase. I have a separate beauty bag – moisturiser, night cream, foundation, and I sometimes take a travel iron with me.I overpack on accessories. Jewellery can be a game-changer, especially for work. If you need to take a look from day to night, a statement earring or cuff can transform a look. For the shows, I take 15 pairs of shoes for about six days, but probably only wear five pairs. My styling represents two sides of myself: there’s the riot of colour, and a real-life wardrobe of white, black and gold.Packing for children is a joy. My daughter is six and we share a suitcase. She will end up with 10 unworn summer dresses and I’ll always be a few items short.I’m pretty low maintenance when it comes to a beach holiday. I’ll take five bikinis (I’ll usually pick up another, and get a new bikini before I go), two pairs of sunglasses and two hats (put underwear inside to keep their shape) – one straw Panama style, and one wide-brimmed – and a gorgeous old kaftan I’ve had forever. Something evening-appropriate, too. I get a spray tan. I don’t want to go in the sun and I don’t want to look white. I have a routine: spray tan, mani, pedi, then you are beach-ready and all those clothes instantly look better and you are in the zone. It’s a ritual, like adding the bikini and the kaftan.I get pleasure from fitting everything in. Packing for a holiday is all about the dream of what’s to come, though the reality might be different. It’s like dress-up.Wherever you go in the world, you can buy what you need. As long as you’ve got your passport and credit card and enough clothing to get through your first day, you’ll be all right.Lucy Yeomans is editor- in-chief of Net-a-PorterI have a super-romantic relationship with travel. I love to explore the planet and it’s an intrinsic part of who I am. So far this year I’ve been to Nicaragua on a backpacking holiday with two friends to Ghana, Lebanon and Colombia, working on my Radio 4 documentary series The Sound Odyssey, which is about musical collaboration on a beach holiday to the Dominican Republic and to the Hay Festival. When I went to Nicaragua I was travelling around with this filthy backpack, that was really heavy and difficult to pack and unpack. My friends saw me lugging it around and for my birthday they staged an intervention and bought me a fancy suitcase. It’s changed my life. There are all these rules about what you are supposed to pack, but when I go on holiday I want to look like me. I have lots of vintage stuff, sequins, big knitted jumpers – and I definitely keep that in mind when packing. If anything, I try to experiment even more on holiday. Bright colours and prints seem to make more sense when you’re abroad. The key is to take loads of gly, exciting accessories and make-up. I’ll take some giant feather earrings or an iridescent eyeshadow, and several scarves you can turn into a sarong or a head wrap.My other essential items are a notepad and a disposable camera or a Polaroid. If I’m on holiday I like the idea of disconnecting. If you don’t take your phone out, you feel much calmer and you capture memories in a different way. I really like to take books on holiday that are about sheer escapism and I’ll always take headphones so I can listen to albums if I’m feeling anxious.I’ve got better at packing. It used to be tears at midnight, not knowing where anything is, feeling panicked and out of sorts. It’s still madness, but there’s some method in it now. My mum’s got this thing called TPM, as long as you’ve got your tickets, passport and money you can go anywhere. So I have this mantra that everything will be OK, regardless of what I’ve got or haven’t got.Gemma Cairney is a writer and broadcasterI am a hoarder by nature, but years of being separated from suitcases by airport (mis)handling, and occasionally by nosy or malign authorities, have forced discipline on me. Two days in Dublin, or three weeks in Latin America, it makes no difference. If I don’t need a first aid kit and a flak jacket, everything has to fit into my battered carry-on.There is usually one smart outfit, a couple of changes of clothes and trainers in the hope I can get out on the streets for a run, which I’ve managed in some unlikely places, including Iran, Iraq and North Korea (I’m just waiting to be commissioned for a piece on ‘jogging the axis of evil’). I also pack a sweater even for hot countries, as air conditioning can be fierce.Because I go to such a variety of places, often in fast succession, I inevitably leave something important behind, but the many missing suitcases taught me that as long as I have my passport, credit card, glasses and phone, I can probably salvage the trip. I usually tell myself this on the way to the airport, as I try to work out what I’ve forgotten.For wars and natural disasters, my packing calculation is different: it’s mostly about protection. I have to think about what the risks are and what might help manage them, from guns and bombs (helmet and body armour) to tear gas (masks), contaminated water (purification tablets), power failures (battery packs and solar or car chargers) or ordinary crime (an alarmed door wedge).The limit is what I can carry myself, usually in a backpack, so I start with a large first aid kit and work back from there. And always lots of snacks.Emma Graham-Harrison is an international affairs correspondent for the Observer and the When I saw the price of flights to Greece this summer, on an airline formerly known as budget, I realised I’d have to learn to travel light. Having already paid extra for that great luxury known as a reserved seat, I refused to cough up for suitcases – so it’s hand luggage only. I spoke to the packing expert Hitha Palepu of hithaonthego about how to pack less stuff, and to pack smarter.1. Toiletries: “I know we’re all trying to use less plastic,” says Palepu, “but I succumb to those travel-sized toiletries and then make environmental decisions elsewhere.” She keeps a permanent set of small toiletries, under 100ml each, in a clear washbag that can go through security in hand luggage, and takes it on every trip, no fuss. I’m in awe. “I have one each for my husband and son, too. In summer I put in sun cream, in winter it’s coconut oil. If I’m going to need a lot of sun cream I buy more at the destination. Don’t travel with it.”2. Packing cubes: Palepu recommends packing cubes for compression – her favourites are by Gonex – so everything inside your luggage is compartmentalised. Pack like with like. Put all your chargers and wires in a pouch. Pick and choose between rolling and folding items: Palepu rolls most trousers, jeans, skirts inidually – and then secures each item with a hair band – but tends to folds shirts, because they have a collar. “But there is absolutely no wrinkle-free method for packing. It’s fabric! So I prioritise space in my luggage for a hand-held steamer, which works with an adapter. I have one that can adapt to every country’s sockets and also includes three USB ports. I bought it in some random airport years ago and haven’t blown anything up yet.”4. Get kids involved: “The sooner you get them helping you pack, the better. I never want to set an expectation that their mother does all of it,” says Palepu. I protest that involving my daughter means she will insist on bringing a full mermaid costume. “Say that you know she has to have the mermaid costume, but her swimming costume is more important, so we’ll pack all the things we need first, and then if we have room, we can add that one thing. Kids have fantasy pieces, too, and it’s good to honour that wish. It’s going to give them a little confidence about the holiday.” She recommends a CabinZero backpack that my child might be able to wear on her back.5. Underwear: Hitha’s formula is 1.5 x the number of days spent there for pants – so that’s 12 pairs for an eight-day trip. I’m confused – isn’t that too many? “If you’re going somewhere hot,” she says, “you might want to shower twice a day and put on a clean pair afterwards.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/757947aef21b44c24df774b40a4129fbdf7e7051/0_0_2350_1594/master/2350.jpg?w=660\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=d51b7e29f2e83ce0c9c37d9e6571a08d 1320w","title":"music aeterna teodor currentzis review prom 18 beethoven","story":"Royal Albert Hall, LondonIn his first prom, Teodor Currentzis, ever the showman, pushed his players until the Second and Fifth Symphonies sounded as radical as they must have when newTeodor Currentzis stalks on to the Albert Hall stage, kisses MusicAeterna’s leader, raises his arms, and … what do we hear? Beethoven. If you believed everything you read about Currentzis, the fact that we can instantly recognise the composer may come as a surprise. So much is made of his maverick nature, not to mention his fondness for making grand, mysterious statements (“I am a poet,” he declared in a recent interview), that it is almost a surprise to find him, in his first Prom, conducting something that comes out sounding familiar.Yet it is not the comfortable familiarity that breeds contempt. Throughout this all-Beethoven Prom – the Second and Fifth Symphonies, with the finale of the Seventh as encore – we get playing of an intensity that makes the music seem somehow Beethoven-plus more Beethoven than ever before. Currentzis is far from the only conductor to try to recapture what made great works shocking when they were new. Later this year, he takes on Stuttgart’s SWR Symphonieorchester, where he’ll work with musicians who grew up under Roger Norrington’s brand of quirky iconoclasm. But Currentzis is perhaps currently the most cannily charismatic. Not many could have persuaded an entire young orchestra to relocate 1,000 miles west from Novosibirsk to Perm, as Currentzis did with MusicAeterna in 2011, when his appointment as Artistic Director of the Perm Opera and Ballet Theatre was part of a cultural push in this former Soviet closed city. Nor could they have inspired such generosity from a record company as Currentzis has from Sony, which bankrolled extraordinarily long recording sessions for their three Mozart opera discs.  He is also one of the most thorough. The relative isolation of Perm, hundreds of miles from any of the world’s major classical music centres, means the musicians who choose to be there are fully invested in the orchestra. Currentzis demands their loyalty and their time, and gets both. He conducts the first minutes of the Symphony No 2 with a care that almost amounts to micromanagement of his players, but once the movement begins in earnest, the music takes flight. He sets a hurtling speed for all the fast movements, making no concession to the Albert Hall acoustic, but drawing out playing so crisply dynamic that it doesn’t seem to matter if some notes get lost in the space. The cellos introduce their first main theme almost under their breath, daring us to listen harder.Making the Symphony No 5 sound new is even more of a challenge but, again, while the shape of the work may be familiar, there are details that seize the attention: the way the descending sequence of longer notes near the end of the first movement seem to be trying to smooth out all those spiky figures that had gone before the proud rasp of the contrabassoon throughout the finale. The Seventh Symphony’s finale finds Currentzis with head down, fist pumping, as the chords thud past. But in a long, calmer passage he stops conducting and lets his musicians just play. There is no loss of momentum from the players, who are all, except the cellists, performing standing up, with a soloist’s flair.  Currentzis, of course, oozes flair – he’s a showman on and off the podium. But even if he is its captain, MusicAeterna is still essentially a team – and the real radicalism here was all Beethoven’s. •Available on BBC iPlayer. •The BBC Proms continue until 8 September.

Other ministers are also scheduled to go on trips.Downing Street will also make renewed overtures to local Conservative associations, after it emerged that seven party chairs in areas represented by cabinet ministers have expressed scepticism at May’s painstakingly drafted Chequers plans and associated white paper.Before May headed to northern Italy – where official photographs released on Sunday showed her strolling with her husband, Philip, by Lake Garda – she stopped off in Salzburg on Friday, as a guest of the Austrian chancellor, Sebastian Kurz.She also held talks in Austria with the Czech prime minister, Andrej Babiš, the Estonian prime minister, Jüri Ratas, and the president of Portugal, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa.No 10 has talked up the discussions as a success, notably the agreement by Kurz that an informal European Council meeting in September, mainly focused on immigration, will also talk about Brexit ahead of a key summit next month.The intention is to target politicians and voters in the inidual EU27 nations in the hope of persuading them to take an easier line than the bloc’ chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, who last week who seemed to dismiss the basis of May’s customs plan, a key plank of the Chequers proposal.“Those four meetings were all felt very positive,” a Downing Street source said. “They listened to the prime minister as she talked though the headlines of the white paper and engaged positively. And getting it to the informal European Council is going to be an important point for all European leaders to discuss that future relationship.”May also faces challenges closer to home after a series of local party chairs, among them the head of her own Maidenhead Conservative association, told the Sunday  they either opposed the Chequers proposals outright or would not back them if the prime minister had to make concessions to the EU.Richard Kellaway said a briefing on the proposals at Downing Street went down well among those present. But he told the : “I think we have reached the stage that if we don’t get a deal around these terms, then we’ll have to break away. If it were to be diluted it would ultimately not be acceptable.”Others were more outspoken. Patricia Soby, who chairs the Tory association in Torridge and west Devon, represented by the attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, told the paper: “This constituency conducted our own survey and practically everybody was against the Chequers deal.”Don Hammond, chair of the Conservative association in Tatton, represented by the work and pensions secretary, Esther McVey, said: “This is right at the limit of what I would consider to be a Brexit and I am distinctly unenthusiastic.”A customs union is an agreement by a group of countries, such as the EU, to all apply the same tariffs on imported goods from the rest of the world and, typically, eliminate them entirely for trade within the group. By doing this, they can help avoid the need for costly and time-consuming customs checks during trade between members of the union. Asian shipping containers arriving at Felixstowe or Rotterdam, for example, need only pass through customs once before their contents head to markets all over\u0026nbspEurope. Lorries passing between Dover and Calais avoid delay entirely.Customs are not the only checks that count – imports are also scrutinised for conformity with trading standards regulations and security and immigration purposes – but they do play an important role in determining how much friction there is at the border. A strict customs regime at Dover or between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland would lead to delays that will be costly for business and disruptive for travellers. Just-in-time supply chains in industries such as car making could suffer. An Irish peace process built around the principle of entirely unfettered travel between north and south could be jeopardised.There is acceptance within Downing Street that local party activists tend to be more heavily pro-leave, meaning some pushback is inevitable. More briefings are planned, however, in an attempt to reassure them.The biggest setback in recent days came on Thursday when Barnier said it was not possible for the UK to collect EU tariffs as a non-member.The EU “cannot and will not delegate the application of its customs policy and rules, VAT and duty collection to a non-member who would not be subject to the EU governance structures”, Barnier told a press conference alongside the Brexit secretary, Dominic Raab.Downing Street has sought to play down the apparent hostility, saying Barnier had been more positive in other areas, such as the planned backstop.“There is a chink in the Barnier armour. He’s the chief negotiator, you don’t expect him to come out with anything other than a tough line to start with,” the No 10 source said.With the Commons in recess until 4 September, May has some respite, but lingering disquiet is likely to peak at the Conservative party’s annual conference at the end of the month. Grassroots members and refusenik MPs are likely to make their feelings plain as speculation continues that she could face a leadership challenge."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8bd99d2533d0b6a90844aa81f98f3c1fc1b4601d/0_326_4612_2766/master/4612.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2f31e43b1caffd2adb76cf44c77757eb","title":"groundsmen look heavens nature keeps out sewer","story":"The intense heat has made pitch preparation problematic, and some drastic solutions were found in the summer of 1976It was around this time in the long, hot summer of 1976 that things were getting really desperate for the nation’s greenkeepers and groundsmen. It remains the hottest, driest summer on record, though one that this year is threatening to outdo, and it forced those in search of water to keep their well-tended turf alive to get creative.Exeter City drew up a plan to pour 10,000 gallons of treated sewage effluent on to the pitch. Torquay United trucked in waste water from a sewage works in Heathfield, and Brentford brought in 30,000 gallons from their local treatment plant. The only way the rugby league club New Hunslet could render the ground at their Elland Road Greyhound Stadium soft enough for a cup tie against Keighley to go ahead was to use a tanker full of water collected from a nearby car factory, which was contaminated with oil and “other waste materials”. “Tests on it show that it does not constitute a hazard to health,” wrote the Times, reassuringly.David Oxley, secretary of the Rugby League, said that though “this is traditionally a hard game for hard men”, playing it on hard ground would be one hard too many. “When it becomes parched and cracks open, that’s the danger point,” he said. “We have suggested that clubs might use purified sewage water, or any similar method. It is very much a local affair. Each club will have to decide for itself but having watched a game last Sunday when it looked more like a battlefield, I think the time is not far off when we shall be forced to call games off.”The Rugby Football Union and its Welsh equivalent both suggested that clubs should consider cancelling games if pitches remained parched. “We are leaving it to the common sense of the clubs,” a Welsh Rugby Union spokesman said, “but if they did come to us for advice I think we would have to say don’t play unless it rains.”’s Frank Keating spoke to the director of the Sports Turf Research Institute, John Escritt, whose advice to groundsmen was simple: “The first advice is to trust in the power of prayer – and if that doesn’t work, which it won’t, leave the grass long because it can then collect what bit of moisture there might be around at dawn.”At Cardiff Arms Park there was no need for prayer. Workmen had been laying the foundations of a new stand when the desperate groundsman, Bill Hardiman, pleaded with them to dig at the river end of the pitch to see if they found water. They did, just nine feet down, and again at the opposite end. From then on Hardiman sprayed his pitch for 12 hours a day. “I have had the water analysed and it is quite drinkable,” he said. “I drink it every day.”Tony Bell, now Middlesbrough’s head groundsman, was just a child in 1976. “I remember thinking it was fantastic,” he recalls. This year Bell and his team, named the best in the Championship last season, have had to cope with similar challenges. “We’ve had dry times before, but not as long as this, day after day after day,” he says. “Irrigation’s OK, but it doesn’t go on the same as rain. It’s never as even. You only need a breath of wind and it blows about. Some parts of the pitch are getting double what they need, others nothing at all.”Bell has several advantages over 1970s-era groundskeepers, including automatic irrigation sprinklers, moisture meters, consultant agronomists, and four decades’ worth of advances in turf science. Half the seed he laid this summer was tetraploid grass, a new, hardier, stronger kind of rye. He also has a borehole that provides plentiful water to the training ground. Yet still he has struggled. “Temperature has been the biggest challenge,” he says. “The heat basically forces us to put water on during the day just to keep the grass alive, but that also creates disease. We’ve had pythium blight, which is a warm-weather disease you very rarely get in this country. It’s devastating, it just makes the grass go strawlike. We had a lot of pitches that were severely knocked back, and they’re only just recovering now. Down south it’s been 30-odd degrees, which is far more challenging. Up here 21-22 is a normal summer, but 25-plus is a different ball game.”Christian Spring is UK research operations manager at the Sports Turf Research Institute, and was recently at Carnoustie to monitor playing conditions at the Open. “They’ve not had a huge amount of rain, certainly a lot less than they’re used to,” he says. “It’s been about managing the water reserves that they’ve got and trying to keep everything ticking over so it looks authentic, feels authentic but still plays well as a golf course. This year was an opportunity to hold an Open Championship in true summer conditions. It’s a different challenge. Overwatering can be just as bad as underwatering. As with all things in life, finding the right balance is difficult. The art of a groundsman is knowing when to back off and not be tempted to turn on the tap.”As this summer continues along its arid path, although this weekend’s rain has brought some relief, it is also about looking beseechingly at the heavens and hoping that at some point nature will take care of that job for you, and ideally before the borehole runs dry, the hosepipe bans kick in and you’re forced to put in a call to the sewage plant."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e058d61d4d5ff4367af9d9ccf583e47f16adef3b/0_118_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e62cb2ae0067d0b82d55a0571ab6f2ea","title":"kare adenegan world record wheelchair paralympian t34","story":"The custom-built £4,000 racing wheelchair that transported Kare\u0026nbspAdenegan to a world record in London earlier this month has been accorded a name of its own.“They used to be quite silly ones but now they mean a little bit more,” the 17-year-old giggles. Hence the latest model is called Karen, after her mum.“She’s been very supportive in everything I do,” her daughter attests. Years of ferrying her to training and track meetings are paying idends, with the promise of much more to come.Already a three-times Paralympic medallist before her 16th birthday, the bespectacled behemoth-in-the-making shattered the T34 100m best during the Anniversary Games, with her time of 16.80sec laying down a marker two years from Tokyo 2020.Another day, another athletic ambition fulfilled. Not bad for a girl who was banished to the sporting sidelines during the early part of her schooling in Coventry for fear that her cerebral palsy made her too great a risk to health and safety.“I’d have to do reading with other students or do slightly different activities,” Adenegan says. Frustrating and difficult at an age where the priority of most is to fit in rather than sit apart. “I don’t blame anyone,” she adds. “I think it was just down to a lack of understanding. Teachers don’t always know how to accommodate people with disabilities. It’s an education thing. Not anyone’s fault. Over time I think they will understand, especially with para sport being on television. They will understand more about what people with disabilities can actually do.”With knowledge comes power. For so many the London 2012 Paralympics pulled back the curtains on a troupe of superhumans, chair-bound figures such as Hannah Cockroft and David Weir who became overnight sensations with transformative effect.Adenegan was captivated by their speed and power. “I thought ‘wow, I want to be a part of this’.” She spun down to her local club, wheelchair at the ready, game for a go. “It was definitely a lot harder than I thought,” she admits. “It’s a very technical sport with a lot of elements to it, like the push technique. Initially, when I watched the Paralympics, I thought it looked easy, like pushing a day chair. But there’s so much to it.”She became the world No\u0026nbsp1 inside six years and the challenges keep coming thick and fast. Next month in Berlin she will chase a maiden European title but the next 12 months will bring the challenge of maintaining the upward trajectory while polishing off A-Levels in history, religious studies and\u0026nbspbiology.Twin ambitions demand sacrifices. It is school, homework, training, sleep and repeat. “It’s hard but it’s worthwhile,” she says. An ecosystem has been put in place to allow her to breathe and to offer every chance of avoiding the burnout that afflicts many who achieve so much so soon.“Debbie Flood, who is a rower, has been very supportive. I’ve been a member of an organisation called Christians in Sport and been mentored by them. I’ve also been mentored by a lot of athletes on the wheelchair side. Having people who have had those experiences, it’s been so beneficial to have that support from previous Paralympians, especially as a young athlete getting that encouragement.”Bright and eloquent, Adenegan is clearly heeding their counsel. Should she obtain a university spot, history will be her preferred subject and its totems her idols of choice. Recently she completed a school history project on Marcus Garvey, a leading figure in the development of pan‑African nationalism in the US who championed civil rights by promoting black‑owned\u0026nbspbusiness.“I was extremely inspired by him and the way that he managed to encourage people through the civil rights movement in the States,” she says. “A lot of people looked down on him – 1920s America is obviously very different to now, but the way he encouraged people to come together for a good cause was amazing.”Although Garvey died in exile in London, he remains lauded in his native Jamaica for constructive efforts against the odds and a refusal to accept restrictions and rejections. It is easy to see why his tale resonates with Adenegan.Despite capturing one of the records held by Cockroft – who has gone from being Adenegan’s heroine to competitive contemporary – Karen can expect to be pushed quicker still. “Obviously Tokyo is a huge goal so everything is really focused on that,” she says. “Whatever happens, I’ll be happy as long as I’ve done my best.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8ce5c4f8e6c0c7274558d615ba71087472529585/347_135_4615_2769/master/4615.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d7c63dbb6194b538d3aab482123f3d80","title":"lewis hamilton f1 hungarian grand prix sebastian vettel","story":"Temperatures may have soared at the Hungarian Grand Prix but Lewis Hamilton and Mercedes ensured cool heads prevailed as the British driver took a win that takes him into Formula One’s summer break in excellent shape. The victory, a command performance in the natural amphitheatre of the Hungaroring, puts him 24 points clear of his title rival, Ferrari’s Sebastian Vettel, and intriguingly in a strong position to buck Hungary’s trend, that has stood for more than a decade, of auguring ill for the winner.Hamilton won with a dominant run, after he had done the hard work by putting his car on pole in treacherous, wet conditions on Saturday. His lap had been a masterclass and he and Mercedes exploited their advantage on a circuit where overtaking is exceptionally difficult while the track reached temperatures as high as 60C. He led from the front and despite Ferrari’s best efforts to attempt a tyre strategy to counter their rivals, second for Vettel, from fourth on the grid, was the best they could have managed.With four world championships under his belt, Hamilton is in a toe-to-toe fight with Vettel to become the first of the pair to equal Juan Manuel Fangio and win five. He is one step closer with victory at a track he can truly claim as his own. He now has six wins in Hungary and is the most successful driver at the race. He has won exactly half of the meetings he has contested here, a remarkable feat but has never go on to take the title after victory. Indeed, no driver has gone on to win the championship after taking the flag here since Michael Schumacher in 2004.Hamilton’s 67th career win and his fifth of the season means he enters the title run-in in a strong position to finally claim Hungary and the title. He now has daylight between himself and Vettel, with a lead that is almost more than a DNF over the German. The lead has changed hands six times between the two this season but this is the largest gap either has held so far.Hamilton was unsurprisingly pleased with the result at a track where Mercedes have been third fastest to Ferrari and Red Bull all weekend except in qualifying. Their car is ill-suited to the slow and medium-speed corners of the Hungaroring but they executed their plans to perfection.Vettel was sanguine that it was the best he could have achieved but he goes into the break ruing the error that ended his race in Germany. Kimi Räikkönen finished in third, no mean feat given he had to complete the 70 laps, which took place at 33C, with his drink bottle disconnected and thus unable to take on any fluid.The race had been unspectacular, if not easy for Hamilton and the crucial moment came at the start. Having held his lead for a one-two with teammate Valtteri Bottas on the opening lap, he was able to dictate the race. He had opened on the quickest ultra-soft tyres, where Ferrari opted to try Vettel on the harder, soft rubber. Looking for him to go long and attack Hamilton on fresh tyres at the end.Vettel made a place up on lap one, passing Räikkönen for third round the outside of turn two and the race strategies became clear. With Hamilton pitting for the soft rubber on lap 25, Vettel tried to make up time in clean air and jump Bottas for second through his stop. He appeared to have done it but for late traffic and then a poor stop from Ferrari. Pitting on lap\u0026nbsp39 a problem with the front left was costly, the stop took 4.5sec and Vettel emerged behind Bottas.Ferrari’s gamble to catch Hamilton had failed and even second looked some way off. Hamilton, now back in the lead, had an 8sec gap up front and Vettel could make no impact on the Finn. He stuck at it however and finally, with his fresher rubber making the difference passed Bottas on lap 65. But Hamilton was long gone.His lead at the end was 17sec, unthinkable after the weekend’s early running and a huge result for Mercedes. To have taken the maximum from one of the three circuits at which they are weakest (alongside Monaco and Singapore) is a major result. It gives Hamilton who traditionally ends the season strongly, the points and the momentum, having definitively applied the heat to Vettel in Hungary.His teammate Bottas took damage to the front wing, clipping Vettel after the German had passed him and subsequently lost a place to Red Bull’s Daniel Ricciardo. Bottas hit the Australian as he passed and was given a ten-second penalty after the race. Ricciardo finished in fourth and Bottas remained in fifth despite the penalty.Fernando Alonso managed to come home in eighth place for McLaren on his 37th birthday. The Toro Rosso of Pierre Gasly was in sixth place. Kevin Magnussen in the Haas was seventh, with his teammate Romain Grosjean tenth. Carlos Sainz in the Renault was ninth."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2127a80dcbf7161d016fa97e939fd74d1197f2af/197_586_3203_1922/master/3203.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8fb9b4c3adc69a2dea134d96cfc45eb3","title":"digitalising democratic party jessica alter tech for campaigns","story":"After hi-tech won Trump the presidency, Jessica Alter wanted to put the Democrats on a stronger footing. She shares what she has learnedJessica Alter is the co-founder of Tech for Campaigns, a 7,000-strong volunteer organisation that enables Silicon Valley employees to use their digital skills to help Democratic election candidates. “The aim is to become a permanent digital arm for progressive and centrist campaigns, and give access to campaigns at any level to the people, technology and resources they need,” she says.What led you to start Tech for Campaigns. Was it the aftermath of the 2016 election? It was the aftermath of the Muslim travel ban. I had been travelling during the election and returned around the time of the inauguration and, within a week, the ban was announced. I had already been very bothered but that really pushed me over the edge and I wanted a way to feel as if I was doing something that made a real impact. When you think about that, you think: what do I have to offer? I understand tech and digital, and I know a lot of other people who do, too. I reached out to my co-founder Pete Kazanjy and we decided to find out if our friends would be interested in something like this. And they were, and that’s how it started.Did you feel Hillary Clinton’s campaign wasn’t firing on all cylinders, digitally? I just felt that, in general, the mindset of the Trump campaign was very different. Much more iterative, tech-driven – it was inspired by a digital mindset. They didn’t go in with a ton of preconceived notions, they seemed open to the idea that you can learn a lot quickly from the data and test a lot of things quickly.So the Trump campaign was working like a startup? I don’t know if the whole campaign was, but, from what I had heard, I felt that digital was being run with that mindset. I’m not saying that we should all have content farms, but that is a lot of what they did. So are you trying to fill that void? We’re trying to start not from the top, but start from campaigns that are ignored and meet their needs first. And we’re trying to be a sustainable digital arm. What happens in politics is that most of the tech is thrown away after a campaign. We are trying to build tools that are longer lasting and shared.How do you help candidates? It really ranges from basics, such as websites and digital identity, to marketing and analytics, to running paid digital for them, to more complex data science. We try to build software that can be applied to many campaigns.Do you have any sense of how many points you can add to a candidate’s vote? Nobody really knows. We can certainly look at campaign data en masse once the midterms happen. Everyone is looking for a panacea, but there’s not one thing that is a secret weapon for every campaign. We don’t go in saying that digital will be the thing that makes you win. We go in saying that people spend six and a half hours a day on a digital screen and you have to be there. Was campaign money previously spent on TV and leafleting? Not previously still. We’re helping them to change the mix. We can help educate them, explain what’s possible, help them test it and give them the talent to do it. Can you tell whether a particular inidual has voted? How granular can you go? We can tell if people have voted, but it takes a couple of months after the election. To prove causation is very difficult at best you can prove correlation.How is encouraging somebody to vote in a particular way different to persuading them to buy a holiday or take a loan? Voting is often a bit more emotional, but not necessarily that different. You have to get them on an interaction curve knowing what the product is before asking them to buy. In that way it’s very similar. You don’t just message them saying: “Hey, do you want to buy this?” You explain to them why it’s good first.What about politicians themselves? Since 2016, people who never thought they would run are raising their hand. I am really encouraged – there are people who really want to make a difference. The silver lining of what happened is a lot of new people want to be involved. Are there particular sectors or demographics that are difficult to reach digitally or are hard to convert into votes? It’s well known that it is harder to get young people to vote. If voting was digital, probably not, but you have to get them to go to a polling place or do a mail-in ballot, which they’ve never heard of. They are certainly online and it’s a great place to reach them, but they are a much more discerning audience, as they’ve grown up there – they want it to feel authentic they know how to spot an ad.Do you have any advice for the president about his Twitter account? That’s not an area I want to wade into. And I’m pretty sure he wouldn’t listen to my advice anyway."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7bb3822204295bf30654705386446105b713924a/761_1098_3910_2346/master/3910.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d1a5717857a6e36499cdf3edc62aa916","title":"natural cycles asa investigates marketing for contraception app","story":"Advertising watchdog launches formal investigation over description of productThe Advertising Standards Authority has launched a formal investigation into marketing for a Swedish app that claims to be an effective method of contraception, after reports that women have become pregnant while using it.An ASA spokesman said it had received three complaints about Natural Cycles and its paid advertising on Facebook, which describes the app as highly accurate contraception that has been clinically tested.“We would require robust substantiation from any company to support such a claim,” he said.A spokesperson for Natural Cycles confirmed the investigation, but said it related to a 2017 ad and that it had accepted the ASA’s draft recommendations.Natural Cycles is also being investigated in Sweden by the Medical Products Agency after it emerged that of 668 women who sought an abortion at a Stockholm hospital between September and December last year, 37 had been using the app for birth control.The UK statistics are unknown, but one user wrote in the  that she had become pregnant and had an abortion after relying on the app to indicate the days when she could not conceive. The Family Planning Association is also concerned about the app. A spokeswoman said: “The use of the word ‘certified’ suggests that there is independent evidence supporting these claims, whereas in fact the only evidence is from the company itself. It has amassed a vast database, which is very interesting, but that is not the same as verified independent evidence.“Many other apps focus on getting to know your own body, but Natural Cycles is specifically targeting itself as a contraceptive, which is concerning.”The app’s promotion as a natural means of birth control was attractive to many women worried about taking hormones, but the association’s concern was that a generation which has come to believe there is an app for everything may be over-reliant on it without realising how motivated and disciplined users have to be to make it effective, she said. The app was developed by two scientists from Sweden and Austria: Elina Berglund, who worked at the Cern laboratory in Geneva on the discovery of the Higgs Boson particle, and Raoul Scherwitzl. The married couple originally devised the algorithm for their own family planning, and now both work full time for the company they founded. They claim to have 600,000 users worldwide, who pay an annual subscription. Users monitor their fertility with the app by taking their temperature each morning. It tracks the results to detect ovulation, and advises which days are safe or unsafe to have unprotected sex without the risk of conception. The app relies on users taking their temperature at around the same time every morning, and cautions: “Remember that you must always measure as soon as you wake up before you snooze, sitget up, or check your phone.”The Facebook page is full of tributes from users, and one woman has posted the launch of a petition against any possibility of the app being banned in Sweden following the Medical Product Agency’s investigation.A spokeswoman for Natural Cycles said: “We are in contact with the ASA and, since the investigation is ongoing, it would not be appropriate for us to speculate on the outcome. “We can confirm however, that the ASA complaint in relation to the Facebook advertisement in question was actually raised in 2017. The advertisement which only ran for a few weeks has been taken out of circulation and we have accepted the draft recommendations very recently shared with us by the ASA.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5aa5bfbf2c393cb4f28791ac59d2271250b43110/0_382_5976_3584/master/5976.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3f46ea640169081e38f51a3555f5be96","title":"the five wikipedia biases pro western male dominated","story":"A 2011 paper reviewed thousands of Wikipedia articles and found that, although most articles were accurate, recent events received \\the most coverage.

Here, she talks hard work, family troubles, and hosting MTV’s answer to Love IslandMaya Jama has wanted to be famous before she even knew what she might be famous for. The 23-year-old TV and radio presenter admits that she couldn’t sing – “as much as I wish I could, being a popstar was completely out of it” – and after a string of auditions as a teenager, realised that acting wasn’t her bag because despite “almost making it on to Skins”, she was only ever playing “Extreme Maya or Angry Maya or whatever”.But Jama had energy and “life goals” – and one by one, she has been ticking them off at such rapid speed that it makes her physically squeal, the human equivalent of the “omg skjhskjhlslhjk” text from a best friend with good news.“It’s amazing!” she says as she whirls into the offices of MTV in a bright orange dress, bright green jacket and new, bright blond hair, carrying a double delivery of fish and chips. She has stopped to take a picture of the promotional cardboard cutouts for her new MTV show True Love or True Lies?, excited to be presenting her “first proper reality show” solo. Despite claims that it’s a completely different concept, the station has Jama hosting a reconfiguration of the format set by Love Island: hot couples, some real and some fake, living in a luxury Tuscan villa, competing to win a prize for the most “real” relationship. Danny Dyer is providing the voiceover, the gritty\u0026nbspgeezer offset to Jama’s boundless enthusiasm.“The whole point is to come after\u0026nbspLove Island – which is incredible,” she explains, “but we’re aiming to fill that gap, fill that void after it ends.” Unlike ITV2’s summer hit, there are “gay people in there, lesbians, trans, an everyday crowd mix of people. And it’s a complete headfuck,” she says through delicate\u0026nbspmouthfuls of fish and chips.\u0026nbsp“It’s like, everyone’s relationship is so different and not everyone’s lovey-dovey and kissing every five minutes. Sometimes, when you’re really in love, you’re not that touchy-feely because you’ve lived together for a few years and you don’t need to kiss every two seconds.”Technically, Jama is talking about the show, but equally, it’s a pointed two fingers to the tabloids that have been snidely speculating about the demise of her own relationship for months now. Jama is also girlfriend to Stormzy, Britain’s biggest-selling grime artist, major league popstar and Croydon’s most famous Corbyn supporter. “I was presenting before I met him,” she says with emphasis. “We have a relationship that people care about, but we both have our jobs and it is what it is. I try\u0026nbspto ignore what everyone has to say or write about it and move on.”Jama’s career has been up and coming for several years now, but her arrival has been swift. She left home in Bristol at 16 to make it in London and after years of doing bits and pieces – a show on Rinse FM, a presenting gig on an unknown sports channel – “one of the ones that pop up when you go really far down the list” – work on MTV – the last year has been about mass exposure.She has ticked off presenting an ITV gameshow (Cannonball), serious Channel 5 documentaries, stints on daytime TV (Good Morning Britain Loose Women), hosting the Mobos and landing her very own Radio 1 gig (in February, she started hosting the Saturday morning Greatest Hits show, and co-hosting Friday afternoons with Scott Mills). She has been plastered on billboards, first with modelling campaigns for Maybelline and Adidas, then with her own fast-fashion line with Pretty Little Thing. She has a podcast – “in the iTunes top 10!” – hosted by lingerie company Freya, neatly titled When Life Gives You Melons, and has an eye on developing her own chat show by “speaking it into existence”. She’s not un-busy.Jama is also unquestionably stunning. The kind that compels the camera and had Stormzy interrupt his usually music-heavy Instagram feed to post a photo of her on a knickers shoot with a caption that simply read: “Sorry, but”.Does she worry about saying no to work, in case her moment\u0026nbsppasses?“No, not at all”. She pauses. “Well, last year felt a bit like that, maybe more the year before. I know a lot of people didn’t take me that seriously and I really wanted to prove myself and show that I have worked really hard to be here – I’m not some girl they just found on Instagram.”She began her career uploading videos of herself on YouTube and has always been big across “the socials” – Snapchat, Instagram, Twitter. She ran into trouble with the latter a few months ago, when tweets she posted at 18 about “dark skin bitches” resurfaced. She does not want to talk about it – she was\u0026nbspmortified and apologised twice\u0026nbspover – and would rather talk about anything else, including her violent father, who she decided to break contact with when she was 12.“With him, I feel like it’s too little, too late in the saddest way,” she says. “I would have loved a relationship with him but it doesn’t come naturally right now. I don’t feel like reaching out to him really, and I suppose it would be different if I saw him get a proper job and sort himself out.”Jama, who is of Swedish-Somali heritage, has been watching her dad go in and out of prison her whole life. Her father has a record for violent crime, which partly prompted her to make When Dads Kill, a bleak documentary for Channel 5 in which she interviewed survivors of terrible trauma. Even her publicist admits to me earlier that the programme “wasn’t as profound” as they might have hoped – Jama’s journey didn’t end with her meeting her own father, nor was there any neat resolution. “I don’t want to get close to someone who will just fall back in the same pattern,” she says warily. “It’s such an effort – it’s like, ‘you’re an adult, come on, sort yourself out’.”She’s not sure how much the situation has affected her. “If you’d asked me at school, I would have been, like, ‘Eurgh! I don’t notice it at all, I’m fine, I don’t feel any absence.’ But as an adult you think: ‘Mmm, maybe there are little signs of my behaviour that\u0026nbspcame from his actions?’ Like, the kind of man I look for\u0026nbspis something so different to what my dad is. And maybe\u0026nbspmy independence and\u0026nbspdo-it-yourself vibe could\u0026nbspcome from him not being around.”Still, Jama says she gets\u0026nbspanxious, and Stormzy has spoken\u0026nbsppublicly about dealing with depression. “My anxiety comes from people watching me more and knowing more about me,” she\u0026nbsplaughs. “But the feeling of entering a room where you don’t know anyone but you feel like everyone’s talking about you, that alone is…” Jama mugs a pained ‘aargh’. “It’s like\u0026nbspgetting on a train and not knowing if someone’s trying to take a sneaky picture.”Stormzy, she says, is “really good\u0026nbspwith it, because you can just do\u0026nbspyour music and disappear, you don’t have to go to events and do lots of public speaking, you let the music speak for itself”. And although, she says, “he’s on a way bigger scale on a fame level, I’m more exposed to everyday interactions and just putting myself out there. I’m always talking – my voice is constantly out there.” She exhales a cartoon sigh.So what makes her angry? “Yeah, I’m not really political, I’m not gonna lie,” she says, holding up a hand. “I don’t get too involved in it, I don’t really watch the news.” Being downbeat isn’t part of Jama’s brand, I suggest. “Well, I think the world’s a bit fucked up and there is so much going on, but I try not to go too much into it because it’s just going to get me in a bad mood.”True Love or True Lies premieres at 9pm, Monday 6 August, on MTV"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/69088abc0664bd8ee159fe004e0e3c99203655ca/0_2319_4050_2430/master/4050.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cca5a96a5ad82b93be75625040544d95","title":"succession comedy drama tv media barons jesse armstrong","story":"Screenwriter Jesse Armstrong skewered political spin doctors. His new comedy drama targets media’s ultimate players: America’s rich and powerful TV barons. But don’t think it’s about the MurdochsAn ageing and cantankerous media billionaire is living in New York with his third wife, surrounded by a brood of children and hangers-on who spend their time squabbling over who will inherit the family conglomerate. Desperate to win the favour of their foul-mouthed father, the offspring spend their time taking over online startups and arriving at family gatherings in helicopters – anything they can think of to impress the mogul.So far, so familiar. But Jesse Armstrong would like to make it absolutely clear that Succession, the writer’s new big-budget drama series, is definitely not about a certain Australian-born media magnate. “It’s not bullshit to say it really isn’t the Murdochs,” says Armstrong, who previously wrote an unproduced film script about Rupert Murdoch and his family. Instead, he suggests that such a comparison might be the result of there being a relative lack of high-profile media barons in the UK. “It could be a parochial view – that because it’s a media family, it must be the Murdochs.”What is clear is that the 10-part series, which aired in the US on HBO earlier this year and combines sweary comedy with high-stakes drama, plays into the increased fascination with how global businesses shape our media consumption – and thereby our politics.In the opening episode, the ailing 80-year-old Dundee-born Logan Roy – played by Brian Cox – toys with his children’s desire to take control. Anointed heir Kendall bounds into a skyscraper listening to Beastie Boys – perhaps a nod to James Murdoch’s brief career running a pioneering New York hip-hop record label after dropping out of Harvard. Kendall is trying to clinch a deal to take over a Vice-style startup, while being taunted by aides who ask if he wants to phone his father for help. Then misfortune strikes at a family party.When it becomes clear that the succession isn’t going to plan, Kendall’s three siblings – Connor, Roman and Shiv – begin circling, setting up a series of conflicts in which each compete for control. While the offspring seem detached from reality and are prone to preposterous outbursts, they also have the same weaknesses, the same desire to be loved, as any other inidual.“They’re human beings,” says Armstrong, “and they’ve been given a set of values. As someone who comes from a super-famous dynasty, how do you escape that? It’s not a situation everyone is going to feel is tragic. Some people will just feel, ‘Fuck them – they’ve got so much money and power.’ But if you care to think about it, this is also a form of a tragic situation.”Armstrong’s dialogue is sharp and vicious. In the first episode, Shiv’s partner Tom sums up the family’s attitude to money, after spending thousands on a gift for Logan, a luxury watch that will soon be discarded by the billionaire. “Every time you look at it,” says Tom, “it tells you exactly how rich you are.” Later, a doctor treating Logan is given the warning: “The socioeconomic health of several countries is dependent on his well-being.”In the world of US TV, which is the wealthiest media market on the planet, the Murdoch dynasty is far from alone. America’s biggest companies are often controlled by a single family, meaning the stakes are higher and the sibling rivalries more vicious. Armstrong mentions the Sinclairs, a Trump-friendly right-wing family “who are buying up the majority of local TV stations where most Americans get their news”. Then there’s the likes of Sumner Redstone, who controls CBS and Viacom. The ailing 95-year-old, who has had a long-running dispute with his daughter, as well as multiple substantially younger ex-girlfriends, over who should inherit his fortune, now lives the life of a decadent recluse in his LA mansion. One recent report claimed he now communicates through an iPad loaded with audio clips of his voice saying “Yes”, “No” and “Fuck you.” As Armstrong says: “The Redstone stuff is either tragic or good – depending on whether you’re a human being or a writer.”Another influence is the Roberts family, who control Comcast, the US cable TV giant that owns the NBC network and is currently fighting Rupert Murdoch in a multi-billion-pound battle to take ownership of the highly profitable Sky TV. Just to confuse matters further, Succession will be shown in the UK on Sky Atlantic, which will mean that a certain media billionaire could do quite well if the show is a success. It’s also just the sort of big-budget quality TV show that audiences might be willing to pay to watch, helping to prompt the very deals the show is satirising.“We had a lot of places to steal from in terms of dynastic politics and family dysfunction,” says Armstrong, who says humour is what lifts the show from boardroom drama to something that captures the chaotic reality of life in a multi-billion-dollar media empire. “If you left out the comic element, the petty bad decisions, the crappy corporate structure, the shitty artistic choices, the humiliations – then you’d be doing PR for them. Comedy has to be part of how you portray these people.”The show also reflects on how the world got into its current state, with Donald Trump in the White House. “If you’re interested in the fucked-up state of American politics,” says Armstrong, “you don’t have to be a supersleuth to figure out that the media climate has been key in creating that.”Succession represents a career high for Armstrong, with HBO not only backing it but already booking a second series. The show, which has Will Ferrell as executive producer, launches Armstrong into the big league of US television, where the budgets are bigger and the stakes higher. Not bad for a man who began his working life in the mid-1990s with a brief stint as a researcher for a Labour MP. He soon turned to comedy, working with Sam Bain to create Peep Show, before Armando Iannucci put the pair to work on The Thick of It.The latter, which took a hilarious swipe at the inner workings of government, has had an enormous influence on British political culture – though not in an entirely positive way. Many of today’s twenty- and thirtysomething political journalists and advisers use the show as a primer for a day at the office. As a result, it’s often said in parliament that the only difference between the programme and modern Westminster is that in The Thick of It, people don’t wander around muttering: “This is like something out of The Thick of It.” When journalists were texting Jeremy Corbyn’s team during the attempted Labour coup of 2016, one reply confirmed that the Labour leader would contest any leadership election – by using a quote from the show’s foul-mouthed spin doctor Malcolm Tucker. “It’s on like Fat Pat’s thong,” the text said.“You can’t control how things that you’re involved with are received,” says Armstrong. “But The Thick of It wasn’t intended as an instruction manual. Writers like hearing how bits of this stuff have got out into the world – but it was not meant to be a joyful celebration of the way these people behave.”He has no immediate plans to return to the world of British political satire. And, despite writing for Veep, which starred Julia Louis-Dreyfus as the US vice-president, Armstrong has no intention of working on a show about Donald Trump. Anyway, he says, the supporting characters around a leader are often more interesting than the boss.“Trump is just extraordinarily unusual,” he says. “He’s a different target, a different figure. I don’t buy the thing that you can’t do satire in the age of Trump. You just have to be funny and figure out the angles. If I was going to do Trump, I wouldn’t take it head on and look directly at the sun.”Brian Cox has drawn comparisons between Logan Roy and King Lear, a notion Armstrong picks up on, talking about the fascinating moment when a leader chooses how to distribute his vast power. “There’s a reason we have a lot of pomp and ceremony around coronations and the transfer of power in democracies,” he says. “It’s a scary moment. The rules aren’t clear. For a moment – whether it’s the Roman empire or Florida at the Bush recount – anything can happen.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d8673eb2ee57332ed76ef341bb3b98fde03151b6/0_66_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4a78cbbb2cd1d60ef5ec5a385eb47ff9","title":"andrew morris texas british politician immigration","story":"Andrew Morris, 32, says his first-hand experience of US immigration and universal healthcare can help him win listenersTexas is traditionally portrayed as a fiercely patriotic state. The kind of state that revels in all-American, conservative politicians. On the face, it doesn’t seem the sort of place where a liberal British politician could win office.But Andrew Morris, a 32-year-old originally from Yorkshire, is bidding to do just that.Morris, who moved to Texas 10 years ago, is running for a seat in the state’s House of Representatives. He’s retained his northern English accent – if it has developed a slight transatlantic lilt – and he says that makes him a curiosity when he turns up on doorsteps making his progressive pitch for more school funding, more investment in healthcare, and higher public sector wages.“I think it captures people’s attention a little more because they want to hear what this strange-sounding guy has to say,” Morris says.“I make it part of my pitch – I just make a joke about it. I go off on a segue about how I’m possibly more patriotic than a lot of my audience because I chose to move here, and who else in the audience can say that kind of thing?”Morris was born in Rotherham before moving to Warrington and later Brighton, following his father’s career. When he was 17, the family moved to Australia, and it was there that he struck up a pen-pal correspondence with his now wife, a native Texan. In 2008, Morris moved to Texas on a student visa, and he became a passport-holding citizen two years ago.As an immigrant himself, he is not afraid to talk about a more inclusive approach to immigration and undocumented immigrants – which is anathema to many in the south.His background, however, sometimes means people are more receptive to his ideas.“Hearing from someone who has gone through the immigration process, they are really open and really curious about what I think of the whole situation,” Morris says.“I have some insight into how expensive it is, how long it is and how opaque of a process it can be. I have a sense about the challenges that immigration reform entails.”Morris co-founded a group backing Bernie Sanders during the Vermont senator’s run for president, and he is running as a progressive in Texas House district 64. One of the things he will be able to focus on as a state representative is education: specifically classroom size and teachers’ pay. Another area Morris says he is particularly able to speak to is healthcare. He is a proponent of Medicare-for-all – which would provide free healthcare to everyone in the US – and says his first-hand experience of living in countries with universal healthcare helps him allay people’s suspicions.“There’s no reason why the US, with all of their riches and all of the opportunities that it has, should trail everyone else among the most economically developed countries in the world. Nowhere else do you become bankrupt because of a medical condition,” Morris says.“I use my experiences in the UK and Australia to show that the level of rhetoric, especially from the conservative side of the political spectrum, isn’t based in any sort of reality.”“There are more Democrats than Republicans. But what I saw in previous cycles was that the Democratic candidate didn’t really run a campaign or organize effectively,” Morris said.“That’s what going to be different about this cycle – the energy and enthusiasm that a lot of people have, especially because of the current White House occupant. There’s something different about this cycle that will encourage more Democrats to come out.”If Morris does win, he’ll serve a two-year term in the Texas state house in Austin alongside 149 other representatives. At a time where there is tension between the US and the UK, perhaps a Brit in Texas could help to repair relations a little."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3580061.1532889226!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"continuous rise in skellig michael visitors alarms heritage group","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA file image of Skellig Michael, the Unesco World Heritage Site  off the  Co Kerry coast. File photograph: Getty.A heritage group has expressed concern about a “continuous rise” in the number of people visiting Skellig Michael, the sixth century monastic island off the Co Kerry coast. The popularity of the Unesco World Heritage site, considered one of the greatest remote scenes of early Christendom, has increased since it appeared in the Star Wars film series and due to the numbers pursuing the Wild Atlantic Way tourism route. Skellig Michael is open to visitors, who must travel there by boat, between mid-May and September 30th. An Taisce’s Charles Stanley-Smith said the island was visited by 16,755 people last year, some 5,000 more than in 2015, and that this was far in excess of the suggested 11,000 included in a management plan presented to Unesco in 2008.He said there was “a continuous rise in numbers of people on what is a fragile and unique site” and that by July 5th of this year, almost 7,000 people had landed there. The Office of Public Works (OPW) said the visitor numbers fall “within the range of what is recognised as acceptable and sustainable”. It said the numbers are constantly monitoring and reported to Unesco.Skellig Michael cost the OPW €510,000 to run last year but brought in no direct income for the State. Ten people were employed by the OPW in relation the island - five resident guides, three masons, who look after the dry stone steps and beehive structures, and two general operatives. Licensed boat operators charge between €85 and €100 per person to bring visitors to the island, with the 11.5km journey taking about 45 minutes. Visitors generally stay for 2½ hours. Fifteen 12-seater boats serve the island under a permit system, which are tendered for annually. The OPW said no permit fees apply to the boat operators and it does not collect a fee from visitors.

Photograph:  StringerReutersA weakening of major ocean currents in the Northern Atlantic, including the Gulf Stream that warms Ireland, could trigger a sudden change to Ireland’s climate that could last for two decades, Irish scientists have warned.Rather than leading to a period of cooling, however, it could result in rapid temperature increases across the country, according to the Maynooth University team.Such changes could have disastrous outcomes for the global climate and make the urgent need to deal with climate change more difficult, the team declares, in research published by the journal Nature.The North Atlantic Ocean’s circulation system, responsible for Ireland’s relatively mild climate, has weakened, and is expected to weaken further in coming decades with potentially devastating consequences.Strong ocean circulation has traditionally been associated with higher temperatures and sluggish circulation with cooler temperatures, but new research is challenging that view.Dr Gerard McCarthy and Prof Peter Thorne of Maynooth’s Irish Climate Analysis and Research Units (ICARUS) analysed research by Professors Xianyao Chen of the Ocean University of China and Ka-Kit Tung of the University of Washington.The research investigated ocean currents called the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) where warm water flows northwards on the surface with a southward flow of colder, deeper waters.The best-known of these currents in Ireland is the Gulf Stream, which has long been widely recognised as protecting Ireland from extreme weather and giving the country its famous wet and mild climate.Globally, the AMOC has been seen as a vigorous force associated with elevated surface temperatures across the Atlantic, but the new research highlights its role in storing heat in the deep ocean”.The AMOC is now at its weakest in at least 1,600 years. Past AMOC changes have been associated with abrupt climate changes. Global surface temperatures rose steadily from 1975 to 1998, but growth then slowed for 15 years.Between 2014 and 2017, however, the world has experienced the four warmest years on record: “Interest in this hiatus and what caused it has, therefore, waned considerably,” Dr McCarthy explained.However, climate change is a complex response to slowly-varying external factors, so “it is essential to re-examine and try to fully understand previous climate behaviour and its underlying causes”, say the Irish duo.The Chinese research may hold the key to explaining this hiatus, and that understanding the mechanics behind it can help us prepare for future climate change.Atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases are increasing at an unprecedented rate, something which is widely understood as driving global warming.Chen and Tung argue that half of the heat arising from such gases is stored in the deep waters of the North Atlantic when the AMOC is strong, which reduces overall global warming.The 19751998 lull, when the AMOC was robust and strengthening, may explain the reduction in global warming that took place because it was “so effectively” able to transfer heat deep into the ocean, Dr McCarthy said.Now, however, the AMOC will “very likely” weaken in coming decades. Indeed, the Atlantic has seen muted rises in surface temperatures relative to the global ocean over the past few decades.Scientists have already observed that the AMOC is weakened and that “the Atlantic is surprisingly cold suggesting that it is not effectively storing heat in its lower levels”.If rapid global surface warming on sea and land results, this could “have disastrous outcomes for the global climate and make navigating the challenges of global climate change even more difficult”, Dr McCarthy added."},{"url":null,"title":"ireland s first trans pride parade takes place in dublin","story":"  July 28, 2018Participants call for improved healthcare and criticise Dublin Pride as \u0026lsquomarketing tool\u0026rsquo "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3579935.1532881592!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ban gambling advertising in sport suggests president higgins","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPresident  Michael D Higgins acknowledges the crowd during the GAA Hurling All-Ireland Senior Championship Semi-Final at Croke Park, Dublin, on Saturday, resulting in a draw between Galway and Clare. He has also attended the Cork-Limerick hurling semi-final on Sunday. Photograph: Tommy DicksonInphoPresident Michael D Higgins has said he is troubled over the issue of gambling in sport – and that gambling platforms should not be allowed access to advertising in sports.The President said: “If I had my way, I wouldn’t have advertising or any access to gambling platforms in sport at all. I really worry when I read the cases.”By convention, the president of Ireland does not intervene in policy matters such as gambling, so Mr Higgins’s intervention is likely to raise eyebrows – especially with a presidential election looming in the autumn.The President referenced a recent visit to a treatment centre in Co Mayo where he drew attention to the amount of advertising for gambling websites that is broadcast during TV sports programmes.“I visited the Hope House in Mayo recently who have been a great assistance to some people who have got over what is, hopefully, a terrible temporary problem.“I think in a way we should protect our sports of keeping them free from this kind of stuff,” he said.“We need to protect our sports more,” he said, repeating his concerns about the influence of gambling.He referred to the need for more education about the dangers of gambling, but added “You can’t do everything through education”. “I just think it should be protected from it. There is no one being heavy about it. What you can do is through education obviously, through the school systems.“As well as that, we do need, and it’s not for me as President as I’m no influence except to say what I think, is that the integrity of sport means having care for everyone who participates,” Mr Higgins said.“Having care for everyone who participates means not exposing them when in fact they are vulnerable. How you deal with vulnerabilities is by preparing them of course.“But you can’t do everything through education. For too long in Ireland we often ignore problems that are staring us in the face,” he said.A long-awaited Bill to regulate gambling, the Gambling Control Bill, is still being prepared by the Department of Justice – five years after the then government approved its general scheme.

Photograph: Kerstin JoenssonAP. British prime minister Theresa May has received a boost after Austria agreed that Brexit would be among the topics for discussion at an informal meeting of EU leaders.Downing Street said Austria’s chancellor Sebastian Kurz had agreed that Britain’s departure from the EU would be on the agenda for the European Council being hosted by his country, which currently holds the EU presidency, on September 20th.It means that Ms May has an extra opportunity to discuss Brexit with leaders of the EU 27 and to convince them to support her plan after a week in which ministers have been deployed to various capitals to woo senior politicians.The next meeting will be a gathering of EU leaders in Brussels in October, by which time it is been hoped a final Brexit deal will be hammered out.Ms May was dealt a blow by Brussels on Thursday as its chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, rejected the customs proposals that form a key plank of her White Paper.A Downing Street spokesman said: “Following their dinner at Downing Street three weeks earlier, the prime minister and Austrian chancellor Sebastian Kurz had a positive conversation ahead of the Salzburg Festival.“The prime minister updated on the White Paper, and chancellor Kurz confirmed that Brexit would be on the agenda for the informal European Council which Austria would host on September 20th.”Ms May also pitched her deal planning to her Czech and Estonian counterparts, Andrej Babis and Juri Ratas, during talks at the Salzburg Festival. She attended the music event before heading off to Italy for the start of her summer holidays.Ahead of their meeting, Mr Kurz said it was important to “avoid a hard Brexit”.The news came as the head of a pan-European dairy co-operative warned that a no-deal Brexit could send prices soaring and create problems getting products to consumers.Ash Amirahmardi, UK managing director of Arla Foods, spoke after ministers last week raised the spectre of foods and medicines being stockpiled as part of contingency planning in case the UK leaves the EU without a deal in place on customs.Mr Amirahmardi told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that 16 per cent of UK dairy products are imported, and of those 98 per cent were from Europe.  “If we have barriers at our ports then that is what is going to lead to increased prices and potentially supply issues.”He added that World Trade Organisation (WTO) tariffs, which would come into play if there was no Brexit deal, on dairy products are “penal” and that stockpiling produce is “not something that is really practical for the dairy industry”.He said the average person in the UK consumes the equivalent of three pints of milk per day, adding: “One of the reasons they do is because of the nutritious benefits of it, but it is also accessible in terms of prices.“Any increase in the friction of movement of products will inevitably lead to higher costs and therefore one of our concerns is to make sure consumer prices are accessible post-Brexit.” - PA"},{"url":null,"title":"summer sun britons make heatwave pictures","story":"As Britain continues to bake in heatwave conditions, a young man jumps in to the sea from a wall opposite Brighton pier.Sunseekers took to beaches and beauty spots across Britain at the weekend, as the fine and dry weather looks sent to continue for at least another week.Here we look at how people across Britain are making the most of the scorching temperatures while they can.Teen ballet dancer speaks of joy after being accepted into Bolshoi AcademyBordeaux wines ravaged by fungal diseaseFifa council members call for evidence of corruption claims, amid calls for \u0026#39independent inquiry\u0026#39Coffin for Novichok victim Dawn Sturgess will be in place before funeral to protect mournersNew York Times publisher says he told Donald Trump his attacks on media could cause violenceGrammar school superhead left students feeling suicidal with policy of exclusion for getting B grades  Zimbabwe\u0026#39s gold rush: boom in illegal mining draws hundreds of thousands to Africa\u0026#39s KlondikeEurope \u0026#39not doing its homework\u0026#39 on basic wildfire prevention, experts warnHeston Blumenthal\u0026#39s £25 Waitrose gin beaten by Aldi\u0026#39s £10 own brand bottleJohn Lewis recycled plastic towels will \u0026#39still pollute oceans\u0026#39, campaigners claimDeadly California wildfire kills great-grandmother and two childrenCambodia ruling party claims landslide election win after opposition banned in \u0026#39sham\u0026#39 voteWater companies criticised for hosepipe restrictions despite torrential downpours Church of England bishops turn on each other over Lord Carey abuse scandalDonald Trump threatens government shutdown if he doesn\u0026#39t get wall funding\u0026#39Fetch me my smartphone, Jeeves!\u0026#39 - Busy Parisians turn to PA firms to organise their lives Richard Leonard under pressure over anti-Semitism row as five frontbench Scottish Labour MSPs demand rethinkDonald Trump let Nicola Sturgeon \u0026#39off the hook\u0026#39 by refusing to meet her during Scottish visitRussia holds \u0026#39tank biathlon\u0026#39 at International Army Games Pro-Russian journalist nominated to run Italy\u0026#39s state broadcaster We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"introducing telegraph new way get news","story":"Head of Digital PublishingMedia and Telecoms industryWe’ve made it even easier for you to get the news you want, when you want it. Introducing My , a new way to get the news.When you login to your  account you can now follow your favourite  writers and the subjects you’re most interested in to create a feed of news that’s just for you.Whether you want the wisdom of Charles Moore, want post-match insight from Paul Hayward or need straight-talking lifestyle advice from Bryony Gordon, the My Feed feature gives you a truly personalised experience of The .The first time you use My , we\u0027ll present a selection of popular subjects and writers to get you started.

For students, they are killers of motivation. “A student given an unconditional offer can hardly be expected to work as hard as they would have for the second part of their a-level course. Even the best school may struggle to motivate that young person, or even get them to come to school.”The number of unconditional offers given to BBB students has soaredFigures from Ucas, the university admissions service, have revealed that almost one in four students - some 24 per cent - who were predicted to get three Bs were given at least one unconditional offer in 2017.This figure is far higher than that for top students, which stood at 4.6 per cent for those predicted to get three A*s. In 2010, just 0.9 per cent of students who were predicted to get three Bs were given at least one unconditional offer, but this has soared by 23.1 percentage points in seven years. Dr Stephen continued: “Unconditional offers can sometimes put a student at a disadvantage: if a young person has not mastered the demands of a-level, they may not be able to cope with what is expected at university. “They can be seriously damaging to a student who is unsuited either to the course or university itself, as the dropout rate suggests.”This was the fate of one student, Eden Scott. Miss Scott was predicted AAB but dropped one grade to ABB in her final examinations, a result she feels was down to her unconditional offer.The 20-year-old from London said: “I got an unconditional offer to study American and Canadian studies at Birmingham University but that 100 per cent made me stop trying as hard as I should have. “I didn’t even want to study there that much but I just went with the unconditional offer and ended up settling when I really wasn’t that bothered. “I think unconditional offers aren’t a good idea - I know that if I didn’t have one I would have got better grades and probably gone to a university I really wanted to. “Instead I settled for Birmingham and ended up having to pay £9,000 in fees after I dropped out at the start of my second year.”She added that such offers “encourage laziness” and meant “some students aren’t reaching their full potential.”Dr Stephen also raised concerns over the value of degrees which were handing out unconditional offers to their students. Media, technologies and arts courses give out a lot of unconditionalsHe said: “How impressed are employers going to be by a course that you do not have to work for to get into or reach any standard, but which you get into simply by filling in an application form?“The plain truth is that we have too many universities and we need to bring back the Polytechnics. “Nobody – students, schools, the economy – wins from the disgrace of unconditional offers, and a degree so easy to get into is likely to be as valuable as a shady Diploma bought off the internet  – except the latter won’t cost the student, and society, £50,000.”Yesterday the Office for Students confirmed that whilst it would not be appropriate to ban unconditional offers they will be looking to ensure the admissions process remains “fair and reliable” and would taken action if necessary. Teen ballet dancer speaks of joy after being accepted into Bolshoi AcademyBordeaux wines ravaged by fungal diseaseFifa council members call for evidence of corruption claims, amid calls for \u0026#39independent inquiry\u0026#39Coffin for Novichok victim Dawn Sturgess will be in place before funeral to protect mournersNew York Times publisher says he told Donald Trump his attacks on media could cause violenceGrammar school superhead left students feeling suicidal with policy of exclusion for getting B grades  Zimbabwe\u0026#39s gold rush: boom in illegal mining draws hundreds of thousands to Africa\u0026#39s KlondikeEurope \u0026#39not doing its homework\u0026#39 on basic wildfire prevention, experts warnHeston Blumenthal\u0026#39s £25 Waitrose gin beaten by Aldi\u0026#39s £10 own brand bottleJohn Lewis recycled plastic towels will \u0026#39still pollute oceans\u0026#39, campaigners claimDeadly California wildfire kills great-grandmother and two childrenCambodia ruling party claims landslide election win after opposition banned in \u0026#39sham\u0026#39 voteWater companies criticised for hosepipe restrictions despite torrential downpours Church of England bishops turn on each other over Lord Carey abuse scandalDonald Trump threatens government shutdown if he doesn\u0026#39t get wall funding\u0026#39Fetch me my smartphone, Jeeves!\u0026#39 -

One staff member overheard a student say he was so fearful of telling his parents he had to leave “he might as well kill himself”, and another student saying “they just want to be rid of me, they just want me gone.”St. Olave\u0026#39s has abandoned the practice of withdrawing Year 13 place offers from Year 12 pupils who achieved worse than three Bs at AS-LevelAn investigation into the fee-paying school, which was judged Outstanding by Ofsted in 2014, found its safeguarding policy was in place and implemented.However, investigators found “issues of wellbeing, mental health and emotional abuse” including an “adverse effect” on the wellbeing of less academic pupils caused by a “constant emphasis” on getting A* grades and reading medicine at Oxbridge.The School Chaplain told how more than 30 pupils in two years had sought a confidential conversation to discuss how the pressure was affecting them, and several “felt like failures” when predicted even A*AA grades, rather than straight A*s.The Orpington school was heavily criticised in the council reportAfter a legal challenge from parents, the local authority confirmed it was illegal to exclude pupils on non-disciplinary grounds and the school has abandoned the practice.The report also criticised the school for refusing staff funds for essentials and requesting donations from parents despite sitting on £2m in reserves.St Olave’s has promised to judge future performance against a broader range of criteria.Teen ballet dancer speaks of joy after being accepted into Bolshoi AcademyBordeaux wines ravaged by fungal diseaseFifa council members call for evidence of Qatar corruption claimsCoffin for Novichok victim Dawn Sturgess will be in place before funeral to protect mournersNew York Times publisher says he told Donald Trump his attacks on media could cause violenceZimbabwe\u0026#39s gold rush: boom in illegal mining draws hundreds of thousands to Africa\u0026#39s KlondikeEurope \u0026#39not doing its homework\u0026#39 on basic wildfire prevention, experts warnHeston Blumenthal\u0026#39s £25 Waitrose gin beaten by Aldi\u0026#39s £10 own brand bottleJohn Lewis recycled plastic towels will \u0026#39still pollute oceans\u0026#39, campaigners claimDeadly California wildfire kills great-grandmother and two childrenCambodia ruling party claims landslide election win after opposition banned in \u0026#39sham\u0026#39 voteWater companies criticised for hosepipe restrictions despite torrential downpours Church of England bishops turn on each other over Lord Carey abuse scandalDonald Trump threatens government shutdown if he doesn\u0026#39t get wall funding\u0026#39Fetch me my smartphone, Jeeves!\u0026#39 - Busy Parisians turn to PA firms to organise their lives Richard Leonard under pressure over anti-Semitism row as five frontbench Scottish Labour MSPs demand rethinkDonald Trump let Nicola Sturgeon \u0026#39off the hook\u0026#39 by refusing to meet her during Scottish visitRussia holds \u0026#39tank biathlon\u0026#39 at International Army Games Pro-Russian journalist nominated to run Italy\u0026#39s state broadcaster Palestinian teenager released from prison after slapping Israeli soldiersWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/01/09/TELEMMGLPICT000150750315_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqX7pHcCCmtgwidDdHSvx2cHE86QaQRwDHQBsfS7ZzE-Q.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"jon sopel says tried shut nuts off air conversation john humphrys","story":"Jon Sopel was caught discussing the Carrie Gracie issue with John Humphrys in a leaked off-air conversationJon Sopel has spoken for the first time about leaked off-air remarks he made with John Humphrys about Carrie Gracie and equal pay at the BBC. The broadcaster\u0027s North America editor claimed he tried to shut down the nuts conversation, but that he was in the court of King John.If you listen, you can hear that I’m trying to shut it down. I’m thinking: stop it, stop it. I was in Washington at 11.30 at night, about to go to bed, and suddenly I was thrown a curve ball.Earlier this year, the two were caught discussing the equal pay issue, after Ms Gracie had resigned from her post as China Editor after finding out she made less than other foreign editors, including Jon Sopel.The conversation began with Humphrys teasing Sopel, 58, by asking him how much of his salary he was “prepared to hand over to Carrie Gracie to keep her.”Sopel responded: “Obviously if we are talking about the scope for the greatest redistribution, I’ll have to come back and say, “Well yes Mr Humphrys, but. . .”Veteran broadcaster Humphrys then remarked that he could “save you the trouble”, adding: “I’ve handed over already more than you f***ing earn. But I’m still left with more than anybody else, and that seems to me entirely just. Something like that.”The highest paid stars at the BBC 2017-18Ms Gracie had the evening before resigned from her role as she accused the BBC of gender pay discrimination. She had also raised that some of the corporation’s higher earning men should take pay cuts, after learning they were earning more than her. The former China editor at the time earned  £135,000, while Mr Sopel was in the £200,000-249,999 bracket.Mr Sopel also spoke for the first time about his reaction to the pay gap row, revealing he found itincredibly uncomfortable, adding: I’m much happier reporting the news than making it. I found the whole thing ghastly on a personal level. I was quietly minding my own business – I had no idea what other people earned – and then suddenly I was in the spotlight.

Since then, areas like\u0026nbspPeckham and Frome\u0026nbsphave taken the message on as their ownClick to followThe Independent OnlineFrom Bristol to LA: The anti-gentrification posters sweeping through our citiesLast summer, stickers and posters began to appear on the walls of Bristol. In a gnomic parody of Trump’s “Make America Great Again“ they read “Make Bristol Shit Again”, and were plastered over the city’s gentrifying high-tide areas, such as Stokes Croft and St Pauls.\u0026nbspThe city talked. Vice magazine did a piece about it, and MBSA went viral as both an exemplar of the city’s mordant humour and a plea against gentrification.“My hometown is becoming an extension of London, and losing its crappy edge,” wrote Vice’s Angus Harrison in a bittersweet excoriation of Bristol’s new-found glossiness.\u0026nbspMBSA might have been a one-off valedictory howl, but in an act of synchronicity, other “Shit Again” activity arrived.In Peckham, the southeast London district previously known for being the location of Only Fools and Horses and latterly for being a hipster hotspot, a “Make Peckham Shit Again” landed\u0026nbspin March, as did a Twitter account called “Make Frome Shit Again” along with a few MFSA hashtags of the same vintage.\u0026nbsp(In an odd circularity, much of Only Fools and Horses, although set in\u0026nbspPeckham, was actually filmed in Bristol.)\u0026nbspBristolStreetWearUK)Then, this spring an international brigade of “Shit Again” warriors\u0026nbspin Los Angeles in the form of “Make Venice Shit Again” (Venice the hippyish LA district, to be clear, not the Birmingham of Italy).Such was its clout that Hollywood actor Josh Brolin sported a MVSA baseball cap, part of a local atmosphere so heightened that a recent LA Weekly story found cause to lament that in Venice, “You’ll sooner find a $200 (£150) wool poncho than a $12 pair of flip-flops.”\u0026nbspSo the “Shit Again” tag somehow hit the mark, both as a lament to the new and deracinated world of overpriced and socially exclusive development, and as a great merchandise idea in its own right. So there’s a MBSA hat, T-shirt and even “laptop skins”, while MVSA baseball caps retail at $30 and MPSA baseball caps a snip at a tenner.\u0026nbspAs Tumbleweed Parker puts it (not his real name) his Make Peckham Shit Again hats were a response to Trump’s MAGA cap as well as a way to protest the gentrification of Peckham, which has deep roots but has gathered pace in the last five years as a domino in what you might call the “de-shitting” of London.“Before Trump I’d been thinking about doing some merchandise to kick back against all the happy-clappy local pride movements that seemed to spring up after the London riots in 2011,” says Parker.Peckham-based rockers Fat White Family (centre) wears a ‘Make Peckham Shit Again’ cap with siblings Sasha and Vida Adamczewski (Morbid Books)“It’s delusional to think London’s the best place in the world when its homegrown youth are so desperate to burn it down, and Sadiq Khan’s idiotic marketing of London is used to sell it off to developers.”Moreover, he adds, “people can’t afford to live in this so-called paradise”. So in its own way, the hats and T-shirts are a kind of Situationist protest or, as he puts it, “a barricade against the unhelpful narrative that Peckham is, was, or ever could be a great place for property speculators. I think it’s important that we say, it’s actually not that great.”So is this ‘Shit Again’ activity really a hankering for the days of shuttered high streets without good coffee: a kind of “Fings Ain’t What They Used to Be” for disgruntled millennials? Possibly: the creator\u0026nbspof Make Bristol Shit Again, Bristolstreetwear, bears the legend “Say no to sourdough” on its website, and certainly, there’s a sense of loss about gentrification’s march through the neighbourhoods: the sticky-carpet pubs turning into homes, the chain stores pushing out independents, and £3-a-cup flat whites and avocado-on-spelt ousting the chipped mug of tea and sausage sarnie.Frome\u0026nbspis known for its independent shops and cobbled street\u0026nbsp(Shutterstock)The protestors are also needled by endless proclamations of arrival, such as Frome’s topping the charts as a good place to move, and Bristol winning The Sunday Times’ “best place to live in the UK” gong: the kind of boosterism that gives some locals the impression their towns are forgotten backwaters just itching to be discovered.It’s rattled further by development that piggybacks on existing “bohemian” infrastructure, such as Stokes Croft in Bristol, where the loss of artist-occupied warehouses and office blocks like Hamilton House have sparked long battles.Yet perhaps there’s something else afoot too: a nostalgie de la boue for the old townscape of sticky boozers and crap shops where people supposedly felt a sense of belonging.The term “gentrification” was minted in 1964 by British sociologist Ruth Glass with reference to Islington, then attracting the middle classes into areas full of multi-occupied late Georgian and early Victorian houses, where they set about losing the net curtains and exposing the floorboards, hence the contemporary jibe, “stripped pine-eers”. Indeed, today’s neo-gentrifiers still like their decoration “raw”, although these days it’s more about bare bricks, old shops and and cocktails in jam jars. And there has long been a missionary-like flavour about the process, whereby gentrifiers comes into an unreconstructed urban district, “discover” it anew and turn it into a mirror of their own taste.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspWoodage  Twitter)But the idea of what gentrification constitutes has shifted, says Loretta Lees, a professor of human geography at the University of Leicester and author of several books on the matter, including Planetary Gentrification. “I’ve noticed that anti-gentrification has become more performative in the last two to three years,” says Lees. “The traditional class aspect of it has given way to a more complicated scenario, full of internal conflict, where critics of gentrification are often gentrifiers themselves and where the discussion is more about consumerism more than class.”The 2017 book Gentrifier by John Joe Schlichtman, Jason Patch and Marc Lamont Hill also works this theme with a look at how gentrification\u0026nbspis now commonly used as a means to describe clothing choices, food and art, often centred around the cipher-like figure of the “hipster“ and part of a battle for the authentic soul of a place.Shoreditch (Jamie OsmanTwitter)“Imagined realities and physical realities collide in gentrification,“ they wrote. This aspect became apparent in 2015, when a demonstration against a branch of the Cereal Cafe in London’s Brick Lane bought a sense of pantomime to the debate, while in 2016 Montreal’s local government introduced a by-law that no more than one in six businesses can be a restaurant: a move that has been seen as a way of moderating gentrification.\u0026nbspAlamy)So the new symbols of gentrification – the cortados, chachka shops and themed restaurants – began to seemingly represent a force that was making Bristol want to be shit again, as well as rippling out anxiously to other corners of the country. It’s a phenomenon that Lees says has seen “gentrification move on from key world cities to rural areas, market towns and ‘edge cities’ – places on the margins of urban areas”. One of the key differences between the Ruth Glass era and now is that gentrification has been globalised and also exists in miniature.\u0026nbspTenants’ lives ‘at risk’ after government fails to act on safety rulesDonald Trump has been scared off by a big balloonLondon to get first permanent LGBT+ homeless shelterAs for Frome becoming “shit again”, she says that the actual long-term locals want a post office, a good supermarket and a Peacocks: all things that\u0026nbspmight not be the grails of a “down from London” person’s eye.\u0026nbspThere’s also a streak of self-deprecation that runs through a certain British mentality, as seen in Crap Towns, the 1990s hit, bringing the “declinism” of the 1980s up to date. Then, things could only get worse. And surely gentrification can sometimes be good? Lees draws a moral distinction between the “gentrification that displaces people, and the good regeneration that keeps people in place”, but struggles to think of a good example of the latter.In 2015, research from the US magazine City Lab concluded that gentrifying neighbourhoods don’t actually lose low-income residents at a substantially lower rate than any other neighbourhood. Plus, it should be said, there’s nothing gentrifiers scorn more than other gentrifiers. It’s fun to have a pop.\u0026nbspPerhaps “shit again” means affordable housing and a regaining of convivial civic life, or perhaps it’s an aesthetic of urban decline. Whatever, a “shit again” cap is the perfect self-abnegating gift for an uncertain age. “It seems to be resonating with a lot of people who feel alienated by the discourse of positivity around urban redevelopment, which is most people I know,” says Parker. “Even the local estate agent ordered one. I hope he wears it when he hangs himself.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/06/26/16/mosque-1.jpg","title":"seyran ates islam mosque religon germany","story":"Created with Sketch.Seyran Ates, a Turkish-born German lawyer and women\u0027s rights activist, could not find a mosque where she felt at home.

She remembers wavering on the brink of death and telling God that she had to rejoin the living.A 21-year-old law student at the time, working at a women’s centre in West Berlin, she was nowhere near finished with the world.“\u0027I want to go back,’ I told God,” Ates, now a 55-year-old lawyer and women’s rights activist who is also studying to become an imam, recalled of that afternoon. “I still have a mission.”More than three decades later, that mission came to fruition a year ago when she stood before a congregation of Muslim men and women kneeling side by side as they recited prayers in the Ibn Rushd-Goethe Mosque – the first Muslim house of worship in Germany where women, many with dark ponytails and long curls uncovered, are recognised as imams.Any Muslim is welcome to join: men or women, Sunni or Shia, transgender, gay or straight.“We want to send a signal to political Islam,” Ates, wearing a long, white tunic trimmed with gold, told a packed room on the opening day, when journalists outnumbered worshippers.“We want to show that another Islam exists, that has nothing to do with terrorism.”Over the past year, that something has grown into a congregation of 35 core members – many of them women. They help Ates organise weekly prayers, give tours to school groups and hold seminars on democracy, love and the concept of an open, tolerant interpretation of Islam and a forgiving God.Religious groups join together for interfaith collaborationHere\u0027s a reminder of what Donald Trump said about Muslims in the past When is Eid al-Fitr and how do Muslim people celebrate it?During Eid, it\u0027s important to reflect on Islam in BritainThree years after a wave of more than 1 million, mostly Muslim, migrants arrived in Germany seeking asylum, culture wars over religious identity and the possible threat posed by Islam have led to a rise in nationalist, populist movements.The government of Chancellor Angela Merkel was nearly brought down this week over a dispute with the Bavarian sister of her conservative party, which sought to turn back refugees at the border.The Bavarian conservatives of the Christian Social Union joined the far-right party Alternative for Germany in promoting a narrative that refugees pose a threat, after several highly publicised killings and sexual assaults in the country led to charges against Muslim migrants.The party ordered that crosses be displayed in all public buildings in the state, and Merkel’s new interior minister, Horst Seehofer – also a Bavarian – declared: “Islam is not a part of Germany.”Against the backdrop of these debates, Ates sees the survival of the Ibn Rushd-Goethe Mosque, which recently celebrated its first anniversary, as proof that Muslims living in Germany need and are open to an interpretation of Islam that reflects the values of the Western society in which they live.Tombs in the centre of Tarung village serve as handy laundry driers on a sunny Sumba morning.Each tomb in Waihola village (near Nihiwatu) represents massive expense in terms of ritual sacrifices for local families who observe the ancestral Marapu religionCatholic imagery on a tomb in Waihola village (near Nihiwatu) shows how imported religions seem often to have blended almost seamlessly with the ancient Marapu religion.In an effort to minimise economic strain the law stipulates that only 5 buffalo can be sacrificed at funerals - in reality many more are often killed and a big buffalo with a wide horn spread will often fetch close to $4,000.A royal tomb in Pasunga village is flanked by the smaller tombs where servants were buried (sometimes buried alive!) alongside their master.Village dogs - currently s but, more than likely, part of some future feast - on tombs in Pasunga village.A horse - another part of Sumba\u0027s ancestral warrior heritage - grazes among the tombs in Pasunga village.A more humble modern style tomb stands next to the kings burial place in Galu Bakul, Anakalang.A village dog relaxes on a tomb in Prai Ijing village.While still considered sacred the tombs very quickly become part of normal village life.

The Arabs will never allow it,\u0027” she said. Instead, hundreds of people from across Germany, Europe and abroad have visited or attended services.Those most committed to its survival have made donations, some as much as €500, Ates said, emphasising that the mosque receives no public funding.“Even atheists come here and appreciate this place, as a spiritual place, a place of peace,” she said recently, standing barefoot on the pale carpet of the mosque. “I had hoped, but never dreamed, that so many atheists would be interested. That was a positive surprise.”The criticism and rejection, in its fierceness and intensity, less so. Even before the mosque opened, her personal Facebook page and that of the mosque were flooded with derogatory messages and even some death threats.“May Allah put you on the right path, or destroy you,” someone writing under the name Xalo Bero said, in one of the friendlier remarks.Protection provided by the police and paid for by the city government, in place since she published the book Islam Needs a Sexual Revolution\u0026nbspin 2009, was increased to a personal security detail after the heightened threats on her life.Days after the mosque opened, Dar al-Ifta, an influential arm of the Egyptian Justice Ministry that issues religious verdicts, denounced the mosque and declared that allowing men and women to pray alongside one another violated Islamic law.Turkish news outlets reported that the mosque was a terrorist organisation with links to the Islamist cleric Fethullah Gulen, whom Turkey blames for a coup attempt in 2016 against President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.Despite a video message in which Ates states that the “the Rushd-Goethe mosque has nothing to do with the Gulen movement”, the rumours have persisted.She blames them for the fact that few Turks have joined the congregants, although they make up the vast majority of the estimated 4.5 million Muslims living in Germany.Despite the demands of running the mosque, she takes Arabic classes and continues to work as a lawyer. She considers achieving a degree in Islamic theology important to her recognition in the Muslim community.“I want to understand the words and know the meanings so no one can say, ‘She’s just a lawyer,\u0027” she said.Born in Istanbul to a Turkish mother and a Kurdish father, she emigrated with her parents to what was then West Berlin in the late 1960s, part of the first large wave of Muslim immigrants who came to fill the blue-collar jobs needed to rebuild the German economy after World War II.Ates was 6 when she and her four siblings moved into a one-room apartment with their parents.As she learned German and excelled in school, Ates says, she came to understand that it was not the crowded living conditions that she found suffocating, but the realisation that because of her gender, she was not afforded the freedoms of her non-Muslim peers.“I was a girl,” she wrote in 2007 in Zeit Online. “I embodied the family’s honour, and my hymen – for a long time I didn’t even know what that was – was more important to the whole family than my brain.”At 17, she fled her home, graduated from high school and started studying law at the Free University of Berlin. To support herself, she worked as a counsellor in a women’s centre.In September 1984, she was speaking with a client when a man wearing a trench coat entered the centre, pulled out a pistol and fired three shots. One hit the client in the stomach, killing her the other struck Ates.She survived to see the suspect, a Turkish bricklayer, acquitted for lack of evidence, which enraged her. For years, she struggled with the psychological fallout of the attack.Violent clashes leave ’86 dead’ in NigeriaFrench far-right group arrested over alleged plot to attack MuslimsShe returned to her faith, but was again alienated by Berlin’s traditional, conservative mosques, where women were forced to pray behind a curtain.

While she received support from like-minded liberal Muslims from Switzerland to the US, the critics have remained.What keeps her going is the encouragement, not only from social media postings, but also from the visitors who go out of their way to find a place of worship that previously existed only in their dreams.​Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/07/27/16/beano-comp.jpg","title":"the beano anniversary characters dc dennis menace minnie minx bash street kids dandy","story":"Created with Sketch.‘Two million kids use The Beano’s website, which is the number of kids who read the comic itself back in the\u0026nbsp1950s.’\u0026nbspDavid Pollock hears an incredible story of resilience and reinvention from that hotbed of rebellion,\u0026nbspDundeeClick to followThe Independent OnlineImagination running wild: Big Eggo the ostrich first appeared in 1938, to be followed by those characters which were to become familiar to generations of avid readers“Whenever we come up to a major anniversary, people always ask us how much longer The Beano can keep going, whether we think we might actually make it to the next birthday,” says Mike Stirling, the title’s editorial director. “But this time things are different – in 2016 we revitalised ourselves with the creation of Beano Studios, and sales of the comic are increasing. I wouldn’t says that makes us cocky, but there’s a certain satisfaction in knowing that no one’s going to be asking the question this time!”He says this with a touch of the impudence of The\u0026nbspBeano’s Dennis the Menace, Minnie the Minx or one of the Bash Street Kids, a stable of characters who have become intergenerational household names in the UK. Yet if the enthusiasm of the guy in charge echoes the spirit of the comic, this only emphasises one of the key reasons for\u0026nbspThe\u0026nbspBeano’s unlikely but very much ongoing success.As well as the embrace of other technologies which Beano Studios was designed to bring about – the free website and app have been hugely successful, and the 2017 animated series Dennis \u0026amp Gnasher: Unleashed! has become CBBC’s top-rated animation, as well as being sold to other countries – it’s the fact the people in charge know and speak to their pre-teen audience so well that keeps readers coming back.Bolstered by this multimedia success, The\u0026nbspBeano’s last set of ABC figures recorded an almost 8 per cent rise it now sells more than 37,500 copies a week, or 1.86 million copies a year. In a comic market which has dropped by approximately 10 per cent in the same period, these figures are somewhere in the region of miraculous, yet simple testimony to publishers DC Thomson’s knowledge of their market. “Online traffic has grown 900 per cent in the last year,” says Stirling. “Two million kids use the site, which is the number of kids who read the comic itself back in the 1950s.”Such new technologies are a world away from what was available in 1938, when the Dundee-based newspaper and publishing company had already enjoyed much success with its line of adventure comics and two recent cartoon creations for the Sunday Post newspaper the still-enduring Broons and Oor Wullie strips. Into this environment of near-guaranteed success, DC Thomson’s head of children’s publishing RD\u0026nbspLow authorised a batch of new titles, including one which featured the adventurous ostrich Big Eggo on its cover.Although many of the characters we most associate with the title hadn’t been developed yet, Stirling says its rebellious tone was baked-in from the beginning. “Dundee was always a rebellious city, in a political sense, and because of all manner of quirks of fate thrown at it. At one point early in the 20th century it was known as She Town, because women ran the city’s jute industry, in which they were very exploited.“They rebelled against this treatment, though. That’s tied up with the 1911 schoolkids’ strike, when children fought for better conditions across the country – this was especially pronounced in Dundee, because they’d seen their mums do the same when they’d been sent on day release from school to work in the jute mills. I don’t think it’s any surprise that some of the generation of kids who were involved in these strikes also went to work for DC Thomson, and were of the same generation who started this rebellious new comic.”It wasn’t until the 1950s, however, that The\u0026nbspBeano as we know it today began to come together, starting with the introduction of creator David Law’s mischievous Dennis the Menace in 1951, and on into Minnie the Minx, Rodger the Dodger, the Bash Street Kids, Beryl the Peril and more. The list of creators working on the title, all of them dead now, is a titanic roll call of Britain’s great humour cartoonists, including Dudley D\u0026nbspWatkins, Leo Baxendale, Ken Reid and more.“Feeling like an underdog or an outsider in some way is a pretty universal feeling, the only weirdos are those who don’t,” says Iain Sawbridge, chief marketing and content officer at Beano Studios, which is based on Fleet Street in London. “The introduction of Dennis in 1951 made The\u0026nbspBeano one of the first brands to really show children behaving like children in popular culture, a version that was anything but the beautifully behaved, seen-but-not-heard simulacra of childhood portrayed in the post-war years.”In Sawbridge’s view, the Beano\u0026nbspsuccess is partly down to the fact that much of the entertainment industry still hasn’t found a way of replicating what The\u0026nbspBeano got right more than 60 years ago. “The reality is, the media industry doesn’t ‘think kid’ enough” he says. “So children aren’t always getting the entertainment experiences they deserve in broadcast or digital environments, and the digital world where older kids now spend most of their time isn’t made for 6 to 12s.“Gaming, YouTube and social media are largely designed for 13 and over, and yet children now spend more time online than on television. Why aren’t there more places made for them, with content they love and environments that are safe? That’s why we created beano and our YouTube channel, to complement The\u0026nbspBeano comic.”What made The\u0026nbspBeano stand out at the beginning as the most exciting entertainment product available to children, says Stirling, is what has kept it alive even after its stablemate the Dandy – launched in 1937 – has gone (although the hardback Dandy annual is still a bestseller). “The\u0026nbspBeano was the first comic to have all kids as their main core of characters, and this core has lasted until today,” he says.The mantra of the title these days, and its digital offshoot, is to be “So Beano”. “It’s about looking on the bright side of life, trying to find a laugh in every situation, offering something cool that kids can talk about in the playground,” says Stirling. “We’ve distilled all the principles of the comic and applied them online. We look at the world from a perspective of what we call ‘four-foot thinking’, a kid’s-eye view, at the absurdity in situations, and the injustice in them. Kids are very honest about how they observe things, they can see the emperor has no clothes.”Sawbridge points out that audience research via school visits, and readers’ emails and responses, as well as interaction with a group of designated young “Trendspotters” around the country, is part of what drives content on the site – which blends strips with videos and more bitesize, online native content – and in the comic. Beano researchers have spent 600 hours face to face with children in the last 12 months, he says, which is only a more advanced way of doing what the title’s early creators did the Bash Street Kids came about because DC Thomson’s offices overlooked the yard of the local school, and the creators noticed how the kids interacted before feeding this into the strip.This interaction, he says, has brought about a new character for the 80th-anniversary edition named Mandi. “She was co-created between us and one of our partners, the mental health charity Young Minds, deliberately to address the everyday issues experienced by kids today which can cause stresses or anxieties that can affect mental health. Whenever she appears she will be experiencing some of these issues for instance, in her first appearance she’s getting her first mobile phone, and the good and bad that come with that, which is something a lot of kids will be experiencing this summer.”After the anniversary issue – which is guest-edited by David Walliams – appears this week, there are plenty of other plans in the works, including a return for the Dennis and Gnasher Fan Club, a forthcoming live-action Minnie the Minx series aimed at young teens, and further plans to bring characters like Bananaman to the screen. It’s all about simply keeping with the times.“It’s school holidays and we’ve had this incredible weather, so we’ve found that more kids have been playing outside over summer,” says Stirling. “They’re returning to what we might call ‘traditional play patterns’ – but kids don’t lose these, they always have them, they just reinvent them for themselves. I think as a parent it’s sometimes difficult to accept this, you have this misty-eyed view of what you did or didn’t do as a child, but kids of different generations all essentially want the same things. Part of that is taking a bit of time and attention, and we want to present Beano as a friend to them, so parents know that they can trust it as a safe place for their kids to go online.“You know, we tell kids to grow up, or we say pejoratively to people ‘you’re acting like a five-year-old’,” he continues. “But why not? It’s a brilliant time in your life, you’re free-thinking, you’ve got a wild imagination, you’ve got no limits and very few rules. Them we get into a system when we’re given a list of things we can’t do, but I think we need to try and retain an element of how we thought when we were six or seven.“Keep that optimism, keep that hope, and you’ll feel happier throughout your life. People might say that’s naivete, but once again it comes back to how children can spot that the emperor’s new clothes are fake. They have a way of thinking which is pure.”The Beano’s 80th anniversary on Monday 30 July will be celebrated by a special birthday edition guest-edited by David Walliams. Celebratory exhibitions around the country include ‘Beano: A Manual for Mischief’ at V\u0026ampA, London, until 12\u0026nbspAugust, and ‘Bash Street’s Back at the McMenace!’ at the McManus Gallery, Dundee, until 21\u0026nbspOctoberbeano at 80Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2014/04/11/16/world-in-pic-5.jpg","title":"theme parks children office slides rollercoaster pub adrenaline fun","story":"Created with Sketch.When most of us spend the majority of our weeks working, worrying about finances, trying to stay on top of life admin and suffering from increasingly poor mental health,\u0026nbspthere is nothing more precious than a place intended simply for funClick to followThe Independent OnlineRollercoasters invoke \u0027eustress\u0027, a kind of stress that is not bad for you – rather it is pleasurable and many of us actively seek it outThat moment at the top of a rollercoaster – after the slow upwards build, when you’re high above the treeline, dangling, stomach clenched, looking down – is hard to compare to anything else.

You can bet that any resort you visit will be filled with varied and never ending things to discover.Whether it’s the thrill-inducing rides, the milder water rides, the inventive “worlds” or the over-priced but delicious doughnut and ice-cream combos that draw you in, it’s hard to deny that theme parks offer something for everyone. They are often marketed as family attractions, something for the kids, but they are places that can captivate and entertain at any age.I don’t feel like I enjoy theme parks any less now that I’m an (admittedly childish) adult – if anything, I enjoy them more. My mood is not as volatile (kids have the tendency to be excited one moment and in a strop the next), I don’t tire at the end of the day and I can appreciate things I didn’t as a kid – the engineering that’s gone into creating a place (not that I know anything about engineering), the small details, the truly fine art and craftsmanship.And as far as I’m concerned theme parks are a work of art. As Bill Watterson, creator of the cartoon strip Calvin and Hobbes, believed, I couldn’t agree more that there is no such thing as high art and low art – rather creations that either speak to people or don’t. And what could speak to people more than a place created for the sole purpose of having fun?Kingda\u0026nbspKa, New Jersey, is the world’s tallest rollercoaster at 456ft – higher than Big BenAfter all, when most of us spend the majority of our weeks working, worrying about finances, trying to stay on top of life admin and suffering from increasingly poor mental health, there is nothing more precious than escapism. Our cities, towns and villages revolve around practicality – offices for working in, shops for buying things, gyms for exercising. Most of what surrounds us is mundane – it’s pretty wonderful in this context that we have places created for the sole purpose of having fun.But while some of the elements of enjoyment are\u0026nbspeasy to recognise as such – good food, fun family rides and the opportunity to take a picture with a lifesize Donald Duck – what is it that is so enticing about rollercoasters? By definition they should evoke sheer terror, yet we absolutely adore them\u0026nbspand queue for hours on end for the two-minute scare they provide.Richard Stephens, a senior lecturer in psychology at Keele University, argues that rollercoasters invoke a good kind of stress, called “eustress” – a word that has the same route as “euphoria”. This kind of stress is not bad for you – rather it is pleasurable and many of us actively seek it out.Eustress can also explain why we like being scared in other contexts, such as on ghost trains or in live action horror mazes. It makes sense that we must all have different ways of seeking this kind of good stress – which is why some people love rollercoasters and some people can’t stand them. I’m a big fan of rollercoasters but the thought of scuba ing absolutely terrifies me. But for others I imagine this is a “eustressful” experience.For the ultimate thrillseeker, the fastest rollercoaster in the world is currently the Formula Rossa at Ferrari World in Abu Dhabi, which reaches an eye-watering 150mph. The second fastest, Kingda Ka at Six Flags Great Adventure in New Jersey, is also the world’s tallest,\u0026nbspat 456ft. To put that into some perspective, Big Ben in London stands shorter at 320ft.But Kingda Ka will not hold its title for long, as a new coaster, Skyscraper, is set to open in Florida in 2020 and will reach 500ft, plus have the steepest drop of any rollercoaster in the world.And lastly the longest rollercoaster, the Steel Dragon 2000, at Nagashima Spa Land in Japan is a whopping 8,133ft. It is the only existing rollercoaster to break the 8,000ft threshold, and it lasts for a whole four minutes.With rides becoming increasingly complex and impressive, it’s fascinating to see where things all started. The first commercial rollercoaster in the world, Switchback Railway, opened in 1884 in Coney Island, New York. It kickstarted the growth of attractions in the US, and before long Coney Island housed a few similar rides. The oldest acknowledged theme park was also located in the US:\u0026nbspSanta Claus Land opened in Indiana in 1935, and included many rides themed around the big\u0026nbspman in red.If you’d like a taste of an ancient theme park,\u0026nbspthe oldest\u0026nbspstill in operation can be found in Klampenborg, Denmark. Bakken opened in 1583 and has more than 150 attractions, including a wooden rollercoaster built in 1932. Denmark is also the home of Lego, and the original Legoland Park – so a heaven for theme park fans.In the UK we’ve also been breathing life into old theme parks, such as\u0026nbspDreamland\u0026nbspin Margate. First opened in 1880 and popular all the way through to the\u0026nbsp1990s, it was closed in 2003 and set to become a residential area. But after local residents campaigned to restore and open Dreamland instead, it was brought back and soon had a £25m\u0026nbsprevamp.It now has a concert venue, seaside pub and rooftop rum shack, and new rides are being introduced to sit alongside the restored vintage ones. According to its Wikipedia page, it’s intended to be a “working museum of vintage funfair rides”. And it’s changing the fortunes of the surrounding small seaside town in Kent.Another intriguing destination is an unexpected one. Nestled deep in the Italian woods, Ai Pioppi boasts a colourful range of rides – none of which are powered by electricity. Instead, riders push, pedal and swing – but we’re not talking playground-style attractions here\u0026nbspwe’re talking full-on Ferris wheels and rollercoasters. But perhaps even more impressive than the park’s eco-credentials is its founder, Bruno Ferrin, who has been building the park himself since the late 1960s. He started by adding a few slides to accompany his restaurant – and it grew from there.Around the world there are a whole host of niche theme parks – those interested can visit Hello Kitty’s castle in Japan, unearth mud at Diggerland\u0026nbspin various locations across the UK and US and view a host of farting and vomiting statues\u0026nbspat BonBon-Land in Zealand, Denmark.Of course, obscurities aside, you’re still guaranteed to have fun at your local attraction. And increasingly we’re seeing theme park culture enter\u0026nbspour day-to-day – less traditional workplaces are starting to install slides and ball pits and Penn State station in New York is considering adding a rollercoaster alongside it’s shops and subway platforms.It would do us all some good to get out the office and have some fun for the sake of fun –\u0026nbspor even better\u0026nbspwe could incorporate theme park rides and attractions into our daily lives.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Even Dr Alex and Alexandra made up after their acrimonious breakup.\u0026nbspBut, as only Love Island knows how, the happiness soon gave way for suspense. The sunny Spanish skies fast turned grey as the islanders found out their fate...\u0026nbspThe contestants had to vote for the couple that they wanted to put forward for eviction on Sunday (29 July) night. Tensions ran high, intense discussions about friendship and unconditional love were had, but choose they must.Good evening! Are you ready to find out which couple will leave the island tonight?Who do you think will be dumped from the villa tonight?Anyway, that\u0027s about it from me until the penultimate episode kicks off tonight at 9pm. I have a feeling it\u0027s going to be an emotional one. See you then!Btw did everyone see the moment it KICKED OFF in the last episode when Josh put his foot in it?Tonight is where we get to see the parents invade the villa and give their offspring some last-minute advice ahead of the live final on Monday night, where one couple will triumph and take home the £50,000 prizeIt\u0027s kind of nuts to think this is our penultimate blog documenting all the drama (because there has been SO MUCH)* that has taken place over the past two months.\u0026nbsp*SarcasmGood afternoon!

(Local protest kept the brand out of the town in 2012.)It’s been called “the capital of New-Age chic”, “the most eccentric town in Britain”, a source of inspiration for artists, writers and therapists, and a cause of rage for at least one visiting rationalist who fulminated against a hotbed of “drop-in Tarot and meditation classes, art healing workshops and psycho-spiritual dance sessions”.And let us continue to pause, because the Totnes passports, which shall be issued to all who are willing to swear the Totnes Oath, are still at the printers.\u0026nbspSomeone spotted an error when they came off the press.This is a pity because Marian and Barry Skeffington have turned up in the hope of becoming the first senior citizens to have their own Totnes passports.Alerted by an early morning news item on Radio Devon, they hot-footed it to the Guildhall determined to be the first in the queue at the Totnes “passport office”\u0026nbsp(which in its current form is more bench

was, of course, the city state of Troy,” he begins.\u0026nbspAccording to Geoffrey of Monmouth, the wanderings of Brutus of Troy took him, after many adventures, to the River Dart, to a land inhabited only by abundant game and a small band of giants.Here Brutus stepped ashore and declared (while standing on the aforementioned stone): “Here I stand and here I rest, and this good town shall be called Totnes.”Brutus and his followers slew the giants, including their leader Gogmagog.\u0026nbspAnd on this now happy shore they created the second Troy that in due course became the nation named Britain, after Brutus.“We are the inheritors of Troy,” insists Mr Cooper, “and the marvellous thing about the EU is that it adopted our Trojan values\u0026nbsp(defined in the Totnes Oath as “compassion, endeavour, ingenuity, altruism, diligence, daring and a peace-loving commitment to the dignity of all sentient beings”).”But now, says Mr Cooper, Britain wishes to depart from Europe and its Trojan values, so to stay true to its roots, Totnes must remain in the EU by declaring its independence from the UK.And should Theresa May’s government refuse them their independence, the Totnesians will cite the precedent set by the 1949 film Passport to Pimlico, in which a plucky band of Londoners claimed to be in part of Burgundy, as granted by English King Edward IV to Duke Charles “The Rash”.There will be issues to resolve, none more vexing than question asked by Conservative district council leader John Tucker: “Will there be a soft border with Newton Abbot?”But Totnes is the town that slew the giants Gogmagog and Costa Coffee.With right, legal precedent and the spirit of British film comedy on their side, declares Mr Cooper, “Totnes will become a leading entity within the EU.\u0026nbspThe City State of Totnes will very quickly become a very prosperous world leader.”“How are we doing on the passports?” asks Barry hopefully.\u0026nbsp“Any word on the passports?”They’re still at the printers.In the Independent City State of Totnes, explains Mr Cooper, everyone will be listened to, not just the 37 per cent of the electorate\u0026nbspwho voted Leave (as opposed to backing Remain or abstaining).The town’s castle, adds his partner Kevin Childs, an art history lecturer, has the perfect circular shape for a people’s assembly.\u0026nbspThe Guildhall would become the headquarters of the executive.\u0026nbspThe town’s Conservative MP – and GP – Dr Sarah Wollaston, who has already called for a second EU referendum, will, they hope, accept their invitation to become the provisional government’s interim first minister,\u0026nbsp“so Totnes will also have the best healthcare system in the EU”.(When The Independent phoned, the woman in Dr Wollaston’s constituency office laughed.\u0026nbspThen she said the MP was in meetings.)The Totnes national anthem has yet to be composed, but will have “forward-looking” words.\u0026nbspThe city state’s flag has yet to be designed.\u0026nbspThey are also uncertain on whether to adopt the euro or keep the Totnes\u0026nbsppound\u0026nbsp(a local currency started by an eco-charity in 2007).But we know what the passports will look like because, hot off the adjusted presses, they have now arrived.\u0026nbspThey are, of course, in EU red and incorporate the image of Brutus of Troy, plus watermarks depicting a carrot\u0026nbsp(for organic farming), a computer – conceived of\u0026nbspby Totnesian Charles Babbage\u0026nbspin 1837 – and three healing crystals (obviously).\u0026nbspThe Totnes Oath is printed on the back cover.Clutching the first ever passports issued by the Independent City State of Totnes, Marian and Barry are delighted.“This is fun,” says Barry.\u0026nbsp“But I’m not particularly hot either way on Brexit.”Organic innkeeper Geetie Singh-Watson, next in the passport queue, is slightly more on message.“I want to stay in the EU,” says Ms Singh-Watson, of the Bull Inn, who is accompanied by her springer iel Artichoke.\u0026nbsp“This does seem an opportunity to question how we got to this point after a referendum full of false statements.“I swear allegiance to Europe.\u0026nbspAnd so does Artichoke!”There is similar enthusiasm on the high street, at Rhythm and Light (purveyor of “crystals, fossils, world music, instruments”).“I like the idea,” says Rhythm and Light owner Sandi Whale, “because of what it shows up – the lies and skulduggery that got us to Brexit.“It does rather highlight that the government is letting a right-wing cabal dictate to the rest of the country.“Totnes is so different,” she adds.\u0026nbsp“You feel you can do anything here.”But at Earth Food Love, Britain’s first zero-waste supermarket, a note of caution is sounded between the jars of organic puffed quinoa and the grind-your-own almond butter.“It’s amusing,” says Edward Judge, 21, the man behind the counter.\u0026nbsp“But there are not as many radicals here as you might think.”And if you really want to be over-serious, you could try quite a few objections to Mr Cooper’s City State of Totnes plan.For a start, Mr Cooper isn’t just any old lawyer.\u0026nbspHe is a human rights specialist with particular expertise in the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights.In Brexiteer demonology, that probably places Mr Cooper in first class on “the Brussels gravy train”, clutching a CV slightly worse than Satan’s.Although Mr Cooper doesn’t see it that way.“It is a fiction that lawyers get rich by exploiting EU human rights law,” he says.\u0026nbsp“In fact, if Britain left the EU, I would be richer, because there would be so many complications flowing from Brexit that I would get much more work.“The overwhelming majority of human rights barristers do large amounts of pro bono work,” he adds, “because we represent people who are not wealthy, but who genuinely need legal protection.”The so-called Thatcherite\u0026nbspeconomic miracle, he suggests, was more of an EU miracle resulting from Britain joining a single market now populated by 500 million people: “It only became controversial when they realised they couldn’t have the business model without the social justice model and protections for workers.”But enough about Mr Cooper.\u0026nbspWhat about Geoffrey of Monmouth?\u0026nbspHe didn’t just invent Brutus of Troy.\u0026nbspHe promoted the myth of King Arthur.\u0026nbspGeoffrey of Monmouth could plausibly be described as more fake news than Boris of Battlebus.Mr Cooper bristles, albeit not altogether seriously.“Where do we get the name Britain, if not from Brutus?\u0026nbspIf they are going to stoop to the level of challenging Geoffrey of Monmouth … We have got the Brutus Stone.\u0026nbspWhat more evidence do you need?”It is with some hesitation that The Independent reminds Mr Cooper that the town’s reputation for “crystal waving” – as one jaded local put it – has spawned the oft-repeated joke that Totnes is twinned with Narnia.“The only fantasy land is Brexit,” insists Mr Cooper.Totnes is twinned with Vire, France.\u0026nbspNot Narnia.\u0026nbspIt is accessed via the A38, not a wardrobe.Yet it has to be said that the key problem in establishing the Independent City State of Totnes may prove to be the independent minds of the citizens of Totnes.Visit for example, the fully immersive art installation that is Totnes’s internationally acclaimed Timehouse.\u0026nbspLie on the “flying carpet”\u0026nbspin the Cloud Nine room while watching a projection of Plan 9 from Outer Space.Then listen to Timehouse owner and creator Julie Lafferty.\u0026nbsp“It is fun to have an independent city state,” she says. “When we first created the Timehouse, I wanted to declare this slice of land the Territory of Aeons.“But when it comes to Brexit, I’m neutral.\u0026nbspI think of myself as Switzerland.”There is even more iniduality back on the high street, in the heavily bearded form of Sky, a 41-year-old “gravedigger and one-to-one enabler in mental health”.Women to lose ‘fundamental rights’ because of Brexit, warns reportGovernment admits plan to stockpile medicines if no-deal BrexitThe British people must be given a final say on the Brexit dealLeave, Remain, EU, UK, Independent City State of Totnes: whichever political form you choose, to Sky you are just “deciding what shape you want your chocolate teapot”.The whole debate, he suggests, is a ersion: “It’s all couched in capital, and anything couched in capital is slave to the banks.”But the faith of Mr Cooper remains unshakeable.“And Totnes will be leading the way.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to

attracted more than 300,000 signatures in support in the first 48 hours.Writing in The Sunday Times, Ms Rudd, a former energy secretary,\u0026nbspsaid: “Yes, we will leave the EU’s political institutions in March next year – we will no longer have MEPs or be members of the European Council.\u0026nbspBut disentangling regulatory and legal systems that have been entwined for more than 40 years will require delicate diplomacy.“Such an endeavour will not be straightforward. Anyone who claims it will is being as cavalier with people’s future as those who deny that the belching of fossil fuels into the atmosphere is warming the planet.“Just as we must listen to scientific warnings about the risks of manmade climate change, so we must listen to the businesses and economists warning that a chaotic Brexit will threaten our economy.”Theresa May has said voters should be “take reassurance and comfort” from\u0026nbspthe government’s no-deal planning, as details emerged over proposals to stockpile food, medicines and fuel in case supply chains are disrupted.More than 1.4m extra young people could vote in new Brexit referendumMP hits out at Labour members after losing no-confidence voteCan’t we, just for once, hear from some sensible Brexiteers?Students up and down the country support a second referendumHow the ‘Independent City State of Totnes’ hopes to stay in the EUUnder the plans, ministers are\u0026nbspconsidering drafting the army in to help deliver supplies to hard-to-reach areas\u0026nbspoutside of the southeast of England,\u0026nbspaccording to The Sunday Times.Supermarkets have already\u0026nbspdismissed suggestions that they stock up on\u0026nbspadequate food supplies\u0026nbspas “impractical”.The British Retail Consortium, the trade association,\u0026nbspsaid: “Retailers do not have the facilities to house stockpiled goods and, in the case of fresh produce, it is simply not possible to do so.“Our food supply chains are extremely fragile and this is yet further demonstration of the need for an agreement on the backstop to ensure frictionless trade is maintained after 29 March 2019.”Doctors have also warned that cancer patients could face potentially dangerous delays to their treatment if critical supplies of medical isotopes are held up at the border.Dr Jeanette Dickson, vice president of clinical oncology at the Royal College of Radiologists, said: “These medicines are like a burning fuse.\u0026nbsp“They start off with a certain amount of radioactivity and you have a set time to get them to hospital when they are still effective.

YouGov places the figure at 71 per cent, while former Tory donor Lord Ashcroft puts it at 73 per cent.Recent polling also shows that\u0026nbsp70 per cent of undergraduates think they would be worse off after Brexit, while 67 per cent\u0026nbspwould support another vote.Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable\u0026nbspsaid: “The referendum two years ago was influenced by the Conservatives’ resistance to open up the vote to 16- and 17-year-olds.

It is more of a 5050 chance.He added: “If you are going to get a second referendum, it is going to be because the government has lost control of the House of Commons – or after a general election.“It would be more likely if Labour changes its position or if the government decides it needs it to get out of jail.\u0026nbspThat is the only way the Brexiteers and the Anna Soubrys of this world would be able to agree.”A string of senior politicians have backed the Final Say campaign, including former prime minister Tony Blair, former deputy prime minister Sir Nick Clegg and prominent\u0026nbspConservative MPs Justine Greening and Dominic Grieve.Labour’s\u0026nbspChuka Umunna and Ms Moran, the Lib Dem education spokesman,\u0026nbsphave also lent their support.It comes as Ms May’s attempts efforts to bypass Brussels and deal directly with European nations\u0026nbspfloundered, as Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief negotiator, poured cold water on a key part of the prime minister’s Brexit plans.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/05/23/17/steve-bannon.jpg  width= 2048  height= 1536  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/05/23/17/steve-bannon.jpg","title":"steve bannon movement ukip brexit","story":"Created with Sketch.Party pledges\u0026nbspto share experience with the new groupClick to followIndy PoliticsUkip to team up in \u0027unholy alliance\u0027 with Steve Bannon\u0027s new far right European movementUkip has pledged to work with\u0026nbspSteve Bannon’s new European alt-right movement, forging what critics have branded an “unholy alliance” to bring down the EU and fuel populism across the continent.Mr Bannon, a former investment banker who founded the website Breitbart, has pledged to bolster the continent’s far right with a new foundation called The Movement that would dole out resources to eurosceptics and anti-EU populists.The former chief strategist of Donald Trump has rattled Brussels after stating his intention to\u0026nbspcreate a “supergroup” in the European parliament after next’s year’s EU elections, with extreme right-wingers taking as many as a third of the legislature’s seats.Though Ukip MEPs will not be able to participate directly in the parliament because of Brexit, a spokesperson pledged that the party would share experience with Mr Bannon’s project to give it a leg up, stating they expected the group to have a “large impact” on European politics and hoped for “a new army of eurosceptic MEPs”.Mr Bannon’s move into Europe also appears set to have an impact on the dynamics of Brexit talks, with one source close to Brexit negotiations telling The Independent that Brussels has been spooked by the alt-right project.As a result, EU officials are increasingly resistant to calls for the Article 50 negotiating period to be extended, so as to avoid eurosceptic Britain participating in the European parliament elections scheduled for next May.The EU is said to fear that such an outcome would see Ukip, which won the 2014 European elections in the UK, return to the parliament and bolster the numbers of Mr Bannon’s new anti-EU group.Ukip teaming up with fascist-in-chief Steve Bannon is an unholy alliance of racist charlatans across the Channel“They really don’t want to see Farage back with Bannon for the sake of a few extra weeks,” one source close to talks said.Layla Moran, a Liberal Democrat MP and supporter of the pro-EU Best for Britain campaign told The Independent the British eurosceptic party were “desperately trying to make themselves relevant again” by joining forces with Mr Bannon.“Ukip teaming up with fascist-in-chief Steve Bannon is an unholy alliance of racist charlatans across the Channel,” she said.“Having been forgotten over the last two years, Ukip are desperately trying to make themselves relevant again. But they’ve got their work cut out for them: nobody wants to hear the verbal sewage coming out of a group whose only claim to fame is their rent-a-gob ex-leader.“Now they want dark elements of the far right in America to help plot their nasty agenda. The dangers stirred up by this kind of right-wing populism are obvious, but terrifying for the many people who fear history might be repeating itself.”A spokesperson for Ukip’s EFDD group told The Independent: “Steve Bannon certainly seems to offer a different perspective, and with his experience of American politics he could exert a large impact on the European scene which is currently going through quite a change.“Ukip MEPs wish to leave the EU in March 2019 and have no desire to return to its facade of democracy in Brussels. The MEPs will however be happy to share their experience with a new army of eurosceptic MEPs from a liberated UK.”Far-right, eurosceptic\u0026nbspand right-wing populist parties are currently scattered across a wide range of groups in the European parliament, including the European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR), Europe of Freedom and Direct Democracy (EFDD), and Europe of Nations and Freedom (ENF) – as well as parties with no group.\u0026nbspSuch parties are expected to make gains at EU level next year, as they have done in national elections since the last European parliament contest. Finding agreement between them to join a single group could be difficult, however, with many parties extremely cautious of their domestic image and loathe to ally with foreign parties that are seen as more extreme at home.\u0026nbspSome of the parties might turn their noses up at uniting under the leadership of an American organisation, too, as many have an anti-American political outlook.Brexit so far: in picturesBoris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

None of this is easy to doClick to followThe Independent OnlineFrom cricketing legend to prime minister of Pakistan, the rise of Imran KhanAfter more than two decades of political campaigning, much of it spent in the political wilderness, Imran Khan will finally become Prime Minister of Pakistan. Along the way, as his ex-wife Jemima Khan\u0026nbspnoted on Twitter, he endured “humiliations, hurdles and sacrifices”. Now, the former cricket legend and philanthropist could become one of the most powerful civilian leaders the country has known.Older readers will of course be familiar with him. After playing cricket for Oxford while he studied politics, philosophy and economics at Keble College, Khan became one of the best known Pakistanis in Britain. He figured prominently in tabloids for his social life, was often spotted at exclusive private members clubs like Annabel’s and Tramp.\u0026nbspHe\u0026nbspbefriended Mick Jagger, Sting and Goldie Hawn while being on nodding terms with Prince Charles and other royals. He married Jemima Goldsmith, the journalist and filmmaker sister of Zac, and invited Princess Diana to Pakistan.For Pakistanis, Khan was one of the few people who did them proud. Winning the Cricket World Cup in 1992 was a rare moment when Pakistan distinguished itself internationally. Pakistanis had grown weary of being principally depicted as a Third World basket case beset by social problems where women, minorities and the poor were treated appallingly. At times when boorish and condescending English cricketers like Ian Botham described Pakistan as “a place to send your mother-in-law”, Khan confronted that racism publicly.Pakistanis craved a confident, good-looking spokesman and the former cricketer could play the part. It’s one of the reasons why many voted for him.“I believe Oxford educated Imran Khan can stand toe to toe with world leaders and make a strong case for Pakistan,” wrote Haroon, a Pakistani singer and one of many celebrities, including cricketers, singers and actors who backed him.\u0026nbspBut he was also supported by a bewildering array of people from religious conservative backgrounds, wealthy businessmen, grafters from the middle classes, taxi drivers and factory workers.Khan is many things to many people. Central to his appeal is that he has not been in power before. It was common to hear his supporters say: “We’ve tried the others”,\u0026nbspreferring to the parties of former prime ministers Benazir Bhutto and Nawaz Sharif, “let’s try him this time”.\u0026nbspFor people alarmed at endemic levels of corruption, Khan represents a rare, honest and financially “clean” leader valiantly battling against an entrenched venal order. For religious conservatives and nationalists, he soothes feelings of injured pride and rouses their spirits.There are people whose support he should be embarrassed by. Sara Taseer, a Singapore-based entrepreneur, declared herself appalled by the sight of poor Baluch women lining up to vote. “Love seeing this turnout of women,” she tweeted, “but then I think would I allow these ladies to make a decision even about what be cooking in my kitchen today? And these ladies will decide on the future of the nation. Scary thought.”And there are supporters he should stay clear of. Asad Umar, Khan’s finance minister to be, posted photos of himself courting the support of Fazlur Rehman Khalil, someone whose name is on a US\u0026nbspterror watchlist.Khan’s rhetoric is often studded with references to the plight of the poor and the ravages of the elite. “A country shouldn’t be measured by how its wealthiest live,” he said in his first speech after the election, “but by how its poorest people are treated.” Critics say that message is at odds with the composition of his party, which is dominated by some of the wealthiest people in Pakistani politics. Many of Khan’s candidates this time around were also drawn from conventional old parties or military regimes, undermining the claim that their election will herald a “new Pakistan”.There are contradictions people notice in Khan\u0027s own pronouncements. When I interviewed him for The Independent, he came across as thoughtful, polite, serious and even good-humoured. On the campaign trail, however, he was seen as boastful and arrogant – making crude jibes against his opponents, taunting voters who support his rivals as “donkeys”, and denouncing liberals as “bloodthirsty”. He has forcefully denounced terrorism, and yet has been accused of being soft on the Taliban. Khan was a critic of Pakistan’s blasphemy laws and has defended religious minorities, but more recently vowed to protect the laws and accused his opponents of being part of a foreign plot to undermine it.When I first came to Pakistan to report for The Independent, Khan was a fierce critic of General Pervez Musharraf’s military rule. I saw him on the streets supporting an independent judiciary, interviewed him the night before he was arrested for defying emergency rule, heard him speak out against attacks on the press, enforced disappearances, civilian casualties in military offensives, and covered his protests against CIA drone strikes. Those experiences do not easily reconcile with the image of him as a mere shill for the Pakistan army.As prime minister, Khan will want to be the most powerful leader in the country. That distinction has usually belonged to the head of the army, which has ruled the country directly for three decades and wielded its clout backstage for the rest. It will be interesting to see how he negotiates these structural tensions. Some of the areas of dispute between Khan and the army have faded: drone strikes are rare, military operations he opposed are a thing of the past, and the US-led, Pakistan-backed “war on terror” is all but over.So, how will Khan rule? As a crusader against corruption and champion of the poor, or as an angry demagogue? Will he strengthen Pakistan’s feeble civilian institutions or disappear into the shadows of the military? Can he unite all the different Pakistanis he appealed to this afternoon, or will he seek to deepen the dangerous political isions that this election has revealed? Will Pakistan pursue peace with its neighbours, or will old modes of chest-beating belligerence endure?Only time will tell. The speech he made this afternoon pleasantly surprised many: he vowed to lift the country out of poverty to combat corruption – starting by hold himself and his own cabinet accountable he said he would educate the more than 25 million children out of school and he said he would protect the rights of minorities and women. None of this is easy to do. There are strong reasons to believe Khan won’t be able to. But it would be good to see him try.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Why has there been an upsurge in violence?At the heart of the latest escalation is 16 weeks of Palestinian protests that have taken place at the border fence between Gaza and Israel. \u0026nbspSince 30 March, hundreds of thousands of Gazans have marched each week on the heavily fortified border\u0026nbspdemanding the right to return to lands they fled and were forced from after the 1948 war, which resulted in the formation of Israel.Palestinians, who have suffered for over a decade under a crippling blockade, have said they are\u0026nbsppeacefully demonstrating during the Great March of Return marches, which is their right. But Israel has accused Hamas, the proscribed militant group that runs the enclave, of encouraging protesters to be violent towards their soldiers, to cut the border fence and to launch raids inside Israel.\u0026nbspThe Israeli military has responded with live fire, leaving more than 140 Palestinians dead, and many more with life changing injuries, in moves described by the UN General Assembly as excessive, disproportionate and indiscriminate”.\u0026nbspAt the same time, protesters say, in frustration, they have taken to launching burning kites and balloons laden with incendiary devices across the border, setting alight to over 2,600 hectares of Israeli farmland and causing hundreds of thousands of pounds of damage.\u0026nbspThe Israeli army, that said its citizens near to Gaza are in danger, subsequently tightened an 11-year-old blockade on the strip, closing Kerem Shalom, the sole goods crossing between Israel and Gaza, and strangling Gaza’s fishing zones to just three nautical miles, a third of what it was before the protests. Israel said earlier this week that it would allow fuel and gas to be transferred via Kerem Shalom, and widen the fishing lanes, partially lifting the restrictions, should a shaky ceasefire hold.\u0026nbspNeither side to date will back down, saying their respective responses are fair and legitimate. This has created a cycle of violence that has reached boiling in the last week, with warnings from the UN that a war could break out.Q. Why is the UN fearful there could be another war? \u0026nbspOn Friday, 20 July, Israeli Staff Sergeant Aviv Levi, 21, was killed by what the Israeli army called a “violent raid” during the protests.\u0026nbspIt marked the first time an Israeli soldier was killed by Palestinian gunfire near Gaza since the last war in 2014 and so crossed a definitive red line. Israel said that gunmen had shot at and lobbed grenades at its soldiers. It responded by bombarding Gaza with tank and air fire, and said its forces struck 60 “military sites” run by Hamas.Four Palestinians were killed that day. Palestinian health officials said that at least one was a civilian. Earlier in the month, there was the most intense exchange of fire between Gaza militants and Israel since the 2014 war - largely due to the border protests.\u0026nbspEgypt has intervened several times enforcing ceasefires which keep being broken.\u0026nbspGazans protest as US embassy moves to Jerusalem – in picturesPalestinian mourners carry the dead body of Mukhtar Ebu Hamas, 25, killed by Israeli forces in Gaza on 14 MayA Palestinian woman flashes a victory sign during a protest near the border fence Israeli soldiers guard on top of a watch tower along the Israel-Gaza borderPalestinian demonstrators react to fired tear gasPalestinian demonstrators run for coverUS President\u0027s daughter Ivanka Trump and her husband Senior White House Advisor Jared Kushner arrive for the controversial inauguration of the US embassy in Jerusalem.

He said it was “imperative” both Israelis and Palestinians abide by the ceasefire.On Monday,\u0026nbspZeid Ra\u0027ad Al Hussein, the UN’s human rights chief, called for an investigation into Israel’s actions at the border calling the most recent killings “shocking”. He said it was also vital to address the root causes of the Gaza demonstrations which would continue, as living conditions under Israel’s blockade are “grossly inadequate”.\u0026nbspPalestinians in Gaza, including the armed factions, say the Israeli security forces have used live ammunition against peaceful protesters, and launched devastating airstrikes on the strip, killing dozens of people. They said that Israel has also exacerbated a humanitarian and economic crisis within the enclave by adding the new restrictions.\u0026nbspIsrael maintains Hamas, that it regards as a terrorist group, has incited violence and endangered the lives of Israelis near the border. It says the fires caused by the burning kites have caused significant damage to farm land.Q. Who are the protagonists?The main protagonists are Israel and its army, and the myriad armed factions within Gaza, that answer to a central operations room that is ostensibly led by the militant arm of Hamas – called the Qassem Brigades. Within that are vastly different factions, with anything ranging from small far-left Marxist armed groups like the National Resistance Brigades to Islamic jihad’s al-Quds Brigade.\u0026nbspQ. What is at stake?For this region, everything. In the last war more than 2,200 Palestinians, and 73 Israelis, were killed. Gaza took several years to recover and still has not been fully rebuilt. More fundamentally is the moribund Middle East peace process, which is arguably dragging into its eighth decade. A new devastating war would only put another nail in its coffin.\u0026nbspEgypt, that has long held a position as mediator in the Israel-Palestine conflict, has reportedly intervened multiple times in the past few weeks to broker a ceasefire. Last week\u0026nbspHamas said it once again stepped in and brokered a truce but it keeps being broken.\u0026nbspMost recently on Wednesday, Israel fired a barrage of tank and artillery shells at what it identified as military targets within Gaza, after one of its soldiers was injured during an earlier cross-border exchange of fire. Three Palestinians were killed during the tank fire,\u0026nbspHamas\u0026nbspconfirmed the dead were members of its group.\u0026nbspQ. What is going to happen now?Both sides of the conflict, as well as civilians, have repeatedly expressed an interest in stopping the current escalation from tumbling into a full-blown war. Further deaths will only worsen the situation.Q. But if neither side wants war why does the violence continue?\u0026nbspHamas is in a tricky position. Gaza is experiencing one of the most severe economic crises in its recent history. There are many reasons, including the Israeli blockade, new sanctions from the Palestinian Authority which is dominated by Hamas’ secular political rival Fatah and a massive shortfall in International aid funding.\u0026nbspIn a bid to force Hamas to relinquish power over Gaza, last April the PA ordered early retirement for nearly a third of its 60,000 Gaza employees as well as restrictions on electricity access to Gaza. In May it slashed salaries to its civil servants in the enclave by at least 20 percent, piling on more pressure.\u0026nbspCash-strapped Hamas, that once relied on taxing goods smuggled through tunnels to Egypt, has also been unable to pay its own 40,000 employees in full.Meanwhile the United Nation’s refugee agency UNRWA said it is suffering from an “unprecedented” £164 million funding shortfall, after the US said it was slashing more than 80 percent of its \u0026nbspfunding to the agency. This has only exacerbated\u0026nbspthe problems. This week UNRWA\u0026nbspannounced it was getting rid of\u0026nbsp250 jobs in the Palestinian Territories, including more than 100 in Gaza.\u0026nbspThe 1.8 million residents\u0026nbspof Gaza, who are\u0026nbspalready suffering from one of the highest jobless rates in the world, cannot sustain further devastation and many are increasingly frustrated with their own leaders.\u0026nbspMembers of Hamas’s Palestinian political rivals in Gaza have told The Independent that Hamas wants the focus of Gazans\u0027 anger to be directed towards Israel, which it regards as an occupier, rather than at local government and themselves.\u0026nbspAnd therefore, the protests at the border cannot stop.\u0026nbspIsrael, meanwhile, is facing a potential war at its northern border as well as its frontier with Gaza. \u0026nbspOver the last months, Israel has been increasingly concerned by Iran’s attempts to build permanent military infrastructure near Israel in Syria, where Tehran is backing Syrian President Assad and the rebels. Iran and its allied forces have fired into Israel.\u0026nbspMembers of the Israeli army and government have told The Independent they have no interest in fighting a war on two fronts. But at the same time Israel is facing pressure from its own people to stop the burning kites and violence at the border.\u0026nbspIt all depends on whether the Egyptian-brokered truces can hold.\u0026nbspGreat March of ReturnEnter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Heres what we know.Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 took off from Kuala Lumpur and was heading to Beijing with 239 people on board.Passengers included Chinese calligraphers, a couple on their way home to their young sons after a long-delayed honeymoon and a construction worker who hadnt been home in a year.But at 12.14am on March 8, 2014, Malaysia Airlines lost contact with MH370 close to Phuket island in the Strait of Malacca.Before that, Malaysian authorities believe the last words heard from the plane, from either the pilot or co-pilot, was Good night Malaysian three seven zero.Satellite pings from the aircraft suggest it continued flying for around seven hours when the fuel would have run out.Experts have calculated the most likely crash site around 1,000 miles west of Perth, Australia.But a huge search of the seabed failed to find any wreckage - and there are a number of alternative theories as to its fate.Malaysian captain Zaharie Amad Shah was flying MH370 when it disappeared.Shah, born July 31, 1961, was described as a veteran pilot who joined Malaysia Airlines in 1981.A father of three, passionate cook and keen fisherman, Shah lived with his wife in a luxury gated community where he was said to have built his own flight simulator.In the wake of the planes disappearance, rumours surfaced claiming his wife had moved out of their home.The co-pilot was Fariq Abdul Hamid, 27, who was on his first flight on a 777 as a fully approved first officer.He had flown five times before with a check co-pilot overseeing him.But he had 2,763 hours experience flying other jets before moving to the larger aircraft.Fariq was reportedly planning to marry his girlfriend.On January 17, 2017, the governments of Malaysia, China and Australia called off the official search which almost spanned three years.The Australian Transport Safety Bureaus final report said authorities were no closer to knowing the reasons for the planes disappearance or its exact location.Only 33 pieces of wreckage were found during the hunt, which saw investigators searching the deep sea areas near to the suspected crash site in the Indian Ocean, and scanning the water from the air.Ocean Infinity started a new search on January 22, 2018, following a failed £111million search for the plane.This search was set to end on May 29.But theyve launched one last-ditch search trip to find the missing planes black box.Theyll be sending a ship to the remote spot in the Indian Ocean where an ultrasonic pulse - which may have been from the planes black box - was detected in 2014.Years of investigations have yielded no concrete conclusion as to what downed Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 in March 8 2014.The Malaysian government is releasing the findings of what it says will be its final probe on Monday July 29 2018.Malaysian transport minister Anthony Loake said: Every word recorded by the investigation team will be tabled in this report.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

OK, later you might find a hash brown stuck halfway up your bottom, but it’s worth it, just for the pleasantly cool sensation.It’s been a lovely summer, the best that I can remember since 1976. That summer was the happiest time of my life. But this hasn’t been bad, has it?But there are downsides to the driest and warmest spell we’ve had for years.Public transport isn’t always much fun, especially if you’re crunched up on the Tube next to a large bearded lady who last washed when hula hoops were all the rage.If you live in the country, there are mosquitoes — I’ve got bites in ­places I ­forgot existed.Work can be a bit of a chore. And if you’re a smoker, the pub gardens are suddenly full of tossers who waft their hands around if the smoke goes anywhere near them.Where were you when it was snowing, huh? I was there, lighting my Superking in a blizzard, while you were tucked away inside.But the hot weather is very good for us.There’s a link between clear, sunny days and good health — mental as well as physical.People feel better about themselves and tend to spend more money, which is good for the economy.OK, crime rates tend to increase when the weather is hot — more precisely, when the temperature ­hovers between 28C and 32C, according to psychologists.But on the whole, this summer — a proper summer, at last — is something to be enjoyed, cherished and remembered. We don’t have them very often.We can admire the women walking around with not many clothes on and laugh at the men dressed in toddler shorts with beer bellies hanging down to their knees.We can relax with a beer and forget about bloody Brexit for a while.The authorities think of nice summers as altogether something very different.For them, nice summers are a crisis.That’s why those tiresome drongos at the Met Office put out an amber alert when the temperature rose this week.“Don’t go out! Stay in your homes! Or you will die — DIE, I tell you.”Oh, with the greatest respect — f*** off!We’ll go out when and where we please, thank you, so you can stuff your advice where the sun isn’t shining.And, of course, the climate change ­monkeys are in full voice.“This is it! The end of the world! Look at the incredible temperatures and those wildfires in poor Greece. We told you!”Give it a rest. I think there is something to global warming. I am not a denier. But I remember the last few ­summers we’ve had — rainy and cool — and the climate change monkeys saying THAT was a consequence of global ­warming, too. You can’t have it both ways.And there have been wildfires in hot, dry areas for the past 100,000 years.So enjoy this wonderful heatwave while you can. Because someday, quite soon, it will be gone and the rain and the cold will be back, and the Christmas adverts will start appearing in supermarkets.And this summer will just be ­something you talk about in years to come. Remember the summer of 2018? Wasn’t it brilliant? If only we could have it again.Carlos Delacruz was in court in Scotland accused of having sex with two women with something other than a penis.The lasses THOUGHT it was his todger. But then, the lights were off.And the sad truth is that Mr Delacruz does not have a penis. Not even a small one.The women complained the sex was painful. So what was it, then?It was referred to in court as an “unknown object”.Here are my guesses:Incidentally, the prosecuting lawyer was called Ms Cockburn.No kidding, love.NO sooner has the World Cup finished than the domestic football season is about to begin.And with it the endless round of transfer speculation.If you’re still wondering why England didn’t win the World Cup, check out how many top foreign teams are trying to buy our players.None.

I just want to say that you are a f***ing disgrace for helping to keep the Tories in power. I hope you die soon.”Lefty Remainers are a lovely bunch, aren’t they?IS it actually the law that all pop musicians must end up skagged out of their heads and taken to hospital?And then, if they survive, check into some poncey rehab clinic and tell their fans they are “fighting my demons”.And then come out of rehab and get skagged out of their heads again.The latest is Demi Lovato.I must admit I’m not a huge fan, but still.First time we knew anything was amiss was when she forgot the lyrics to one of her songs. The track was called Sober.So let’s wish her a speedy recovery from whatever foul substance laid her low.And remind pop singers that nobody looks cool in a pine box.THE Palestinian Authority has just revealed that at least half of the money it receives in aid goes to funding vile acts of terrorism against Israel. One Hamas bomber even pocketed £100,000.Please, think carefully and do your homework before giving money to charities working in Palestine.The British Government has already stopped aid to the Palestinian Authority. It’s time these Islamist thugs had the plug pulled on their slush fund from naive Westerners.LATEST news from the front line of scientific research on . . . crows.Apparently these birds are fond of a bit of necrophilia.Experts Dr John Marzluff and Kaeli Swift professed themselves “surprised” to seeing crows trying to have sexual intercourse with dead members of their species.The pair put this down to confusion caused by hormonal imbalance.I am not so sure. I have watched crows. And I can tell you that if I were forced to have sex with them I would much prefer it if they were dead.They would make that awful cawing noise if they were alive, and probably try to peck at your bits.Crows, I think, feel the same way.JUST a short word of congratulations to Jeremy Corbyn’s favourite country, Venezuela.The socialist paradise will soon experience an inflation rate of ONE MILLION PER CENT. That’s a pretty astonishing achievement.Most addled old Marxist dictators manage to keep inflation down to the low thousands.Meanwhile, Venezuela’s people are starving and every so often murdered or arrested by the foul Corbynista government.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But what sort of relationship do they want with us after all this is over?Talking about, and planning for, no-deal is not the “bravado” sneered at by Simon Coveney, deputy to pipsqueak PM Leo Varadkar. It is a vital precaution we should have begun two years ago.Leavers do not fear it, despite the panic Remainers are now deliberately stoking.Nor is it a bluff. It simply looks more likely every day. Especially on days when Irish politicians are wheeled on to pressurise us to shift even further towards Brussels’ fixed position.We have compromised far too much already. The EU must now cross some red lines. Why not? No country has left before. The situation is unprecedented. The EU’s response must be too.Ireland will be hit hard if no deal is struck.It should be pleading with Brussels. It can see Theresa May has no ­further room for manoeuvre without her Government imploding.And no, Mr Coveney, Britain doesn’t need “more time”.We need the EU to finally accept we aren’t changing our minds — unlike ­Ireland over the Lisbon Treaty and despite the Remainer clamour to do so.That way lies permanent servitude, global humiliation and political chaos.HOW can anyone guarantee a convicted paedophile or rapist is safe enough to be taken off the sex offenders’ register?The number of criminals winning that right since a law change six years ago is 1,230, including 632 child abusers.They no longer report to police or tell them if they are away from home.Even some put on the database “for life” can apply after 15 years to be removed. A thriving legal industry helps them do it.Decisions are simply at cops’ discretion. But how stringent are their tests when approval rates vary so wildly?We know “life” sentences in prison mean nothing. Now we cannot even trust “life on the sex offenders’ register”.Public safety must always come before the rights of potentially dangerous perverts.SOMETIMES we despair at our cops.They couldn’t be bothered looking into shoplifting at John Keppie’s sweet store. But they snapped into action with a warning over “data protection” when he put up CCTV pictures of the suspects.What is he meant to do? How does he prevent losses from thieving teenagers without a functioning police force?The local “Reducing Crime Partnership” even attacked John’s posters as like “returning to the Wild West”.It’s already a Wild West.

Things are said.” While one Cabinet minister remarks: “It is not a great surprise. He’s been saying no all along.”This minister’s view is that it is now “up to the member states” what happens next.But they aren’t likely to come to the rescue of May’s customs plan. I understand just a handful of them are interested in it.Most of them don’t want to let the UK collect tariffs on the EU’s behalf or to have to collect tariffs for the UK ­themselves. The sheer bureaucratic complexity of the scheme doesn’t make it appealing.So, what happens next? Well, as May has told the Brexit Inner Cabinet, Barnier’s real aim is to keep Britain in a customs union with the EU.His calculation is that faced with a choice between a customs union and no deal, Britain will buckle.The attraction to the EU of keeping the UK in a customs union is that it will keep the pattern of trade much the same as it is now.There won’t be any free trade deals that cut the cost of, say, Australian wine and reduce European producers’ share of the UK market.But Barnier is making a dangerous assumption in thinking Britain will accept a customs union in the end.May has repeatedly said that she doesn’t want one. In the unlikely event of her changing her mind on this, more ­ministers would resign from her Cabinet (two are already on the verge of quitting, according to their colleagues) and more letters would go in demanding a vote of no confidence in her.It is hard to imagine her surviving this. Brexiteers would argue that if the EU won’t accept May’s proposal, the UK should turn to the “max fac” customs plan.This doesn’t eliminate all checks at the border, but uses technology to hugely reduce them and speed things up.The EU, though, will say that this doesn’t solve the Irish ­border problem and match what May committed herself to in December. It was this worry which led to her rejecting “max fac” in the first place.Some ministers are now beginning to whisper about whether, in these circumstances, some separate arrangements for Northern Ireland would be so terrible. But May herself would never go for this.One Cabinet minister warns a separate deal for Northern Ireland would bring down the Government, “I can’t see how the DUP would accept that and we can’t govern without them”.This minister says that May has made a “bold and fair offer to the EU” and if they won’t work from that “we’re not going to end up with a deal with them”.There is a strong sense among ministers that the UK can’t carry on with Barnier saying no and the Government offering up concession after concession. In the words of one, “we shouldn’t sell the soul of the nation to have a deal with the EU”.Is no-deal the most likely outcome, then? Well, not yet.Some in Government believe they can reverse the EU’s threat — pointing out that if there is no deal there will be a hard border in Ireland. They hope this message might make the EU more amenable either to May’s customs plan or to a “max fac”-style solution.What’s for certain is that May’s meeting with other EU leaders in September is ­shaping up to be crucial. But May must make sure she goes to that meeting with a plan B.If Merkel, Macron and Co want more and more ­concessions on Chequers, May must simply change course and ­propose a Canada-style free trade deal.She should tell EU leaders — and Ireland’s Leo Varadkar in particular — that the choice is between that and no deal, with all it would mean for the Irish border.But MPs who are back in their ­constituencies  are telling me that they are getting  even more stick  than they  expected about her proposals.One  Tory predicts that time spent  in the constituency will “put a fire underneath MPs before they  come back, rather than calming them down”.THERESA MAY’S fundamental flaw as a politician is on display again. She is simply not very good at selling things.This was her problem in the General Election campaign and it is her problem now as she tries to persuade a sceptical public of the merits of her Brexit plan.Her trip to the North East this week was a case in point. Here was a chance to try to sell the deal directly to voters. But May failed to take it.She didn’t come with anything new to say, she didn’t ask voters to put themselves in her shoes or make a charismatic case for it. As one Cabinet minister laments: “She’s uncomfortable with ­people, including her own ­colleagues.”But May needs to sell this plan. If she cannot turn public opinion on it around – at the moment only 12 per cent of voters think it would be good for Britain – then she won’t be able to get it through Parliament.As May goes on her summer hols, she should be thinking about a big address to the nation in September where she makes the case for her plan. It could be her last best chance to save it.THE most alarming thing about Labour’s anti-Semitism scandal is that the extent of concern across the Jewish community about how Labour is dealing with the issue hasn’t been enough to make the party change course.It is now hard not to conclude that Labour’s refusal to simply accept the full International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance definition of anti-Semitism is worryingly sinister.It is tempting to put this all down to the Brexit effect, and that is – obviously – part of it.But what is striking is how volatile politics is right across the Western world. In the EU, the new populist Italian government will announce its budget in September, which could cause major problems in the eurozone.In Germany, a regional election could further destabilise the coalition there.While Spanish politics is about to be riled by it becoming the new centre of the migrant crisis.Meanwhile in America, August promises to be the most dramatic month yet in the presidency of Donald Trump  as his own lawyer appears to have turned on him.None of these situations is exactly the same.But there is a common root to this volatility: The aftermath of the financial crisis and the challenges posed by the fact it has never been easier to try to move from the poor world to the rich world.Until Western governments come up with answers to these questions, politics will be extremely volatile.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She is the same age as me. But that’s where the similarities stop. In fact physically, the only thing that is similar about our ­bodies are our toenails.But when I see pictures of her I don’t feel bad about myself or envious (on the contrary, I feel only admiration) because I know I have not put in any effort to look like that.I like cake too much, and I like going out with friends, having a drink, cooking and eating. And I am more than happy with my lot.The problem is, though, that a lot of women DO feel bad about themselves when they look at photos of beautiful women.They compare themselves and feel they don’t measure up that they are lacking or worthless. This is especially an issue for young girls.Talking about body image this week, Loose Women presenter Nadia Sawalha said she blames herself for her teenage daughter’s body issues.She thinks 15-year-old Maddie has developed insecurities by growing up with Nadia talking about her own.“She grew up around me being negative about my body and she picked that up by osmosis,” she said.Unfortunately, it’s true that girls are influenced by the way their mothers feel about their bodies.But the reality is it’s not just our mum’s body image that is informing ours.It’s the airbrushed adverts and the photos that have been photoshopped into flawlessness on social media, offering impossible standards for us to try to live up to.It’s the enhanced physiques of the Kardashians and the women on Love Island setting impossible standards of “femininity”.The bottom line is that women are constantly sexualised and judged on their appearance, so it’s all too easy for women to fall prey to the pursuit of a “perfection” that doesn’t exist.When “perfect” can only be attained with surgery and extreme dieting, or starvation, you are setting yourself up to feel inadequate and bad about yourself.Even when some women look like they’ve achieved “perfection”, they still feel bad about themselves.Megan on Love Island is a good example.She is absolutely stunning but still lacks confidence — the one key thing surgery and dieting can’t necessarily give you.The most important thing you can give to any young girl — or boy — is that belief in yourself and who you are, and the certainty that your personality is just as important as the way you look.The question is, how do you achieve this?One thing I always tried to emphasise to my daughter when she was young was that it’s not just your skin that people are going to judge you on.I never worried about my weight and never said I felt fat — even if I had put on a few pounds.I also emphasised that happiness is not about looks.It is about how you feel, and about the friendship, fun and laughter you have in life.Laughter and personality are infectious.People don’t want to spend time with people obsessed about their looks and their weight.They want to be around people who are interesting, fun and dynamic.Have you seen that film, I Feel Pretty? It stars Amy Schumer, whose character is fuller figured, wears big pants and is always on a diet.Then she bangs her head and wakes up thinking — and acting as if — she is drop-dead gorgeous.As a result, doors start opening for her and she can have any man she wants.It’s just a film, but it rings true: Confidence comes from within.So much about confidence comes down to attitude.If you are constantly thinking about your flaws you forget your positives.So next time you find yourself pointing out your flabby bits, force yourself to find a positive.Forget “perfect”, accept your flaws and focus instead on dressing for your body shape.If you don’t know how to, then ask a sales assistant — that is the beauty of going into a shop rather than shopping online.And there’s nothing wrong with a few props. I’m not a fan of cosmetic surgery but if a padded bra and fake tan make you feel better about yourself, then go for it.That way you’ll have more time to get on and enjoy life, rather than fretting that you don’t look like J-Lo.THE saga of Tini Owens, 68, who has been trying for several years to end her 40-year marriage to 80-year-old mushroom farmer Hugh, took a depressing turn when she lost her long-running legal battle to divorce her husband.In short, she insists their relationship has broken down but Mr Owens refuses to agree to the split.Despite her certainty that it’s over, and the fact they are now living in separate houses, five Supreme Court judges waved away Mrs Owens’ pleas to let her end the union.They ruled she must stay married – because Mrs Owens has failed to establish that her marriage had irretrievably broken down, as required by law.How farcical.We do not live in the Middle East, or the middle ages, and we are not owned by our husbands.So why is she being forced to stay married to him?And what kind of man wants to force his wife to stay married to him?They didn’t deny the conclusions drawn by people at the time that they would rectify the shocking pay-gap between the actors and give Claire a £100k cheque as back-pay.But now that the dust has settled, guess what? It turns out the back-pay bit was just a rumour and no such thing has happened.Given that they pledged at the time that there will be no gender pay parity for the new cast, that sounds like flawed logic.I ADMIRE Louise Redknapp for saying she “lost her identity” during her 19-year marriage to ex-husband Jamie.The former Eternal singer, 43, talked about the fallout of putting her successful career on hold to raise sons Charley, 14 and Beau, nine.I guess what partly happened is that Louise found her identity again after being in the 2016 series of Strictly, followed by the show Cabaret.Having put her life on hold, which would build resentment in even the most giving individual, Louise had a chance to rediscover herself.Either Jamie didn’t like that, or he felt he couldn’t be part of her new life.It’s such a good reminder of the importance of hanging on to your own identity in a marriage.Even if you are the stay-at-home parent, it’s important to find a way not to be the “Wife of” or “Husband of” someone else.And not just to prevent your spouse from losing sight of the person they fell in love with.The real issue is that you can forget who you are yourself.A lot of this comes back to shared parental responsibility.The more equality there is with parenting, the more space there is for both parents to retain their individuality.Here’s some unsolicited advice for any new parents out there.Even if all you think you want to do now is look after your kids, try to find a little bit of space that’s just for you.Hang on to the things that made you you before you had kids and you’ll be doing your marriage a huge favour.But what’s as important as having separate interests and experiences in a relationship is that you grow together.It’s good to take separate paths but make sure you’ve got a shared one too.You’re welcome!\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBRITAIN’S first “legal” red light district, in Holbeck, Leeds, was a great idea – on paper.It was created four years ago with the aim of stopping sex trafficking and violence, and combatting sexually transmitted infections by regulating the sex trade.The problem is, it hasn’t worked.In fact it’s caused a surge in sex and drug-taking in parks and woods – sometimes in view of children.Not only that but the number of reported rapes and sex assaults in the red light district doubled since it launched.There is no perfect solution for the world’s oldest profession.But perhaps we need to start considering a way to create safe and regulated brothels since street-walking is never going to be safe.I WAS sickened to read about the man who “rescued” an 18-year-old British au pair in Naples who had just been raped by two men.Allegedly, he offered to help her but then said, “It’s my turn now”, before raping her again.What kind of despicable human being “rescues” someone only to attack them?In my view, if he is found guilty, whatever sentence he gets should be doubled.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

There was a private event in his constituency which had nothing to do with his role as Minister for Housing.“I put it on his diary card to be helpful though it really wasn’t my res­p­onsibility to sort things like that. Next day he was raging. He had called my line manager in a fit at 10pm. He was furious — he couldn’t find the address.“The door number was wrong, everything was a mess and he had hit the roof about his diary management. My line manager, his private secretary, knew the error had been made by another PA and it wasn’t my fault.“We tried to explain but he had no time to listen. He said, ‘I don’t care. There is an issue with diary management in this office’. I was made to feel small and undervalued. He seemed to be avoiding talking to me which created an awkward dynamic.“He had some kind of personal issue with me. In the end the other PA admitted it was her error. Even then, there was not a single apology or acceptance he made me doubt my capabilities and my place in that office. I felt bullied. I was distraught. I felt wrecked by the way he made me feel.“His inability to accept when he is wrong is a nasty characteristic. It’s typical Dominic Raab behaviour.”Rebecca said she was not the only one in the office treated cruelly by Mr Raab, who replaced David Davis as Brexit Secretary on the same day she was given her P45.She said: “There were days he would call other staff and scream at them down the phone. It reduced one of my colleagues to tears. He called her later to say, ‘Sorry, I was overworked and over-stressed’.“If he didn’t like the format of a briefing, he would just say, ‘I’m not going to read it’. I felt it was impossible to work with him. The way he spoke to others was short and sharp. He’d cut people off.”Rebecca’s claims are not the first time the Esher and Walton MP has faced a storm over his attitude.In 2011, he branded some feminists “obnoxious bigots”, claiming men were getting such a “raw deal” that it was time they “started burning their briefs”. His remarks put him at loggerheads with Prime Minister Theresa May.Rebecca went on: “He was notorious for going to the gym every day for one hour and 15 minutes. I had to fit that in no matter what. There were times when it was just not workable and I’d say, ‘I’m really sorry, I’ve had to cut five minutes off the gym because you have a really important meeting.“His reaction would be, ‘No, you don’t have authority over the diary. You ask me first and then I make that change’. I found it patronising. His responses were just rude.“His tone was aggressive. You’d be mid-sentence and he’d say, ‘Stop. I don’t want to hear from you’. Whatever your status, there is no need to be like that with anyone.”Dad-of-two Mr Raab also sometimes refused to walk to the Commons from his office.Rebecca said: “It was just a seven-minute walk, but he requested the daily use of the ministerial car.”She claims there were ­simmering tensions with the staff of other ministers in the department. She said: “If I asked Dominic to take on a commitment that others couldn’t, he’d say, ‘They all seem to think this is one big happy family. It’s not. It’s me and it’s them’. He was referring to the other junior ministers. That remark stands out.”Rebecca was suspended in April after a newspaper sting revealed she had met men via the sugar daddy website SeekingArrangement. At the time Mr Raab went on radio to dismiss the scandal as a “storm in a teacup”.Then Rebecca was dismissed for breaches of conduct — a humiliating end to a career which began when she joined the civil service at 16.Rebecca is now setting off on a round-the-world voyage. She said: “I’m excited for a new beginning. This chapter in my life has closed, and I’m ready for the next.”A source close to Mr Raab said last night: “Rebecca was dismissed according to an independent process. This is an attempt to cash in by smearing with false and malicious claims.”Rishi Sunak, who worked with Mr Raab as a junior housing minister, said: “Dom was a great colleague, supportive and collegiate. I have tremendous respect for him.”A Housing Ministry spokesman said: “We do not recognise these claims and they do not reflect the department’s experience — including those who worked directly with the minister in his private office.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He was an extremely arrogant young man. The fact that he was not wearing a life jacket sums him up. He thought he was better than everyone else.“This has been his comeuppance resulting in the tragic, tragic loss of the life of a young lady. I send my condolences to Charlotte’s family.”He told how Shepherd had “a campaign of plugging in an electrical outlet and tripping all the electrics” in the school which he did not want named.He said: “For about six months we had electricians in trying to diagnose the fault and we could never get to the bottom of it until he was found with this device he had constructed to cause this chaos, and it did cause a lot of problems.“We reflect on students and I have discussed this with others, he had this arrogance about him and we felt at some point something bad would happen and tragically this is what it resulted in.“Despite everyone’s best efforts at the school to try, we weren’t able to help him behave with a bit more sensibility and turn his life around.”Web designer Shepherd, originally from Exeter, wed his childhood sweetheart after the tragedy and now has a two-year-old child.The couple have since split and he has been on the run since March and has not even spoken to his mum.He was blasted for his “cowardice” for failing to face justice at the Old Bailey.Charlotte, 24, was thrown into the river after she and Shepherd took his boat out onto the water during a first date in December 2015 after a champagne dinner at The Shard.He had been trying to impress her and didn’t even ask if she could swim. His date could be heard screaming “you’re going so fast” in her mobile phone video before the crash.Tragedy struck when she took the wheel and the boat hit a log and capsized - catapulting the pair into the freezing water. Shepherd managed to cling on to the upturned bow and call for help but Charlotte died from cold water immersion.THE Sun is offering a £10,000 reward to help catch speedboat killer Jack Shepherd.The show-off, 30, is on the run after he skipped bail before his trial for Charlotte Brown’s death.Police hunting Shepherd, of Paddington, central London, but originally from Exeter, suspect he may have fled the UK.His barrister Stephen Vullo QC said “cowardice” stopped him facing her family in court. Charlotte’s mum Roz Wickens, of Clacton, Essex, said: “When he is enjoying himself with his family, I will be “visiting Charlotte’s grave”.Det Sgt Christopher Davis said: “The family and the police are very grateful for the reward put up by The Sun.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The changes – which will be announced today following an eight-week consultation — will give “clear and consistent” guidelines and stop a potential boom of bogus claims for badges.Under the new rules, the badge will be extended to people who cannot undertake a journey without there being a risk of serious harm to their health or safety or that of any other person, such as young kids with autism.Others who will become eligible include those who cannot make a journey without suffering considerable psychological distress or have considerable difficulty walking.Minister for disabled people Sarah Newton said: “It is absolutely right that disabled people are able to go about their daily life without worrying how they will get from one place to another.“We’re taking an important step forward in ensuring people with hidden disabilities get the support they need to live independently.”National Autistic Society boss Jane Harris said the move would make a massive difference to the lives of many people.She said: “Just leaving the house is a challenge for many…involving overwhelming anxiety about plans going wrong.“The possibility of not being able to find a parking space near where you’re going can mean you can’t contemplate leaving the house at all. A Blue Badge will be a lifeline and prevent a life of isolation.”Sally Copley, of the Alzheimer’s Society, said: “This will be an absolute game changer for people living with dementia.It will bring great benefit to many of the 850,000 people currently living with dementia in the UK.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

You can even see her wondering whether she’s doing it right every time she crosses her ankles rather than her legs.I feel for Meghan, because she does have a difficult family. But it’s still her family.The broadside comes as Meghans half-sister Samantha warned her that their dad could die of sadness if she doesnt reconcile with him.She told the Sunday Mirror: “I’m desperate for Meghan to meet up with Dad when she’s back. If she doesn’t it would be really cruel and hurtful and would break his heart.“I speak to him every day. He’s very sensitive and I see his health suffering as a result of this. I hope they can meet in a quiet place, spend some quality time together and gain closure on what’s been an incredibly sad time for him.“If they don’t I’m worried he’ll die of sadness. I just want her to get in touch before it’s too late. Life’s short – neither of them deserves to be left with the consequences.”"},{"url":null,"title":"bridesmaid demands jetblue airline refund flight sacked bride","story":"The Ivy League student was meant to be flying cross-country to attend her pal Alexandras wedding.The disappointed former bridesmaid shared the email she received from Alexandra on Twitter.In the email, the bride-to-be asked Courtney to relinquish her bridesmaid duties because she was prioritising her studies.Courtney was then asked to send her jumpsuit in the mail to allow someone else to step into the role.While Alexandra was looking forward to seeing Courtney, Courtney felt she must avoid this wedding at all costs.In a tweet to JetBlue, the MBA student at Dartmouth College asked the airline to help out.Her tweet received lots of social media attention - racking up thousands of likes.In response, the airline offered to pay for a future girls weekend.JetBlue said they wanted to help make the old friendship feel like new.Some people agreed with JetBlues response.Reporter, Jessica Huseman, tweeted that the ticket should be transferred to a beach location and that Courtney should send the bride a picture of you swimming in the ocean in the jumpsuit.Others on Twitter also expressed their anger with the bride-to-be.One user said that brides need to stop treating their bridesmaids like unpaid interns.Some thought that Alexandra was justified in her actions.Ricki Spanish said: Im a woman.

There’s your baby – and that’s your baby’s heartbeat.Riley was born healthy and safely in May.Window to the Womb, in Chessington, South West London, sincerely apologised to the couple for the pre-birth blunder, which it described as an isolated incident.The clinic said extra training had been introduced, admitting: We recognise that we failed on this occasion.Dad Ben later called Dr Sharma to tell him of the error.

It was full of other young people and they didn\u0027t look like me. They all looked unhappy, just different, and I couldn\u0027t understand why I was there.I entered the room and the doctor diagnosed me with anorexia. I couldn\u0027t understand it: anorexics, I thought, were skinny and I certainly wasn\u0027t.I accused him of lying and told him to stop making me fat. I wasn\u0027t anorexic. Over the next few months things got harder. I felt completely trapped and gradually more out of control.My days were spent obsessively exercising, skipping as many meals as possible and either ending the day with a massive family row or eating dinner really quickly then heading upstairs to make myself sick.I used to sit in my therapy sessions being told that my body was falling apart and I was losing the fat round my organs. But I didn\u0027t believe anyone telling me this. I thought they were just jealous I had a best friend who made me feel so good.It spiralled out of control so fast that months after my first appointment at child and adolescent mental health services my heart nearly stopped and I was admitted to a mental health hospital where I spent the next year of my life recovering.It was the hardest year of my life: revisiting past experiences, learning to talk about my feelings and learning to accept that I needed help.After that year in hospital, I had developed a handbook of coping mechanisms - including learning to talk about how I felt, challenging myself around food, and getting rid of all emotions.But my biggest frustration was that people still thought your anorexia must be completely gone if you were a healthy weight.That is not the reality. There is so much more to recovery than gaining physical weight.Recovery isn\u0027t always a straight line either. You have to learn what triggers to watch out for, and to be aware if it gets tough again.As we entered in to 2016 I was feeling positive about life. I barely thought about my anorexia and I certainly didn\u0027t let her dictate what I did.But after my grandma passed away, anorexia used it as a reason to seduce me. She pulled me in when I was feeling weak and grieving, sucking me closer and closer. After four months of battling with this relentless voice in my head I reached out for help. I got an appointment at my local mental health trust, but because I wasn\u0027t underweight there was nothing they could do for me.My story isn\u0027t unique. In fact there are countless people who get turned away for not being \"thin\" enough, or not fitting a specific criteria. It isn\u0027t right or fair that this is still happening - and it means people with eating disorders aren\u0027t getting the treatment they need to prevent them getting worse.After I came through my relapse I decided that I needed to help others, so I wrote a book, Stand Tall Little Girl, and I began doing talks about mental health."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/15/06/2048x1152/australia-qatar-world-cup_3311381.jpg?20150604105239 ","title":"senior mp calls for proper investigation into qatar world cup bid claims","story":"Qatar said it \"rejected\" all of the allegations, while the international governing body FIFA said there had already been an investigation into Qatar\u0027s bid and no wrongdoing had been found.Reacting to the Sunday Times report, Mr Collins said: \"I think what needs to happen now is for there to be a proper independent investigation of the allegations published in the Sunday Times.\"I\u0027ve met the whistleblower myself and seen the evidence that he\u0027s brought forward.\"I think these are serious matters and there needs to be a proper independent investigation of them.\"Mr Collins added there had been a \"big loss of confidence\" in FIFA as a result of corruption allegations, and said the latest claims represent an \"opportunity to demonstrate that FIFA takes these issues much more seriously than it has done\".

Troops, helicopters and trucks could spring into action to move vital food, medicines and fuel if border controls break down. The shock report comes after ministers admitted they are considering the stockpiling of medicines and food supplies. Today leading doctors warned the treatment of thousands of cancer patients could be delayed, risking their lives, if there\u0027s no agreement by March 2019. Medical isotopes help around 10,000 patients a year but could become snarled up in border checks, experts warned the Mail on Sunday. Dr Jeanette Dickson, of the Royal College of Radiologists, said: These medicines are like a burning fuse.  They start off with a certain amount of radioactivity and you have a set time to get them to hospital when they are still effective. If you delay them for a fews hours, you begin to lost activity. Meanwhile supermarket giant Aldi reportedly emailed suppliers asking them to help understand potential implications and mitigate any negative impacts of No Deal. That prompted one anonymous coffee supplier to consider keeping up to eight weeks\u0027 stock instead of four, according to the Sunday Times. And a supermarket chairman told the newspaper: We\u0027re probably still a few months off, but there will come a point in this calendar year where, if people are going to book extra warehouse space or make additional transport arrangements, they will have to start doing it because there isn\u0027t unlimited capacity. Aldi has not commented on the reports.  Brexit talks remain in deadlock ahead of an October deadline, forcing the UK government to ramp up backup plans for No Deal. Imperial College London research in March claimed there would be 29-mile, five-hour tailbacks to Dover if the time to clear customs paperwork doubled from two minutes to just four. And plans are being considered to turn the M26 motorway - a key artery to the Kent port - could be turned into a 10-mile lorry park for 1,400 trucks.

Ian Austin claimed Labour is becoming a much more extreme party as he became the second MP to be investigated for attacks on the Labour leader. Party chiefs are probing the Dudley MP, a serial critic of the leadership, for abusive conduct after he confronted Labour chair Ian Lavery and branded action on anti-Semitism a bloody disgrace. Sources told the Mirror\u0027s Kevin Maguire he also called the shadow cabinet minister a f***ing b*****d and a w****r - claims Mr Austin denies.  It comes days after it emerged veteran MP Margaret Hodge is being probed for confronting Mr Corbyn and calling him an anti-Semite.  She was also accused of using the f-word, which she also denied.  Today Mr Austin, whose adoptive father fled the Holocaust, said he was upset about the leadership’s failure, I think refusal really, to deal with this properly. Mr Austin admitted his confrontation with Mr Lavery was “heated” but said “did I scream abuse at anybody? No I didn’t.” He BBC Radio 4\u0027s The World This Weekend: I’m really shocked that a party that’s got a proud tradition throughout its entire existence of fighting racism has ended up causing such huge offence and distress to the Jewish community in Britain. I think this could never have happened before.  “I’m appalled that it’s happened, I’m ashamed of the Labour Party , I really am.  “And I think if I’m honest we’re becoming a different political party - this could never have happened in the past.  Attacking Mr Corbyn, he added: He’s spent his entire time in politics on the extreme fringes of the Labour party supporting and defending all sorts of extremists and in some cases, frankly, anti-Semites. That’s why I thought three years ago he shouldn’t be the leader of the Labour Party and that’s why I think now that somebody with views and a history like his isn’t really suited to the leadership of a mainstream political party. “I was worried that what would happen is a mainstream social democratic party would be turned into something much more extreme. That’s what I fear is happening - that’s what I’m worried about. It comes amid an angry debate within Labour after the party failed to adopt the full International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) definition of anti-Semitism. Labour\u0027s code explicitly endorses the IHRA\u0027s working definition of anti-Semitism, but it omits four examples from the IHRA list.   Labour insisted that while the examples are not reproduced word for word, they are covered in the new code.  Shadow Justice Secretary Richard Burgon said he was not going to condemn Mr Austin because it is important that people who have strong opinions… can express themselves. He added: Jeremy doesn’t associate with the people who make the kind of extreme anti-Semitic comments that have been described on social media. It’s quite right that he doesn’t - he condemns them.” Some Labour MPs rallied behind Mr Austin today. Siobhain McDonagh called him a nice man, great MP adding: This is madness. Peter Kyle added: If the exchange reported is the one I witnessed, it was far from ‘abusive’. Labour will not solve the antisemitism problem it has by disciplining children of Jewish refugees like Ian Austin, but by listening to them. This cycle of madness must end.

The Prime Minister has been warned by her own constituency chairman that she must not concede any further ground to the EU. Seven chairmen of Cabinet ministers’ Conservative associations today said they either oppose the plans in their current form or would withdraw their support if Mrs May offered any further concessions to Brussels. Richard Kellaway, the chairman of Mrs May’s Maidenhead Conservative association, said: “If it were to be diluted it would ultimately not be acceptable”. Lib Dem MP and Foreign Affairs spokesperson Christine Jardine warned that Brexit could be determined by Tory internal party fighting. She said: “Yet again we are hearing about internal party fighting that could determine the position of the Prime Minister. In the interests of the country, we must demand better.  “As long as the Tories are dominated by these massive internal divisions they simply cannot be trusted to do the right thing.”  It came as former Home Secretary Amber Rudd hit out with a vicious attack comparing Brexiteers in her own party to climate change deniers.  Trade Secretary Liam Fox famously claimed a post-Brexit trade deal with the EU would be one of the easiest in human history. But Ms Rudd wrote Brexit will not be straightforward, adding: Anyone who claims it will is being as cavalier with people\u0027s future as those who deny that the belching of fossil fuels into the atmosphere is warming the planet.  Just as we must listen to scientific warnings about the risks of manmade climate change, so we must listen to the businesses and economists warning a chaotic Brexit will threaten our economy. Meanwhile ex-Chancellor George Osborne warned the Tories are politically screwed if they do not reconnect with modern Britain. In an GQ interview the Hard Remainer claimed the 2016 referendum was a vote for hybrid membership with the EU - risking the fury of Brexiteers. He added Tory Leave-backers are being found out as they try and put off the actual effects of leaving for years to come. The growing Tory row came as Mrs May was also warned by Italy’s deputy Prime Minister to take a hard line with the EU over Brexit negotiations or risk being cheated.  Right-wing populist Matteo Salvini said Mrs May should be prepared to walk away without a deal, adding: “On some principles there is no need to be flexible and you should not go backwards.” Her white paper sparked the resignation of Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and Brexit Secretary David Davis. Some Tories have backed it but warned it should be a line in the sand - not a starting point for negotiations.

Rebecca Tott, 21, said she felt bullied by the Brexit Secretary after she was dismissed for leading a double life as an escort following a Daily Mirror expose. Ms Tott\u0027s allegations were vigorously denied today. The government said it did not recognise them - and a source close to Mr Raab branded them an attempt to cash in by smearing with false and malicious claims. We revealed in April how Ms Tott told an undercover reporter, posing as a wealthy \u0026shybusinessman, that for \u0026pound750 he could have “full undisputed access to me”. Mr Raab\u0027s then-diary secretary also accused the minister of having the same lunch from Pret a Manger each day - which he denied. Since then high-flier Mr Raab has been promoted from Housing Minister to Brexit Secretary. He now sits in the Cabinet and leads crucial talks with Brussels.  Meanwhile Ms Tott, also a high-flier who entered Whitehall as an apprentice, has been dismissed from her job, a government source confirmed. Today Ms Tott spoke out about Mr Raab\u0027s alleged behaviour in her first interview since being sacked. She claimed he had the nasty tendency not to admit he was wrong, hit the roof over a diary mixup and demanded he was driven the seven-minute walk from his Whitehall office to Parliament. There were days he would call other staff to scream at them down the phone, she told the Sun on Sunday. It reduced one of my colleagues to tears. He called her later to say \u0027sorry, I was overworked and over-stressed.  Ms Tott claimed Mr Raab complained at having five minutes cut out of his gym regime and used an aggressive and patronising tone. I felt it was impossible to work with him, she said. The way he spoke to others was short and sharp. He\u0027d cut people off. She added: No woman should have to go through it again. It was an outright abuse of power. The Mirror did not name Ms Tott in our initial investigation. However, she was later named by other newspapers before giving today\u0027s interview. Brexiteer and karate black belt Mr Raab, 44, has enjoyed a controversial rise to power since being elected MP for Esher and Walton in 2010. He sparked fury last year by saying most food bank users are not languishing in poverty, and when a disability activist told him people are dying under Tory austerity, he described her calls for cash as a childish wish list.  He also put out a pamphlet in 2011 that suggested exempting small firms from minimum wage laws for workers under 21. In the same year he said feminists are now amongst the most obnoxious bigots and said it was time for men to start burning their briefs. Today junior housing minister Rishi Sunak insisted Mr Raab was a great colleague, supportive and collegiate and I have tremendous respect for him. A Housing Ministry spokesman said: We do not recognise these claims and they do not reflect the department\u0027s experience - including those who worked directly with the minister in his private office.

Imre Marton, 33, is so scared he lives like a recluse. He covers the windows of his home with film and thick black \u0026shycurtains so no one can see in. And his ordeal goes on despite his tormentor Charlie Howells being behind bars for a second time because she has \u0026shysuggested she has accomplices ready to help her and his “days are numbered”. Imre said: “I never feel safe. I know she won’t stop and this is never going to end. I am living in fear, always looking over my shoulder. I am sure that one day she will kill me. It’s the end goal for her. Her mission is for us to die together,” Imre’s nightmare began in 2012 when Howells, 24, first boarded his No32 bus in Oxfordshire. She began memorising his schedules. Her bizarre \u0026shybehaviour \u0026shyincluded standing just inches behind him so she could sniff him.  After she declared her love for Imre and he rejected her, Howells began \u0026shybombarding him with thousands of \u0026shymessages – \u0026shysometimes up to 500 a day. They included proposals, suggesting they tie the knot on a bus, and claims she had found his home address. Imre reported her and after four years of \u0026shytorment she got two years in May 2016. He spoke to the Sunday People after the case and in November 2017 took part in BBC documentary My Stalker and Me to help raise awareness of the issue. But his appearance re-ignited Howells’s campaign and she messaged him on Facebook to say: “You are the biggest fool ever, going on TV saying you wear a stab vest.  Well now Charlie knows where not to stab you… You thought your life was in danger then, there are many people out to get you now. I’d watch my back if I was you, you have been warned!!!!” Earlier this month Howells was jailed again for three years at Oxford crown court and given a ten-year restraining order. Imre, who left the city in January but is too scared to say where he is, said: “I take no comfort in her getting three years. “It just gives her more time to plan what she is going to do next – and that terrifies me.” Recalling how the campaign started, he said: “I’d feel her breath on me. She was like a ninja, she would \u0026shyappear from nowhere. She was always there.” After his rejection, Howells began turning up in shops and cafes Imre was visiting. On the bus she played One Direction songs and handed him notes.  Police gave Howells a \u0026shywarning but she found Imre on Facebook. He was forced to delete his account and apply for a transfer out of the city centre. Howells found him again and in August 2014 he won a two-year \u0026shyrestraining order – \u0026shybanning her from the city, his route and any contact. She ignored it. Imre said: “To avoid her, I cut my bus shifts and began working as a bouncer but she found me, getting my number from a driver who didn’t know how dangerous she was. She called every minute of the day.” Imre called 101 or 999 every time but her stalking campaign escalated. In 2015 Howells first said she was going to kill him – running a finger across her throat as she made the threat. Terrifingly, in April that year, Imre was with a colleague when Howells threw water in his face which he feared was acid. He said: “I felt lucky it was only water but it made me realise how easy it was for her to harm me.” In August, with Howells screaming “like an animal” at him, he called police again. She was remanded in custody and Imre secured a two-year restraining order. Howells was then twice convicted of breaching her restraining order and jailed in June 2015 for eight weeks. After persistently ignoring the order, she got two years in May 2016. The order was extended to five years.  But even with Howells behind bars, Imre was not safe. The first message he got was from a “friend” of hers, who Imre believes was a fake account. She continued to declare her love for him when she was released in August last year. Despite Imre blocking Howells, she kept creating new accounts. After he \u0026shyappeared in the documentary, her messages took an even more sinister turn. Chillingly, Howells told Imre: “If I can’t have you, no one else will.” She also told him on the bus and in the street that they were “going to die together”. The stalking escalated and in January Howells, of Shrivenham, Oxon, was held again after turning up at a bus stop and shouting and screaming at him. Police found she had a blade. Imre said: “I felt scared. I was told she was saying she is going to stab me in the neck and she had a knife.” He took a lower-paid job, which he does not wish to reveal, and left Oxford. He did not go to court on July 5 to see her locked up again. Imre said: “Even though she is behind bars again, I am still in constant fear. Everywhere I look, I think of her. She’s ruined my life.” Howells got three years after admitting breaching a restraining order, intimidating a witness and possessing a bladed article. But Imre said the term “is not long enough” and his own life is now more like serving a sentence.

But before your kids will be happy riding on the road they\u0027ll need to have some practice. This might include tarmac-surfaced bike paths or very quiet roads. But as they get better on two wheels you\u0027ll want to help them get used to road cycling to prepare them for when they\u0027re ready to venture out alone. 1. First thing to do: get their bike checked  Before you set out on any bike ride, make sure everything is in good shape for the ride ahead.  Halfords offer a Free Bike Check , giving you complete confidence without having to get your hands dirty. In-store experts will check tyre pressure, brakes and gears. If they spot anything that needs attention, they can fix it too.   2. Start traffic-free   One way to get started cycling on the road is to follow a national bike route and take a small diversion.  Sustrans , the cycling charity, has loads of great family rides that are either entirely traffic-free, or mostly. But if you want to give little ones a quiet road to practice on then you can always find one along the way.  Because these routes are also shared with pedestrians this gives you a chance to educate your little ones on being considerate and safe. Explain that they should stay on one side, not zig-zag across the whole path. Treat these paths like a road and make it into a fun game that helps your kids learn.  3. Pick the right bike   Hybrid bikes take elements from road bikes and mountain bikes, so they are a great choice if you are looking for something that\u0027s great on the roads but also suitable for some slightly rougher terrain.  A good option for younger cyclists is the Apollo Vortice Junior Hybrid Bike (above), \u0026pound120 (save \u0026pound10) which offers 18 gears with twist shifters for easy gear changes. Plus you get \u0026pound15 worth of free accessories when you buy a junior bike at Halfords right now.    Of course, it\u0027s equally important to invest in a good bike for yourself. The Carrera Subway 1 Hybrid Bike (above) is \u0026pound300 and ideal for mums and dads looking to head out on their own on an equally good set of wheels. Thanks to its lightweight frame and 24 gears, you’ll be able to tackle hills no problem, without fear that your kids will show you up!  With frames ranging from 14 to 22 inches, it\u0027s perfect for adults and teenagers alike. Disc brakes mean great stopping performance too.   If you are looking to upgrade your current bike then the Boardman MTX 8.6 Hybrid Bike (above) is is great and priced at \u0026pound500. It has you covered from road to trails with it\u0027s versatile design. The aluminium frame is light to save weight, paired with the Suntour NEX forks that are designed to give you complete control over mountainous terrain while off-roading.  Better still, Halfords are currently offering \u0026pound75 of free accessories and clothing when you buy any 8 Series Boardman Bike.  4. Keep the kids in tow            The other step you could take to get younger kids used to on-road cycling is to use a trail gator. Essentially a tow bar that connects a small bike to yours via a rigid metal bar. These mean that your children can be towed on the road by you, getting them used to the traffic in a safe manner.   They can pedal along and the Trail Gator (above) which is now \u0026pound40.04 (save \u0026pound29.95) keeps their front wheel above the road, meaning they can\u0027t cause problems by steering (but can still move the handlebars like mum or dad).   5. Use a good roadside bike route         Once your little one starts gaining confidence, head to a good local cycle lane that\u0027s close to a road. This is a good way of introducing your youngsters to the noise of the road and the movement of the cars. It also keeps them somewhat separate from other road users.  Routes like Manchester\u0027s Medlock Valley have a selection of different paths and road routes that might help to ease new riders into being confident on the road. Check Sustrans for local rides to you.  Once your kids are able to cycle in a straight line (roughly at least) and avoid obstacles without panicking then they\u0027ll feel a lot more confident about hopping on the roads.  The Carrera Subway Junior Hybrid Bike (above) priced \u0026pound208 (save \u0026pound52) will help your child get out and about in no time at all. It has a lightweight junior fit aluminium hybrid frame for a light and easy ride, complete with 21 speed Shimano Revoshift gears for slick shifting.   6. Helmets are a must         A well fitting helmet can seriously reduce the risk of a head injury, so you should get your kids in the habit of wearing one whenever they are out on their bikes. Feel free to let your kids pick a helmet that suits their personality. That way there will be no arguments when it comes to popping it on.  Halfords stock a range of fun helmets starting at \u0026pound10. Designs like the Paw Patrol Kids Bike Helmet (\u0026pound20), Disney Princess Helmet (\u0026pound20) and stylish Blogger Junior Bike Helmet (above) priced \u0026pound17 are among the most popular.  This colourful helmet has a comfy fit thanks to its removable pads and clever dial-fit adjustment system, and is topped off with plenty of vents to keep heads cool.  Adults will want to stay cool with the ventilated Boardman LC 8.6 Helmet , \u0026pound28, save \u0026pound12. The visor keeps weather out of your eyes and its nice and light for long ride comfort.  If you\u0027re not sure where to start, pop into your local Halfords and our friendly experts will help find the right helmet for you and your family.  7. Riding on the pavement - what the law says    It\u0027s technically illegal to ride a bike on the pavement. However, the advice given to police is to be sensitive to circumstances.  While they can theoretically stop young children (aged under 10) who are cycling on pavements, they have no powers to arrest, fine or even caution them. This is sensible, as young children should not be expected to cycle on the road. (source: cyclinguk.org )  Police are allowed to use their discretion - so adults, too, can get a pass for pavement cycling if there\u0027s a reason for example, cycling with your kids.  If you\u0027re on the lookout for your child\u0027s first bike, right now the Carrera Cosmos Kids Bike (below) is priced at\u0026pound128 (save \u0026pound32).   Ideal for kids who are confident enough to ride without stabilisers, the Carrera Cosmos Kids Bike has an aluminium frame, making it easy to manoeuvre, as well as genuine Kenda tyres and alloy V-brakes.

As the three-year-old poses on his \u0026shyloving adopted mum’s lap, few would realise the hell he has endured. Tony was just six weeks old when his parents violently swung him around by the legs, causing eight fractures. He was injured so badly that he had to have a double amputation.  But mum Jody Simpson and dad Tony Smith were only brought to \u0026shyjustice because of the determination of his adoptive mum Paula Hudgell. And Paula is still fighting for justice after Simpson, 24, and Smith, 47, were convicted of child cruelty and jailed for ten years. Paula, 50, is campaigning for \u0026shytougher sentences for child neglect and abuse. And she has spoken out after Simpson made a bid to be freed early from jail. She said: “Jody left her son close to death and now she wants sympathy. She can’t accept her guilt for what she did to her own child. “By appealing to have her sentence reduced shows she has no remorse.” She added: “Both his parents \u0026shydeserve to rot in prison.” Tony was just 41 days old when he was admitted to hospital with multiple organ failure, numerous \u0026shyfractures and sepsis.  By four months, he still weighed only 9lb 7oz but he was ready to be \u0026shydischarged into the arms of foster\u0026shy \u0026shycarers Paula and Mark, 53 – who have seven kids of their own. Paula first met Tony in February 2015. She said: “Tony was on the brink of death. My heart broke.” Tony’s body had inflated like a \u0026shyballoon fighting infections from thigh bone, lower leg, ankle, thumb, and toe fractures. Doctors said he may never be able to sit up or crawl and may face development delays from the amount of life-saving drugs he received. Paula knew little about Tony’s \u0026shybackground but alarm bells rang after meeting his birth parents, who told her the injuries had been a “terrible accident”. Paula and asset manager Mark took Tony home in Kings Hill, Kent, to meet their children Ben, 28, Chloe, 23, Ryan, 26, Kyle, 16, Jessica, 11, Jaden, ten, and Lacey, five.  Paula, a former market researcher, said: “I didn’t think too much about his parents – we were all just getting to grips with Tony’s medical needs. “But my stomach churned when it was time for his first supervised visit with his mum and dad. “His dad came bounding up, saying, ‘Thanks for looking after our boy. You’ll think us bad parents but it was just a terrible accident’. I couldn’t shake off the suspicion it was more than that.” In May 2015, Paula and Mark told social services they wanted to adopt him. A year later, he was legally theirs. Paula went straight to the police to voice her concerns but was told there was “insufficient evidence” to prove any abuse by Tony’s parents. She said: “I knew detectives were looking into the case but I had no right to information until I was Tony’s legal parent. “As soon as the adoption came through I contacted them and heard it had been dropped.  “I was devastated. I wrote a victim’s right to appeal letter to the CPS. Within weeks, a detective came to see me to explain why it hadn’t gone to court. I told them about my meeting with Tony’s real dad and what he’d said. He was shocked. He said there and then that he would re-look at the case.” Smith and Simpson were charged months later. They denied causing physical harm and cruelty to Tony. They told police they delayed taking Tony for medical help because they were waiting in for a plumber. Paula faced the pair in Maidstone Crown Court in February. She said: “I was terrified. But I’m a mum and you do anything for your child.” After the verdict, the judge told the court: “Tony’s adoptive family are stars. They are absolute stars.” Tony will be four in October and is learning to use prosthetic limbs, which he got just before Christmas last year.  Paula said: “He will never recover fully. Everything he does, he has to adapt to his own way. “Now he has stubbies – to try and help him use prosthetics in the future. He doesn’t like wearing them as they do restrict him. It’s a lot of hard work. “But he’s so happy. He took his first swim stroke without an arm band last weekend. We went on a day out to Peppa Pig World and stayed the night. “I was so proud as it was a huge achievement for him. He absolutely loves life at the moment.” Paula said Tony loves sport and is \u0026shytaking tennis lessons. She also has a positive outlook on Tony’s lifelong disability. She said: “The absence of his legs will not be a lifelong \u0026shyreminder of his parents’ cruelty. “It will be a reminder of what an incredible human being he is. He is a lovely boy and I am so proud to call him my son.

Jenna Langston, 33, spotted the infant in the baking hot car and raced to help him by forcing open the boat and then opening the doors from the inside. The little boy was soaked in sweat and had been left alone in the car for at least half an hour before Jenna arrived on the scene at the Asda store in Barnes Hill. Emergency services rushed to the supermarket and the baby was taken to hospital. Jenna, who works as a care manager, was at the store to buy her favourite egg custards when she saw the baby, believed to be just three months old, in the back of the car.   She told Birmingham Live : I saw a guard standing by a black car and initially thought: \u0027I hope no-one\u0027s left a dog in there.\u0027  I had already heard a tannoy announcement giving a registration plate while I was inside the store and quite a bit of time had passed since then. But a guard said a baby was inside. I dropped my shopping and ran over to the car. I said the baby needed to come out straight away - it was 31C. But the guard said they couldn\u0027t break in because it would be classed as breaking and entering. I said I didn\u0027t care and I was going to get the baby out. The guard said: \u0027We can\u0027t help you do that. I could lose my job.\u0027 All the doors were locked and none of the windows were open. I forced the boot and threw bags and everything else out to get access to the baby. I got myself into the boot and put my top half over the back seat. He was dripping with sweat - his babygrow was like it had been through the washing machine. I opened the doors to let some air in and someone else asked if I wanted to sit in their car with the baby as it had air conditioning. Then the police and paramedics arrived. I handed the baby over to the ambulance crew. They said he seemed fine but they had to take him to hospital. There was still no sign of the car driver - it had been around 50 minutes by now. Then she appeared, walking slowly back to her car.

The three dresses were created by designer Kate Tabor and took her over three weeks to make, using 20 metres of wetsuit material and 12 litres of foam.  Tabor took inspiration from the structural designs of Alexander McQueen and renowned haute-couturier Iris Van Herpen in creating the lip-smacking gowns.  The Couture creations were commissioned to celebrate the launch of Costa Coffee’s new Whipped Milk, which gives iced coffee drinks like the Iced Flat White and Cold Brew a silky mouth-feel while topping them with an elegant meringue-like appearance.  Kate Tabor, designer said: “Each dress is bespoke from a flirty minidress to an edgy asymmetric design and a classic, full-length bridal number all were inspired by the texture of Whipped Milk and the way it is poured. “I’ve created innovative costumes for everyone from David Bowie to The Chemical Brothers, but I’ve never designed anything as challenging or unique as Costa Coffee’s Whipped Milk Couture.” Designer Kate, who has created awe-inspiring costumes for music videos for the likes of Katy Perry and Kylie Minogue, began the process by sketching designs, then experimenting with delicate foams ahead of crafting robust neoprene shells, which supported the overall structure of the dresses. The painstaking application process took three hours per gown. The Whipped Milk creations mark the reinvention of Costa Coffee’s Iced Flat White and Iced Cappuccino drinks this summer.  The addition of Whipped Milk, an aerated skimmed milk foam topping, also forms the finishing flourish on summer menu items such as refreshing Cold Brew and in Costa Coffee’s new range of Milk Whips. Gennaro Pelliccia, Costa Coffee\u0027s Master of Coffee, added: Whipped Milk is Costa Coffee’s must-have summer drink addition, inviting coffee-lovers to enjoy their favourite hot choices as refreshing chilled drinks, perfect for the scorching weather we’ve been enjoying. “Coffee fans don’t even have to wait for Whipped Milk to make it from the catwalk to the high street, it’s already whipping up a storm in store now!” The Iced Flat White is expertly handcrafted by Costa Coffee\u0027s skilled baristas using the purest extract of the coffee bean.  In the same way the traditional ‘hot Flat White’ that fans know and love is finished with texturised milk so too is the iced version using the chilled Whipped Milk to recreate the luxurious silky texture. Cappuccino drinkers can enjoy the Iced Cappuccino made with either a double or triple extraction of espresso and topped with the delicate chilled milk foam. For a twist on your favourite Costa Cold Brew, try the Cold Brew with Whipped Milk. The meringue-like Whipped Milk floats beautifully on top of the Cold Brew and is a great way to add milk to the drink without diluting the coffee flavour and adding visual and sensorial excitement to the coffee drinking experience.

The mum-of-one arrived at the pub at around 2pm on Monday, July 23, and shortly afterwards Jack became overwhelmed. The pair, who are from Manchester, were enjoying visiting family in Llanaelhaearn during the first week of the summer holidays.  Miss Clough, an administrator for the NHS, told the Daily Post : “Jack was just making a bit of noise and it hadn’t gone on for longer than 30 to 60 seconds when a man walked over and said we should leave.  “I explained that Jack is autistic and I asked him to just give me a minute to calm him down but he responded by saying it wasn’t his f***ing problem and said he was trying to have a nice meal with his wife.  “I couldn’t believe it was happening, nothing like this has ever happened before. “He was looking at Jack and speaking about him like he was nothing, it was very upsetting. “I know my son and I knew by the noise he was making that it wasn’t going to be a full on tantrum, I knew I could calm him down. “If it had been going on for 10 minutes I might understand but it was 60 seconds at most.” Miss Clough said she became even more defensive over her son when the man said that his wife had “one of them at home”.  “I was sobbing by this point,” she said. “I didn’t swear but I told him I thought he was a horrible man. I felt he was bullying me and my son, he was just glaring at us” “Not one member of staff said anything,” she added.

I have no problem with the staff members at all”, she said.  “I’ve been to this Wetherspoons before and the staff have always been lovely. “My problem is with this individual, who was actually sitting five or six tables away from us anyway. “I understand that he is entitled to have a nice meal with his wife but Wetherspoons is family friendly - there were other children there making just as much noise. “I’ve never sobbed like that or been that emotional in my life. “It took me a long time to get to the point where I didn’t care what people thought and this has set me back.

The Met office has sai  d “ summer is not over by any means” as the country braces for temperatures over 35C.  Showers will stop from Tuesday, with temperatures increasing gradually throughout Wednesday and Thursday before they hit their mid-30s after the weekend. A high of 36C is expected into next week, the Weather Outlook said, because of high pressure and continental heat. It would beat the 35.3C day reached before the weekend, recorded as the hottest in three years.  Met Office forecaster Steven Keates said: “The weekend was not pleasant for people on summer holidays – but it warms up again later in the week. “The low 30s is not out of the question at the end of the week – and it could go higher, with forecast models showing the mid-30s after the weekend. Watch this space.” The Weather Outlook forecaster Brian Gaze said: “The weekend was an incredible contrast to the past two months – but it looks like the hottest day of the year is still to come. “With high pressure returning, we could well beat last week and see 36C.” It comes after Britain’s 58-day drought came to an abrupt halt over the weekend when temperature dropped 18C degrees. Atlantic storms of 60mph hit the country from East to West. The sudden change in climate was branded a “shock to the system” as it saw thunderstorms that brought three inches of rain.  Thunders of 130,000 lightning bolts - containing enough energy to boil water for a billion cups of tea - hit in 24 hours to early Saturday. Met Office forecaster Steven Keates also said: “This weekend was shock to the system after hot conditions. “Heavy rain and strong winds are impacting people on holiday, camping, at festivals and travelling. “But the hot air will come back later in the week to the South and Midlands, with very high values well over 30C shown on forecast models from a week’s time.” "},{"url":null,"title":"woman stung scorpion travelled 5000","story":"NewsWoman stung by scorpion that travelled 5,000 miles in her suitcase from Costa Rica to the UKThe woman from Waterlooville, Hants, was rushed to hospital after being stung by the scorpionShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByElaine McCahill17:51, 29 JUL 2018NewsA holidaymaker got the fright of her life when she was bitten by a scorpion which travelled back in her suitcase from Costa Rica (Image: WaterloovilleFireStn/Solent)Get daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA holidaymaker got the shock of her life when she was stung by a scorpion which had travelled back in her suitcase all the way from Costa Rica.

From a player who hasn’t played for a year you can see he can get about the pitch and he’s only going to get better.“I’m quite excited about him and I’m pleased he got on the scoresheet.“That opened it up because Peterhead worked really hard to try and limit us chances.“We’ve been working on that actually over in Portugal, midfielders coming from deeper positions into that area and he finished it well, too.“It was a comfortable finish, he didn’t rush it, though he did with one later in the game.“The over-riding feeling is we’re quite pleased to come away with three points because we were quite disappointed on Sunday.”Dundee went on to seal the three points in stoppage time as another new face found the net as Jean Mendy made it two goals in three games.Neil added: “I was pleased, clearly Peterhead were going to make it difficult.“They dropped everyone right off the ball and sometimes had 11 players in the last 40 yards of the pitch. That denies us space and it was difficult.“However, I thought we were patient enough and scored two really good goals.“We created a lot.

The first is my collections of jewellery which I design and make to be distributed to the shops that stock my designs up and down the country.“The second is my bespoke pieces.“This is where someone comes in with a design in mind or with a piece they want to be remodelled.“With my bespoke designs it is much more fun as I can be a bit more creative.“It can be a big responsibility as a lot of the time someone is grieving over the loss of a loved one and they want a piece to remember them by or they want a piece of their loved one’s jewellery reworked.“You can’t change it back, so it can be quite nerve-racking.“I have also incorporated people ashes into designs, so it can be a very emotional journey with my customer.“It is lovely that I can really help customers after the passing of a loved one with a piece that is incredibly sentimental.“The third part is teaching.“I have held workshops since the beginning. I think it makes the pieces more sentimental when someone has made the ring themselves.”After taking the plunge to work on her business full time only a year ago, Scarlett has urged anyone else in the same position to take that leap into self employment.“This business is my life and I love it. It is hard and scary to take that step but I am so glad I did it.

He has fantastic pace and loves to run at defences. He is strong on both feet, and I believe he will excite our fans,” said Csaba.After an unsuccessful spell in the Turkish second tier, Loemba is keen to get going in Scottish football.“I am happy to be with Dundee United, I am excited to play in Scotland and want to bring joy to our fans,” he said.Vastic comes in as United look to complete the final part of their rebuilding process since the end of last season.While Csaba is pleased to have secured the services of strikers Nicky Clark and Craig Curran earlier in the summer, he wants more height in his attack.

I don’t make any secret that we are bringing someone in from Austria Vienna, a big striker, I can have a look at,” said Csaba.“We are talking with one other player and hope the signings can be made, the deals are done.“I hope by next week we will have a complete team.”United also hope to be boosted by the sight of another new striker, Craig Curran, making his debut when they complete their Betfred Cup campaign at Elgin City this Saturday.Curran was due back in training today after the dead leg that’s sidelined him for the past two weeks.If he completes his work over the next couple of days without suffering a reaction, he will be on duty up north and back on course to be ready for the league kick-off against Dunfermline next week.“We have been working on Craig and, if he is OK, he can get 45 minutes against Elgin and that would be good news.”Defender Callum Booth is another who has been in the wars but could be back on duty at the weekend.The former Partick Thistle man picked up a knock at Ross County last week and missed out against Alloa but could be ready over the next couple of days.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"ten minutes each game has cost us says dundee united boss csaba","story":"\t\t\t\t\tCsaba Laszlo believes 10 minutes per game has been the difference between success and failure in Dundee United’s Betfred Cup campaign.That’s why the Tangerines are heading for Elgin on Saturday for what is a dead rubber.However, he’s seen enough from his team in the other 240 minutes of their group games to remain confident a successful league campaign lies ahead.“Unfortunately, a football match is 90 minutes. If we’d played 80 minutes we are the winners,” he said.“It sounds stupid but true. Against Arbroath, after 82 minutes if we put the ball out we keep one zero but we don’t and lose a goal.“In the next game (Ross County), for 80 minutes we made a good game and if we score from our penalty we win. We don’t score from the penalty, then they score and win but we had played a good game.“Then we controlled the game against Alloa but lost a goal, again in the last 10 minutes. So people say we are a bad team. We are not and not everything has been bad.”While he’s confident United will show that in the months ahead, Csaba doesn’t hide his frustration over being out of the Betfred.“We created pressure for the club, for the management, for the players and from the fans.“And we lost a lot of money, let’s be honest. So, I am really unhappy, but I can’t turn this back.“We have to do better. When we have 10 minutes to go and we are in the front, we have to win the game.”Any pressure the past three games has put on him does not, he’s stressed, match the pressure he puts on himself for every outing.“I always have pressure because when we lose I think why did we. For me, there is always the pressure that this is not OK. I think about it all the time and we have to find the solution tactically.”For the manager, that solution lies in getting the right mix between the passing style he prefers and a more direct Scottish approach.“Some people tell me I play too much continental football, we have to play Scottish football, kick the ball more off the front.“We’ll mix, keep the ball down and try to kick the long ball as well but just the long balls won’t be enough.“With Craig Curran injured we have had to use Paul McMullan as a No 9, up beside Nicky Clark sometimes.

It has completely blighted the community and many homes are now unsaleable.\"He said the proposed expansion would bring the substation boundary within 30 yards of the nearest property, and 75 yards of his home.He added: \"SSE refuses to acknowledge any fault or offer compensation of any kind.\"There appears to be no clearly established legal obligation for SSE to compensate, but there is a moral one, considering the substantial financial loss suffered by the residents and the spoiling of a peaceful rural atmosphere.\"He added that the planning authority, Highland Council, has expressed little interest in helping them.Mr Lanning said that in February he was forced to take his house off the market after a year because he could not sell it at \u0026pound40,000 below the market value.The substation began growing to accommodate the Beauly to Denny power line and the new renewable energy sources in the surrounding hills.Pensioner Mr Lanning, who has lived in the glen for 11 years, said: \"The substation has been enlarged about four times.\"There are liaison meetings but they are simply PR exercises.\"This is not just about me.

has admitted.Public anger over a lack of visible action at the site \u0026ndash which went up in flames in April 2013 \u0026ndash has been growing as assurances of forward movement repeatedly come to nothing.Most recently it was suggested that the scaffolding could be down by June after a planning application was lodged to demolish the remaining structure and rebuild.This was scuppered when Highland Council\u0027 conservation and building officer objected that, at one storey lower than the original, the proposed rebuild would not \"preserve or enhance the character and appearance\" of a designated conservation area.Historic Environment Scotland also voiced disquiet, sending the building\u0027 owners back to the drawing board.Now Inverness city manager David Haas \u0026ndash who has generally sought to paint the protracted discussions over the building in the most positive light \u0026ndash appears to have fully acknowledged the depth of dissatisfaction as the city finds itself in the midst of a sixth tourist season with the unsightly ruin still in place.\"We know it is taking far too long and that it is an unacceptable length of time,\" he said after the Inverness Courier again sought answers over progress.\"It is not moving as fast as we would like.\"It is frustrating but we want to make sure we get it right and we want to make sure it happens.\"We respect the fact the owners have to make the right decision for their own interest but we have to make sure we represent the public interest and that it is protected as far as the law will allow us to do that.\"Agent for the site owners, Gary Johnston, said they would not comment at this time.The last public announcement made by two of them \u0026ndash Mr Ali and Mr Cheng \u0026ndash came in a statement last month where they claimed \"a new way forward\" was being investigated, but would not elaborate on what that entailed.No more details were forthcoming when the Courier contacted Mr Johnston more recently.Pat Hayden, chairwoman of Crown and City Centre Community Council, said she is glad Mr Haas has finally admitted the situation is \"unacceptable\", believing the community is \"being made a fool of\" over the whole saga.\"It has been for a long time and we have the right as a community to ask for an update and to get one,\" she said.\"The whole thing has been kept very hush-hush and there has to be something wrong for it to have taken five years \u0026ndash there is a bad smell about the whole thing.\"Talking about the impact of so prominent a building sitting untended for so long she said: \"It looks like the people of Inverness don\u0026rsquot care.\"Chiropodist Jim Crawford, whose practice lies just beyond the former hostel in Stephens Brae, branded the ongoing situation \"a complete disgrace\", and repeated his previous calls for the council to compulsorily purchase the building.\"It has been \u0026lsquounacceptable\u0026rsquo since day one,\" he said.\"Mr Haas has been trying to keep everyone happy and now no-one is happy.\"Mr Haas insisted a lot of work is continuing \"behind the scenes\", including council officers working with the owners to provide the appropriate information to enable planning officials to provide, in return, the right advice regarding the outstanding planning application.\"We need facts and once we have the facts we can move forward,\" he said.\"We absolutely have the public interest at heart.

The stones would be patterned, partly to minimise slips and also to reflect foliage patterns from trees growing on the islands.A report from Inverness City Artworks Group states: \"While it was preferable to use natural stone, the cost might prove prohibitive and alternative materials might need to be considered.\"It was also minuted that if concerns were raised regarding the cost of this feature, the high cost of \"providing basic play equipment should be highlighted.\"The group was given assurances that the design would, when completed, look like part of the landscape, and members were told that Bespoke Atelier was confident that all aspects of the design could be met within the available budget.Path improvements in the vicinity are included in the application.Company director Yvonne Elliot-Kellighan said the stepping stone forms envisaged were inspired by the shape of the Ness Islands, and the stones themselves could be engraved with botanical patterns \"creating a ow and connection between stepping stones\".The children\u0027 feature is not far from MY Ness, a \u0026pound300,000 centrepiece which was unveiled as a concept in May and has still to receive planning permission.The River Ness Public Art Project is funded by Creative Scotland (\u0026pound305,000), Inverness Common Good Fund (\u0026pound250,000), HIE (\u0026pound66,000) and Highland Council (\u0026pound106,000).At a time of heightened concern about public spending, Highland Council has stressed that the vast majority of the money for the projects comes from third parties and cannot be used for other purposes, and the council\u0027 \u0026pound106k is from capital investment and not revenue spend.Sunday 29 Jul 2018 8:35 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116840.jpg","title":"New team aims to make changes easier","story":"\u0026nbspA NEW team of health and social care professionals has been established to support disabled people transition from children to adult services.People aged between 14 and 25 were traditionally supported by Highland Council\u0027s children\u0027s services and NHS Highland\u0027s adult services.The new transitioning team will provide a consistent platform for young people, parents and carers at what can be a challenging time.Nicola Stewart, transitions team manager, said: \"The team has been set up in response to recognising that the transition period can be difficult for young people and their families and carers.\"There are a lot of changes in a young person\u0027s life during that period, such as leaving full-time education and starting employment, and we don\u0027t want the process of transitioning from one service to another to exacerbate that.\"The overarching vision for the team is to take young people living in the Inner Moray Firth area through the process of transition and to support them in a more consistent way than has been possible in the past.\"Transitions team manager Stella Chisholm said: \"The establishment of the team will provide the opportunity for the one service to support an individual from 14 years of age all the way through to 25.\"This is a fantastic example of joint working.

It feels like ages before we can get home.”Senga hopes that Olivia will be ready to return to the north-east early next month.Despite the success of the surgery, Senga is under no illusions about the challenges facing Olivia.She said: “We’ve got so far to go.“Obviously with her in physiotherapy now, there’s so much to do, and so much muscle to build.“I think this time next year we’ll be able to notice much more of a difference in her.”Olivia is facing a gruelling physiotherapy regime, which sees her attending sessions twice a day.When she gets back home, the youngster will still have to attend sessions twice a week, to ensure her mobility is as good as it can be.According to Senga, a small change can already be seen in Olivia’s walking ability.She said: “It’s been great to see the difference in her from before the surgery and now.“She’s had muscles in her legs that she’s never, ever used before, so we’re trying to teach her out of some bad habits, but all the staff have been fantastic with us.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"chamber of commerce in new appointment to help lead new region projects","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAberdeen and Grampian Chamber of Commerce (AGCC) has made a new appointment to its leadership team.The business body has tasked Andrew McCallum to advise and support on policy and government affairs until the end of the year.Andrew, pictured, is the managing director of Aspect Reputation Management and will work with AGCC chief executive Russell Borthwick on a number of projects including transport improvements and business rates.The appointment comes after a change in the leadership team at AGCC.Earlier this year former policy director James Bream left the chamber to become general manager of Katoni Engineering.

Now scientists from the University of Aberdeen have added a third species to the mix \u0026#8211 the European pine marten. These native squirrel predators are recolonising Britain after years of persecution, and so the scientists set out to uncover the impact of this on red and grey squirrel populations.Three study sites in Scotland were in the Highlands (marten recolonisation for over 45 years, no grey squirrels), Central Scotland (marten recolonisation for 8-14 years, grey squirrels since 1945) and the Borders (early stages of marten recolonization, grey squirrels since 1980).Populations were monitored for five months using cameras and multi-species feeders \u0026#8211 the latter with glue strips on the underside of the lid to obtain visitor hair samples. This material provided DNA to determine visitor species and identify individual martens.The results showed that while red squirrels avoided feeders used by martens, greys were equally likely to use feeders whether frequented by martens or not. So grey squirrel numbers were reduced where exposure to pine martens was high, whereas numbers of red squirrels increased – unequivocal evidence that recovering marten numbers affect competition between red and grey squirrels.This finding is likely explained by the fact that reds, having co-evolved with martens, instinctively avoid areas used by martens but invasive greys, having no such instincts, showed no avoidance behaviour at all.Since pine martens’ range is increasing and extending southwards, scientists are optimistic that this will control the invasive grey squirrel species.As they say in the title to their report, in this case ‘the enemy of my enemy is my friend’.PIC:The native grey squirrel may have an unlikely ally.

We simply don\u0026#8217t have enough children playing shinty in each school to make up separate clubs.Surely, in 2018, this shouldn\u0026#8217t be allowed to happen?It is only three clubs that are being affected by this, and they\u0026#8217re all in the south of Scotland,  half way through a season, leaving all our kids devastated at the though of losing their chosen sport.My son has been playing shinty since Primary One. He is now heading into Primary Four and is even more passionate about the sport. He enjoys quality team time, striving to be the best he can and just loving playing the game.It\u0026#8217s very difficult to explain something like this to an eight-year-old child, never mind the Primary One children we have in our club.One quote from a child was: \u0026#8216Everyone is going to be so sad if we don\u0026#8217t have shinty. Why would shinty people do this to us?\u0026#8217It\u0026#8217s a very sad day indeed for the children of Argyll and Bute who are simply being punished for what school they go to and where they live. We have to stand together and fight for our club and our children.The Camanachd Association needs to step up and find a solution to allow all children to compete nationally and stand as one united shinty community.Ailsa and Alastair Crawford, LochgilpheadSir,The Camanachd Association has put politics before the needs of the children and the development of the sport in Argyll.The kids are disappointed and the coaches who have worked tirelessly to set the club up are deflated. Surely the association knows this is a mistake that needs rectified immediately.Personally, Kilmory and Dunadd children\u0026#8217s club has inspired our son and daughter to get involved with the sport and to grow in confidence amongst other like-minded children.Stuart and Simone Charnock, LochgilpheadSir,My son has trained with Kilmory/Dunadd shinty club since he was in Primary One. The club has always treated the kids equally and welcomed all kids to participate.After years of hard work, the team was progressing well and was worthy of competing at national level.In his last year before high school, to be told he is no longer allowed to play is not only devastating to my son but greatly confusing and he is left wondering what he has done wrong.I fail to see how this can be classed as progress by the Camanachd Association. This needs to be readdressed to allow kids to compete in the game they love.Susan Jackson, LochgilpheadI was very angry to hear from local residents in Portnahaven that their recycling bins have been used by numerous motorhomes for disposing of general waste, including food waste.I have visited the recycling bins site in Portnahaven and spoken to my constituents in person about this and I can confirm that unfortunately Portnahaven\u0026#8217s recycling bins are full of general waste.This is as unacceptable as it is disrespectful. I have contacted the appropriate department with the council and asked for an investigation to be done. I also asked for some addition signage for the bins area.I made it very clear that my constituents should not lose their recycling facilities as a result of their bins being misused by someone else.I will continue to monitor this situation and provide an update as soon as I have more information.Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,It is fitting to mark this Diabetes Week (June 11-17) for Scotland’s 30,000 adults and children living with type one diabetes by noting that life-changing monitors are now available on the NHS.A child diagnosed with type one diabetes at five faces 50,000 finger prick blood glucose tests by the time they are 18.Each painful finger prick is part of a daily routine which also includes calculating carbohydrate intake and frequent insulin injections, all to prevent life-threatening hypoglycaemia and long term complications.But since November last year, a \u0026#8216flash glucose monitoring\u0026#8217 system called the Freestyle Libre can be prescribed by local GPs, offering an alternative to such intensive finger-pricking.The roll out of flash glucose monitoring, which gives a reading via a simple sensor, however, is not consistent across all local health boards. So, our message for Diabetes Week is to call for health boards in Scotland to speed up prescription policies and step up much needed prescriptions.As someone who has lived with type one diabetes for 21 years, new technology, such as the FreeStyle Libre, makes a world of difference.Type one diabetes cannot be prevented and until we find the cure for it, research and technology are vital.Holly Davies, development manager, Aberdeen\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 25","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 23/06/18, 5:52 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Sir,Labour and the Lib Dems must recognise and respect the recent vote in the Scottish Parliament and the views of their Scottish colleagues who refused to give consent to the damaging Brexit legislation proposed at Westminster.Labour amendments to former clause 11 of the bill require consent of the Scottish Parliament unless a UK Minister ‘has reasonable grounds for believing that regulations are required for the purpose of giving effect to any international obligations’.It would be catastrophic for Scotland if Labour left the door open for the Tory Government to breach the devolution settlement.Leaving Holyrood exposed to powers taken without consent in any area connected to an international trade agreement would be disastrous. This could threaten future trade deals, environmental standards and food safety.The Tories think they can do whatever they want to Scotland and get away with it.The SNP tabled amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill to safeguard the Scottish Parliament from the threat of constraints on existing powers.This is something which Holyrood refused consent for last month by an overwhelming majority including all parties, except the Scottish Conservatives.It would simply be a democratic outrage and it would fly in the face of the fundamental principles of devolution. This Conservative government seems determined to destroy the founding principles of devolution and Labour and the Lib Dems must join us in defending it.Brendan O’Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.Sir,It seems that almost every day I\u0026#8217m contacted by farmers in my constituency with concerns about their future.This is hardly surprising as farmers are borrowing more and having to pay staff less, according to figures released by the Scottish Government.According to ‘Agricultural Facts and Figures’ published recently, agricultural borrowing has doubled in the last 10 years, capital investment has stayed the same and agricultural workers are earning £1,560 less on average compared to last year.The figures show farm borrowing has almost doubled from £1.38 billion to £2.28 billion between 2007 to 2017, while capital investment has stayed the same at £210 million.This demonstrates that farmers are investing much less in their machinery and equipment while still having to borrow ever-increasing sums to remain viable.This is on top of the fact farmers are still struggling with debts they incurred as a result the CAP payment fiasco caused by the SNP Government several years ago.Time and time again the separatists have shown complete disregard to the plight that our hard pressed farmers are facing. It seems our agricultural industry is just one more sector that is ignored by the separatists in their relentless push for a second independence referendum.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Claims by Theresa May that a so-called ‘Brexit dividend’ will help pay for a boost to NHS spending in England worth £20 billion a year within five years are highly disingenuous.The UK will continue to pay into the EU through the transition until the end of 2020 and will pay £20 billion of the \u0026#8216divorce bill\u0026#8217 through to 2028. In addition, the UK Government has committed to keep EU funding for agricultural subsidies, research and development and other key areas at the same level in the short-term.These are set figures so it will be at least 10 years before any so-called ‘Brexit dividend’, if it were ever to materialise, is to be realised. Add to that, if the Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts are accurate, public finances are set to be £15 billion a year worse off by 2021, equivalent to £300 million a week.Interestingly, if taxes are set to rise, which they will clearly have to, it is staggering hypocrisy for the Tories to have attacked the Scottish Government’s boosting of the NHS in Scotland through progressive tax changes and then look to hike taxes themselves.Alex Orr, Edinburgh.Sir,Local government spending cuts have left councils in Scotland unable to meet the needs of local communities and, in some cases, are putting the public at risk.A survey of more than 2,000 local government employees working across all services reveals almost eight in 10 council workers have no confidence in the future of local services and half are thinking of leaving their jobs for less stressful work elsewhere.While local authorities have protected spending on statutory service areas such as adult and children’s social care, the amount they spend on other areas including parks and libraries has fallen sharply.Local authorities have had to cut so many vital services that they have now reached a point where vulnerable children and the elderly struggle to get the help that they need, entire communities are suffering and the public is being put at risk.There have been cuts to road and bridge maintenance, potholes in roads are left unfilled and bridges are at risk of crumbling. Crematoriums are not maintained, streetlights stay broken and parks are in disrepair as councils don’t have the equipment or the staff to adequately maintain them.There are now more than one million people with an unmet need for social care because councils do not have the resources to support them.

Thanks also to everyone at MacPool, Argyll Cafe, Bargain Zone, Danny\u0026#8217s, Ferguson\u0026#8217s Butcher, The Archway, Crinan Cycles, Argyll Pharmacy, Square Peg, The Sweetie Jar, Dalriada Home Hardware, the Post Office and Maureen Roy for donating the great raffle prizes and Councillor Dougie Philand for being an excellent quiz master.And, of course, my appreciation to everyone who came along and took part.The event raised £120 which will help Lochgilphead Community Council put on this year\u0026#8217s festival on Saturday August 4 on Lochgilphead front green.Thank you everyone.Brian MacLennan, Lochgilphead Community Council.Sir,I have been working hard to address issues raised by my constituents. I am still receiving many justifiable complaints about the terrible condition of Mansefield Road in Port Ellen and the hospital road in Bowmore. With long overdue road works going on across Islay and the rest of the Kintyre and Islands ward, it\u0026#8217s only fair these roads are not ignored.The poor condition of the Bruichladdich toilets continues to be raised by local residents.Since contacting the appropriate department I have been informed repairs and maintenance are planned for them.While checking on the progress of pothole repairs I had previously requested, I noticed some of the recent street light repairs leave a lot to be desired. While a quick fix is better than nothing, many of these short-term fixes need to be looked at again.I have been speaking to the BT Openreach staff across Islay who are expanding our island\u0026#8217s internet capabilities. I have contacted BT to make sure recent issues with phone lines in some local households are not a result of the broadband upgrades.There has been progress with local housing associations after pointing out many of their tenants are having trouble with mould in their housing. Measures are now being implemented to to rectify the problem. I was happy to hear Argyll Community Housing Association has fixed gate latches on four of its houses at Cnoc Na Faire in Port Ellen after I raised this with them a few weeks ago.I met with environment, development and infrastructure committee member councillor Gary Mulvaney about Kintyre and Islands\u0026#8217 crumbling infrastructure, alongside our growing industrial output with the success of distilleries on Islay and Jura.Later that day I spoke directly to my constituents in Tarbert after a number of locals \u0026#8211 some business owners \u0026#8211 contacted me about the recent flood of sewage on Harbour Street as a result of blocked drains. Scottish Water were coming under fire from locals because of its slow progress on the matter.I made my anger about the poor conditions in Tarbert very clear when I contacted Scottish Water. A long-term solution to needs to be put in place.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Scottish Water is asking customers to use water wisely in their daily activities to help maintain supplies during the current hot summer weather.Following a sustained dry period without any significant rainfall, customer use has increased significantly.In some areas, there has been a 30 per cent increase in demand for water and an additional 140 million litres are currently being produced and pushed through the system every day.The situation is being monitored closely to manage supplies across the country.This includes deploying additional resources to move water between distribution areas and tankering water to supplement local networks.Average reservoir levels are generally normal for this time of year but the current level of use and continuing dry weather means stocks of stored water available for use are reducing.Try to reduce use wherever possible.Businesses are also being asked to consider their use and how they can use water more efficiently.Simple, practical steps include: taking shorter showers, using a watering can rather than a hose to water plants, using a bucket rather than a hose to wash vehicles only washing windscreens/lights instead of the whole vehicle, turning off taps whenever possible and use washing machines and dishwashers fully loaded.More advice on using water wisely is online at www.scottishwater/savewaterscotland or call 0800 0778778.Peter Farrer, Chief Operating Officer, Scottish Water.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"riverside fun day sparkles in the sun","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 06/07/18, 9:44 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe sun shone on the Riverside in Lochgilphead for a day of fun.Mid Argyll Community Pool and Riverside Rascals nursery hosted the family day on Sunday July 1, featuring a variety of colourful craft and charity stalls.The unmistakeable aroma of barbecue wafted across the car park from Riverside Rascals nursery, which opened its doors to the public for the occasion, complete with children\u0026#8217s activities.MACPool lifeguards were on hand to keep an eye on the youngsters in the pedal boats while the sunshine glistened across the splashing fun.PICS:Four-year-old Kaiden Abel from Lochgilphead has fun splashing in the inflatable outdoor pool. 06_a27RiversideFun01Kyra Robertson, aged 11, from Cairnbaan, tries to hook a duck on the MS centre stand \u0026#8211 and it\u0026#8217s not as easy as it looks. 06_a27RiversideFun04On the MS Centre Mid Argyll stall were Maggie Dodd and centre manager Karen McCurry. 06_a27RiversideFun07Mary Stewart of the Loch Awe Pottery helps sisters Abby and Chloe McCallum, from Glasgow, to decorate their pottery. 06_a27RiversideFun08Cathleen MacDonald was there with her Woolly Bobbins textile-base crafts. 06_a27RiversideFun09Alongside Cathleen was her mum Margaret Davidson, who creates soft toys under the name Twisted Yarn.

It was difficult to hold the bottom at times, however, we managed to hook into dab, plaice, grey gurnard, haddock and a good haul of thornback rays to bring our species tally for the day to five.All in all a decent day’s fishing given the rough conditions. We returned to harbour a tad battered and soaking wet.Day two was almost as windy as the first day, however the rain kept away which was a bonus.Conditions were still far too rough for fishing the deep so we started off on the soft ground for flats but the spurdogs had other ideas. Everywhere we went \u0026#8211 singles, doubles, trebles \u0026#8211 there was just no getting away from them despite Robbie’s best efforts.I have never seen so many chunky spurs, with the best of the day tipping the scales at 14lbs 8oz.Needless to say a fair number of rigs were wrecked, leads snagged and lost on the rough ground, and quite a few fish dropped. On the plus side there were a few PBs and a couple of new club records set.In between the spur attacks, we picked up a few decent dab, plaice, cod, grey gurnard, red gurnard and coalfish (coalies) to take our species count for the day to eight.Despite the rough and tumble we enjoyed the trip and the opportunity to catch some decent fish. Hopefully the weather will be kinder next year and we’ll get to drop a line out in the deep water marks which hold so many more species.The combined scores over two days:Nikki Thompson 185%***********************It was no surprise to find ourselves fishing in the pouring rain yet again. We don’t seem to have much luck weatherwise, but at least it was relatively calm out of Oban with only the slightest breeze.We headed out on board the ‘Laura Dawn’ in search of fresh bait but despite several drifts the mackerel eluded us.With the big tides, skipper Ronnie suggested we fish the rough ground and reefs for pollack and coalies. The plan was to play around here until the tide eased off enough to drop the anchor.It was pretty desperate though with only a few miniscule whiting to show for our efforts. The incredibly rough ground and fast drift were challenging to say the least and most of us left a fair amount of tackle and lead stuck fast to the seabed.Enough was enough, so we decided to head for deeper water and anchor up even though the tide was still pretty strong, resulting in some horrendous tangles.It proved to be a sensible move from a fishing point of view though, with reasonable sized spurs hooked on the very first drop. More spurs, spotty dogs and a couple of bonus thornbacks were taken throughout the afternoon.It was nip and tuck right to the end with just one fish separating the top three placing.Final scores:\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"tarbert golf club is looking for players","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 26/07/18, 12:32 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowSort that swing because Tarbert Golf Club is holding its James Mundell Memorial gents open.On Sunday August 5 players will compete at Glenralloch for various gross and net prizes between £20 and £60 and, of course, for the coveted James Mundell Memorial trophy.So book your place for a chance to win.Tee off times are 7.50am to 9.10am, 10.45am to 12.05pm or 1.40pm to 2.50pm.To book, call 01880 820565 and entry fees are £15.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"teenie takes the title in myargyll","story":"\t\tSandy NeilUpdated: 26/07/18, 9:24 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowA competition capturing #myargyll has been won by Teenie Wilson, an amateur photographer on the Isle of Lismore, who took this stunning image before an evening’s fishing at Port Ramsay, as the sun set over Glensanda quarry in Morvern.The competition, run in in association with Wyvex Media and Argyll and the Isles Tourism Co-operative, sought to recognise why you think our region is such a fantastic place to live, work and visit through photography, video and prose.Teenie, who runs the Lismore Post office and shop with her husband David, took up the hobby, which they share, two years ago.‘I love it,’ she said: ‘It gets me out. I take the camera wherever I go. I always keep my eye open for the right shot. With a good camera you can’t go wrong.’One summer evening last year, Teenie said their neighbour Duncan Black, a retired seaman, had asked if she wanted to go fishing. ‘I was waiting for him to bring the boat in,’ she recalled. ‘I thought it would make a great shot. We caught 40 fish that night. When I downloaded it, I thought ‘wow’.’‘Wow’ indeed, because it was voted the best from hundreds of brilliant photographs sent in by you – you can still enjoy them all by visiting #myargyll.‘I am chuffed,’ Teenie said. ‘I am not very confident in my own work \u0026#8211 everybody tells me they are good. This has given me a huge boost.’Thanks to her winning photograph, Teenie has won an autumn break for two on Islay, featuring an overnight stay at the Machrie Hotel, dinner and B\u0026ampB in Bowmore’s Harbour Inn, a tour of Islay’s newest distillery, Ardnahoe, a boat trip with Islay Sea Adventures, travel via Hebridean Airways, based at Oban Airport, a night at the Falls of Lora Hotel in Connel, and an Oban walking tour.Teenie said: ‘I am taking my sister, because she persuaded me to enter the competition.’Teenie also runs the island’s photography club and has just been awarded £1,000 to set up a junior one this winter.The runner-up was Alan Frew from Helensburgh. He was surprised but absolutely delighted with his achievement.His stunning picture was taken at Carsaig jetty, near Tayvallich.He said: ‘My son Aidan is an avid BMXer and wanted a picture of himself jumping. The photograph was taken at sunset with flash.’For his efforts, Alan won a bottle of Oban whisky, a box of 24 chocolates from the Oban Chocolate Company and a Cashmere scarf from Islay Woolen Mill.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyll and bute cup all set for action","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 27/07/18, 2:00 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowSaturday August 4 will see the return of the Argyll and Bute Cup tournament, hosted by Lochgilphead Red Star.The competition will feature Group A  at the Lochgilphead joint campus 3G astro, comprising Oban Saints, Lochgilphead Red Star, Neilston and Port Glasgow Athletic.

He played for two seasons at Murray Park, taking part in tournaments at Turin in Italy  and in Russia at Shakhtar Donetsk before moving to Ralston, where he signed for St Mirren FC and had an enjoyable two seasons before returning to Lochgilphead Red Star YFC.Proud dad Dougie also happens to be the Red Star manager, and he said: \u0026#8216As a manager, it is always sad to lose your best players, but after the team\u0026#8217s success last year we had rumblings that something may happen at the end of the season.\u0026#8216As a club, we are delighted that one of our players has been given the chance to go and make an impact at senior level and just goes to show the hard work put in by the volunteers at the soccer centre, youth and amateur teams that there will be chances if players show the right attitude and commitment, whether at our level or at the youths.\u0026#8216Locally there are a number of youngsters who are with Partick Thistle, Hamilton, Rangers and others, which is great for such a small town like Lochgilphead.\u0026#8217Taking off his manager\u0026#8217s hat, Dougie added: \u0026#8216As parents, both myself and Fiona are delighted.

Sadly the rally was over for both crews after stage four due to electrical problems and other issues.Donald Bowness battled it out in the usual competitive class two with his Vauxhall Nova with Andrew Blackwood on the notes. Bowness enjoyed the battle with Michael Harbour during a Saturday which saw crews struggle to keep cars cool while specators looked on in glorious sunshine. Rally journalist John Fife was prompted to comment: \u0026#8216It\u0026#8217s like watching two spoilt weans scrapping over one tube of smarties.\u0026#8217Sunday saw a complete change in the weather and crews continued to battle it out in some very wet and slippy stages. Donald Bowness finished 11th overall and first in class two, followed by Michael Harbour in second. Another local man, Jamie Miller, finished an impressive third in the class on what was his first time out in his new car \u0026#8211 without so much as  a test drive in his the Citroen C2R2 Max.Class one saw Innes Mochrie and Paul Hunter battle it out in Innes\u0026#8217 newly built Rover , with another excellent drive from the pair who also finished the rally with a trophy win, coming third in their class. Alan \u0026#8216Goldie\u0026#8217 Ross decided not to enter this year as he is selling his Citroen Saxo rally car and instead enjoyed the rally from the spectating areas.The overall winners of the 2018 Mach 1 stages were Bruce Edwards and Jim Smith in the Darrian follwed by Gordon Morrison and Calum Macpherson in their Subaru Impreza and third place went to Ian Paterson and Callum Shanks also in a Subaru Impreza.All the local drivers appreciate the efforts of Davie Hatrick and the team behind the scenes of DCC, who put so much time and effort to bring this fantastic rally to Argyll each year.The rally is always on the lookout for new volunteers to marshal at the event, this is a great opportunity for locals to get up close to the action and learn more about the sport.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"talented mojo line up announced","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 28/07/18, 5:01 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowAfter having had a meeting recently to choose all the acts, the MOJO crew would like to say thanks for all interest shown.They didn’t have it easy deciding the final line-up as the response resulted in a very large and varied selection to choose from.

NHS Ayrshire \u0026amp Arran this week appealed for drivers to help to keep the grounds as safe as possible for patients, visitors and staff. The car parks at University Hospitals Ayr and Crosshouse have designated short and long stay areas which are clearly signposted. The short stay car parks have a time limit of three hours and the long stay car parks are for people who need to park for longer than three hours. When the car parking scheme was first implemented, there was a significant improvement in parking behaviours. However, this has not continued. John Wright, director for corporate support services, said: “Over the past few years we have carried out surveys and audits of the car parks at University Hospitals Ayr and Crosshouse and created more than 400 new spaces across both sites. However, we have now reached the limit of the number of new car parking spaces we can build. We are, therefore, asking for help from members of the public. “We need to make sure that we all play our part in parking appropriately and safely in all of our car parks across all of our sites. This will help traffic to flow better, reduce the risk of accidents and ensure that we comply with health and safety regulations.” Mr Wight is urging motorists to: park only in a designated parking bay and do not park on footpaths, or at road junction He urged drivers notto park in disabled parking spaces if you do not have a blue badge Mr Wright said people can help reduce congestion at car park by travelling to the hospital by public transport or car share. He added: “We know that parking is challenging on our sites, particularly at University Hospitals Ayr and Crosshouse. “However, we are limited to the number of spaces we have and this is why we are urging the public and our staff to help us and to park appropriately. We will also be looking at other ways of reducing the volume of traffic on our sites at particular times of the day.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyr HospitalUniversities and CollegesCrosshouseAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"kilmarnock man who lifelong alcohol","story":"NewsKilmarnock man who has had lifelong alcohol struggle shares heartbreaking story and says: \"I don\u0027t want my grandson seeing me drunk every day\"At his worst Andrew from Kilmarnock could drink a bottle of vodka per day, on top of 10 or 15 pints of beer.Share\u0026nbspByDavid Wren12:25, 27 JUL 2018NewsAndrew has struggled with drink his whole life (picture posed by model)Get daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email“I’ve got a daughter and a grandson, I don’t want them seeing me drunk everyday,” says Andrew, who has struggled with alcohol for most of his adult life. At his worst, the 59-year-old from Kilmarnock – who has asked for his surname to be withheld – could drink a bottle of vodka per day, on top of 10 or 15 pints of beer. His situation was desperate, with the alcohol numbing the pain of crippling mental health issues he has suffered from for years. Andrew spoke out after it was revealed in last week’s Kilmarnock Standard that there were 48 alcohol-related deaths at Crosshouse Hospitalin 2017/18, an increase from 38 in the previous year. Illnesses and injuries related to alcohol which have been treated at the facility have also gone up, with NHS Ayrshire and Arran aiming to tackle the problem.  Andrew said: “I’ve been drinking repeatedly for 25 years. I used to drink a litre of vodka a day and roughly four litres per week. “I’d maybe have 10 or 15 pints of beer a day as well. I sought help from various organisations which didn’t help. “I’ve been struggling with my mental health over the years too. The main reason I’ve been hitting the drink is because of my mental health and I can’t get any help.” His battles with drink and mental health have led Andrew to dark places and he has attempted suicide twice. A chaotic lifestyle where he has had brushes with the law over the years also played a part in his mindset, as well as an incident in his late teens where a gun was put to his head. The terrifying ordeal, Andrew says, “wasted my head” and he continues to have flashbacks. It started off his spiralling issues with anxiety and depression which have plagued his life and repeatedly led him back to alcohol. After one suicide attempt, Andrew said that he was told to quit his vodka habit and did so overnight. But the consequences of going cold turkey led to a mild stroke the following day. Battles with his health have continued over the years, meaning he is now on 17 tablets a day just to help his body function. Andrew doesn’t consider himself an alcoholic, but admits he has struggled with drink for most of his life. He also claims that he’s struggled to access help for his mental health issues. He said: “I’ve been to various organisations and they hunt me. “They take the name and address, say they’ll contact you – then nothing.  “So I go to drink and that solves the mental health problems. “But it actually triggers it. Sometimes it eases me and it’s a bit back to front. “These mental health organisations have no money, no funds and the NHS is in a terrible state. “The only people I can rely on are the Ayrshire Council on Alcohol down in Ayr. “I’m not an alcoholic, I’ve just got a problem with drink. “I don’t like being called an alcoholic, I’m just a normal guy that needs help.” The Ayrshire Council on Alcohol have helped him work on his problem with drink. Although on a long road to recovery, Andrew’s drinking has decreased. But, even though the alcohol counselling helps, he admits he’s desperate to tackle his mental health issues. He said: “I’m down to drinking four days a week now, before I would have been seven. The ACA have helped me, I would recommend them to anybody. “They explain the circumstances and give you a target to achieve over a period. They don’t want you to come off of it straight away. “It maybe goes from seven days to five and so on.” He continued: “In a day I’ll maybe drink 15 pints. That used to be every day but now I’ve cut it down to four. “It’s a lot of beer. It’s very hard to say the effect the alcohol has on me. “My main issue is the mental health, the anxiety and depression, my head’s wasted.” Having been in the habit of drinking every day for so long, Andrew removes himself from the dangers of binging when his days away from alcohol come around.   He goes on day trips across Ayrshire to keep him away from the lure of  the pub, which Andrew admits he would struggle to resist if he was just hanging around Kilmarnock town centre.  Although he lives himself, Andrew says he doesn’t drink in the house and bottles of booze stay untouched in his home. The social aspect of the pub, he says, is the lure for him as he seeks the company it brings. Andrew believes he can quit drink – but admits his mental health constantly brings him back to square one as he looks for a life away from alcohol. He says the ACA is saving his life with their support and he hopes continued work with the organisation can help him to live a healthy life. “At times I was just desperate, thinking ‘why live?’” said Andrew. “But I’ve got a grandson now, a daughter, so it gives me something to look forward to in the future. “Hopefully one day I can come off the drink. “Never say never – it’s my ambition.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrKilmarnockAlcoholCrosshouse"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"mayboles christmas celebrations in jeopardy","story":"NewsMaybole\u0027s Christmas celebrations in jeopardyThe community association organises a Christmas lights switch-on ceremony, as well the summer gala day.Share\u0026nbspByAyrshire Post11:18, 25 JUL 2018NewsMaybole Christmas lights switch on (Image: David Kiltie)Get daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe town’s Christmas celebrations will be in the ice box this year after a community group agreed to freeze itself for six months. Maybole Community Association will not meet again until January, by which time the festive fun will be over. The group organises a Christmas lights switch-on ceremony, as well the summer gala day. But members could not form a committee at an extraordinary general meeting (EGM). A statement issued after the meeting states: “Following the EGM held by Maybole Community Association on Thursday, July 12, 2018, regrettably no one came forward at the meeting prepared to be an office bearer, knowing that the present committee were standing down. “The decision was therefore made at the meeting for all activities of the association to be frozen and put on hold for a minimum period of six months and a maximum of 12 months and will be reviewed again at that time. “No business will be conducted during that timescale. This decision means that there will be no Christmas lights switch-on and potentially no gala next year.” Outgoing chairperson Senga Mason had been in her role for three years and took over after a similar committee crisis.  She said: “People didn’t come forward for the main committee roles and there’s far greater pressures on people’s time now than there was 40 years ago.” Mrs Mason’s connection to the group, founded in 1975, goes back to 1978. Maybole Gala Days in days gone by featured lorry floats and impressive bunting displays across the High Street. But Mrs Mason pointed out: “Health and safety rules meant the end of using lorries, which in any case are normally needed 24/7 by operators. “Even for simple things like bunting you need permits and a cherry picker to put it up. “Rules are in place for a reason and we have to abide by them.” Community association members are also upset at what they saw as unfair criticisms made on social media following this year’s Maybole Gala Day on June 9. A switch-on ceremony in Maybole can only now be saved if another group of volunteers steps forward. If the community association decides to wind up in January its assets - cash, tables, chairs and gazebos - would be dispersed to other groups in the town.

The event was a huge success, raising \u0026pound338 for UNICEF and helping raise awareness for young people in need throughout the UK and beyond.

And reader Brian Cassells snapped this image of the creature from the deep. “I’d never seen anything like it before,” said Brian, who was out walking with wife Julie and their two small pet dogs. “At first I thought it must be part of a fishing net, or some kind of rope from a boat. “But then, looking closer at it, it was more like a giant version of those little bones you see when you open a tin of salmon.” Aircraft mechanic Brian, 55, also noted what looked like the remains of a large fin on the sea monster. The carcass was in the water when he first spotted it. But he got a better look on a return walk, two days later. “It had started to break up a bit,” said Brian. “But I got a chance to pace out a rough measurement on dry land.  “And I reckon it was at least 20 feet long.” The Post passed on Brian’s pictures to Girvan-based David Bova, a retired Marine Scotland scientist. David, 61, said: “The images suggest the remains of a basking shark. “Shark skeletons are cartilage rather than bone, and this looks to be the case here.” David explained that basking sharks tend to be seasonal visitors to the Firth of Clyde, feeding on plankton bloom. The gentle giants can grow to over 30ft long, and weigh several tons. “I haven’t seen one so far this summer,” said David, who is regularly out on the waters around Ailsa Craig. Brian was interested to hear David’s opinion, and agrees with his view that the skeleton was more like cartilage than bone. “We kept Daisy (Bichon Frise) and Millie (Cavachon) well away anyway!” he joked.

And United proved that underdogs can upset the odds by finishing sixth and leaving Aberdeen, Dundee United, Dundee and St Johnstone in their wake. It was a stunning effort but McSherry, who was signed by Ally MacLeod on a free from Kilmarnock, reckons Ayr can once again confound the pundits and enjoy a great season. United kick off the league at home to Partick Thistle on August 4 and midfielder turned publican McSherry expects them to be up for the challenge. He said: “Consolidation should be the aim but there is no reason why Ayr can’t rise again and enjoy the good times that we enjoyed in the 70s.” An old team picture that surfaced in McSherry’s Wee Windaes got punters rewinding the years and reliving past glories. It was taken at the start of season 1975-76 and showed Ayr in their change kit of Barcelona strips. Proudly standing tall are, back row – Davie Wells, Alex McAnespie, Ally MacLean, Hugh Sproat, Rikki Fleming, John Murphy. Middle row – Alex Ingram, Gerry Phillips, Johnny Graham, Johnny Doyle, Hugh Cameron, Jim McSherry. Front row – John Dickson, Danny MacDonald, Davie McCulloch.   Jim recalled: “No one could work out why the team weren’t in their usual black and white if it was an official  team picture.  “We were also puzzled why there were 15 players in it, including two goalkeepers. “Then one of my regulars, Stephen Robb, came up with the answer – it was taken before a pre-season friendly.  “We wore it in a 7-2 defeat at home to Celtic and it was never seen  again. I think it was binned as a bad omen.  “These were good times at Ayr and the team was loaded with some great players. “We were the only part-time team in the Top Ten and were quoted at 66/1, which seemed about right given the teams we were up against. “I remember Ally signing me on the wall at Central Station and then telling me to look out my passport. “He told me ‘You’re going on tour to Canada next week’. It was quite a start to my Ayr career.” Only three months into that season, Ally was lured to Aberdeen and replaced at the helm by Alex Stuart who quickly appointed McSherry as captain. Ayr sealed safety with a last-day 2-1 win over Motherwell, who were bossed by Willie McLean and Craig Brown. Gerry Phillips got a dramatic late winner to spark euphoric scenes at a packed Somerset. The second season of top-flight football saw Ayr again more than hold their own.  They finished eighth in the table on 30 points, three ahead of Hearts and a distant 13 more than rock-bottom  rivals Kilmarnock.  Season 1977-78 marked Ayr’s third campaign in the top flight, a remarkable achievement considering they stayed part-time. Robert Connor, Ian McAllister, Derek McCutcheon and Iain Sim were called up from Ayr United Boys’ Club. But Ayr were always up against it and their life in the Premier League ended when they finished second-bottom on 24 points and were relegated along with Clydebank. Now as a new league season beckons with renewed optimism and a totally full-time structure, it’s time to dream again.

Ayr United head to Firhill to take on Partick Thistle today knowing that a win will be enough to top the group and put them into the hat for the knockout stages. The Honest Men beat Morton 3-1 in their first group game before beating Albion 2-0 on Saturday. McCall’s side then hammered Stenhousemuir 5-0 at Somerset Park on Tuesday. And McCall, who will head to his old stomping ground on Saturday, said: “It’s a good game against a team in the same league as us. “They are fancied to be challenging for the league title, so it will be a good gauge for us to see where we are at. “I don’t think the game will have any similarities to the league opener though, but if there is a place up for grabs in the last 16 then we are going to go for it.” The Betfred Cup format has come under scrutiny from a number of players and managers involved in the game.  But McCall has gone against the grain and offered his support for the group stage style. He said: “I think it’s good and I like it. “I like the games that actually mean something, rather than meaningless friendlies which I hate. “With this format it means you only need three pre season friendlies. “And we have done well in the opening couple of games so that momentum will hopefully stick with us going into the league campaign.” Ross Docherty has been back in full training for the past week, with Chris Higgins set to join back up with the squad next week. •The Ayr United open day will take place this Sunday from 12pm. Fans are welcome to join the party at Somerset where they can meet their heroes amidst a whole host of fun events. The players and managers will be there along with a Stagedoor BBQ, Mancini’s ice cream and a kids v adults match to soak in, plus plenty of more fun activities.

During this time there were three railway stations in Peebles \u0026ndash one where Tesco now stands, which was then extended to create a line to Galashiels the second in Dean Park and the third on Caledonian Road, serving travel to the west and Glasgow.\nThe rail link not only encouraged thousands of visitors, with The Hydro having its own spur, but underpinned the huge expansion of the weaving industry by providing fast, cheap links to world markets.\nUntil now there has been little recognition of the influence of the railway on the development of Peebles and, while some evidence can still be found in the Viaduct Bridge over the River Tweed and the railway tunnel connecting the bridge to the town, much has been lost.\nBut now railway enthusiasts are steaming ahead with plans to establish a museum which will house artefacts and photographs of historic trains during their journeys through Peebles.\nThe PCT is now hoping to gauge if there is an appetite amongst the people of Peebles for the museum.\nFurther investigations will have to be carried out, as it is believed the building is owned by Scottish Borders Council.\nIf the railway museum is given the green light, funding will be sought for the renovation of the old railway building. PCT chairman Lawrie Hayworth said: \u0026ldquoThis a really exciting project which can help us all have access to this important period in the town\u0026rsquos history, a period of rapid local transformation akin to the wider impact we see today with global internet access.\n\u0026ldquoThis should also boost visitor numbers to Peebles and provide economic benefit to the town.

In the last general election in 2013, voter turnout was 6.6 million, or 68.5% of 9.7 million registered voters.\nHun Sen said on his Facebook page before the results were announced that he welcomed the big turnout, and congratulated his countrymen for exercising their right to vote.\nOpposition forces, who had already judged the polls not to be free or fair because of the exclusion of the only credible challenger, can point to two reasons for the alleged failure of the boycott movement.\nLocals line up to vote at a polling station in Phnom Penh (Heng Sinith/AP)\nIn rural areas where the majority live, the failure to vote \u0026ndash signified by having no fingers dipped in indelible ink \u0026ndash made voters subject to retaliation by local officials who carry out civic functions, such as land registration. There had been reports during the campaign of threats against anyone who planned to boycott the vote.\nVoters in Phnom Penh, Cambodia\u0026rsquos capital and an opposition stronghold, were less susceptible to such threats because of their higher visibility and safety in numbers. However, according to the election committee, even there the turnout was about 80%.\nDoubts are also likely to be raised about the actual turnout figures because several established poll-watching groups \u0026ndash as well as contingents from the United States and the European Union \u0026ndash declined to take part because they felt the polls were not legitimate. One of the bigger Cambodian groups participating in poll-watching was led by one of Hun Sen\u0026rsquos sons.\nFollowing the election, exiled opposition leader Sam Rainsy, who had earlier urged Cambodians not to vote, called for peaceful protests, calling it \u0026ldquoa sham election with a foregone conclusion.\nSpeaking in Paris, where he lives, he said it \u0026ldquois a meaningless victory because (Hun Sen) won without any real challenger\u0026hellip prior to the election he dissolved the only credible opposition party.\nHun Sen\u0026rsquos Cambodian People\u0026rsquos Party was alarmed by the results of the 2013 election, when the race was close enough for the opposition to claim that it would have won had it not been for manipulation of the voter registration process.\nAlong with fracturing the political opposition \u0026ndash including pressuring Rainsy into exile and jailing his successor Kem Sokha \u0026ndash Hun Sen\u0026rsquos government also silenced critical voices in the media.\nOver the past year, about 30 radio stations shut down, and two English-language newspapers that provided serious reporting were gutted, one forced to close and the other put under ownership friendly to the government.\nJust ahead of the polls, the government ordered the temporary blocking of 17 websites, citing regulations prohibiting media from disseminating information that might affect security. The blocked websites included those of the US government-funded Voice of America as well as local media.\nHun Sen, whose 33 years in power make him among the world\u0026rsquos longest-serving national leaders, promised peace and prosperity at a rally on the last day of campaigning on Friday, but attacked the opposition\u0026rsquos boycott call and called those who heed it \u0026ldquodestroyers of democracy.\nThe 65-year-old has said he intends to stay in power for at least two more five-year terms.\n(function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i[\u0027GoogleAnalyticsObject\u0027]=ri[r]=i[r]||function(){(i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date()a=s.createElement(o),m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0]a.async=1a.src=gm.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m)})(window,document,\u0027script\u0027,\u0027//www.google-analytics/analytics.js\u0027,\u0027ga\u0027)ga(\u0027create\u0027, \u0027UA-72310761-1\u0027, \u0027auto\u0027, {\u0027name\u0027: \u0027pacontentapi\u0027})ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027referrer\u0027, location.origin)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027dimension1\u0027, \u0027By Sopheng Cheang and Jerry Harmer, Associated Press\u0027)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027dimension2\u0027, \u0027624cef3e-4054-429e-a299-06b19984a53b\u0027)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027dimension3\u0027, \u0027paservice:news,paservice:news:world\u0027)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027dimension6\u0027, \u0027story\u0027)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027dimension7\u0027, \u0027composite\u0027)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027dimension8\u0027, null)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027dimension9\u0027, null)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.send\u0027, \u0027pageview\u0027, { \u0027location\u0027: location.href, \u0027page\u0027: (location.pathname + location.search + location.hash), \u0027title\u0027: \u0027Cambodian PM coasts to another victory after opposition party silenced\u0027})\n"},{"url":null,"title":"thomas-enjoys-the-champagne-feeling-of-being-a-tour-de-france-winner","story":"Geraint Thomas savoured victory in the Tour de France with a glass of champagne on the road in to Paris on Sunday.\nBefore Alexander Kristoff took victory in the final sprint on the Champs-Elysees, Thomas lined up with his Sky team-mates and posed for pictures while carrying the Welsh flag on the 116km stage from Houilles.\nThomas crossed the line alongside Chris Froome to confirm his final margin of victory at one minute 51 seconds over Team Sunweb\u0026rsquos Tom Dumoulin, with Froome a further 33 seconds back in third place.\n\u0026#128077\u0026#128077\u0026#128077\u0026#128077\n#TDF2018\npic.twitter/Xmrz2G8iJ1\n\u0026mdash Le Tour de France (@LeTour) \nJuly 29, 2018\nThe third Briton to win the Tour did not start the race as either a favourite or the leader of his own team.\nThough he had led Froome by more than\u0026nbsp a minute and a half after his victory on stage 12 to Alpe d\u0026rsquoHuez, Thomas revealed he was only fully handed the leadership of the team after the four-time winner faltered on stage 17 to fall even further back just days before Paris.\n\u0026ldquoThe real defining moment was when he had his bad day (on stage 17), but at the same time I was always allowed my own freedom, the Welshman said.\n\u0026ldquoIt wasn\u0026rsquot like I had to work for him as a domestique.

More of the same please.It was a good day for the Argyll favourites. A positive start which should continue at Kintyre Park against Pollock under 19s tomorrow with a 2pm kick off.

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.

A planning application for the substation by Inch Cape Offshore Limited (ICOL) was called in by Scottish Ministers in a controversial move in April and will now be decided by the reporter instead of the council.  ICOL wants to bring offshore energy from a planned windfarm off the Angus coast onto land at Cockenzie by building the substation on the footprint of the former power station.  A previous planning application siting the substation further inland had been given planning permission but that permission lapsed instead of renewing it, ICOL decided to pursue a new site.  In its argument to Scottish Ministers, the council will state that the substation is \u0026ldquonot the best use of the land and point out that planning permission had been given at another site.  Councillor Norman Hampshire said: \u0026ldquoBecause of the location, we have to recommend it should be refused. We have done a lot of work to move this proposal forward and this action jeopardises that.  \u0026ldquoI think if everybody had worked together we could have got a development on a site the council, developers and communities could have supported.  Earlier this month, representatives of ICOL were challenged by Prestonpans Community Council to name any independent party that support the planned location of the substation.  Brian Weddell, community council chairman, told the ICOL representatives that there had been no public consultation about the new site.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe are against it, Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council are against it, East Lothian Council and Scottish Natural Heritage are against it.  \u0026ldquoShow us anyone, apart from Inch Cape, who think it is a good site.  Ian Johnson, ICOL project manager, said: \u0026ldquoWe are naturally disappointed that East Lothian Council officers have recommended refusal to the application on the grounds that it could prejudice future development of the area. ICOL have been and will continue to work with the council to look at options to reduce the footprint of the site and ensure that other potential future developments can co-exist next to the substation.  However, he made it clear there were no plans to consider an alternative site, telling the Courier: \u0026ldquoWe have no intention of moving the proposed site of the onshore transmission works again.

Now her sister Susan Gibson, along with daughters Laura Burgess and Elaine Macrae, will be joined by nieces Clare Furze and Kara Wallace and granddaughters Ciara Burgess and Isla Burgess in the running-themed fundraisers.  Susan said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom the runner in the family and I have always done a fundraising event every year.  \u0026ldquoJennifer was a great supporter, she was not a runner herself but she would tease me about the time I had done at the event.  \u0026ldquoShe was a huge supporter and always contributed generously to what I was running for.  \u0026ldquoAfter she had the terminal diagnosis, one thing we talked about was that I would organise some kind of running thing for the family.  \u0026ldquoIt was her choice to go with Edinburgh Maggie\u0026rsquos Centre because she had such amazing support there.  The charity, which has been based in Edinburgh since 1996, offers support to people with cancer and their family and friends.  The centres offer not only practical advice about benefits and eating well but qualified experts provide emotional support and the centres offer a chance to meet people or simply sit quietly with a cup of tea.  Team Jenny, which includes seven-year-old Isla, will in varying combinations be clocking up nearly 200 kilometres of timed runs throughout the summer.  Originally, the plan was for the seven family members to take part together in the same event.  However, with the family spread out in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Coleraine, it proved impossible.  Instead they are taking on half a dozen different events before combining both the distance and fundraising totals together.  Elaine, 32, has already completed the Baker Hughes 10k in Aberdeen, while Kara, 28, and her husband, Duncan, will be joined by Clare, 32, Elaine and Susan at the Run the Blades event at Whitelee Wind Farm, near Eaglesham, this month.  Meanwhile in Portrush, Northern Ireland, Susan will join Laura, 36, together with her daughters Ciara, 13, and Isla, at the Portrush Park Run.  Clare, Elaine, Kara and Susan will all take part in the Great Aberdeen Run 10k next month before Susan\u0026rsquos attention turns to the Scottish 10k, which starts and finishes at Musselburgh Racecourse in September.  Finally, Elaine and Susan will take on the Great Scottish Run Half Marathon in Glasgow, with Laura\u0026rsquos husband Barry competing in the Belfast City Half Marathon in September.  The family set an initial fundraising target of \u0026pound1,000 before increasing that to \u0026pound3,000 but both have already been smashed, with nearly \u0026pound5,000 already raised.  Susan said: \u0026ldquoIt is amazing.  \u0026ldquoPeople are just so incredibly generous and I think that is a measure of Jennifer and Maggie\u0026rsquos and the affection and respect people have for Maggie\u0026rsquos.  \u0026ldquoWe are very fortunate it is a very close family.  \u0026ldquoJennifer was very caring, had a great sense of humour and she was honest.  \u0026ldquoYou could always depend on her \u0026ndash it might not be what you wanted to hear but what you needed to hear.  \u0026ldquoShe had that ability to be completely honest without ever being harsh or unkind.  \u0026ldquoShe was incredibly supportive of the family and everybody in it.

Mrs Reid, known as Kit, told how she exchanged early memories of her nursing career and the transition into the NHS with the royal guest.  She said: \u0026ldquoMy first pay was two pound notes and a 10 shilling note. The week before national health it was seven (shillings) and six (pence).  Mrs Reid, of Haddington worked as a nurse from 1946 until 1952 and spent some of her career at Edinburgh\u0026rsquos Royal Hospital for Sick Children. The grandmother of five, with triplets in Seattle and a grandson in Saskatchewan, Canada, and a further grandson at the University of Edinburgh, said: \u0026ldquoThe Duke was absolutely normal.  \u0026ldquoHe spoke to me and asked various things about the work I had done.  \u0026ldquoObviously he had been briefed because he asked me about the pay and for what felt like a long time he spoke to me.  \u0026ldquoHe was just so charming \u0026ndash it was the thrill of a lifetime, the whole thing.  \u0026ldquoI met so many wonderfully interesting people \u0026ndash people from Orkney and Shetland, from all over Scotland, with their own stories to tell.  \u0026ldquoIt was just absolutely wonderful \u0026ndash I even got to walk on a red carpet.  Mrs Reid said that the NHS had made a massive difference to the way of life across Scotland and said she was \u0026ldquoall for the NHS.  The 90-year-old, who also met Scotland\u0026rsquos new Health Secretary Jeane Freeman MSP, added: \u0026ldquoMy first memory of work was the knowledge that the hospital was getting much busier and there were more children coming in and going out cured. Before that, the parents couldn\u0026rsquot afford medical help and were leaving it too late for their children to come in and many of them didn\u0026rsquot make it.  \u0026ldquoAlso I remember saying to the sister I was working with at the time: \u0026lsquoThe parents coming in now have lost their terribly haunted look because they know now they can bring their children in.\u0026rsquo  She told how the nurses had to live on-site in those days and would therefore tend to give up work when they became married.  Mrs Reid added: \u0026ldquoWe weren\u0026rsquot allowed to live out of hospital, we had to stay in the nurses\u0026rsquo homes.  \u0026ldquoI loved it \u0026ndash I loved the camaraderie, I loved the company, I loved everything about it.  \u0026ldquoIt wasn\u0026rsquot all drudgery and hard work, we had lots of fun into the bargain.  The evening reception, attended by 700 people, was one of a series of events taking place around the UK to mark 70 years since the health service was founded.  During the engagement, Prince William watched a short film about the history of the NHS and listened to singing by the NHS Forth Valley Nurses Choir."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8070351.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"all-the-latest-from-day-three-of-the-scottish-open-at-gullane","story":"  He carded a two-under-par 68 in his third round today (Saturday) to lead the tournament at Gullane Golf Club.\u0026nbsp  He\u0026rsquos a shot clear of a six-strong group that includes American Rickie Fowler, the 2015 Scottish Open\u0026nbspchampion at Gullane.

The crew chose East Lothian due to its great surfing beaches and its film charter \u0026ndash an agreement between council departments to work together to accommodate film requests in the East Lothian area wherever possible.  In past years, East Lothian has been the backdrop for films including The Railway Man, starring Colin Firth and Nicole Kidman, and Steven Spielberg\u0027s The BFG.

The park, which is home to various football teams, has been the victim of numerous attacks but the latest, earlier this month, led to calls on social media for security to be tightened up there.  Two summers ago the park was hit twice by vandals in two weeks, again during July, with the \u0026lsquopie hut\u0026rsquo broken into and items stolen, as well as damage caused to the pitches and surrounding area.

The plans went before by the council\u0026rsquos planning committee in March last year but members agreed to delay a decision while consideration was given towards improvements being carried out at the junction of the A199 and B1407.  But the developer opted to go straight to appeal and Christopher Warren, a reporter appointed by the Scottish Ministers, gave an indication that the plans would be approved towards the end of November last year.  Now he has issued a final decision, which allows 93 houses and 20 flats to be built on land beside Orchardfield.  Gerry More, managing director of Stewart Milne Homes Central Scotland, said: \u0026ldquoThe sensitively designed new homes planned for East Linton will have a mix of 19 individual home styles, with house prices set to appeal to a wide range of buyers, from first-time buyers through to growing families.  \u0026ldquoOur vision is to create a series of new communities in East Lothian that incorporate traditional values and features from historical East Lothian towns and villages.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos encouraging that this vision is being shared and supported by the local authority.  \u0026ldquoWith substantial investment planned for landscaping, design and placemaking, The Orchard in the market town of East Linton is set to be a prime example of Stewart Milne Homes\u0026rsquo innovative approach to creating unique, sustainable and aspirational communities.  Thirty-one objections were lodged with the council\u0026rsquos planning department ahead of councillors considering the plans last year.  Dunpender Community Council raised concerns that the development was \u0026ldquotoo large-scale and building so many new homes at once would \u0026ldquoput undue pressure on existing services and infrastructure both within East Linton and in the wider area.  Ward member Councillor Norman Hampshire, who is also the chairman of the council\u0026rsquos planning committee, said: \u0026ldquoObviously we as a council support the development \u0026ndash it is part of the Local Development Plan. However, we did have concerns regarding the entrance into East Linton and we had hoped to have made improvements to that entrance.  \u0026ldquoHowever, Stewart Milne Homes have now got consent.  \u0026ldquoWe can still try to negotiate with the company to see if improvements can be made to the entrance.  \u0026ldquoMy preference would be a roundabout, like we have on the eastern side of East Linton, but that might be difficult now they have got consent but we will still negotiate to try to make improvements for access in and out of East Linton.  \u0026ldquoIt is a fast road and cars come down that hill and try to make a left turn into East Linton.  The councillor added: \u0026ldquoI think there is potential for an accident blackspot.  Mr Hampshire described East Linton as \u0026ldquoa very attractive village and noted the development would fund an extension to its primary school.  Of the 93 houses, 64 would be detached, 16 semi-detached and 13 terraced.  In terms of size, two of the proposed 93 houses would contain two bedrooms, 33 would contain three bedrooms, 36 would contain four bedrooms and 22 would contain five bedrooms.  Eighty-five of the houses would be for sale, with 28 affordable housing units, which would be a mix of two different house types and one and two-bedroom flats."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8129137.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"map-highlights-alcohol-hotspots-of-east-lothian","story":"  The study by Alcohol Focus Scotland, alongside the Centre for Research on Environment, Society and Health, flagged up hotspots in Musselburgh, Haddington and North Berwick.

Government spokesman Khieu Kanharith confirmed the Cambodian People\u0026rsquos Party had topped the polls.  He did not say how many of the 125 seats in the National Assembly the CPP had captured, but preliminary totals broadcast on state television showed the party had won at least 70% of the vote in each of the country\u0026rsquos 25 provinces.  Under the election\u0026rsquos system of proportional representation, the party would likely grab more than 100 seats.  Local and foreign rights groups, along with several Western governments, had agreed that the election would not be credible.  Charging that the polls were neither free nor fair, the disbanded CNRP\u0026rsquos former leaders had urged people not to vote in what was dubbed a \u0026ldquoClean Finger campaign because those who did cast ballots had to dip a finger in indelible ink to thwart multiple voting.  According to detailed totals released by the state National Election Committee, more than 6.8 million registered voters, or 82.2%, cast ballots.  The figure, if correct, would suggest the promotion by opposition forces of a poll boycott was ineffective. In the last general election in 2013, voter turnout was 6.6 million, or 68.5% of 9.7 million registered voters.  Hun Sen said on his Facebook page before the results were announced that he welcomed the big turnout, and congratulated his countrymen for exercising their right to vote.  Opposition forces, who had already judged the polls not to be free or fair because of the exclusion of the only credible challenger, can point to two reasons for the alleged failure of the boycott movement.  In rural areas where the majority live, the failure to vote \u0026ndash signified by having no fingers dipped in indelible ink \u0026ndash made voters subject to retaliation by local officials who carry out civic functions, such as land registration. There had been reports during the campaign of threats against anyone who planned to boycott the vote.  Voters in Phnom Penh, Cambodia\u0026rsquos capital and an opposition stronghold, were less susceptible to such threats because of their higher visibility and safety in numbers. However, according to the election committee, even there the turnout was about 80%.  Doubts are also likely to be raised about the actual turnout figures because several established poll-watching groups \u0026ndash as well as contingents from the United States and the European Union \u0026ndash declined to take part because they felt the polls were not legitimate. One of the bigger Cambodian groups participating in poll-watching was led by one of Hun Sen\u0026rsquos sons.  Following the election, exiled opposition leader Sam Rainsy, who had earlier urged Cambodians not to vote, called for peaceful protests, calling it \u0026ldquoa sham election with a foregone conclusion.  Speaking in Paris, where he lives, he said it \u0026ldquois a meaningless victory because (Hun Sen) won without any real challenger\u0026hellip prior to the election he dissolved the only credible opposition party.  Hun Sen\u0026rsquos Cambodian People\u0026rsquos Party was alarmed by the results of the 2013 election, when the race was close enough for the opposition to claim that it would have won had it not been for manipulation of the voter registration process.  Along with fracturing the political opposition \u0026ndash including pressuring Rainsy into exile and jailing his successor Kem Sokha \u0026ndash Hun Sen\u0026rsquos government also silenced critical voices in the media.  Over the past year, about 30 radio stations shut down, and two English-language newspapers that provided serious reporting were gutted, one forced to close and the other put under ownership friendly to the government.  Just ahead of the polls, the government ordered the temporary blocking of 17 websites, citing regulations prohibiting media from disseminating information that might affect security. The blocked websites included those of the US government-funded Voice of America as well as local media.  Hun Sen, whose 33 years in power make him among the world\u0026rsquos longest-serving national leaders, promised peace and prosperity at a rally on the last day of campaigning on Friday, but attacked the opposition\u0026rsquos boycott call and called those who heed it \u0026ldquodestroyers of democracy.  The 65-year-old has said he intends to stay in power for at least two more five-year terms."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8134394.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"thomas-enjoys-the-champagne-feeling-of-being-a-tour-de-france-winner","story":"  Before Alexander Kristoff took victory in the final sprint on the Champs-Elysees, Thomas lined up with his Sky team-mates and posed for pictures while carrying the Welsh flag on the 116km stage from Houilles.

Although Thomas was a protected rider in the team, Sky continued to insist Froome was their leader and Thomas himself was still making the point even after his victory on Alpe d\u0026rsquoHuez in the middle week put him one minute 39 seconds clear of his team-mate.

Introduced by Alex Salmond\u0026rsquos SNP Government, the Offensive Behaviour at Football Act (OBFA) was passed in response to trouble at an Old Firm match and after parcel bombs were sent to former Celtic manager Neil Lennon and others.  However, the law was derided by legal experts, football supporters and opposition politicians who believed it singled out fans for special treatment.

Although the Act has been scrapped, prosecutors have rebadged the outstanding charges as breaches of different legislation, a move critics believe is symptomatic of wider problems with the way football fans are dealt with by the criminal justice system.  During a recent pre-season friendly between Celtic and Standard Liege at Parkhead, a police officer pointed a video camera at a group of fans. After the incident was flagged up by Fans Against Criminalisation \u0026ndash a group which was set up to oppose the OBFA \u0026ndash the official Police Scotland Twitter account responded: \"Officers were deployed as a result of pro IRA songs being sung by a section of the crowd.\"  The force added: \u0026ldquoIf you don\u0026rsquot want police filming supporters at the game, don\u0026rsquot commit a crime.

Football fans are second-class citizens to the SNP Government, and that is why Labour is calling for an independent review of the way football policing is carried out.  FAC asked the Police Scotland for clarification of the tweets, after which McBride emailed the group about the controversy: \u0026ldquoI was the match commander of that fixture and prior to the game information had been received that \u0027Ultra\u0027 fans from Belgium would be attending the fixture. Being unaware of the threat these fans posed, I instructed officers with cameras be included in the match day operation.  He added: \u0026ldquoAt no time in my response on Twitter did I indicate that I felt that anyone connected with Fans Against Criminalisation were (or indeed are) in any way responsible for any of the actions that led to the police filming fans at that fixture and I would hope that you accept this communication as confirmation of that.  Assistant Chief Constable Bernard Higgins said: \"The policing of football matches is under constant review and while there is a general framework of how we approach them, the tactics and deployments will vary dependent on circumstances such as the nature of the match and the risk associated with it. As in the past, I or my colleagues will happily meet with any supporters\u0027 groups to discuss any concerns they may have.\""},{"url":null,"title":"paul-hutcheon-richard-leonard-should-stop-acting-like-jeremy-corbyn-is-his-boss","story":"  LABOUR\u0026rsquos breakdown over anti-Semitism sums up the party\u0026rsquos quandary as it faces up to nearly a decade out of office.  Jeremy Corbyn is pitted against the weakest Tory Prime Minister for more than 20 years. Theresa May\u0026rsquos troubled leadership could result in a formal split in her party and her vision of Brexit is likely to make voters worse off.  A focused and competent Opposition would be more than 20% in the lead in the opinion polls. The parliamentary Labour party would be united behind the leader and MPs would be positioning themselves for places in Government.  The reality is Labour is barely ahead of a struggling Tory party and is tearing itself apart about what constitutes prejudice towards Jews.  Anti-Semitism has always existed in pockets of the Left. Criticism of the current Likud-led coalition in Israel is entirely merited, but some individuals seem incapable of distinguishing between the appalling Benjamin Netanyahu and conspiracy theories involving banking, Mossad and Nazis.  The International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) deserves credit for making the clear distinction between legitimate criticism of Israel\u0026rsquos Government and hostility to Jews. Accepting the IHRA definition, and all 11 of the associated examples, should have been a no-brainer for Corbyn\u0026rsquos Labour.  But some Labour figures believed the IHRA definition would restrict the scope for criticism of Israel and, despite the definition being supported by dozens of countries and organisations, the party\u0027s governing body needlessly offended the Jewish community by watering down some of the eleven examples.  The anti-Semitism row may seem like Corbyn\u0026rsquos problem, but it is also illustrative of the difficulties faced by Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard since he succeeded Kezia Dugdale.  Leonard, despite the sneers from people who do not understand Scottish Labour, leads an autonomous party. He can say whatever he wants on reserved matters and can offer his view on whichever drama is consuming internal UK Labour politics.  Given that Labour is reviewing its code of anti-Semitism, Leonard could have led the way in calling for his party to back the full IHRA definition. He could have staked out a distinctive position, which would have reflected the majority in his own Holyrood group and in the wider Scottish party.  Leonard has instead kept quiet about the IHRA row while allowing the Scottish party to put out a defensive statement that backs the UK position. As with Brexit, where he has signed up to the baffling stance adopted by the Westminster Shadow Cabinet, Leonard prioritised unity with Corbyn over acting as the voice of Scottish Labour.  The Central Scotland MSP, eight months into his leadership, has two sizeable problems. One is that a majority of his MSPs \u0026ndash and their staff \u0026ndash do not, and will never, fully support him. Every day is a struggle and his enemies hope he fails.  The second issue is that many of his supporters care more about the Corbyn project than they do about him. Deviating from the UK leadership line is viewed by elements inside Team Leonard as tantamount to helping the Labour Right. For them, Leonard should be a replica Corbyn whose job is to help return Labour MPs.  Johann Lamont\u0026rsquos last call as leader was to warn that Scottish Labour had been treated as a \u0026ldquobranch office by London. Leonard has the power to be his own man, but seems reluctant to walk in his own shoes."},{"url":null,"title":"the-decluttering-conundrum-how-modern-life-has-got-in-the-way-of-the-quest-for-order","story":"  But lest we forget amid the summer sunshine, here are some chilling facts. Around 60% of the world\u0027s private consumer spending is done by the 12% of us who live in Western Europe and North America. The average British 10-year-old owns 238 toys yet plays with only 12 of them. A typical UK household has at least eight internet-connected devices. And every year, the army of professionals dedicated to helping us rid our lives of unwanted clutter grows by 10%.  Guilty as all those statistics make me feel, I could do with some professional guidance right now as I attempt to deal with the accumulated detritus of my own household\u0027s consumerist past. So I search the internet, where I learn that there is actually something called the Association of Professional Declutterers and Organisers, that it\u0027s possible to do a specialist training course in how to chuck out other people\u0027s stuff, and that the best advice of all was coined back in 1880 by William Morris, who said: \"Have nothing in your house that you do not know to be useful or believe to be beautiful.\"  But what, I wonder, would the father of the Arts \u0026amp Crafts movement have made of the mess of electronic gubbins I\u0027ve just pulled from the cupboard under the stairs? There are chargers for gadgets I don\u0027t remember owning, software CDs for devices that haven\u0027t worked in years, dozens of unlabelled video cassettes and a diabolical tangle of cables that have somehow become conjoined.  None of it is beautiful. The fact these objects have been unmissed for years would suggest they long ago outlived their usefulness. And yet \u0026hellip What if, somewhere amidst that technological morass, there lies the key to unlocking one of the umpteen outdated gadgets currently doing time in my loft? Up there among the bat droppings there are cameras that just might contain precious photographs. There are old PCs containing jottings that may one day be hailed as literary gems. There are broken vacuum cleaners that could conceivably be repaired, inkjet printers that came home with the laundry from various student flats, and VCRs I can\u0027t throw out in case one of the unlabelled video cassettes turns out to contain lost footage from my children\u0027s infancy.  Clearly, I am suffering from a bad case of disposophobia \u0026ndash fear of getting rid of stuff and then regretting it. Then again, \u0026ldquousefulness is a stretchable term and William Morris \u0026ndash who was speaking at a time when homes didn\u0027t even have electric sockets \u0026ndash could never have envisaged a society in which many people change their phones every year.  According to United Nations environmentalists, discarded electronic goods constitute the world\u0027s fastest-growing waste problem. Each year in the UK, the average person throws away 20-25kg of gadgets such as laptops, fridges, TVs and phones and in 2016 alone, some 43 million tonnes of electronic refuse were disposed of worldwide.  Hoarders like me may kid ourselves we\u0027re not adding to the tech mountain but, deep down, we know we are simply delaying the inevitable and that sooner or later, all that metal and plastic will have to come down from the loft. We could, of course, simply leave the excavation to our beneficiaries, by which time those old printers and vacuum cleaners may have acquired a veneer of vintage charm as offbeat coffee tables or lamp stands. But it appears that leaving your offspring to deal with your stuff is the height of bad manners in the 21st century, thanks to the growing popularity of the gloomy-sounding cult of Swedish death-cleaning.  Touted as \u0026ldquothe new hygge, this Scandinavian trend was introduced to the UK by Margareta Magnusson, author of The Gentle Art Of Swedish Death Cleaning. Offering tips on \u0026ldquoremoving unnecessary things and making your home nice and orderly when you think the time is coming closer for you to leave the planet, the book is the latest in a long line of clutter-clearing manuals.  I\u0027m not sure about Magnusson\u0027s exhortation that we \u0026ldquoreally must death-clean in order to \u0026ldquosave precious time for our loved ones after we have gone. People who have led useful lives and raised families are surely entitled to expect their descendants to make a little effort on their behalf and it\u0027s distressing to think of people feeling the need to disappear without trace \u0026ndash the ultimate exercise in \u0026ldquonot being a burden.  But she is undoubtedly right that getting rid of superfluous possessions helps people of any age to \u0026ldquolive in the moment and focus on what really matters. There\u0027s plenty of evidence that being surrounded by mess is bad for your mental health and psychologists say it interferes with our ability to make decisions \u0026ndash including, ironically, about what to do with all that stuff.  The long-term answer is, of course, to stop buying things and for manufacturers to be legally prevented from deliberately designing products with a limited lifespan, but in the meantime we still need to deal with the legacy of our past profligacy and Magnusson\u0027s suggestion that readers invite friends and family round to take what they want certainly beats dumping your cast-offs in landfill. \u0026ldquoTo know something will be well used and have a new home is a joy, she writes, adding that handing things on while you are still around lets you pass on some of the memories that are attached to the objects.  I love this idea but sadly it won\u0027t work for defunct old VCRs, which no-one\u0027s going to want, however much I regale them with happy tales of family video nights past watching The Best Of Tom \u0026amp Jerry on the loop. Nor is there any hope of persuading anyone to take over that other domestic bugbear, clearing out the bureaucratic bumph, which for many people remains a major source of anxiety, even in this supposedly paperless internet era.  In our house, there are three key places where piles of correspondence accumulate. There\u0027s the top of the radiator beside the front door, where boring looking letters gather dust, unopened. There\u0027s the hall table, where envelopes that just might contain cheques, tax rebates or the like get opened, then abandoned after the disappointing truth emerges. And there\u0027s the kitchen table, where stuff that urgently needs dealt with gets placed and then ignored.  When visitors are expected, those piles get swept into drawers or sometimes shoe boxes along with a mental note as to their whereabouts that immediately gets forgotten amid the frenzied business of creating a veneer of domestic orderliness.  And there they remain for months, sometimes years on end, until another attempt at home rationalisation brings them to light.  So what to do with them? According to the website of data security company Data Shield, \u0026ldquotrashcans full of old documents could potentially be a gold mine for identity thieves. They recommend shredding bank statements immediately, although Martin Lewis of MoneySavingExpert advises keeping them for at least six years, in case you need to back up mis-selling claims.  Confused? Me too, but I\u0027m also fed up with the amount of space those documents take up, particularly now that contactless payments mean each statement consists of several pages worth of bus fares, postage stamps and pound-store purchases. Even those who embrace online banking need to deal with the pre-digital backlog \u0026ndash which in my case, dates well into the last millennium. So can I just chuck it all in the recycling bin, I ask data protection consultant Daradjeet Jagpal, director of the Glasgow-based Information Law Solutions Limited? Apparently not.  \u0026ldquoWhen recycling bins were first introduced by local authorities, he tells me, \u0026ldquopeople were putting junk mail and even old bank statements in with their newspapers and magazines, thinking they\u0027d be shredded or otherwise destroyed. Unfortunately they didn\u0027t realise there were people who would go up to recycling bins during the night, and see what they could find.  Identity thieves, he says, are always one step ahead and bank statements need to be shredded, though even then: \u0026ldquoPeople who perpetrate these crimes are savvy and sometimes they take the shreds and join them together to create an image they can then use for their illegitimate purposes.  Since burning your papers may breach local environmental laws, he recommends using cross-cut shredders (which are safer but dearer than older models) or a professional shredding service. Can you, I ask, get away with removing your contact details and account numbers from the statements and recycle the rest? Jagpal sees no problem with this and is sanguine about energy bills going in the bin, though he warns phone bills which show other people\u0027s telephone numbers could potentially compromise their security too, and that old passports and driving licence documents must always be securely disposed of.  What about computers, I ask, thinking about the decrepit contraptions in my loft. Again, advises Jagpal, these should be disposed of carefully since even if they don\u0027t work, savvy thieves can read your hard drive and steal your data \u0026ndash with or without your passwords. If the machine still functions and you want to recycle it (which you really should), he suggests approaching a reputable company or charity that will certify that your data has been securely wiped.  If you must bin the machines, he recommends \u0026ldquoputting a hammer and chisel through the hard drive though points out that data protection legislation requires more stringent methods of corporate bodies.  All of which sounds very sensible but doesn\u0027t cure my disposophobia and although I briefly consider buying a cross-cut shredder (which can be bought online for less than \u0026pound20), I realise it would eventually end up joining all those inkjet printers in the loft.  So I opt, instead, for a low-tech solution. Phone bills, energy bills and dental check-up reminders get recklessly recycle-binned. Some yawn-inducing pension stuff gets relegated to the kitchen-table pending pile, along with car tax reminders and anything else that might result in a jail sentence if ignored.  Next, I start on the bank statements, beginning by cutting off the bits containing those risky personal details. Twenty minutes in, however, bored rigid and with 10,000 unexpurgated sheets to go, I throw the whole lot into a large box along with the electronic gubbins and squash it into the cupboard under the stairs.  It may be useful it may even be beautiful, in a surreal kind of way \u0026ndash but death cleaning can wait until I\u0027m dead. And if anyone wants to steal my identity after I\u0027ve gone, they\u0027re welcome to it.

The musician, better known for his indie band moniker Conquering Animal Sound, has recorded an album of songs inspired by the events around, and since, the city\u0026rsquos feelgood summer of 1988.  The five-month jamboree of arts and horticulture drew five million folk to a 100-acre patch of post-industrial brownfield on the south bank of the Clyde that had been repurposed as a verdant playground blooming with optimism.    Jamie Scott\u0026nbsp \u0026nbspPhotograph by Colin Mearns  Trams ran the length of the cobbled promenade, a beach and a forest were created at the Govan basin, and the docks became a playground for musicians and artists.  A Japanese garden, miniature railway, Art Deco milk bar and a huge floral crest celebrating the centenary of Celtic FC feature in many a photo album of those who visited the site in a summer when the riverside thrilled with screams from the Coca-Cola rollercoaster.  The festival, which was the third of its kind in the UK and lasted just 153 days, is fondly held in the collective memory of the city\u0026rsquos people, thousands of whom would consider the \u0026pound15 forked out for a season ticket to be among the best money they ever spent.  Yet the physical evidence that it even happened is scant.  The Bell\u0026rsquos Bridge, the uninspiring Festival Park and a now-obscured mural on the gable end of a block of flats are the only nods to an event which generated millions for the city.  It was while delivering mail as a postman on the streets of Govan that 30-year-old Scott was inspired to examine the cultural memory of the expo.  \u0026ldquoI went into a block of flats on the former site of the festival and up the stairs there\u0026rsquos the logo from the Garden Festival, says Scott. \u0026ldquoMy initial thought was that it would look good on a T-shirt, because it was really colourful and inspiring. Then I had the idea for an album about it and the more the whole thing went on the more we started to do, so we decided to recreate the festival at the Glad Cafe.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a marker of its 30th anniversary, but it felt like there was an intrinsic link to it, because of the way I stumbled across this thing that happened in the summer I was born.  Despite being born in Inverness midway through the festival\u0026rsquos run, and raised in the Trossachs, Glasgow-based Scott has come to understand the significance of the part it played in recovering some of the pride the city lost as the industries that made its name were dismantled in the 1980s.  \u0026ldquoThere\u0026rsquos a line you can draw from the Garden Festival to the European City of Culture in 1990, through to the Glasgow Miracle [a term coined by German art curator Hans Ulrich Obrist in response to the number of Turner Prize nominated artists in the city] and the explosion of the indie music scene, he says.  \u0026ldquoI was living in Govan when I first had the idea, and there aren\u0026rsquot really any markers to the festival in the area. There\u0026rsquos the Festival Business Park which has a logo on the wall which has been obscured, and festival park.  Working with a collective of artists and designers, Scott has conceived Glasgow Garden Festival \u002718, a live time-portal which will include designer Roy Shearer\u0026rsquos accessible scale model of the Clydesdale Bank 150 Anniversary Tower, one of the festival\u0026rsquos most popular attractions, as well as replica T-shirts, merchandise and immersive tours using virtual reality headsets to turn the clock back three decades.  Yet the purpose is more than providing the mere novelty of nostalgia.  He says: \u0026ldquoFrom what I\u0026rsquove read about the Garden Festival, people were overwhelmingly positive about it. People talked about never having seen anything like it in Glasgow before, they spoke about how it felt like the city had come together. Glaswegians were on the same page, seeing their city in a different light, which I think is really important.  The event, to be held on August 11, will feature the work of visual artist David Lemm who will contribute a series of illustrations based on some of the artwork around the site in contrast to its current appearance as an avenue of grey boxes, described recently by artist Lachlan Goudie as \u0026ldquobits of space junk.  Virtual reality artist James Houston will use archive footage shot during the festival to create an immersive experience enabling people to stroll through the site\u0026rsquos walkways wearing virtual reality headsets. Independent clothing label 2 Stripe, which specialises in reviving forgotten Scottish corporate iconography of the 1980s and 90s, will sell the T-shirts featuring the flower spray logo, which was the brainchild of Shona Maciver, of Glasgow design firm Locofoco.  \u0026ldquoApparently they sold something like 25,000 of those T-shirts, says Scott. \u0026ldquoWho knows how many of them are still out there.  He added: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove taken a few of the markers of the festival. The tower was removed almost as soon as it was over, and now stands in Rhyl, in Wales. There was no tower in Glasgow for many years until the tower at the Science Centre, and that was shut for a long time.  \u0026ldquoI think being able to go up and see a city from above is actually really important for its people \u0026ndash to see your own space, but also being able to see beyond it. It\u0026rsquos part of defining what your city is.  \u0026ldquoSo we decided to build a tower in the Glad Cafe and project archive footage of what people saw when they went up there, a skyline of Glasgow which doesn\u0026rsquot exist anymore, and this incredible festival going on below them.  \u0026ldquoOne of the things people remember about it most is that it was a nice summer, and we\u0026rsquore having the same kind of summer again 30 years later.  The gig will also feature Scott debuting the songs on the album Glasgow Garden Festival \u002718, which include references to the city\u0026rsquos ascendant music scene of the late 1980s.  He said: \u0026ldquoThere\u0026rsquos a song on the album called (Don\u0026rsquot You) Forget About Me, which is a totally different song from the Simple Minds one, and is really about the fact that the Garden Festival should be remembered. There\u0026rsquos also a reference to Tinseltown In The Rain by The Blue Nile. I think it\u0026rsquos important to recall what was going on with the music coming out of the city at the time.  One of the key themes behind the project is encapsulated in the song The Paper Boat, a reference to the art installation of the late Inverclyde artist George Wyllie, famed for his sculptures and artworks inspired by heavy industry along the Clyde. Both the river\u0026rsquos industry, and its garden festival, are now virtually gone.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a song about the decline of shipbuilding on the river, and a reference to George Wyllie\u0026rsquos Paper Boat, says the singer. \u0026ldquoSome of his artworks were at the festival, and though the Paper Boat wasn\u0026rsquot part of that, the song is a link to the fact that they worked with some of the former shipbuilders in the creative design of the festival.  \u0026ldquoWyllie\u0026rsquos take on the shipbuilding industry wasn\u0026rsquot just about people losing their jobs and their livelihoods, it was about the creative energies and the skills they had which gave them a sense of wellbeing. Losing the shipyards was about those people losing their creative energies.  It\u0026rsquos a desire to reflect the toils of the city\u0026rsquos forefathers which have led Jamie Scott to employ his own creative energies in tribute to theirs.  \u0026ldquoThey discovered the Floating Head from the festival sitting in a yard down the Clyde a few years ago, he says of another memorable installation, a head the size of a boat designed by Richard Groom, which floated on the river. \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos crazy to think there\u0026rsquos really nothing to mark it. Some of the artwork could still be accommodated on the site.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos something which has completely disappeared and yet is so fondly remembered. This is our way of doing that, and maybe others will, too.  Glasgow Garden Festival \u002718, The Glad Cafe, August 11.

The Glasgow Garden Festival was the first international expo to be held in Scotland\u0026rsquos biggest city since the Empire Exhibition in 1938.  Visitors were 40 per cent higher than expected at the 1988 celebration on the Prince\u0026rsquos Dock, living up to its slogan, \u0026ldquoA day out of this world.  And while little of it remains by way of physical touchstone, its impact on the city\u0026rsquos cultural confidence and reputation is unmistakable.  Within two years of being awarded the Garden Festival in 1984, Glasgow was named as the European Capital of Culture for 1990.  Some would argue that a line can be drawn from the Garden Festival through to this summer\u0026rsquos European Championships, with 1999\u0026rsquos City of Architecture and Design and 2014\u0026rsquos Commonwealth Games maintaining the momentum.  This year, the RSPB launched a Glasgow Wildlife Garden Festival to mark the 30th anniversary, with pop-up gardening events planned on Glasgow Green as part of next month\u0026rsquos Festival 2018 cultural accompaniment to the European Championships. A conference aimed at fifth and sixth year school pupils on the future of Glasgow\u0026rsquos green spaces is also due to be held at the city\u0026rsquos Science Centre on the former festival site. Today, the Science Centre is the only public attraction on the 120-acre footprint.  Initial plans for an ambitious housing development fell through after a downturn in the housing market in the late 1980s, and most of the site lay derelict for years.  In 2001, the Glasgow Tower opened, hailed as the tallest free-standing fully rotational structure in the world. It suffered from a series of malfunctions in the years after its completion.  The festival site is now home to a row of colourless offices and hotels, with the premises of broadcasters STV and BBC Scotland occupying the area.  Some of its attractions and installations were broken up and distributed near and far. The Clydesdale Bank Tower was sold for \u0026pound400,000 and now stands in Rhyl.  The Big Yellow Kettle became a tourist information office in Gourock, Inverclyde, before being dismantled. Nearby Cardwell Garden Centre is home to a variety of structures and plants from the festival, bought up by then owner Eric Gallagher.

What then transpired was a soul-chilling insight into how grotesque wealth often has a Uri Geller-like effect upon one\u0026rsquos moral compass.  After casually querying the viability of keeping brains alive in jars, one of the group \u0026ndash a major brokerage firm\u0026rsquos CEO \u0026ndash then proudly informed the professor he\u0026rsquod recently built an extensive \u0026ldquounderground bunker system. So far, so Robbie Williams. However, it was the next question which caused the hairs on the back of Rushkoff\u0026rsquos neck to rise: \u0026ldquoHow do I maintain authority over my security force after the Event?  This \u0026ldquoEvent, of course, refers to the apparently inevitable and imminent downfall of civilised society \u0026ndash envisioned simply as a complete breakdown in the laws governing our lives which maintain the fantasy of societal order. With capitalism\u0026rsquos illusion presently flickering like a cheap lamp in a thunderstorm, Professor Rushkoff\u0026rsquos account of the paranoid psyches of the super-rich is as deeply disturbing as it is enlightening.  With risk assessment a vital tool of success within the entrepreneurial sharkpool, we should perhaps not be surprised that these five individuals didn\u0026rsquot actually need a solution from Rushkoff on how to maintain control of their private armies. The question was purely rhetorical. Such post-Event plans seem to have already been drawn up \u0026ndash with these billionaires suggesting either advanced-AI security robots or special combination locks on the food supply could keep their biological minions subservient. There\u0026rsquoll certainly a risk of mutiny when they realise wages are worthless in a post-apocalyptic world.

So whether the apocalypse arrives upon the wings of nuclear war, an uncurable virus, environmental catastrophe or self-aware Artificial Intelligence, Rushkoff\u0026rsquos meeting has not only confirmed that humanity\u0026rsquos upper echelons are well aware their privileged social standing will mean nothing once money is meaningless \u0026ndash but also that they actually plan on keeping their hard-won elite status after the \u0026lsquoEvent\u0026rsquo.  This coldly tyrannical mindset was certainly responsible for the casual manner by which the next potential method of control was discussed \u0026ndash the possible post-Event application of an electronic collar device that deep south plantation owners would have seen as indistinguishable from magic. These would, presumably, administer a nasty blast of voltage to punish acts of insubordination.  But surely such a heinous instrument of control would never be put into production in a civilized modern society? Well, you can actually buy one off eBay right now for a tenner. Of course, such devices can only be used for disciplining naughty dogs at present, but it looks likely our own societal masters might be liberal enough not to discriminate between species.  HAD YOUR FILL OF BREXIT?  TALKING of apocalyptic scenarios, it seems doomed Tory patsy Dominic Raab has slipped into the role of Brexit Secretary as comfortably as Vegas Elvis\u0026rsquo swollen, gout-ridden feet did into his old blue suede shoes.  By announcing he\u0026rsquoll ensure adequate food supplies in the event of a \u0026ldquono deal divorce, Raab has inadvertently smashed the emergency alarm glass, alerting us to the Government\u0026rsquos acceptance of such a nightmarish endgame. It\u0026rsquos also likely this \u0026ldquoadequate stockpile describes the countless jars of Nutella and pesto crammed into his own cupboards at home. Perhaps he\u0026rsquoll soon be chastising starving children for not having the \u0026ldquoBlitz spirit.  Speaking selfishly, it would be good to have some clarity from Mr Raab on the legalities of cannibalism in the event of \u0026ldquono deal. I personally know one fella whom I suspect would be particularly flavoursome, having survived on a diet of ciggies and apple cider for much of his life.  Yet, despite cannibalism likely to be legalised before cannabis in the UK, perhaps we should first consider the facts behind the UK\u0026rsquos food imports before choosing which of our children we love the least.  It\u0026rsquos a fact that around half of all our food actually originates here \u0026ndash so the obvious solution is to simply ban sex and wait a few decades for half the population to die. No-one will have the energy for rumpo anyway on a diet of radioactive oxygen and tree bark.  Yet, it may be vital that we continue to bump uglies \u0026ndash the friction between two malnourished human pelvises may be the only means of sparking a fire once the lights go out.  CASHING IN AT THE END OF THE WORLD  IF you\u0026rsquore too skint or lazy to build your own doomsday bunker, take comfort in the fact that death is certain to be an agonisingly prolonged experience for world leaders and politicians who survive the \u0026ldquoEvent.  With nothing but tinned food, water and \u0026ndash one assumes \u0026ndash stockpiles of hairspray and St Tropez to keep them occupied, madness will overcome our newly-impotent rulers long before the bravery to surface does.  Unless, that is, they\u0026rsquove gone to ground in China, where a recently constructed underground complex is so spacious and accommodating that much of the populace will surely find conditions preferable to the toxic smog hellscape on the surface. Built 2,000 metres below ground in Beijing, the new city-sized complex apparently has space for at least one million people \u0026ndash with supplies that can last years, if necessary.  And unlike Western billionaires, President Xi Jinping won\u0026rsquot have to worry about mutiny over worthless wages within the ranks of his army, being communists and all. Already, the Chinese military proudly refer to the complex as the \u0026ldquobrain of the People\u0026rsquos Liberation Army, which will clearly remain the world\u0026rsquos largest fighting force post-apocalypse. Learn Mandarin now, kids.  It certainly puts the scale of a new commercial bunker complex recently completed in South Dakota into perspective, where Californian firm Vivos has identified a thriving market in end-time paranoia. Their underground tomb will host 10,000 customers who stump up a \u0026pound18,000 fee. Surely, however, Vivos knows all that cash will be worthless post-Event.  It\u0026rsquos almost as if they don\u0026rsquot expect the apocalypse to happen at all.  RELY ON NATURE WHEN ALL ELSE FAILS  SAM Cooke once ably informed us all that a change is gonna come, but it\u0026rsquos unlikely he meant a post-apocalyptic evolutionary adaption that will allow us to exist without eating. Or maybe he did, influenced perhaps by those Californian cultists that claim to survive on sunlight and good vibes alone.  So fear not if you can\u0026rsquot afford a bunker to sit out Armageddon \u0026ndash Japanese biologists agree with Sam that a change is, well, possible. If we have the patience to wait for a miraculous gene mutation which presently only takes place within the bodies of the sea-snail Gigantopelta chessoia.  Spending much of its life hanging around ocean hydrothermal vents, this wee creature\u0026rsquos digestive tract was found to completely cease functioning upon reaching physical maturity \u0026ndash with a mysterious gland that once acted as its food pipe increasing as dramatically as human teenagers\u0026rsquo hate for their parents.  This new organ then invites nearby bacteria to move in and carry out all the body\u0026rsquos energy conversion \u0026ndash allowing the snail to survive without ever eating food again. This astonishing feat is apparently fuelled by a bacteria-energising compound called hydrogen sulfide, which is abundant in ocean hydrothermal vents.  As the snail no longer needs to feed, the balance of the entire ecosystem changes \u0026ndash which, for humanity, would usher in a new Eden without abattoirs, fast food conglomerates or James Martin roadshows. Finding hydrothermal vents on dry land may prove challenging, but note that hydrogen sulphide is also richly abundant within human faeces \u0026ndash yet another way Brexit could leave us deep in the s***."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/8133193.jpg?type=article-full","title":"online-trolls-face-political-ban-for-election-intimidation-under-planned-law","story":"  A new law would target those convicted of \u0026ldquothreatening or abusive behaviour, either in person or online, towards those standing for Parliament or campaigners working for them, closing a loophole in legislation.  The measure follows a report on intimidation in public life which found that social media was \u0026ldquothe most significant factor driving harassment, abuse and intimidation of 2017 general election candidates, which included threats of violence and sexual violence, as well as damage to property.

Minister are also seeking views on \u0026ldquoclarifying the electoral offence of having undue influence on voters, which is when people are threatened in an attempt to influence how they cast their ballot.    Constitution Minister Chloe Smith said: \u0026ldquoThis Government recognises that rising intimidation in public life is stopping talented people from standing for election and putting voters off politics and we want to tackle this extremely serious issue.  \u0026ldquoWe are consulting on three new measures that will protect voters, candidates and campaigners so they can make their choice at the ballot box or stand for public service without fear of being victims of misinformation or abuse.  \u0026ldquoWe can\u0026rsquot let intimidation of our candidates, campaigners, the public and those that serve us continue unchecked and I would encourage everyone to take part in this consultation.  Currently, extreme cases of intimidation are considered a serious criminal offence, punishable with a custodial sentence where evidence of sustained, pressurising behaviour intended to cause distress and impact campaigning is found.  A Cabinet Office spokeswoman said that the length of the ban on standing or holding public office would be one of the subjects consulted on.  The report by the Committee on Standards in Public Life in December had urged ministers to consider such a new offence after identifying a gap in the legislation.  It also said the\u0026nbspGovernment should set up a \u0026ldquotrusted flagger social media reporting team during general elections so abuse and intimidation could be dealt with more quickly.

Aberdeenshire Council and Scottish Water are continuing to provide support to a number of properties experiencing water shortages and are encouraging everyone to use water wisely.                                                    Both agencies are working with the Scottish Government to provide bottled water and tanks to those in the area whose private supply is running dry, at no cost. Council teams are already dealing with requests relating to around 40 water supplies, serving around 60 properties, a number which is expected to increase.        The council has delivered, or householders have collected, 2,500 1.5 litre bottles of water. Fifteen 1,000-litre bowsers have been issued and filled by the council, which will be refilled as required. There are more than 7,500 private water supplies in Aberdeenshire – the highest number in thecountry.Given the limited capacity of the council, priority is being given to elderly, disabled or ill occupiers and householders may have to augment the supplies the council provides with water from other sources. More bowsers are being delivered this week and farmers concerned about their livestock are beingadvised to submit requests direct to Scottish Water.                                                                                                        Significant rainfall over a prolonged period is required to replenish some supplies, but this is not expected in the near future. There are warnings that when rain does fall, private supplies could become contaminated and users should be wary.Users of untreated supplies should ensure they boil water before drinking, cooking and brushing teeth. Those using such supplies may be eligible for grant funding towards treatment – contact the council’s environmental health team for information.Long-term, the council is providing advice on future solutions to improve water security, such as support to help connect to the mains. If that is not possible, improvements to the current source or forming a new supply can be considered and grants may be available for some of this work.Environmental health team manager, Louise Cunningham, said: “Most people will be well aware of how recent weather conditions have been affecting the country, but those with private water supplies in Aberdeenshire are acutely aware of the impact it’s having.                                                                                                        “Clearly we all have to use water wisely at times like this, but around 11,500 properties in Aberdeenshire are served by private water supplies, by far the highest number of any local authority in Scotland, and difficulties for these residents could be pronounced.“We are assisting where we can and would encourage anyone who is having issues with their private supply to get in touch with us, both about short term solutions and thinking about the longer term.“When rain does come, users of private supplies should be aware that following an extended dry period the water will not be absorbed by the ground quickly and has the potential to run over ground for longer, potentially contaminating some supplies.”If you need assistance in relation to water supplies, please contact the council by phoning 01467 539539 (during office hours) or by emailing: environmental@aberdeenshire.gov.uk Some useful advice from Scottish Water is also available online: http://bit.ly/2K1CQ7s                                                                    "},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116798.jpg","title":"Caithness estate with links to royal family to be sold at auction","story":"A CAITHNESS estate with links to the royal family and rock and pop stars is to be sold at auction next month.The Dunnet Head Estate, comprising 1800 acres of land and the House of the Northern Gate, was initially put on the market in February for \u0026pound925,000.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspA spokeswoman for Auction House Scotland, which is dealing with the transaction, yesterday described the price reduction as \u0026ldquoone of our biggest ever.She said: \u0026ldquoSince the latest reduction on Friday the amount of interest in the estate has increased tenfold with enquiries coming mostly from the UK.Asked why the estate is being sold, she replied: \u0026ldquoThe current owner has had it for a long time and felt it was time to sell up and move on.The estate includes six lochs, a beach, approved planning for 10 timber lodges and a detached house as well as the 10-bedroom House of the Northern Gate.It was owned by Commander Clare Vyner and his wife Lady Doris Vyner, who was the Queen Mother\u0026rsquos close friend and lady-in-waiting. While staying there in 1952 the Queen Mother saw Barrogill Castle, purchased it and renamed it the Castle of Mey.She restored it and stayed there regularly from 1955 until her death in 2002. The castle has been open to the public since then and attracts 25,000 visitors a year.After the Vyners sold their property it was run as a hotel from 1967 until 1974. When it then went on the market, the rock band Led Zeppelin looked at it with the aim of turning it into a recording studio although the plan did not come to fruition.Stuart \u0026ldquoWoody Wood from the Bay City Rollers also showed interest as a buyer but it was purchased by a clothes manufacturer before he sold it to the current owner\u0026rsquos family in the mid-1980s.The house \u0026ndash built between 1895 and 1908 \u0026ndash was also said to have been used as the backdrop for a horror film in the 1970s.The property is in need of refurbishment but could be developed as a hotel, as serviced apartments, as a bed-and-breakfast business or as a family home, according to the auctioneers.The 1800 acres of land is suitable \u0026ldquofor sport and grouse shooting, while the six lochs are said to be ideal for brown trout fishing. It also has planning approval for 10 timber lodges which could be built and rented out or leased to a holiday letting company, the auctioneers say.There is also approval for a new-build detached house.\u0026ldquoThe estate enjoys a spectacular setting on a peninsula of the most northerly coastline of the Scottish mainland, overlooking Dunnet Bay to the west and over the Pentland Firth and towards Orkney to the north, the promotional material says.Asked why the property is being sold at auction, the spokeswoman explained it can help maximise the price and \u0026ldquomake a more secure sale.She said: \u0026ldquoWhen the gavel falls the sale is legally binding.The auction of the estate is due to take place at St Vincent Street in Glasgow on August 16.Sunday 29 Jul 2018 8:41 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116795.jpg","title":"Mey Highland and Cultural Games to be bigger and better","story":"Event chairman Captain Richard Otley said that the Mey Highland and Cultural Games 2018 will be \u0026ldquobigger and better this year and \u0026ldquowill surely put Caithness on the map.The 2018 event is the first Highland games to include para-athletes\u0026rsquo events.

The Mey Games will be unique as it welcomes both para and Invictus athletes to compete in traditional Highland track-and-field competitions.

There will be in the region of 15 marquees this year, including seven new ones as a result of successful applications to local community benefit funds.\u0026ldquoThe Mey Games is now a major annual event in Caithness, Capt Otley said.\u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos organised by the Wick, Canisbay and Latheron branch of the RBLS who took on the running of the games when visitor numbers were dwindling to as low as just 30. Last year, we had 1500 visitors and this year we hope to welcome between 2500 and 3500 people.\u0026ldquoWe are all volunteers and work hard to ensure the event is a big success. It\u0026rsquos a community event and we want the local community to be part of it. We offer free stalls to local businesses as we want to encourage them to be involved.\u0026ldquoAt the RBLS we provide a lot of veteran support and our ethos is focused on military support and participation inclusion.\u0026ldquoWe are delighted to have so many para-athletes taking part this year from around the globe. A delegation from the RBLS Wick, Canisbay and Latheron branch visited Australia in April this year to mark Anzac Day so it\u0026rsquos fitting that we will have a number of Australian para-athletes taking part.\u0026ldquoWe want to make sure each of the para-athletes and everybody at the games has an enjoyable time.He stressed how the games have been \u0026ldquoramped up by comparing the number of marquees this year with the total put up two years ago, only three.\u0026ldquoThere has been a massive amount of work behind the scenes by a dedicated group of members to ensure the games not only takes place but grows to a more sustainable level.The build-up to the Mey Games will get under way with a North Coast 500 cycling challenge that will depart from Wick\u0026rsquos Market Square on July 28 and arrive back in the town on August 3, the day before the games.On the morning of the games, at 9.30am, there will be a rededication ceremony at the grave of General Lord Horne in Wick cemetery. \u0026ldquoWe shall honour Wick\u0026rsquos own hero of the Great War with a colour party and piper in attendance at this short but poignant event, Capt Otley said.Events kicks off at 11am and include Highland dancing competitions, pipe and drum bands, the tug of war, dog show and live music, as well as various exhibitions, local art, crafts and food stalls.The event will take place at John O\u0026rsquoGroats for the third time after travel company Natural Retreats stepped in after the previous games location, close to the Castle of Mey, became waterlogged.Since then the company has continued to provide ongoing complimentary use of the showground.Ewan Kearney, chief operating officer at Natural Retreats, said: \u0026ldquoWe are absolutely delighted to support the Mey Games again this year.For more information, visit the Mey Games Facebook page: https://www.facebook/MeyGames/Sunday 29 Jul 2018 8:41 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"New record set for Lands End to John OGroats cycle run","story":"THE record for cycling from Land\u0026rsquos End to John O\u0026rsquoGroats has been broken by Michael Broadwith.The 40-year-old from Hertfordshire did the marathon bike run in 43 hours, 25 minutes and 13 seconds \u0026ndash more than 30 minutes faster than the previous record held by Gethin Butler.His record of 44 hours, four minutes and 19 seconds had stood for 17 years.Veteran local cyclist Alasdair Washington was a record-keeper for the Road Records Association (RRA) at the north end of the trip.Mr Broadwith, a maths teacher, joins a select number of people to break the record since George Mills, riding a penny-farthing, made the first successful end-to-end attempt in 1886.Broadwith also broke the RRA 24-hour record with 507.511 miles covered at an average speed of 21.1 miles per hour.Bill Mowat, vice-chairman of the Dunnet and Canisbay Community Council, congratulated Mr Broadwith on his remarkable achievement.The women\u0026rsquos record holder is Lynne Taylor who lives in the West Midlands. \u0026ldquoShe is the only one with a Canisbay parish relative to do so, said Mr Mowat, who pointed out that the RRA only recognised female racers in the late 1930s.

Its expertise is thought to have formed part of the case for siting the facility at the Moine, which is about 40 miles west of Dounreay.Cavendish Dounreay Partnership (CDP) and its subsidiary Dounreay Site Restoration Ltd (DSRL) have invested resources in the spaceport proposal as part of its bid to identify and develop new jobs after the closure of the plant.Mr Craig said: \u0026ldquoEvery single one of us here at Dounreay recognises the importance of seizing opportunities like these to create new job opportunities, not just for this generation but the one that follows when Dounreay is gone.He added: \u0026ldquoOur skill sets in engineering, environmental science, programme management and a range of technical disciplines are easily transferable to industries such as the space sector and I am committed to working closely with the developer and operator to make the most of this amazing opportunity for our people.CDP chairman Simon Bowen said: \u0026ldquoDecommissioning a complex nuclear site like Dounreay is about more than getting it into a state that is safe for future generations \u0026ndash it is also about securing the social and economic prosperity of future generations.\u0026ldquoThe UK vertical launch facility is a key priority, with the potential to deliver high-value employment and supply chain opportunities.Sutherland was one of three potential spaceport locations to submit outline business cases to Highlands and Islands Enterprise (HIE) earlier this year. The others were Scolpaig on North Uist and Unst in Shetland.All three were assessed by independent consultants with specialist knowledge of the space sector.Each one met key criteria, including the ability to stage north facing launches over the sea into both polar and sun-synchronous orbit.However, the business case for Sutherland was judged stronger overall, including being successfully awarded UK Space Agency funding for its proposals in collaboration with potential launch operators.HIE chief executive Charlotte Wright said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore very clear that we want to work with others to ensure the benefits of a spaceport in the Highlands and Islands are not confined to Sutherland, but extend well beyond.\u0026ldquoA central part of our approach as we develop this project will be to explore opportunities throughout our region.Sunday 29 Jul 2018 8:41 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"We just werent at the races says Academy boss after opening day derby defeat","story":"DEJECTED Wick Academy manager Tom McKenna watched his side succumb to a 2-0 derby defeat to Brora Rangers and admitted: \u0026ldquoWe just weren\u0026rsquot at the races.Goals by Kyle Macleod on the stroke of half-time and Craig Campbell just before the hour mark gave Brora a 2-0 win at Dudgeon Park on Saturday in Steven Mackay\u0026rsquos first competitive match as player/manager.Rarely will you see a more one-sided game with a mere two-goal margin of victory, and after the final whistle McKenna admitted his team had been second best throughout.\u0026ldquoWe were lethargic, we were disjointed, there was no fluency in our game, he said.\u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom not going to take anything away from Brora \u0026ndash they were by far the better team.

The organisation\u0026rsquos chairman, Tony Vandyke, says the money will be used to complete the first stage of an extensive revamp ahead of proposed further work in the next five years.\"We are going to use the money for things like replacing the handrails and changing the electrics and lighting,\" he said. \"These are vital upgrades. It will also enable us to start some engineering works.There are some issues regarding the age of the harbour. Part of the stonework has shifted and needs some work.

It\u0026rsquos not a fix for everything, because we have concrete which is now over 100 years old and is past the end of its useful life. However, it\u0026rsquos important for us to preserve everythng we can.\"All of the help and funding we have received will give us a more modern harbour that is safer.

The utility giant said underlying earnings at its generation and supply unit had soared by more than 300 per cent to £165.8 million in the six months to the end of June. It added that the  division had “recovered” from a poor performance in 2017.            Average customer consumption increased by 4 per cent year-on-year over the period, which was mainly due to cold weather from the Beast from the East around late February and March.            Customer numbers now stand at about 4.9 million, down from the five million reported at the end of the first quarter of 2018.The latest figures come after the Big Six energy company, which is owned by Spanish multinational Iberdrola, increased prices in a move that hit some 950,000 households.The firm hiked its standard variable gas and electricity prices for around a third of its customers from 1 June, with impacted households facing an average increase of 5.5 per cent.ScottishPower attributed the rise to an increase in wholesale energy costs, alongside costs associated with upgrading meters and delivering electricity from low-carbon sources.The firm has been investing in wind power, having completed a £650m project to build eight wind farms north of the Border.            Over the first six months of 2018, ScottishPower also started construction on a major offshore wind farm in East Anglia, the East Anglia ONE project.Underlying earnings at the ScottishPower Renewables business rose 27 per cent to £205.1m while they nudged up 3 per cent to £399.9m at the SP Energy Networks division.The group has also completed the installation of one million smart meters. It is working with four installation partners across the UK, installing at peak 2,700 meters per day with a UK-wide workforce of more than 500 people.ScottishPower chief executive Keith Anderson said: “Everyone knows that installing smart meters hasn’t been plain sailing for suppliers. Challenges have been overcome, with more to face, but it is a major achievement to reach one million installations.            “The potential for customers to reduce consumption and save money is only one benefit. As the energy industry becomes fully digital in the years ahead, the new meters will be a vital cog in a smart network that supports electric vehicle charging, manages locally produced renewable energy and even the storage of electricity at home.”On the half-year results he noted: “All of our business areas are performing in line with expectations. Our investment in onshore wind last year has seen an increase in electricity generated, and excellent progress has been made on delivering the £2.5 billion East Anglia ONE project.”"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4774174.1532601783!/image/image.jpg","title":"end of era as john menzies offloads distribution arm","story":"        Logistics group John Menzies has entered into a conditional agreement to sell its print media division Menzies Distribution to investment funds managed by \u0026#8220transformational\u0026#8221 private equity investor Endless LLP in a \u0026#16374.5 million deal.                It said the proposed disposal creates a global aviation services business “operating in a structural growth market and marks Menzies’ exit from the market for print media and retail logistics”, enabling it to expand in the structurally growing aviation services market.            The Edinburgh-based group was founded in 1833 with the opening of a bookshop on Edinburgh’s Princes Street, which began selling The Scotsman newspaper over the counter and Menzies became known for retailing and wholesaling.            As part of the disposal, Menzies will retain a 10 per cent equity stake in the business, while Menzies Distribution will be responsible for the funding of Section B of the Menzies defined benefit pension scheme, which represents 17 per cent of the assets and liabilities of that scheme as at 31 December.John Menzies chairman Dermot Smurfit said: “I am delighted to announce today the sale of Menzies Distribution. In doing so we create a ‘pure play’ aviation services business that operates in a structural growth market and is very well-placed to take advantage of the many exciting opportunities that exist.”Upon completion of the disposal, which is subject to shareholder approval and expected to complete in September, Forsyth Black, currently president and managing director of Menzies Aviation, will be appointed chief executive of John Menzies and will be supported by Giles Wilson, chief financial officer and John Geddes, group company secretary and corporate affairs director.Smurfit added: “In his role as Menzies CEO, Forsyth Black will now focus on growing our market share in the aviation services market, increasing our operating margins and continuing to deliver excellent services to our customers.”The firm is set to report its interim results on 14 August."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4775528.1532886959!/image/image.jpg","title":"letter another scottish independence march so why does support remain the same","story":"        So another independence parade has taken place, this time in Inverness.

There is nothing better than a cracking fairytale when everything works out in the end with the main characters dancing into the sunset. Having overcome obstacles, barriers and nasty people, our wanderers sail away in a dream world of happiness and bliss. It warms our cockles and makes us feel all gooey inside. From Disney’s Cinderella to Tarzan to Shrek, good will win through and love will save the day.            And as always the baddie or villain gets his or her comeuppance and is cast aside. The villain learns his or her lesson and either falls off a cliff or eats lots of humble pie. But in the Brexit fairytale, the villain keeps winning and it’s spoiling the ending for me...            For many of you, Boris Johnson was a joke and a joker. He was happy to hang from a zip wire in London, ensuring all the press put his picture front of stage in the next day’s editions. He just loved the fact that his hair was literally all over the place and in need of some care and attention. It was and is messy and disheveled – all the time, making him look a bit clumsy and cute. He basked in the knowledge that the Tory-leaning broadsheet, The , would hire him at the drop of a hat to write his column, giving him that elevated platform he needed to point the finger at others. But, in this fairytale, Brexit Boris just will not leave us all alone to get on with the film. He keeps calling a halt to production. No, this baddie will not learn his lesson.I was one of those gullible idiots who swallowed the Brexit Bus slogans – hook, line and sinker. Hundreds of millions of pounds would come back to the UK each week and our NHS would swallow it up to keep this stalwart of British society prospering. READ MORE: |UK to stockpile food in event of no-deal BrexitAlong with Nigel Farage, Boris was front and centre in the Brexit campaign. It appeared these two characters were key to the plotline. They were partners in crime, but likeable rogues who were happy to swill a pint at the local village pub or get involved in some crazy prank. Were they the goodies or the baddies though? Then the unthinkable happened and we all woke up to the next instalment in our fairytale. These two had pulled it off.              Farage then did a runner. He has carved out a tidy media career with LBC in London. It is estimated that his media earnings are topping £700,000 a year. Well done Nigel. And who knows, Her Majesty may even honour him with that knighthood. It’ll be “Arise Sir Nigel”, as he distances himself from the nightmare he has helped create. But, this character is only now reduced to a sub-plot in our fairytale. The main protagonist and staring role goes to Boris. And I’m now convinced this baddie may be unstoppable.  No doubt the Tory grandees wanted him in power to give him a flavour of what it was like working with others. So, Mrs May was told to give him a seat at the table. The office of Foreign Secretary beckoned and he was completely unimpressive. Why? Because in this fairytale, he was plotting for more. He wants it all. He wants a shot at the title.My question to the screenwriters of our fairytale is this: Is the baddie not supposed to die or get trampled by rampaging wildebeest? Surely, you are not going to let the villain win the day?  No sooner had Johnson resigned, in what can only be described as a staged media directors cut, than he starts writing for the .

The one you, Boris, created and we are all suffering from as a result – Brexit. You cannot just whitewash yourself out of this one, hoping that some other patsy will pop up and take the blame. No, you wanted it, you sold it and now you need to run with it! We want a happy ending, Boris, and only you have the answer. After all, you had the answers 18 months ago...Does it feel like I’m being a bit accusatorial? Am I being too harsh on this Boris character? Are there other baddies in the background pulling his strings and writing the ending of our fairytale?This is our reality today as we prepare for a no-deal Brexit, WTO rules and a whole raft of sub-plots that we have not even considered. And we Scots are powerless to intervene in any way. The First Minister has tried. To be fair, Nicola Sturgeon must be sick to her back teeth of this baddie, wondering how she can have him written out of each scene. But, like Dr Legg in Eastenders, he keeps coming back.I’m afraid folks, there is no happy ending to our fairytale. Boris will make sure of that. Just as the world is burning, this baddie wants the hot seat, so he can rule and fulfil his potential and and make Boris 2, Boris 3: This Time it’s Personal, etc. It’s his movie and sequels and we are all bit-parts.              I wonder if he wakes up in the morning and sings that Lion King song, ‘I just can’t wait to be king!!’ The only problem with all of this is our fairytale has been turned upside down. Maybe it’s time we all left in search of Narnia.

Peter Duncan revealed he quit his role at the Scottish Unionist Association Trust (SUAT) ten days ago because he wanted “more separation” between its work and his role as a lobbyist.            But he denied the trust was being used to conceal the source of political donations, and said the nearly £319,000 given to Tory campaigns over 17 years had been generated from the “historic proceeds of raffles and tombolas”.            Political opponents have urged Ruth Davidson to reveal the source of the donations after the scale of financial support emerged.Under electoral law, unincorporated associations are not required to register with the Electoral Commission or declare where they receive their money from provided they donate less than £25,000 per calendar year to political parties and candidates.The elections watchdog has said it is reviewing whether SUAT has “complied with their reporting requirements as set out in law”.An investigation by the Ferret website revealed that between April 2001 and February 2018, SUAT donated £318,876 to the Conservatives. At last year’s general election, the trust made donations to the campaigns of Tory MPs John Lamont, David Duguid and Douglas Ross.Mr Duncan, who served as MP for Galloway and Upper Nithsdale from 2001 to 2005, told the BBC: “The suggestion that this is in some way dark money is a bit like suggesting the WI is some KGB front organisation. This is historic proceeds of tombolas and raffles throughout the west of Scotland going back 50 years.            “They were transferred into a trust with the express purpose, not of spending it, but actually investing it long-term.“And that’s what the trust has done since about the time I was born. It has invested that money with the objective of growing its capital base and making some of the proceeds available on a semi-regular basis to the party’s campaigns.” He added: “I was satisfied, and remain satisfied, that the trust is a permissible donor and that this is in no way dark money.”Theresa May said all donations to the Scottish Tories had been “accepted and declared in accordance with the law” when the SNP’s Westminster leader Ian Blackford challenged her over the issue at PMQs earlier this month.SNP MP Pete Wishart claimed last week that “serious questions are now piling up at Ruth Davidson’s door over the dark money that is funding the Scottish Tories”.            The Scottish Conservatives have said the party “always works closely with the Electoral Commission on the permissibility of donors”."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4774013.1532550395!/image/image.jpg","title":"strictly come dancing sensation ed balls on his newest tv show","story":"        Ed Balls is discussing the dos and don\u0026#8217ts of donning a leotard.                No, he’s not referring to his Strictly Come Dancing days (in case you missed it, he was the unexpected star of the 2016 series).            The former politician, 51, actually wears a skimpy Union flag number to enter the wrestling ring in new BBC Two show, Travels In Trumpland With Ed Balls.            “I’m not someone who previously had bikini line concerns, but they wanted me to wear a really tight-cut leotard, and I thought it would be unflattering,” quips the Norwich-born father-of-three, who’s married to Labour MP Yvette Cooper.“I got a pair of black boxers under it. Had I only worn the bikini line, that might have ruined it for the viewer…”He decided not to shave his legs and torso, like his fellow wrestlers did, either.“My kids think dads should be embarrassing but that I substantially overachieve,” he adds with a grin.“I could explain to my 13-year-old why it was important to do the wrestling, but if I’d have been waxed and shaved, she would have said it was too much.”            The factual entertainment series sees the ex-shadow chancellor walk in the shoes of a variety of supporters of US President Donald Trump, to try and understand why they voted for him.“Lots of people will assume they’re either deluded and don’t understand, or extreme and dangerous, but we just met really nice, ordinary people,” he says.“I thought that after the first year Trump would be losing support, but we didn’t find that at all and it wouldn’t surprise me at all if he won a second term.”The three episodes look at different issues facing Americans, whether that’s the gun control movement or immigration policies, and how they feel about their country since former reality star Trump was elected in 2016.            “I thought he’d drop the wild persona and become a more reasonable, centrist president but he hasn’t at all,” Balls notes.“You assume it can’t get worse, and it does.”As well as being an insightful and entertaining series, what might surprise viewers is how emotional it is to watch at times.In the first episode, Balls stays at a farm with a group of war veterans, and as well as hearing their thoughts on Trump, he joins them round a campfire for a toast to friends who lost their lives in service.And he asks to toast to Labour MP Jo Cox, a mum-of-two who was murdered by a far-right extremist outside her constituency surgery in Birstall, near Leeds, a week before the EU referendum.            “The only thing which felt comparable to me was Jo, who I knew very, very well,” Balls confides of the moving scene. “I did a lot of campaigning and fundraising with her.“From a personal point of view... Jo losing her life is a terrible thing, obviously, but I’m somebody who has three kids, and a partner who does exactly the same kind of surgeries every Friday, so it could absolutely have been us.“I could both think about what it’s like to be Jo but also think about what it’s like to be her family.”Balls agrees that competing on Strictly – on which he won fans over with his memorable salsa to Gangnam Style – showed the public a different side to him.“People kept saying to me, ‘We always knew you were a politician but it’s great to see you’re a human being as well’.”With presenting this documentary series taking him out of his comfort zone once again, he says we can expect to see even more of his personality.“It’s impossible to be in a character for so many hours [of filming] each day, so it’s impossible to conceal who I am.” Did he look to an experienced interviewer like Louis Theroux for inspiration?“I took a decision that I shouldn’t watch anyone else doing this kind of thing until we had made the first episode. I didn’t want to try and be someone else.“If you asked me what the genre is, it’s a mix of old-style, early Louis Theroux meets The Real Marigold Hotel and little bit of Ruby Wax.“I tried to let the characters do the talking. I reveal my opinions to camera but not to the people I’m with.”It was the 2015 general election when Balls lost his seat in the Morley and Outwood constituency, in West Yorkshire.And he doesn’t seem to envy those currently working as an MP.“I’m regretful politics is so chaotic at the moment, and I look back at better times wistfully,” he says.“But if you said to me, ‘You could be in Parliament or you could do this show at the moment’, I’d definitely choose this show.”"},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.\n\nThe project, costing around £6 million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in 2006.

It’s manufacture uses up valuable natural resources but this is a result of human exploitation. This begs the question, why are humans capable of natural behaviour and unnatural behaviour in what seems to be equal measure?  Is it normal and natural to drive cars, fly in ‘planes, build tower blocks, dig for coal, aim to fly to distant planet ? The list is endless. According to the experts, global warming and ice ages have occurred many times and certainly before life as we know it existed.

One of the most remarkable performances in the latter game came from Kari Arnason, recently deemed not good enough by Aberdeen but still able to do a pretty fair job on shackling Lionel Messi.\nThe introduction the Video Assistant Referee system, or VAR as it is commonly known, has caused a few talking points. There was the decision to allow Diego Costa’s first goal for Spain against Portugal, and also to award penalties to France and Sweden against Australia and South Korea respectively.\nThese “assistants” are apparently not even at the game. They are sitting in a office somewhere in Moscow, but bizarrely kitted out in full referees’ uniform!\nWhy on earth they didn’t disallow Switzerland’s equaliser against Brazil is beyond me, however.

The cricketer with roots connected to these parts was none other than the man of the match himself – batsman Callum MacLeod whose magnificent 140 not out was largely responsible for Scotland’s thrilling win.\nMacLeod’s father Donald attended the Anderson High School in the late 1960s and early 70s. He was a goalkeeper himself, playing for the Ness United team in the Shetland under-18 competitions.\nHe went on to make somewhat of a name for himself as a photographer, working for The Press and Journal and The Scotsman at times before establishing his own business.\nMacLeod (junior) has obviously usurped any success attained by his old man, however. Even before his recent moment of glory he has been an established international batsman, making several centuries at one-day level.\nHe has been good enough to play grade cricket in Sydney, which is no mean feat, has had stints at English counties Warwickshire and Durham and has just signed a contract with Derbyshire.\nIt is going on half a century since I last saw Donald MacLeod, but I know a certain former Whitedale goalkeeper who keeps in touch. If he happens to read this he’ll maybe pass on congratulations from me, and I’m sure a few others, to the family.\n: : : : : : : :\nTwo weeks ago I suggested that having clubs competing in a local league structure could be of great benefit to preparation for junior inter-county sports such as hockey and netball.\nWhile there is no regular junior league set-up in the isles for hockey, it has been pointed out that in netball this exists for primary school-aged players upwards.\nThe sport appears to be thriving at the various age levels, with under-13 and under-17 squads regularly competing on the mainland with success.\nThe Anderson High School team has also regularly sent a team to compete in the Scottish Schools Open competition, where they have performed with distinction over the past few years.\nThe AHS team also plays in division one of the senior netball leagues, while a feeder team called “Hotfooters” was created to provide easier access for youngsters to join the league.\nAccording to the organisers there have been over 1,000 competitive matches in Shetland and 32 competitive matches away from the isles for juniors this season in various leagues and tournaments.\nCoach Sanna Aitken says: “Of course it is disappointing that we lost the junior inter-county this year \u0026#8230 the girls were really gutted.\n“As a coach, I am delighted that the netball continues to be really competitive [with] an incredibly high standard of match demonstrating the hard work and success of the sport and junior set-up in both isles.\n“I am confident when saying the loss was nothing to do with any weaknesses in the local league structure.

Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined.\nI think the Mareel is a fine looking structure.

Would not even need a bar!!!\nThe Shard in London, an amazingly beatiful structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.  Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautiful building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indifferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays.

Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identifying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\n@ Haydn Gear.\nWhen there is nothing of note to differentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.\nPretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.\nUnless you already know Mareel\u0026#8217s purpose and that its supposedly an \u0026#8216iconic\u0026#8217 design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that\u0026#8217s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname \u0026#8216The Pagoda\u0026#8217 as soon as it was built.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions (£16?), Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\nI have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel.   What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.  Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kick  out of venting there spleens in those directions.  I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments?  I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.\nPurely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda was  in any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it?  I wonder if takeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architectural  similarities.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"rubber duck wins first bergen lerwick leg of shetland race ","story":"Espen Børresen (left) and Morten Offendal celebrate their victory.

There is no doubt the English are cute enough to take full advantage of the introduction of VAR system with three penalty kicks so far despatched by captain Harry Kane.\nPenalising defenders for holding at corners and other set pieces is, I have to say, a major step forward. This has been going on for far too long in most levels of football, and thankfully the days of pundits uttering the words “part and parcel of the game” will now be over.\nGrabbing someone in a bear hug is not football – never has been and never will be. I recall a European match some years ago when Glasgow Celtic should have had about six penalties but the referee gave none.\nWhat this needs now is for officials to be in accordance with one another. But sadly, and I can envisage a few whistlers spluttering over their cornflakes at this, the words “consistent” and “referees” are an oxymoron as far as I\u0026#8217m concerned.\nOn the subject of the English progression in the tournament, it has once again thrown up the perennial question of whether Scottish people should support their oldest rivals.\nThere are no doubt many north of the border who would find the prospect of England winning the World Cup a terrifying one. They could even be in the majority. A recent poll suggested that only 15 per cent of Scots would support the English while 28 per cent would back anyone playing against them.\nThe same survey found that only two per cent of Scottish National Party voters would get behind England, although I actually find that figure quite high.\nIt does appear to be the case that Scottish football followers have nothing against English players, many of whom they actually admire, but it is those in the press and the media who they reserve their anger for.\nI sincerely hope that England do go all the way. I have always supported them when Scotland are not involved, and in recent years that has become the norm.\nA few issues do bother me, such as the constant gormless look on Kane’s face and the insistence of manager Gareth Southgate on dressing as if he was taking part in the World Snooker Championships. Someone should tell him that waistcoats are the most pointless item of clothing known to man.\nBut hey, most of it is good. I particularly enjoy the ITV panel and even Ian Wright is growing on me!\n: : : : : : : :\nIt is just over a month since the tragic death of former Aberdeen footballer Neale Cooper and I would like to add my own tribute to the many which have been paid to such a popular man.\nThe late Neale Cooper made a memorable trip to Shetland.\nAt just 19 he was the youngest member of the 1983 European Cup Winners Cup side which defeated Real Madrid in the final at Gothenburg in Sweden.\nAlong with that memorable triumph he was in the team which won two Scottish league titles, four Scottish Cups, a league cup and the European Super Cup, all achieved before he was 24.\nHe later played for Aston Villa, Rangers, Reading, Dunfermline and Ross County, where he later became manager.\nIt was in the summer of 1999, when Ross County were invited to Shetland as guests for Scalloway’s centenary celebrations, that I had the privilege of meeting Cooper.\nThere was a gala dinner in the village hall after the friendly match where County defeated Scalloway 8-2, and he agreed to give me time for a short interview. But not until after his speech, he said, which he was dreading as he hated speaking at formal events.\nSadly the evening dragged on somewhat, with various Scalloway luminaries spending rather more time on stage than was really necessary, and it was approaching 1am when Cooper eventually got his turn.\nI decided to give up on the interview that night, and maybe catch him the following day after a game against a Shetland XI in Lerwick.\nAs I was wandering along the embankment at Gilbertson Park prior to the match I heard someone calling my name, and was surprised to see Cooper running towards me.\nHe was full of apologies about the previous evening, although he had no justification, and he said he would speak to me immediately after the game.\nThe match ended 2-2 and Cooper was generous in his praise for the opposition. Shetland were “as good as any top Highland League side”, he said.\nThe two-day visit had been excellent both from a football point of view and a social one, he added. “It’s been fantastic. We had a great welcome from Scalloway and it was an honour to be invited to their centenary celebrations. I’ve never been to Shetland before and I only found out last week that my mother had been here 40 years ago.”\nFollowing Cooper’s untimely death, and the loss of the first of the Gothenburg greats, there have been many kind words. Colleagues, writers and others have pointed out what a humble, friendly and likeable character he was.\nThey are absolutely correct. I’ve meet a few well-known footballers over the years but I have no difficulty in stating that Neil Cooper was the nicest one of them all.\n: : : : : : : :\nCyclist Chris Froome is now free to go for a record-equalling fifth Tour de France win after his anti-doping case was sensibly dropped.\nThe Team Sky rider had been under investigation by the sport’s world governing body Union Cycliste Internationale but proceedings were closed on Monday.\nFroome, who is bidding to move level with Eddy Merckx, Bernard Hinault, Jacques Anquetil and Miguel Indurain as the only five-time winners of the tour, has been under intense pressure since an amount of the asthma treatment salbutamol was found in his system.\nGet off this guy’s back and give him a break, I say. Just because he’s the best cyclist in the world does not mean he’s benefiting from a performance-enhancing drug.\n: : : : : : : :\nWith all the buzz of the World Cup an annual competition in southwest London has almost been forgotten about.\nYes, Wimbledon is in full flow once again and the British competitors are as usual struggling to make it into the second week.\nAndy Murray was probably sensible to withdraw, citing that he was not quite ready for five-set matches after his hip operation. There were signs at Queens and Eastbourne, however, that he may be able to scale the heights once more.\nThere is of course a capable replacement in Kyle Edmund, who is seeded having reached the Australian Open semi-finals earlier this year.\nEdmund’s half of the draw looks fairly open, and he could well still be involved come Monday. But of course anything can happen, and by the time you read this he could be gone.

On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely different.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the length and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit if ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great individual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois (Belgium) Benjamin Pavard (France), Raphaël Varane (France), Diego Godín (Uruguay), Ivan Strinic (Croatia) Ivan Perisic (Croatia), Luka Modric (Croatia), Jordan Henderson (England), Eden Hazard (Belgium) Cristiano Ronaldo (Portugal), Edinson Cavani (Uruguay).\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the diving Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe if Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"communities minister makes isles her first port of call ","story":"\nCabinet secretary Aileen Campbell pours soap mixture into a mould under the watchful eye of Louise Jamieson.

Even with the introduction of new flights our air connections remain some of the most fragile across these isles.\n\u0026ldquoThe Smith Commission was very clear when it stated that: \u0026lsquothe power to charge tax on air passengers leaving Scottish airports will be devolved to the Scottish Parliament.

However, the six houses are to be built on what was a King George V Playing Field, which was set aside and protected in 1962.\nFor anyone to build on this land they must notify and obtain the consent of Fields in Trust, a charity that acts to protect all KGV land. Even though the comhairle took over the management of the land in 1984 they must still obtain the trust’s consent.\nThe Barra Sports Forum have been pressing the comhairle for years to transfer a piece of derelict land near the Co-op, which is adjacent to the KGV area, for use as an all-weather pitch.\nA spokesman said: “The sports forum urge the comhairle to fulfil their legal and moral obligations to the people of Barra and Vatersay to protect the sports and recreation land in Horve by righting this wrong: firstly, by filing for a change of land use to Fields in Trust from ‘sports and recreation’ to ‘housing’ and secondly, by transferring an equivalent area of land to the KGV playing field in compensation for land lost to housing. Only by doing this will the comhairle avoid the danger of stalling the desperately needed new housing that helps secure the future of our islands.”\nRichard McKeever of Fields in Trust the charity recognised that that “sometimes it may be necessary” to change the use of recreational land.\nHe added: “As part of our protection, we have a responsibility to ensure the local owners and managers of these spaces seek our consent to undertake any changes regarding land ownership, land transactions, erection of buildings and structures \u0026#8211 and that proposed changes fit with the purpose of the protected space and benefit its recreational use.

Having beaten Juniors twice already this season \u0026#8211 2-5 and 0-6 \u0026#8211 Jamie MacGregor will have faith that his team can make it a hat-trick of success and book their place in the final.\nIn their last semi-final outing, Mallaig defeated Sleat and Strath 10-8 in an incredible game to secure their place in the GF MacRae Cup Final. The blues, however, will be keen to avoid a repeat of their performance in the final which saw Kyleakin run out 4-1 winners in a disappointing and underwhelming showing by Mallaig.\n\n \u0026#8220Another tough game for us, but it’s the type of games we wanted to be involved in at the start of the season. We now have a great opportunity to make a second cup final this season.\n\u0026#8220The season, in general, has been a learning experience but a very enjoyable one. The lads have picked up a lot quite quickly and we have had some good wins this season especially on our travels. It’s good to be back playing at home especially in such a big game, especially after being away for so long\n\u0026nbsp\nWith four wins from their last five matches in all competitions, and 37 goals scored in the process, Juniors have really hit their stride and will approach their third meeting with Mallaig with great confidence.\nNow just four points point off leaders Sleat and Strath with one game in hand, Phil McCaherty will hope his team can transmit their impressive league form into today\u0026#8217s cup match against the only side who have beaten them domestically this season.\nWhile Juniors\u0026#8217 recent free-scoring display will have given Mallaig some food for thought in their preparations for the match, the Portree side must avoid the lapses in concentration which cost them in their heavy defeats at home against Mallaig in the league and Loch Ness in the Highland Amateur Cup.\n\nIt\u0026#8217s a tough task for us away to Mallaig who have beaten us twice already 5-2 and 6-0. We are going with the same squad (minus Angie MacPherson and Paul MacKinnon) that played GA United in last round, with Nick Flanagan added for goalkeeping duties to free up backup goalie Will Brown to his normal defensive duties. I am hoping that David Potter doesn\u0026#8217t get lost this week!\u0026#8221\n\nIt\u0026#8217s been a fantastic season so far for the Broadford-based side who are the current league leaders, joint top scorers, and have the meanest defence to boot.\nWith an average of 5.2 goals a game in the league, Sleat and Strath have developed a ruthlessness in front of goal and appeared to have a strong belief when they take to the pitch that they can beat any team whether it be at home or away. Their most recent win in which they turned a 3-0 lead at half-time into an emphatic 12-0 victory in last week\u0026#8217s quarter-final tie against much-improved Glenelg is evidence they have the weapons to transform a tight match into a comfortable victory.\nHaving put in impressive defensive displays against both Kyleakin and Portree Juniors in the league, DL MacKinnon\u0026#8217s team have proven they can stand firm when required against tough opponents. That said, he will still be mindful of his side\u0026#8217s loss in their last semi-final encounter against Mallaig \u0026#8211 in what has been their only defeat so far this season \u0026#8211  and will be keen to avoid missing out on a second final.\n\n \u0026#8220It\u0026#8217s going to be a battle at our tight pitch. Key to the result will be our ability to defend set plays, which is not our strong point as we are a very small team. If we can keep Gordy (Mccarroll) and Innis (Thompson) quiet we will hopefully cause them problems with our pace.\u0026#8221\n\u0026nbsp\nWith Sleat and Strath having burst out of the blocks in the league and new boys Mallaig also making their mark, it is perhaps easy to overlook the fact that Kyleakin is not only very much in contention for the league title but have already won a piece of silverware this season with a convincing victory over Mallaig in the GF MacRae Cup.\nWith 22 goals in their last three matches, which included their 10-2 quarter-final win over Kyle, the reigning league champions know how to win games, and ultimately trophies. As well as being well-deserved, their 4-1 victory in the GF MacRae Cup Final against Mallaig was a superb example of game-management against difficult opponents on a big occasion.\nAlthough Kyleakin have put themselves in a good position to challenge on all fronts, they will have to address their inconsistency this season which has seen them held to draws recently by Glenelg and GA United.\nWith back-to-back matches coming up against Sleat and Strath in the cup, then the league, the reigning champions will look to draw on their past successes in the big games.\nBy Adam Gordon\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/web-ad-sales.jpg","title":"recruitment highlighted as a priority at first emergency services","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\n\nRepresentatives of all the emergency services on Skye held their first ever partnership meeting in Broadford last week to discuss how they can support each other.\nPictured (left to right) are Dave Philips from the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, Nick Mort from the British Red Cross, Station Manager Mike Colliar from the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service, Sgt Andrew Shaw from Police Scotland, Neil Urquhart from Skye Mountain Rescue, Inspector Lynda Allan from Police Scotland, Area Service Manager Alan Knox of Scottish Ambulance Service.

It is central to community life and is active across the local community, working collaboratively with other sporting codes and community and civic organisations.\nThere are eight Gaelic Athletic Clubs active within the local council boundaries, with a combined membership reaching into thousands.\nPromotion and use of the Irish Language has been historically strong in the area. The language has become even stronger in the last 30-40 years particularly.\nToday in terms of Irish medium education (IME), four Naíscoileana (preschools) flourish, and there are two gaelscoileanna (primary schools), and another English medium school with IME provision.\nThe demand for IME in South Antrim is growing.\n\nSo, many citizens in South Antrim possess an innate sense of their own Irishness. It really matters to them.\nLike everywhere else in Ireland the rich local heritage and history of townlands, place names, geography, and topography of South Antrim cannot be understood without reference to the Irish language.\nTo take two local examples: Cranfield has its origins in Creamh choill, the woodland of the wild garlic: Farranflugh is the anglicised version of Fearainn Fliuch, otherwise, the boggy or wet ground.\nBilingual signage captures that rich heritage by making it visible and providing an educational reference point for the local community and visitors.\nThe council’s ‘English only’ policy effectively air brushes out access to a heritage we all share regardless of political allegiance.\nThe English language is only a small part of who we are and where we have come from as a community.\nSome in the leadership of both the DUP and UUP have sought to weaponise the Irish language and to demonise those who support its use and visibility.\nThey have prosecuted their own version of a ‘project fear’ which deliberately misrepresents the campaign for Irish language rights as cultural warfare.\nThat type of exclusive and bigoted mind-set goes right to the crux of why the political institutions do not currently exist in Stormont.\nThe DUP wrecked power sharing and partnership in recent years as the culmination of their 20-year campaign opposing the GFA since 1998.\nThose presently in charge of the DUP don’t want to exercise proper power sharing with Sinn Féin and are opposed to a rights-based society. \nThat’s the message which comes from the leadership of the DUP, and as a result, why unionist councillors in Antrim and Newtownabbey have now adopted an ‘English only’ policy in an act of abject disrespect to their Irish neighbours.\nPolitical unionism in South Antrim has form in the history of exclusion.\nNever once in the history of local government in Antrim and Newtownabbey have unionists shared the position of Mayor or deputy mayor with a Sinn Féin councillor.\nIn the 2017 Westminster general election 18.1% of the electorate voted for Sinn Féin in South Antrim.\nThat section of the electorate is synonymous, albeit not exclusively, with those citizens who consider themselves to be Irish.\nAn additional 12.9% voted for other non-unionist political parties.\nImportantly some citizens who vote for the unionist parties consider themselves to be both Irish and British. Unionism is not a culturally homogeneous bloc.\nSo when the unionist councillors in Antrim and Newtownabbey vote to adopt an ‘English only’ policy that tells a substantial cross section of local rate payers that they are unequal and do not deserve to be treated with parity of esteem and respect.\nThe only conclusion is that those in charge of the local unionist parties are not committed to a shared future and inclusion, and instead want to make South Antrim a cold house for the Irish identity.\nAnd, that mind-set is a throwback to the days of the old apartheid, orange state in the north of Ireland.\nThe ‘English only’ policy in Antrim and Newtownabbey borough council is now the subject of a judicial review.\nLocal Irish language activists and rate payers have begun a campaign to overturn this disgraceful policy.\nI have been encouraging local people to register their objections with the Chief Executive.\n\nIf there is ever to be a shared and united future in the north that must also apply within Antrim and Newtownabbey council politically, culturally and in respect of every aspect of community and civic life.\nLocal councillors and council officers have an obligation to ensure the operation of this council is conducted in a legally compliant, fair, equal, inclusive, transparent and democratic matter.\nThey should be actively promoting and ensuring adherence to the principles of parity of esteem, mutual respect, equality, and anti-sectarianism enshrined in the GFA.\nThat is what the republican and nationalist electorate and other progressives and fair-minded people in South Antrim expect from those charged with administering local government.\nCitizens in Antrim and Newtownabbey pay high rates with the expectation of good quality council services.\nThey do not pay high rates to be treated with such abject disrespect.\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27429  ","story":" Oisín Mac Canna\n\nSpeakers at today\u0026#039s march urged attendees to make their way to Belfast over the next week to celebrate Belfast Pride, who will host Ireland\u0026#039s biggest LGBT festival, with the annual parade held on Pride Day which is celebrated on August 4th.\nSinn Féin were among the thousand strong crowd of people who marched at the first ever Transgender Pride parade that took place in Dublin this afternoon.\n The march started outside Liberty Hall and made its way to Fairview Park, where Declan Flynn was murdered by a gang of five so-called “queer-bashing” teenagers in the early hours of September 10th, 1982.\nThe suspended sentences for his attackers triggered a long march towards equality in Irish society.

There are many, many more people who have no sight at all. \n  \n“I’ve done training with a guide dog so that I will be ready when the time comes but I’m not at that stage yet.”\n  \nBrian’s latest sponsored walk went ahead in early July and saw around 50 people joined in at very stages of the 13-hour hike.\n  \nIn the previous two years, Brian’s efforts have brought in almost \u0026pound10,000 and he is hopeful that his latest walk will be the best fundraiser yet.\n  \nBut it is not only about raising funds for Brian.\n  \nHe believes that the charity needs to be highlighted for the vital work it does in providing guide dogs.\n  \n“These animals are trained to the highest degree so that a blind person can put their full trust in thedog.\n  \n“That is the real key factor. The difference these dogs can make to a person’s life is not quantifiable. \n  \n“They are a an invaluable safety tool and a wonderful companion.\n  \n “It takes around \u0026pound56,000 to train each dog so you can see that there is a great need for support from the public,” he said.\n  \nBrian concluded: “I would like to thank ecverybody who supported the walk both physically and financially. \n  \n“I’d especially thank the Antrim and Ballymena Guide Dog Volunteers for their great support and I have to applaud the ‘route manager’, Terry Hasson for all his behind the scenes work and dedication to the event.\n  \nA ‘just giving’ page is in operation allowing members of the public to make contributions online.\n  \nSimply do a google search for ‘Just Giving - the docs 50 mile walk’.\n  \n Meanwhile, tickets will soon be available for a concert featuring Liam McLaughlin which is due to take place on Friday, August 24 at the Michelin Club.

It requires a cut and lift once a year in September where the meadow is mowed and the cuttings are lifted which prevents the grass from taking over. The school has achieved so much by doing less and spending no money.\n  \n“The principal, Mrs Lutton has been very supportive of the initiative and the groundsmen have ensured the meadow is looked after in the proper way.”\n  \nRachael said the meadow has been such a success that the school has agreed to extend its size. \n  \nRachel added: “These flowers have been lying dormont in the soil for years waiting for an opportunity. We now have over 20 of these rare flowers after just two years of changing the mowing regime.”\n  \nOther wildflowers found in the meadow include Self-Heal and Birds Foot Trefoil.\n  \nRachael continued: “We would love to see Ballymena schools become a showcase for meadow creation. \n  \n“Council has planted quite a lot of wildflowers around the town and it would be great to see less mowing and more and more of these wonderful meadows.” \n \n                  \n    \n          \n"},{"url":"http://www.antrimguardian.co.uk/fs/img/articles/250px/spb27-22-jpeg.jpg","title":"65134  ","story":"    \nTHE Vice Chair of the North Antrim Young Democrats, Ballymoney man Mr Timothy McLean has come out in support of the party leader Arlene Foster. \u0026#160\nLast week DUP party stalwart of some 40 years Alderman John Finlay blasted Mrs Foster in an open letter for attending a GAA final on Sunday.\nTimothy McClean, son of Cllr Alan McClean has responded to Alderman Finlay\u0027s comments with the following statement.\nMr McLean said: Arlene Foster has never asked Councillor John Finlay to abandon his conscious or his deeply held beliefs.

Creating an atmosphere where all people can thrive in peace is the surest way to secure our precious Union.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n// \n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            \n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n      // \n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n      // \n      \n      \n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n              \n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n        // \n        \n\n    \n      \n        \n\nTerms \u0026amp Conditions\n\n        \n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n              \n    \n  \n      \n    var gaJsHost = ((\"https:\" == document.location.protocol) ? \"https://ssl.\" : \"http://www.\")    document.write(unescape(\"%3Cscript src=\u0027\" + gaJsHost + \"google-analytics/ga.js\u0027 type=\u0027text/javascript\u0027%3E%3C/script%3E\"))    \n    \n    var pageTracker = _gat._getTracker(\"UA-4764369-20\")    pageTracker._initData()    pageTracker._trackPageview()    \n      \n\n      \n              \n  \n    \n  \n\n      \n  \n\n"},{"url":"http://www.antrimguardian.co.uk/fs/img/articles/250px/wk19-004cr.jpg","title":"65135  ","story":"    \nTRIBUTES have been flowing in for iconic Ballymoney historian Mr Alex Blair who passed away suddenly at his Lisboy Road home, Kilraughts on Saturday.\nDescribed by one of his many friends as a big man, a private man, a very friendly person the retired Dalriada teacher wore many hats in the town and wider afield.\nHe was a writer and lecturer, the confidante and biographer of the late Mollie Holmes, a traveller and raconteur who had decades long associations with Ballymoney Drama Festival and the Ballymoney Agricultural Show.\nThe Service of Thanksgiving for his life takes place in Kilraughts Presbyterian Church tomorrow (Wednesday) at 11.30am. The house is strictly private.\nFriend and Chairman of Ballymoney Drama Festival, Mr Mac Pollock said: He was a big man in every way, a very private man though he had many public faces he was a very friendly person, was genuine and had many long-standing friendships.

Noel McClean had cut short his holiday in Scotland and returned home when he heard\u0026#160 the news.\nSpeaking to a packed church at the Service of Thanksgiving Rev. McClean said Alex\u0027s death had, shocked the entire community, not only locally but far and wide.\n\u0026#8220We will never see his face again or benefit from his conversation and all the stories that made Alex such a legendry figure with such a wealth of knowledge.\nAfter Rev. McClean\u0027s tribute (see adjoining page), the Rev. Stanley Stewart of Castlerock said a prayer on behalf of the family, his wife Valerie being one of Alex\u0027s closest relatives.\nRev. Stewart said that: Alex had a long life, lived well, and had been a great supporter of the community through his lifelong involvement in many organisations and though his many friendships.\nOne of the many mourners at the service, was Mr Donal O\u0027Hanlon Chair of the Newpoint Players, Newry who have performed at the Ballymoney Drama Festival for 30 years in a row.\nMr O\u0027Hanlon said: We have attended 30 festivals on the trot and the linch pin for us in that was Alex as secretary.\n\u0026#8220Whether there was good adjudication or bad Alex was always there in the tea room to give support and say all that was good about the performances.\nSpeaking from London, Director of Newpoint Players Sean Treanor added Ballymoney will never be the same without him, especially at\u0026#160 festival time.

It was the first time he had competed since withdrawing from the Isle of Man TT Races back in May.\nDunlop was a revered competitor who had more than one hundred wins to his name at both national and international level. 15 of those came at the County Dublin circuit which ultimately claimed his life on Saturday afternoon during practice for the Open Race.\nWhyte said that after some lacklustre seasons where fans only got to see sporadic glimpses of his ability shine through, 2018 looked set to be the start of something special as Dunlop joined forces with Tim Martin in the Superstock and Superbike classes. \nThe team was being built around Dunlop, with Martin ending his sabbatical from the sport after just one year.\n\u0026#8220Tim threw everything he had at it for William, Whyte told Chronicle Sport.

Universal Credit is definitely a part of that, I am in no doubt about that. We have been dealing with people who have said that they are in need of help because of Universal Credit. \nThe figures cover the six month period May to October 2017 and the period January to May 2018 with an average of 30 vouchers a month dealt with in the first period, jumping to 38 in the second.\nPeter acknowledges that these figures are from quite a small area over a limited time \u0027but something must have triggered it.\u0027 He said:There is an unmistakable trend, more people are needing help after Universal Credit. It\u0027s eight more families who need our help every month in a small town like Ballymoney.\nThe Trussell Trust, which compiles UK wide Foodbank figures, say that increases of over 50% are common in areas where UC has been rolled out for a year or more.\nThe Chronicle asked the Department of Communities, who rolled out UC, to comment on the issues raised, with a spokesperson saying: \n\u0026#8220People use food banks for many and varied reasons and it would be misleading to link them to any single cause.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n// \n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            \n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n      // \n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n      // \n      \n      \n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n              \n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n        // \n        \n\n    \n      \n        \n\nTerms \u0026amp Conditions\n\n        \n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n              \n    \n  \n      \n    var gaJsHost = ((\"https:\" == document.location.protocol) ? \"https://ssl.\" : \"http://www.\")    document.write(unescape(\"%3Cscript src=\u0027\" + gaJsHost + \"google-analytics/ga.js\u0027 type=\u0027text/javascript\u0027%3E%3C/script%3E\"))    \n    \n    var pageTracker = _gat._getTracker(\"UA-4764369-20\")    pageTracker._initData()    pageTracker._trackPageview()    \n      \n\n      \n              \n  \n    \n  \n\n      \n  \n\n"},{"url":"http://www.antrimguardian.co.uk/fs/img/articles/250px/jbllegiofdoolfna1.jpg","title":"65370  ","story":"    \nARMOY Road Races Clerk of the Course Bill Kennedy says this weekend\u0027s 10th anniversary event is a \u0027massive milestone\u0027 for organisers.\nRace Week continues apace until this weekend with practice on Friday and Race Day taking place on Saturday.\nIt\u0027s been a massive achievement for the club, said Kennedy.

This is because Cameron’s health has declined over the last few weeks and we have just been fully focusing on giving Cameron everything he needs at this time.\n\n“It is with the greatest of pains in our heart that we share his journey is near over. We don’t know how long we have left with our beautiful boy but although he is sleeping mostly now he still is fighting with all his might when he is awake. He is in no pain and is just restful. We plan to be at home surrounded by family where he will be happy.\n\n“We can’t thank you all enough for everything you have done for our sweet boy. Because of the love, help and support we received Cameron’s life was greatly extended and in those times he had amazing days that we where so blessed to be apart of.\n\n“We hope to honour Cameron by continuing Cure4Cam. He has spoke of things he wants us to do in his charity and we hope we can do him proud by helping other kids with cancer and funding help and awareness for DIPG as well as much more.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nAll the time in the world would not be enough with our amazing son. But we are thankful and honoured to have had the time we have had. We are filled with pride on the young man he has become. He fought this battle with more strength and courage than we could have.\n\nAs our hearts are shattering we ask for prayers. Prayers for Cameron in all that he needs right now, for his sisters and for us and our whole family. \n\n“We are going to take some time out.

It’s important that we show solidarity with the LGBTQ+ community and send a clear message that inequality and discrimination of any kind is simply not tolerable.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nAfter the meeting the DUP issued a statement accusing Sinn Fein of hypocrisy.\n\n“The DUP outrightly condemns any act of hate or violence against any member of the community.\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nDeputy Lord Mayor, Paul Duffy\n      \t\n         \n\n\n\n“The motion before the Council on Monday night was divisive as there was a significant element of hypocrisy given that Sinn Fein proposed a motion which focused heavily on hate crime, yet the IRA, which by Sinn Féin’s own admission has been inextricably linked to that party, committed some of the most heinous crimes during ‘The Troubles’ for which members of IRA have not been held responsible. \n\n“The families of victims of IRA violence deserve the greatest respect and the ultimate show of remorse for crimes committed against these victims by the IRA would see Sinn Fein ask specifically that those members of the IRA who committed murder and other acts generated by hatred, come forward to face the courts. All other attempts at deflection under the so called banner of ‘equality’ by Sinn Fein will be highlighted by our DUP council grouping.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“The motion appears to have been submitted very late in the day and the implications of such a motion are far reaching. Due process hasn’t been followed, no call for an equality impact assessment as is custom and practise when displaying flags and emblems and we are going against our policies and procedures.\n\n“We as a party fear that this result will open the floodgates for all groups to suggest flying all types of flags from civic buildings, we would argue very strongly that official local authority flagpoles should only be used to fly the nation’s flag or indeed the armed forces flag which incorporates the Union Flag. \n\n“These are the reasons we objected in the strongest possible terms to any other flag being flown and are somewhat dismayed and astounded that only the DUP and Independent councillor David Jones voted against such a haphazard and unprofessional approach. We will on this occasion have to consider taking legal advice and utilising the call in process.”\n\nFollowing the meeting Cllr Jones said: “I opposed the Notice of Motion. My reasons were quite clear. I have no issue or problem with the LGBTQ+ community. Where I have a major problem is such a motion being proposed by Sinn Fein while over a period of thirty years their military wing, PIRA, carried out the most heinous indiscriminate murders on people no matter their sex, religion, colour, age or sexual orientation and have to date offered no remorse or apology for their actions. I do not believe Sinn Fein should be seen as s of minority groups, no matter who or what that group may be.\n\n“During a fractious debate members of Sinn Fein attempted to shout me down. They went as far a proposing a Motion of Censure on me to stop me from speaking at the meeting but following a vote this Motion failed.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“At the close of the debate and despite a rejected amendment being proposed the Sinn Fein Notice of Motion was passed. I and the DUP voted against while the UUP did not vote.\n\n“Once again I feel this shows the desperation of Sinn Fein to latch onto an issue they believe will show them to be the defender of a minority. No doubt they will say I am biased against the LGBTQ+ community. I totally repudiate this. I have worked with, socialised and have friends from the LGBTQ+ community. When I spoke to some of them before last nights meeting and I explained my reasons for not supporting the Sinn Fein Notice of Motion they were equally scathing of it saying they did not want to be used by a political party to bolster their image.”\n\nCllr Catherine Nelson proposed Cllr Jones be censored but this failed due to support from both UUP and DUP members. \n\nCllr Duffy said: “His disregard for the authority of the Mayor fell well short of the behaviour expected from members in the chamber.\n\n“In dredging up the past he used it as an excuse to deny this gesture of solidarity to members of the LGBTQ+ community. I am delighted our motion passed despite his opposition. We will be the first council in the North to fly the rainbow flag and that is something to be proud of.\n\n“I urge members of our local LGBTQ+ Community, and their families, to join me this coming Tuesday night for a celebratory event during Pride Week in Craigavon Civic Centre 7-9pm.”\n\nThose who are interested in attending the event are asked to contact the Lord Mayor’s Office on 028 3752 9633 as they need to know numbers for catering purposes.\n            \n

agent owen becomes secret agent","story":"\nMove over Tom Cruise, there\u0026#8217s a new Mission Impossible star in the making - Portadown Estate Agent Owen Matchett.\n\n                \nAnyone who follows the Williams Estate Agents Facebook page will know only too well they are given to more ‘off the wall posts’.\n\n\n   \n                 \n                \n\n\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nWell next week they are set to scale new heights of daring to promote the agency - by ‘dangling upside down from a helicopter’ in a Mission Impossible spoof video.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nEstate Agent Owen will transform into a Secret Agent - resplendent in full tactical gear - for the movie skit as he tries to place a sold sign on one of his properties.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nThrow in a some stunt driving and a 30 foot fall into an air bag and you have the perfect recipe for an eye-catching and fun video.\n\nExplaining the thinking behind the video Owen said: “A few years ago we did a James Bond skit for the movie Spectre coming out. It got 18,000 views. With Mission Impossible coming out this week, I thought I’d do a bit of a spoof,”\n\n\n   \n                 \n                \n\n\n\nFilming took place at Todd’s Leap in Ballygawley over the weekend and speaking before his movie moment Owen said: “I’m going to go for it big time, I’m just hoping people will find it amusing and entertaining.\n\n“It will involve a high speed helicopter chase, high speed rally driving, abseiling and me jumping 30ft into an airbag.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nAnd, while we don’t want to give away the ending, the concluding message is ‘At Williams, no mission is impossible’.\n\nBut Owen’s exploits won’t just be confined to Facebook, as while he is being filmed doing his stunts a TV crew will be along to film him being filmed for a TV slot (that’s nearly as confusing as a Mission Impossible plot).\n\nThe company had approached Owen after they saw his James Bond spoof and had asked him, if he was doing something similar, to invite them along so they could cover the story.\n\nOwen went on to say: “I do these videos thinking outside the box, something a bit different from what other agents might do with housing market figures and such. I don’t do that type of thing.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“I’m a bit of a movie buff and love action movies and hopefully people will get a laugh and some enjoyment out of it.”\n\nThe video will be released on the Williams Facebook page next week - along with details of a competition to win a family day pass to Todd’s Leap.\n\nAnd to conclude in Mission Impossible style: This message might not self destruct but it is tomorrow’s chip paper!\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"a new fellowship of the rings is born","story":"                                                                                                  \t                \t\n\nUNTIL\n three months ago, local environmental champion Aidan Crean had never seen a barn owl – which is why he looks so ecstatic this week in this photograph.\n\nAidan is holding a baby owl in what was the culmination of a project that is breathing new life into the fortunes of this spectacular and incredibly rare bird. \n\nA pair of barn owls – scréachóg reilige in Irish, meaning screecher of the graveyard – were found to be nesting in a derelict cottage on the shores of Lough Neagh, and – watched round the clock by another great West Belfast nature lover known to bloggers as Antrim Lens – the parents produced a record haul of five chicks. And just before the youngsters left the nest to take to County Antrim skies, Aidan led a team of birders to ring them. It was a marvellous occasion for all who took part. These participants now share a special bond, a fellowship of the rings not unlike that from the famous trilogy Lord of the Rings itself.\n\nIn April, Aidan was overjoyed to see his first barn owl when, after a three-hour stake-out of the old cottage with Dúlra, one emerged like a ghost from the window and out over the shimmering, moonlit lough. That night one of the most significant barn owl projects was launched – if the birds successfully bred, Aidan determined to ring the chicks, setting in motion a structured, monitored process to analyse the population of one of our most threatened birds, one which was on the verge of extinction in Ireland.\n\n“Now that they have rings, these chicks have become dots on the map of barn owls in the world,” said a proud Aidan. “They are five ambassadors who will contribute to a national scientific study of these birds in Ireland.\n\n“And I want the public to help us. These five birds will leave their nest by next Friday and set out to make lives for themselves. Their territory will be from Hannahstown right out to Lough Neagh. We want people to look out for them. If anyone sees one, we want to know. \n\n“You’ll often see an owl in your headlights, and if you also see a flash of metal on their legs, then it’s one of ours. And we want to know about it especially if you see one of them hurt and in need of help.”\n\nThe team weighed and measured the chicks, discovering that four of them were male. “That’s four new territories for breeding barn owls next year,” Aidan said.\n\nAidan and pals – including Belfast Media Group editor Robin Livingstone – set out to ring the chicks in a slick operation.\n\n“This was all about planning,” said Aidan. “We wanted to keep disturbance to a minimum so we had it all worked out beforehand.\n\n“Everyone knew their job, be it climbing the ladder to the nest, weighing the birds, writing their details in the log book, putting on the rings. And everyone was caring and sensitive of the brood. We only spoke when we had to and were gone as soon as possible.\n\n “Adult owls leave their chicks alone in the nest, so the two parents were sleeping in the chimney pot when we went to the nest in the rafters and they weren’t disturbed at all. Owls could teach us a lot – once the chicks are four weeks old the parents sleep in a different bedroom. They know they’ll not get any peace with the young ‘uns playing and constantly pulling at them because they want the bird equivalent of McDonald’s and Pizza Hut. \n\n“The parents go somewhere else so they can get a good night’s sleep rather than stay with their teenage brood.”\n\nThe chick with Aidan is about 40 days old – owls incubate their eggs as soon as each is laid, unlike garden birds who wait until all the eggs are laid before they incubate to ensure they all hatch together – so the five chicks are all different ages and weights.\n\n“This was pretty special for me,” said Aidan. “Despite a lifetime of birdwatching, I’d never seen a single barn owl until this year. To see five chicks in a single nest is phenomenal. This is one of the biggest broods ever recorded, and shows that the birds here are healthy and finding plenty of food.”\nThe old abandoned cottage is on land belonging to the owner of Randox Laboratories Dr Peter Fitzgerald, who is said to be delighted that barn owls have chosen to nest there and is backing the study of the chicks.\n\nAidan added: “There may be only a couple of pair of breeding barn owls in the whole north of Ireland, so these chicks are precious and represent hope that they can make a comeback. A big congratulations is due to everyone concerned.”\n\n* If you’ve seen anything interesting or have any nature questions, you can text Dúlra on 07801 414804.\n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Generation-identity.png","title":"fascist graffiti re emerges in north belfast","story":"                                                                                                  \t                \t\nA SINN Féin councillor has stressed the importance of challenging the far-right after the appearance of graffiti promoting a new fascist group in North Belfast.\nLogos representing the white supremacist Generation Identity movement were daubed on street furniture on the Cavehill Road, but were quickly removed due to the fast actions of Cllr Mary Ellen Campbell and maintenance workers from the Belfast City Council.\nGeneration Identity describe themselves as a “movement aimed at preserving the ethnocultural identity of Europe”, and are active in 13 countries across Europe and North America.\nThe shadowy group has been trying to gain a foothold in the North and have already been involved in a number of public demonstrations.\nLast month they were part of the “Free Tommy Robinson” rally at City Hall where demonstrators were pictured giving Nazi salutes.\nSpeaking to the North Belfast News, Cllr Campbell said that fascist graffiti has become a more common occurrence in recent times.\n“It’s about the fourth or fifth time I have had to get this type of graffiti removed in the area,” she said.\n“We need to keep challenging them to prevent them gaining a foothold.\n“More and more people are questioning what it is because they started putting their logo up. If you look at their logo it isn’t immediately recognisable, it’s not a swastika, but people need to be looking at it as such.\n“North Belfast is a very culturally diverse area and we don’t want anybody with that negative agenda organising here.\n“We can see what they are doing outside City Hall and we can see what they are doing in other countries. North Belfast is a welcoming area and that’s the positivity that we want to promote.\n“Thankfully the Council removed the graffiti almost immediately after I reported it.\n“The people of this area have been very welcoming to families that are here from Syria and other countries. We’re a diverse part of the city and that’s the part of the city that I want to live in and promote.”\n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"internet sensation set to go on stage","story":"                                                                                                  \t                \t\n\nA WEST\n Belfast comedian whose parody of chart hits from the likes of Ed Sheeran – which has seen him go ‘viral’ on the internet – is about to headline his own show such is the demand to see him live.\nBrooke’s Paddy Rafferty, known to fans as Paddy Raff, will perform at the Foundry Club, formerly the Stiff Kitten, in the city centre on Friday July 27. The 34-year-old told the Andersonstown News how he had always been performing skits and his own take on songs throughout the years and decided that 2018 was his year to try his hand at stand-up.\n“Even back at school I would always try and change the lyrics of songs, whatever was popular at the time. The ability to flip lyrics dead quick always came naturally to me,” he said.\nPaddy explained how he started to play guitar in his teens and began to use his talent to create comedy videos which he has since posted on his social media Facebook page and which now have received thousands of hits.\n“I have my own take on Ed Sheeran’s ‘Galway Girl’ – I do ‘Broadway Girl’ and instead of Fountains of Wayne’s ‘Stacey’s Mom’ I sing about Stacey’s Ma. I’ve only really been performing since March but it has really taken off and it’s going really well.”\nPaddy said he is really looking forward to performing at The Foundry – which is already approaching a sell out.\n“I have always been a big fan of Billy Connolly, who funnily enough used a guitar as well in his early gigs. I’ve always loved stand-up comedy and never for a minute thought I’d actually be up there doing it myself.\n“It’s great to know that people will be coming next Friday to see and hear my stuff, I’m not being complacent, I’m putting the work in so it’s going to be a great night for everyone coming along.”\nPaddy will play The Foundry on Friday July 27. A limited number of tickets are still available priced at £8.\nFor more details on Paddy and his upcoming gigs follow www.facebook/paddyraff\n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Paisley-tears.png","title":"mp ian paisley suspended for","story":"                                                                                                  \t                \t\n\nDUP\n MP Ian Paisley has been suspended from the House of Commons for 30 sitting days – his party immediately also suspended him for an unspecified period pending its own investigation.\nThe North Antrim MP’s punishment follows his failure to declare two lavish family holidays paid for by the Sri Lankan government, following which he wrote to the then Prime Minister supporting the country in its bid to block a UN investigation of its human rights record.\nThe Seaker of the House of Commons described it as “a regrettable state of affairs”. A petition is to be opened ,which, if signed by 10 per cent of the North Antrim electorate will lead to a by-election and Mr Paisley being forced to stand down.\nSir Kevin Barron, chair of the Standards Committee, who delivered the findings, concluded that Mr Paisley was guilty of \u0026#8220serious misconduct and his actions were of a nature to bring the House of Commons into disrepute\u0026#8221.\nIn response, the DUP have suspended Paisley “pending further investigation into his conduct.”\nSinn Féin North Antrim MLA Philip McGuigan said the DUP cannot dismiss the fact that its Mr Paisley lobbied in defence of a regime with a shocking human rights record.\n “Much of the focus of the Ian Paisley scandal has revolved around his failure to declare two lavish family holidays paid for by the Sri Lankan government,” he said.\n“That is understandable given the focus on integrity in government following the DUP’s involvement in a number of scandals including RHI, Nama, Red Sky and dark money for Brexit.\n “These have all severely damaged public confidence in the political institutions but this latest scandal also calls into the question where the DUP stands on fundamental questions of human rights.\n“Amnesty International has said that serious human rights abuses were committed with impunity by the Sri Lankan regime during the conflict there.\n“Yet, after receiving his gifts from the Sri Lankan government, Ian Paisley actively lobbied the British Prime Minister to oppose a United Nations resolution to establish an international investigation into the human rights abuses in Sri Lanka.\n“Does the DUP leadership really believe that it is acceptable to dismiss the fact that one of its MPs lobbied in defence of a regime that carried out mass murder, war crimes and gross human rights abuses?\n“This is a litmus test for the DUP leadership and If Ian Paisley does not do the right thing and voluntarily resign, his party should compel him to do so.”\n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"ms decision to close lisburns bow street mall store described as a blow to city centre","story":"                                                                                                  \t                \t\n\nSDLP MLA Pat Catney\n has said the loss of the M\u0026#038S Simply Food store in Lisburn’s Bow Street Mall is “a blow” to the city centre, to staff and shoppers.\nIn a statement Marks and Spencer said it had opted not to renew its lease on the Simply Food store but that no jobs were at risk with staff having been advised that all existing employees at the Lisburn branch will be redeployed.\nThe closure of the food store, which has been open ten years and employs 40 staff, will further add to the many already shuttered and empty retail slots in the complex following the liquidation of its anchor tenant BHS.\n“Any loss of business in Lisburn is a drain,” said Mr Catney. “Any business closure makes it more difficult for retailers to build their product up,” he said. “It’s the old saying – there’s no point going to market if there are only two stores in it. We need to be working to lift, build, Lisburn city centre up together.”\nMr Catney told Daily Belfast that the issue of paid city centre parking is taking a heavy toll  as shoppers are choosing to travel and spend their money elsewhere.\n“I personally don’t like the paid parking from a trading point of view, the parking attendants are very, very strict and I’m calling upon the city centre management from us as MLAs to really look at a strategy that will lift where we work in the city.”\nMr Catney described as “disappointing” the fact the Belfast Rapid Transit (BRT) scheme was not rolled out to Lisburn. “You have this Glider bus running from West to East in Belfast that could’ve pulled on out here. This is a commuter town, there are so many developments being built here with a lot more young people and families moving here so I would’ve liked to have seen that considered.\n“I will be contacting Translink over the coming days to request that bus services to Sprucefield shopping centre are frequent enough for those consumers who previously used to shop at M\u0026#038S in the town centre.”\nThe M\u0026#038S Simply Food store is expected to close its doors in the autumn. \n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"name change opposed by belfast celtic society","story":"                                                                                                  \t                \t\n\nPLANS\n for Sport and Leisure Swifts to change their name to Belfast Celtic suffered a setback yesterday with the news that the Belfast Celtic Society has voiced their opposition to the move. \n\nThe Glen Road Heights outfit announced its intentions to change their name in a statement issued on social media earlier this month, with the aim of “improving the club and improving the footballing prospects for young people in West Belfast”. \n\nHowever, despite approaching the society prior to making their announcement, Sport and Leisure’s plans have been met with opposition from the Belfast Celtic Society. \n\nHaving distanced themselves from the name change in a previous statement, primarily due to their status as a charitable organisation, the Belfast Celtic Society held a full committee meeting yesterday morning (Wednesday) to discuss the matter. \n\n“The Belfast Celtic Society again reiterates that it had no involvement in this venture,” a spokesperson said. “The Society was only made aware of the development 48 hours before the public announcement. \n\n“The Society was surprised by this announcement and the reaction received from both our membership as well as the general sporting public has been overwhelmingly negative. \n\n“Since its foundation almost two decades ago, the Society has been approached on more than one occasion to endorse and support a range of commercial enterprises with the intention of exploiting the name of the club for commercial gain. \n\n“Over this period, our standard response has been that this is contrary to the constitution of the society which is regulated by the Charity Commission.” \n\nThe Society also expressed its concern that the families of the former players of Belfast Celtic were not consulted prior to the announcement. \n\nThe Belfast Celtic Society also claim that the trademark registered by businessman Anthony John Bonnar earlier this year is a new company and is not linked to the old Belfast Celtic Football and Athletic Company. \n\nHowever, speaking to the Andersonstown News, Sport and Leisure chairman Jim Gillen said that while he was disappointed the Belfast Celtic Society hadn’t supported the name change, he stressed that the club will be moving forward with their plans regardless. \n\n“We have everything in place. As of yet, the IFA (Irish Football Association) has yet to rubber-stamp it,” said Gillen. \n\n“We have to go ahead with it. We informed them (the Belfast Celtic Society) and we spoke to a few members. They seemed to think it was a good idea. They’ve obviously put it to their full committee and they have given a different outlook. There’s nothing we can do about that other than trying to change their mind. \n\n“We would like to go ahead with their blessing and indeed the blessing of everybody in West Belfast. We’ll stay positive on what we are trying to achieve.” \n\nSport and Leisure Swifts are set to play their first game of the new season against Armagh City on Saturday, August 18 and are hoping the name change to Belfast Celtic will be approved by the IFA before that fixture.\n"}]
