At the same time, the volume of disinformation from doctored photos to false rumours and hoax videos spreading online has grown at a worrying pace.In etymological terms, the word “viral” comes from the stem word “virus”. And the viral misinformation can be a danger in itself. Just think of the recent petrol bomb attacks on 5G phone masts because of a widely believed – but unfounded – link to coronavirus.There’s so much noise on social media that false theories are easily spread: whether that’s forwarding an email attachment containing a computer virus without reading it properly, or sharing a faked photo because you’re in a rush.The claim: “5G mobile phone towers emit radiation that attacks the immune system, thus affecting those vulnerable to the coronavirus.”The truth: There is no evidence that 5G weakens immune systems or is harmful to humans, with international radiation experts reminding us that Covid-19 has spread in many countries that don’t have the high-speed phone system, such as Iran. The cause of the disease is still unknown, but appears to have started in a Wuhan food market where wild animals were illegally traded.See also: Other false claims about the causes of coronavirus, such as eating bat soup a manmade bioweapon for population control and fortune cookies.If in doubt ... Don’t trust information on social media if you don’t know where it came from one video claimed new £20 notes show symbols of 5G towers, and dozens of phone masts have been vandalised, including one serving Birmingham’s NHS Nightingale hospital. If a cause is confirmed, it’ll appear in reports issued by the World Health Organization (WHO). Rather than trusting celebrities or influencers, try Googling the information to see whether trusted sources such as reputable news organisations like the BBC or the  have reported it.The claim: “Gargling water mixed with salt or vinegar can wipe out coronavirus.” Or so a post shared many times on email and WhatsApp tells us, often accompanied with information that “holding your breath for 10 seconds can prove there’s no fibrosis in the lungs”.The truth: At present there is no cure or treatment for Covid-19.See also: Bogus claims that coronavirus can be cured or prevented by: oregano oil, lemon juice, sunbathing, using vodka as hand sanitiser, or drinking bleach.If in doubt ... Check the latest advice on the NHS website, the WHO website or the Q\u0026ampA page on the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.The claim: In March, a photo emerged on social media purporting to show troops clad in army fatigues walking around London’s Clapham Junction. Many wrongly interpreted this as evidence that the military had been deployed to ensure people stayed home.The truth: The “soldiers” were actually students at a nearby military preparation college and had nothing to do with Covid-19, something confirmed by the Ministry of Defence and the college.See also: Other fabricated photos and videos, such as footage of a man in Wales wiping his hands on a public lift (actually filmed in Bangkok), or the picture of worshippers crowded outside a mosque (taken before lockdown, 23 March).If in doubt: Remember that many doctored photos and videos, plus images with misleading captions, exist online. You can trace the possible source of the photo with a simple image search online.What’s happening: Despite global demand for face masks, a quick online search reveals vendors apparently offering to sell protective gear in bulk.The truth: Hundreds of bogus websites have been set up by criminals since the crisis began, many claiming to have face masks for sale. Police recently revealed British firms and iniduals have lost more than £1.86m to coronavirus-related fraud from bogus companies with no intention of selling masks.See also: The websites recently caught selling fake hand sanitisers or unregistered coronavirus testing kits - another scam.If in doubt ... Never purchase anything from an unverified website - check the padlock symbol in the address bar that indicates a secure connection and report any misleading websites, emails or text messages you think may be suspicious.The claim: “The government has been sending texts alerting people that they’ve been fined for ignoring social distancing measures during lockdown.” For example, one text reads: “You have been out of your house three times today, you are in breach of government guidelines. Your £30 fine will automatically be added to your bill.” A link leads to a non-governmental website asking for bank details.The truth: Hackers have spied an opportunity in the many people working from home, attempting to access their networks or steal login and password details. Up to 21 April, Action Fraud had received more than 1,000 coronavirus- related reports, with losses topping £2.3m.See also: Any email that asks you for personal information such as passwords or credit card details.If in doubt ...

Translated from Yuin, the language of the country, it means “dancing grass”.Pascoe and his small team of coworkers have never done a harvest like this before. There’s so much grass that both sheds are full, and Pascoe says they are “racing against the clock to refine our methods so we can extract the seed and make the flour. We have got to get this done in two or three weeks before the seed completely drops.”The team had a ceremony for the the beginning of the harvest because they think it’s the first time in 200 years that mandadyan nalluk has been harvested for food.“And some of these people are descended from those who would have done the last harvest,” Pascoe says. “That’s what this farm is all about – trying to make sure that Aboriginal people are part of the resurgence in these grains, rather than being on the periphery and being dispossessed again.”They had intended to harvest a different, more promising crop of kangaroo grass but it was destroyed by the summer’s catastrophic bushfires. As a CFA volunteer, Pascoe spent weeks on the fire and recovery efforts. His sheds burned down but his house survived.As he battled the fires, Pascoe was under increasingly vitriolic attack over his 2014 book Dark Emu, which used historical sources, including the journals of explorers, to show that Aboriginal people engaged in complex agriculture and were not just hunter-gatherers.The personal attacks, largely driven by the Herald Sun columnist Andrew Bolt and a prominent Aboriginal businesswoman, Josephine Cashman, escalated. Cashman asked the Australian federal police to investigate allegations that Pascoe had received financial benefit from claiming to be Aboriginal. The AFP said Pascoe’s Aboriginality “was not relevant in determining whether a commonwealth offence had been committed, as such there was no need to undertake these inquiries”. Then the provenance of a letter Bolt and Cashman relied on to denounce Pascoe was called into question by NITV. Cashman was removed from the senior advisory body to the minister for Indigenous Australians, Ken Wyatt.Pascoe had little to say publicly at the time and withdrew from some scheduled appearances. But he says book sales went up and he could afford to hire four young people to work with him.“When Andrew Bolt attacked me a lot of Australians took it as a personal attack on them, because a lot of people have read Dark Emu,” he says. “The same people, booksellers have been telling me, bought 10 copies as Christmas presents.But Pascoe says it was “the worst, worst time of my life”.“It was hard for me, that period,” he says. “I’m not trying to downplay it. I’m not trying to say I’m this resilient character because I’m not. But I was totally supported by Aboriginal community. Not every Aboriginal person, obviously, because people tell me that social media was rife with other opinions. But basically the elders stuck by me firm, and some of them came down here, some of them stopped me in the street, to tell me to keep doing what I was doing.”Pascoe says he took solace from the number of Australians “who want their children to learn a better history, a more true history”.“It’s a wave that is washing over these dinosaurs,” he says. “There’s an extinction event happening, and the dinosaur, of course, is never aware of his demise.”Pascoe’s team has been able to work right through the coronavirus: “We just carry on. This is a very isolated farm and we’re isolated on it, so it’s pretty good.”This week they milled some of the mandadyan nalluk seed into flour and baked a loaf of bread.“It’s beautiful bread. It’s a really dark, rye-like flour. Incredibly dark, incredibly aromatic, but also very tasty,” Pascoe says, and it’s not like anything he has smelled before.He gets seven or eight requests a day from bakers and restaurateurs to supply seed or flour, which they will do when they get the milling right.He also wants to show local farmers that letting these plants grow is worth the effort.“In future years it’ll be commonplace because we can grow these grasses on degraded land. I think there are a lot of farmers on marginal land now. They want some consistency, and they want reduced costs. Perennial grain is a way to do that.”The dancing grass is only one of several perennials the team is working with, including kangaroo grass, warrigal greens, samphires and water ribbons.“We cooked with murnong the other day in a recipe we hadn’t tried before and it was sensational,” Pascoe says. “Water ribbon tubers are absolutely delicious. We found a plant, we still don’t know what it is, which came back after the fires, a lovely little onion type thing, absolutely sensational.“There’s nothing new about it at all, but we ignored it. We turned our back on anything of Aboriginal provenance, such was our sensitivity to the history of the country.“It’s time to embrace the history of the country, and with that we will be able to embrace its food.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cd45addac7ad65557e9e643a14138378dcc42540/0_32_2913_1749/master/2913.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=6d32b2598cbbf27279bc8be37e3da449","title":"sainsburys expands chop chop delivery service to 20 uk cities","story":"Supermarket joins up with courier firm Stuart to make deliveries to homes using bikes Sainsbury’s is taking a bicycle delivery service to 20 cities across the UK in its latest effort to extend grocery home delivery during the coronavirus outbreak.The supermarket is joining up with courier firm Stuart, part of DPD Group, to launch its one-hour delivery product, Chop Chop, in Brighton and Bristol on Thursday with Manchester and Reading to follow.By mid-June, 50 stores will offer the service, which is also extending from central London into suburbs including Charlton, Haringey, Morden and Richmond. The company said this would enable one-hour deliveries to 3.2m households.The rapid expansion comes after Sainsbury’s last month relaunched Chop Chop from its Blackfriars convenience store in central London, which was one of 12 that closed when commuters stopped travelling.The service, which has previously only operated in London using cyclists employed directly by Sainsbury’s, had been suspended in March as it struggled to serve stockpiling shoppers before the lockdown.Sainsbury’s said Chop Chop had already more than doubled the number of customer orders it can fulfil from the nine supermarkets where it operates. Deliveries from the Blackfriars convenience store have halted as it could not provide a big enough range of goods for shoppers.Clodagh Moriarty, chief digital officer at Sainsbury’s, said: “We are doing everything we can to feed the nation and offer our customers quick, convenient and safe ways to get their groceries. “Demand for home grocery deliveries has never been higher and we have been receiving great feedback for Chop Chop, with customers really valuing the speed and convenience it brings.”Customers can order up to 20 Sainsbury’s products from a range of about 3,000 essential grocery and household items via the Chop Chop app.Sainsbury’s said the expansion of Chop Chop would contribute to efforts to increase its total number of grocery delivery slots to 600,000 per week."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1743c222600743e42900fdb3301e7ba6d266ebb6/0_268_5248_3149/master/5248.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b06a81c16cd23fcb720bd7faabe43681","title":"uks largest pubs group agrees coronavirus lockdown rent credit for tenants","story":"Ei Group will help publicans, albeit in terms of a discount on future stock purchasesThe UK’s largest pubs group has agreed to help tenants pay rents following widespread criticism that the industry is leaving publicans in the lurch during the Covid-19 lockdown.Ei Group – formerly known as Enterprise Inns – has said that any of its more than 4,000 pubs that are not receiving government grants will get a three-month “rent credit”, amounting to a discount on future payments.A group of 60 MPs had earlier urged Ei Group to give publicans a rent-free period to keep them afloat, as the industry wrestles with a crisis that threatens to put thousands of pubs out of business.MPs from both sides of the House of Commons had singled out the company for particular criticism, saying they were “dismayed” it had agreed only to defer rents rather than offering a rent holiday.“This will put many tenants deep in debt, making it financially more difficult for them to reopen,” the MPs said in a letter to the company. understands that Ei Group was working on the rent credit proposal when it received the letter.Greg Mulholland, chair of the British Pub Confederation, said Ei’s proposal was a “clever ruse” that still meant charging rent on closed pubs.He added that credit on future stock purchases was an easy sacrifice for Ei to make given that pubcos typically charge huge markups on the beer they sell tenants.Ei’s offer followed an outcry from publicans at being charged rent during the lockdown, with the groundswell of anger prompting two warnings from the government’s Pubs Code Adjudicator (PCA) to companies who it said should do more to help tenants.The PCA oversees the relationship between large pub companies and tenants subject to the controversial “beer tie”, under which they buy their beer from the company in exchange – supposedly – for lower rents.Of the UK’s “big six” pub companies, only Admiral Taverns had already agreed to a rent-free period for tied tenants.Some other rivals have said they will agree reductions on a case-by-case basis with inidual pubs."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2acdf807bad92c8ec626e5b5893649fd19cf355a/0_0_5000_3002/master/5000.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026s=2e67ac2cf6054e47195a37ea463cb02b","title":"china global leadership beijing coronavirus","story":"For years Beijing has spoken of its global leadership. As democratic states score Covid-19 own goals, that narrative is stronger than everWhen a new decade dawned a few short months ago, many predicted that the dominant theme would be China’s continued emergence and role in a world that was changing quickly. Few suspected that the rivalry and antagonism between China and the west would be framed by a global pandemic, and by the challenges – and opportunities – that it has offered to countries around the world, not least China itself.China was where Covid-19 struck first and it is where life is getting back to normal, albeit slowly. Manufacturing and production are rising, with factories open and starting to get back to similar levels to the second half of last year. Although fewer than three cases a day had been reported, alongside a handful of asymptomatic cases in the past two weeks, the emergence of a cluster of infections in Shulan, in north-east China, and the announcement that the entire population of Wuhan is to be tested in the coming days, show how nerves are still jangling about new waves of the disease. Still, data released by customs authorities last week shows that although there was a large decline in imports, exports rose year on year for the month of April – largely due to massive shipments of healthcare products.It is quite a turnaround. The catastrophic handling of the outbreak of coronavirus in Wuhan led to infections on a global scale. Many outside China wondered whether the failings of the authorities in Hubei province and beyond would lead to major political change in the country. Instead, we find Li Keqiang, the premier of the state council, telling us that “the virus is the common enemy of mankind” and saying that Chinese people are “willing to join hands with the people around the world” in an effort to defeat the disease.Not surprisingly, China is less keen to talk about what it got wrong than about what it is doing right: face masks, surgical gowns and ventilators have been distributed around the world, as we keep being reminded. China alone can’t supply a pandemic-gripped planet with ventilators, one industrial ministry official was quoted as saying in April. It wants to play the role of saviour, rather than villain.Control of that narrative is helped by the own goals provided by countries that have – or perhaps had – reputations for competence. In the UK, the prime minister missed crucial meetings, boasted about shaking hands before being infected and taken to intensive care. In the US, where infections are well past the million mark and the death toll is anticipated to double this month alone, the president has said “we have it under control”, urged citizens to “liberate” states that have locked down and recommended highly unusual areas of medical research as possible cures for the coronavirus.The high infection rates across many developed, democratic countries have helped ert the narrative away from China and its supposed “Chernobyl moment” to one of why democracies have performed so badly with the pandemic. It is a message that falls on fertile ground in many parts of the world. For example, the Saudi-owned Al Arabiya news station remarked that “China is the only country that has performed well in dealing with this crisis”. Solidarity in Europe “does not exist”, said Aleksandar Vučić, the president of Serbia, in an angry statement about import restrictions imposed by the European Union. “The only country that can help us is China,” he said.Such comments, made in the heat of the moment, can flatter to deceive – although China-watchers know how carefully Beijing has been cultivating its contacts in central and eastern Europe, including EU members, before the pandemic began. Likewise, the dispatch of medical equipment may well win short-term thanks, such as in Africa, where every country has received 100,000 masks (and more) from Chinese entrepreneur Jack Ma, but also strengthens the narrative of Chinese global leadership that has been articulated by Beijing in multiple countries, regions and formats for many years.It can be easy to over-emphasise the idends, as a report by a thinktank affiliated to the Ministry of State Security in Beijing reveals. Despite the efforts to win hearts and minds, for all the investment and focus on other parts of the world, global anti-China sentiment is at its highest point since 1989 and the Tiananmen Square protests, according to sources familiar with the report, which was presented to the country’s leadership. This has been led and fanned by the US. As a result, it warned, in the worst-case scenario, China needed to be ready for armed confrontation – and for war.That too needs to be taken with a pinch of salt. Although the threat of military conflict is one that Chinese president Xi Jinping has repeatedly spoken about, this is best understood as being designed for domestic consumption and as a means of framing an economy that was slowing before Covid-19. In fact, successive defence white papers issued by the Chinese military have emphasised both the low risks of serious confrontation, and the awareness that tensions need to be understood and managed carefully.In that sense, the reference to the potential for military conflict (and the fact that this was leaked) is most usefully interpreted as a sign of deliberate messaging: China recognises that the situation is serious, febrile and dangerous. Donald Trump’s threat to seek “hundreds of billions” in compensation is less of a concern, especially in a presidential election year, than his comments that “we can do something much easier than that … we have ways of doing things a lot easier than that”. Even though Trump says many things that have to be retracted, clarified or dismissed, those words sounded ominous.Gathering reliable information from China has always been difficult and has become more so with the expulsion of highly experienced journalists in recent weeks. Decisions about how to understand, let alone respond to, China are being taken blind, the result of educated guesswork and wishful thinking. When Trump’s top Asia adviser made an eloquent speech in Mandarin in favour of pluralism, to mark the anniversary of the 4 May 1919 protests, it was met by excitable commentaries in the US suggesting it might seed a democratic political movement in China. Such thinking shows how much easier it is to see the patterns that westerners might want to see, rather than deal with the more prosaic realities.Ideological, political and security tensions between the US and China have a long history. But, as the distinguished scholar Evan Feigenbaum stresses, in the past coordination has been possible, not least economically, because of overlapping interests. Now the problem is that, for all China’s talk of global leadership, it is doing little to lead international collective action. Nor, for that matter, is the US, the EU or anyone else. And in our me-first world, where states put their interests first, and find collaboration either increasingly difficult or unpalatable, this indeterminacy could have very significant consequences for global affairs."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/40c86fa57f862af5e460b97aead8e7e4300b151a/0_308_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8b618032a47c11df695c340c9fd82580","title":"estate agents britain recovery government property market coronavirus society","story":"The government’s deification of the property market should alarm those hoping for a more equal post-coronavirus society Everyone thinks they have “common sense”, but Boris Johnson’s may not be the same as yours or mine. But if you think it’s blindingly self-evident that only social democratic solutions can rebuild an economy plummeting into waters deeper than those of the South Sea bubble, beware. Prepare for a fight against the “common sense” of old enemies, battling not to return to the inequality-fuelling, environment-destroying normal, but to make it far worse.In Wednesday’s daily briefing, the housing and communities secretary, Robert Jenrick, delivered this homily: “I do know that in every economic recovery in modern British history, the housing market has been key.” With this, he reopened the housing market and set estate agents free to be our prime engines of growth. Off we go again, restarting an economy built on the quicksands of ever-inflating property wealth. After the crash of 2008, quantitative easing accelerated investment in already existing bricks and mortar, at the expense of falling investment in industry or anything else that might fuel our dismal productivity growth.Today, again, the property industry is calling for the suspension of all stamp duty to kickstart the market. Britain already taxes hard-grafting work far more than unearned wealth. Tax on property and accumulated wealth has been eased time and again in the last decade’s budgets: families now pass on homes untaxed altogether, regardless of massive lifetime capital gifts.Tax cuts on the sale of houses are piously claimed in the name of passing wealth onto the next generation, butinflating house prices benefit the older generation, while young people are locked out of the housing market. Angus Hanton, the co-founder of the Intergenerational Foundation, says a rising property market is the last thing the young need: “Young people need lower house prices and Covid-19 might make this possible. That means embracing falling house prices rather than protecting wealthy oldies in large homes.” Young first-time buyers already pay no stamp duty on properties worth up to £300,000, and a low rate on those worth up to £500,000. A stamp duty holiday subsidises buyers of expensive homes.But that’s only a taster of what militant tax cutters will seek to gain from the coronavirus crisis. Read Allister Heath in the  as an emblem of rightist thinking: “We cannot let the left use Covid as an excuse for radical tax hikes. A long-term strategy for free-market growth is the only responsible way to cope with soaring debt.”He sees in the Treasury document leaked to his newspaper, “a wealth and property levy, higher VAT, income tax and corporation tax and just about every other one of the modern liberal‑left’s wet dreams, repackaged neatly in a box stamped ‘Covid’”. Many on the left read the same Treasury document with equal horror, but for its public service cuts and public sector pay freezes. Heath accuses environmentalists of “enjoying the crippling collapse in GDP”, calling ministers “useful idiots” with their “absurd obsession with cycling … and relentless bashing of the car”.As the left hopes that the economic shock of the pandemic will lead to a 1945 moment, he ripostes, “the answer from the government, the Tory party and right-leaning voters to all of these leftwing, statist proposals needs to be unequivocal: over our dead bodies”. Instead he wants tax cuts for companies and the wealthy, cuts in red tape regulation, cuts to foreign aid and public sector pensions, and a private not state-funded insurance social care system. Heath also asserts that, “it’s time to drastically re-engineer the state” – but not in a good way.He would prefer a plan for “turning the whole UK (or the entire northern part) into a giant free port, radical pro-growth tax reform, the release of land for new suburbs, a privately financed road network and the legalisation of modern scientific techniques for agriculture”. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, is already a free port enthusiast, so will that find some traction?But here’s one surprise. He urges an end to the last decade’s balanced budget obsession: debt and deficits are no longer a problem. “If the choice is higher taxes or a one-off, large increase in the national debt, the latter is the least bad.” In a time of near-zero interest rates, higher debt is something the left would advocate too.The difference is that the left would use debt to rebuild threadbare public services and invest in green technologies. Tax Justice UK is not pushing for tax rises now, but once over the worst it warns that we must “ignore the siren call for a buccaneering low-tax Britain and invest in strong public services, part paid for by higher taxes on the wealthy and companies”.If that’s your “common sense” too, be well armed. Heath’s right has many government backers urging the US republican playbook of Ronald Reagan, George W Bush and Donald Trump: cut tax for the super rich and let debt rip for no productive or social gain. If property does get yet more tax boosters, that will be an alarming indicator of the government’s direction of travel."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db730bde1057a7bef05518a5d8e68682f150d71b/0_150_3300_1980/master/3300.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=86482d49b0784b6f53eacfa1d7db27e0","title":"mp confusion official covid 19 advice uncertainty","story":"My constituents’ questions have made me realise that we all need to get used to living with uncertaintyI’ve been an MP for 19 years and I’ve never known such a strange variety of questions pour into my inbox (aka my Facebook page).

After all, he’s allowed to drive to the garden centre so why not the lake? Or what about if he drove to the lake on the way to the garden centre? Another asks whether she has to go to work if she doesn’t have childcare – and dozens wonder whether they can legally refuse to work if their husbandwifenanchild is shielding, or if they don’t have a car, or their employer can’t guarantee social distancing? That’s without mentioning the requests for advice on wearing masks, washing clothes, home-teaching six-year-olds and the best alcohol level in hand-sanitiser. Lots expressly ask me for permission in writing to do what they want to do – or a letter they can show to their next-door neighbour forbidding them from doing what they don’t think their neighbours should be doing.It’s not surprising people are looking for certainty. Vagueness and incompetence haven’t inspired trust and with so much of normal life turned upside down people are genuinely fearful for their jobs, their health, their livelihood and their way of life. The very sight of so many people dying (in the old-fashioned but apt phrase) “before their time” has posed horrible questions – not least about the way we treat older people – and those who once thought themselves safe are now worried.But Boris Johnson is right about one thing. No government can micro-manage every minute element of the loosening of lockdown that must eventually come. It’s easy to tug the corset on. You just pull and pull on the drawstrings. It’s much tougher to loosen your corset with decorum.And the truth is that as we come out of this we are all going to have to live with a far higher degree of uncertainty. We will have to rely on our own judgment in our daily life and learn to assess risk and minimise danger without endlessly fretting.That is not going to be easy. Mathematics teachers tell me that probability is one of the most difficult things to teach or for the human brain to compute. We see a possible danger and flee, even if the chances of the danger realising itself are infinitesimal. But we will have to learn how to take sensible precautions but live with the unpredictability of life.The poet Keats had a phrase for this. He said that great people had a “negative capability”, that is to say they were “capable of being in uncertainties, mysteries, doubts, without any irritable reaching after fact and reason”. I know it sounds a bit like Kipling (“if you can keep your head while all about you are losing theirs” etc) but there’s an important difference. Of course we should establish the facts and listen to the experts, but we shall be paralysed as iniduals and as a nation if we seek certainty all the time. A life well-lived has to accept and embrace the chaos around us.This isn’t a call for rugged inidualism. The “herd immunity” idea was a dangerous fallacy. Nor do I subscribe to the idea that there’s a choice between the physical and financial health of the nation. But at some point each of us will have to make a difficult decision for ourselves without a politician’s say-so, just as we always did.I take three lessons from this. First, the government needs to factor into its thinking how it can help people assess risk and minimise danger more accurately and realistically.Second, the hyper-astute among you will have noticed that I referred to “government minister” back at the beginning without specifying what kind of government minister. That’s because I’m a Welsh MP and the four governments’ inability to sing from the same hymn-sheet has made life yet more complicated. So, half the time I’m explaining the difference – or the similarity – between England and Wales. It’s been driving lots of us insane that the prime minister – and virtually every other Westminster minister from the chancellor down – endlessly speaks as if devolution had never taken place. BBC News presenter Huw Edwards now seems to have taken to saying, “in England” after each announcement with especial glee, but ever since this started I’ve wished for a little symbol that could appear on your screen saying, “England-only” or “UK-wide” or “please ignore, this doesn’t apply to you”, as I know that the moment the news is over my constituents will take to the ether with the same plaintive question: “Does that apply to us?”Finally, I’m not giving people “permission” any more. I’m not an employment lawyer, a police officer, a social worker, a doctor or a chemist. Yes, I’ll point people to the most recent advice from the Welsh and UK governments, I’ll try to help people with their problems and I’ll make their case in the Commons. But I’m buffing up my negative capability and learning to live with uncertainty.• Chris Bryant is the Labour MP for Rhondda"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f94a0e70240b0b495434503689776cf4ffffe1eb/0_137_5958_3575/master/5958.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=55175f54bdfa54917a6694a00b1b1572","title":"stay alert coronavirus blame","story":"This meaningless phrase allows the government to shift blame to the public for failing to be sufficiently responsibleOfficially, the new strategy is “personal responsibility” and “good, solid British common sense”, as our prime minister colourfully describes it unofficially, operation blame the public is well under way. As media outlets query why London’s trains and buses are rammed despite government advice, our transport secretary, Grant Shapps, pleads with silly old commuters not to “flood” back on to public transport.It is unsurprising that a government that has presided over Europe’s worst death toll is so invested in shifting the blame. Was it “good, solid British common sense” to pursue herd immunity and impose a lockdown later than other European nations, even despite having advance notice of the horrors of Lombardy? Perhaps, indeed, it was “good, solid British common sense” to send vulnerable patients back to care homes without testing them for coronavirus first, seeding the illness in a sector in which up to 22,000 people may have died? Or, who knows, perhaps “good, solid British common sense” could explain how frontline staff have been left exposed for a lack of personal protective equipment?But the strategy in the government’s new approach is clear. “Stay alert” is meaningless, of course, except to devolve responsibility for what happens next to iniduals. Grownups don’t need a nanny state to hold their hands, scoff the government’s outriders: rather than relying on detailed instructions and central diktat, we should rely on our judgment. The implication, of course, is that if there is another spike in infections and death, that will be the public’s fault for not exercising adequate levels of personal responsibility.Here is a revival of the ideals of High Thatcherism, except applied to a pandemic. Back in the 1980s, what were once known as social problems requiring collective solutions – such as unemployment and poverty – became redefined as inidual failings. “Nowadays there really is no primary poverty left in this country,” declared Margaret Thatcher herself. “In western countries we are left with the problems which aren’t poverty. All right, there may be poverty because people don’t know how to budget, don’t know how to spend their earnings, but now you are left with the really hard fundamental character – personality defect.” If you were poor, it became an increasingly popularised attitude that it was because you were feckless, workshy, stupid and lazy. Thanks to the former Tory minister Norman Tebbit, “get on your bike” became a national cliche: it was more convenient, of course, for the government to pretend that mass unemployment was caused by a lack of effort, graft and can-do determination, rather than monetarist economics that ravaged entire industries.What the dogma of “personal responsibility” does is erase the inequalities that scar, disfigure and ultimately define society. It pretends that we are all equally free, that our autonomy over our lives and circumstances are the same that a middle-class professional working from home with access to a car can make the same choices as a cleaner expected to work halfway across a city.The estimated 60,000 people who have so far died in this national calamity were not wrested from their families because the public failed to be responsible, and neither will the deaths to come in the weeks ahead. Any uptick in infections won’t be down to someone standing one metre rather than two away from their parent in a park. It won’t be down to people inviting neighbours round for forbidden cups of tea in their kitchens, instead of paying poverty wages to cleaners to wash away their dirt.The explanation will instead be straightforward: the government relaxed a lockdown to force disproportionately working-class people into potentially unsafe environments at the behest of employers who have prioritised economic interests over human life. Another aggravating factor will be the abandonment of clear instructions in favour of confusion. It may well be this is a deliberate strategy, to claim that the government was perfectly clear, but the public let the team down by not showing enough “good, solid British common sense”. Whatever happens, the attempt to shift blame for the most disastrous government failure since appeasement on to the public must not succeed. This is on them: they did this, and we must not let them forget it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fa373c19a8f4b86c84bd0d33e202808bcd8f99c3/0_194_7540_4523/master/7540.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c97129cb19b24944a0e8f1bc3614f025","title":"the guardian view on pandemic secrecy wrong and counterproductive","story":"In the battle against Covid-19, transparency about the facts is key to maintaining public support. The government is undermining its own credibilityThe official documents consisted of line after line of blacked out information. They gave every appearance of top secret cold war papers from which the slightest hint that might be useful to an enemy had been redacted. In reality, though, they were nothing more than part of a report by behavioural scientists on how the British public might respond to Covid-19 lockdown measures. With heavy irony, they were published last week as part of an attempt to be more transparent.The language of war has been too common throughout the Covid-19 crisis, never more than in the mouth of Boris Johnson, a leader who is happier trading in florid metaphors than in plain facts and practical details. Yet there is a huge difference between a war and the pandemic. In a real war there is a human enemy. In the pandemic there is a viral one. This difference is crucial when it comes to mobilising the public’s support.In a war, the enemy craves vital information. As a result, the national effort must indeed often be kept secret, plans concealed and information controlled. In a fight to preserve the national health, however, openness is all. Transparency is fundamental to good decision-making about an elusive enemy. It is also vital to ensuring national confidence, so that the public cooperates with evidence-based restrictions and sacrifices – including control over their own data – that can help bring the viral scourge to an end.British governments have never been at ease with openness, and this continuing unease is now significantly affecting and weakening the national effort, especially as the lockdown is loosened in England. Too much is being subordinated to “comms strategy”. This is not just wrong in principle, but counterproductive in practice. It is wrong because the public has a right to know about the threat and to take highly personal decisions which are laden with risk. And it is counterproductive because it disables ministers from the very task – gathering information in order to act rationally and effectively to combat the virus – in which public confidence and cooperation are most essential.But the secrecy persists. It was always ridiculous that the membership of the government’s Sage advisory committee was kept secret. ’s revelation of the names this month has had no adverse public consequences and at least one positive one, since we now know that Sage members were not asked to approve the new message to England to stay alert. Whitehall has now published an incomplete list of names.Even less defensible is the fact that the government continues to keep most of Sage’s key papers and some of its most recent conclusions secret, despite occasional promises to publish them. The findings of the Exercise Cygnus test drill in 2016, which exposed a health sector that could be overwhelmed by a pandemic, have long been suppressed, when they could have made possible a more effective resilience strategy that might have saved lost lives. The documents published last week revealed only that No 10 is politically paranoid about losing hold of the debate.Yet these papers and conclusions are “the science” that the government still claims to be following in its Covid-19 policy. They are documents which ought ideally to provide a gold standard of credibility that ministers are doing the right thing. Yet the public cannot see what they say and the conclusions, where they are known, are open to challenge. As long as this continues, ministers risk precisely the loss of trust that has been such a mark of this most troubling week in the crisis."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f1f209b1038f6289dd3cf54680231a35dc9ed5e7/0_177_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=300\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=310c71461240b4c1cdb16583a372f00c 300w","title":"i want to be a role model to the black community how detectives from ethnic minorities are inspiring young people","story":"Three BAME police officers explain how their influence is having a positive impact on others from underrepresented backgrounds With the government pledging to recruit an extra 20,000 police officers in three years, there has perhaps been no better time to join policing. Detectives have especially bright prospects, given the ever-changing criminal landscape and the need for investigative expertise.Police Now – an independent social enterprise, with a mission to transform communities by recruiting, developing and inspiring leaders in policing – delivers a National Detective Programme, focused on advanced investigations and a National Graduate Leadership Programme, which focuses on neighbourhood policing. Here, three recruits, all from black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) backgrounds, bring their experiences to life.Mtitimila presented his work on disrupting “county lines” drug dealing to Cressida Dick, commissioner of London’s politan Police, when he finished the National Graduate Leadership Programme in 2018. “In some of my work, I have experienced gangs in cities target people in rural areas who had mental health problems or a drug addiction and use their house as a nest to sell class A drugs,” says Mtitimila, who is based in Cheshire. His solution was to tackle county lines drug dealing at its source: the rural drugs nests. He focused on shutting down these premises, which were often home to some of the most vulnerable people in society. This highlights how policing has a tangible positive impact on disadvantaged communities – one of the reasons he signed up for the force in the first place.He joined the programme in 2016 to improve the lives of people in disadvantaged communities after a stint as a study support assistant at a college. “I’ve had a fortunate life and want to give back and work with people who are less fortunate,” he says.Another reason Mtitimila was motivated to join the force is because of the negative experiences of being stopped and searched as a teenager. “The search wasn’t necessarily unfounded. The problem was a lack of communication. I’m not sure I understood why I was being searched other than for mooching around with my hood up.” He signed up to change stop-and-search techniques, so as to make them a more positive experience for those being asked to comply. Through a multicultural network of colleagues, he has given feedback to “nudge” officers into changing techniques. “I ask: how would you stop and search your mother? You’d be very polite and respectful. That’s how we should treat people, they are humans at the end of the day. Sometimes we recover drugs or knives, but often searches are negative. They’re innocent until proven guilty.”His leadership skills have grown by leaps and bounds because he was given responsibility for managing and leading other police officers early on in his career, even those with more experience. The programme taught him to tap into people’s reasons for being a police officer and to assign them roles accordingly, so as to keep morale and engagement up. “If someone likes getting into drug investigations, you might have them at the front going through a door on a drugs warrant. It’s about knowing the people around you, and that everyone’s motivation is different.”After the programme, he moved into a “high-octane” response team, then became a detective and is currently training to become an inspector. He ultimately hopes to move into a management job to improve processes, whether optimising shift patterns, improving mental health support for officers, or how the police communicate information to the public and media. “I want to improve procedures to deliver policing better. This is where I can have the greatest positive impact.”Fanibe was in McDonald’s during his lunch break recently when a young black man serving him a coffee asked for his advice on joining the police. “The confidence he gained from seeing a black guy in a police uniform legitimised this career path,” says Fanibe, who is originally from Nigeria and moved to the UK for university. “I want to be a role model to the black community.” It’s worth noting, however, that all recruits need the indefinite right to work in the UK.Fanibe, who is in his late 30s, joined the National Detective Programme last year after working in quotes and customer finance at British Gas, and hopes to build rapport with all communities of society. Currently doing a rotation in a team responding to 999 calls in Manchester, he was recently called to an assault. At the scene, a group of people from eastern Europe gravitated towards Fanibe. “They found it easier speaking to me, because of the trust they had in me simply because I was a minority too,” he says. “People put barriers up sometimes. I want to break them down.”A positive experience with the police after a burglary at his Manchester home was what got Fanibe excited about a career in policing. “The officer who came showed genuine care and empathy that really put me at ease in a very stressful scenario,” he says. “We can make a big difference to how people feel about crime through our communication.”The detective programme has increased Fanibe’s resilience and made him more confident as a leader. “You have to go to a certain place in your mind when things get tough,” he says. “I have been called to situations where there was blood everywhere, someone was hurt, I had to call an ambulance. My supervisor also threw me in at the deep end, putting me in charge of the other emergency responders, to allow me to show my leadership skills. I think I managed the crime scene well.”Brown was a firefighter for a decade before he signed up for the detective programme in search of variety. “There is lots of variety in policing – you can work on tackling cybercrime and serious organised crime,” he says.It was a big decision to change his career, but Brown finds policing in Avon and Somerset really rewarding. “It wasn’t an easy decision, but I wanted a different way to make an impact on society,” he says. “The thing that really energises me about policing is the pace in which I can help the most vulnerable in challenging times.“There are transferable skills that I have brought with me, including resilience in challenging times. I can make decisions with clarity of thought, without the adrenaline taking over.”Brown plans to join a detainee investigation team and has learned the PEACE framework for interviewing people in custody – the framework takes a conversational, non-confrontational approach to getting information from an investigation interview subject. “It helps you find the truth, to be able to link a suspect to a crime, or at least understand how something happened.”He has also become forensically savvy. “If you’re on a crime scene, it means not contaminating potential evidence by walking over or touching things – a simple cigarette butt might contain DNA that is vital to a case,” Brown says.The training was rigorous, helping to get him ready for policing. He also built up a network for sharing ideas and joined a movement of people wanting to help society. It’s no surprise that he recommends the programme to others: “A job in policing is fulfilling, despite the risks involved. It’s about helping the vulnerable, and you do it to make a difference.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b84bd59e5d36eb88f18e50f2dd4b8c319b53ab24/0_267_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=4913aee5b33a31a53db95fb49f12b8b7","title":"greta thunberg cnn coronavirus town hall climate change","story":"Thunberg isn’t a Covid-19 expert, but she’s world-renowned activist using her platform to inform people about the pandemicShortly after CNN announced yesterday that 17-year-old climate activist Greta Thunberg would join a panel of experts discussing the coronavirus, the backlash began.“What place does Greta Thunberg have in this town hall?” asked the New York magazine journalist Yashar Ali. On the other side of the spectrum, Fox News pundits and Donald Trump Jr also took issue with Thunberg’s name being on that list.It is worth noting that Don Jr frequently takes the stage with no qualifications other than being his father’s son. Fox News, meanwhile, has a rotating roster of non-experts debating people whose job it is to know better than them. We’ve seen climate-deniers who debate scientists about climate change unlicensed health practitioners who debate what actual doctors have told us and commentators who have compared Black Lives Matter to the KKK debate civil rights activists on what racism is. We are hardly in expert-land here. Even if letting “people with a view” challenge experts can sometimes produce good debate, it can also run the risk of creating a false equivalence between the two. So is CNN right to have Thunberg on? Thunberg is hardly a coronavirus expert, but she is world-renowned climate activist – and has already spoken about how the pandemic should inform our response to climate justice in a post-pandemic world. Thunberg’s activism also gives her an undeniable platform which she has used to inform people about the pandemic. After showing mild symptoms of Covid-19 in late March after a trip around Europe, Thunberg chose to quarantine away from her family for two weeks and encouraged other young people to do the same.Without Thunberg, the panel for “Coronavirus Facts and Fears” – which includes the CNN broadcasters Dr Sanjay Gupta, 50, and Anderson Cooper, 52 Kathleen Sebelius, 71, the former health secretary and Richard Besser, 60, the former Centers for Disease Control and Prevention director – has an average age of 58.That makes sense: expertise often takes years to accrue. But it also makes sense to have a young voice that carries influence on the panel. Young people are less vulnerable to the virus and so they might take its risks less seriously, but they also tend to be more socially agile. Studies analyzing the early outbreak of Covid-19 suggest that about four in five people who have spread the disease probably didn’t know they had the virus. In other words, young people could play a vital role in preventing its spread.Some have suggested that sexism might play a role in the shock people are expressing at Thunberg’s appearance. It is hard to imagine the same outrage if the journalist Chris Cuomo – who was recently diagnosed with Covid-19 – was invited to the town hall. In fairness, Cuomo had proof that he had the coronavirus. But isn’t that kind of the point? Most people who aren’t wealthy or famous simply aren’t able to get tested – certainly many young people won’t. Medical guidelines also encourage people without severe symptoms not to get tested.Viewed in this light, Thunberg – a young person who showed symptoms that weren’t bad but decided to stay home anyway – has one of the most important experiences on the panel."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2a0c8611a4cfbb8e98a8b9c4f089eb8fa663621c/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fdbce79842c884a0a5f144455bc43e28","title":"retro cool how to get your vintage fashion fix from home in pictures","story":"Many secondhand shops are still open for business via their websites.

In Guy Ritchie’s notorious gangster drama he plays Handsome Bob, a bit of a lairy bastard, with a secret emotional life, who works with Idris Elba. The film set my teeth on edge, but Hardy brings some of his trademarked truculent charisma.This is a dodgy one for Hardy fans, although he gets points for an excursion outside his comfort zone into the world of larksome capers. In this frantic, strained comedy, Hardy plays a super-tough federal agent, a cockney superlad with a V-necked jumper and a simian walk. His partner is smooth hottie Chris Pine. Both guys fall for adorable Reese Witherspoon, and use all their spyware paraphernalia to spy on each other taking Reese out on dates. Maybe Jason Statham and Dwayne Johnson would have been better.Hardy deserves a high-profile role in a Marvel movie — and he is one of the very few actors who would be equally credible as superhero or supervillain. But this isn’t the one. Here he plays tough investigative reporter Eddie Brock, who takes down corporate bad guys in his weekly online show. But then he “fuses”, horribly, with a symbiote organism imported from outer space by precisely the kind of evil business behemoth that he exposes on his programme and becomes the monstrous Venom. The element of broad comedy really isn’t Hardy’s thing.Hardy has a tiny role in Sofia Coppola’s film, playing Raumont, the discontented nobleman at Marie Antoinette’s court, a young intriguer who is a keen enough participant in the power politics of the day, but without the status to which he thinks himself entitled. Hardy’s relatively low profile here is probably because he is not fully plausible as a pretty-boy figure and had yet to grow into a his bulkier, more macho looks.Hardy is here well into his broodingly impassive hunk phase in this hefty adaptation of the historical bestseller, set in the postwar Soviet Union and based on a real case. Hardy plays Leo Demidov, the soldier who hoisted the Red Flag atop the Reichstag in Berlin in 1945 and went on to become a security officer. He’s on the trail of a serial killer, but hated by the regime for his tough refusal to denounce his wife on a trumped-up charge. It’s a heavy meal of a film, but Hardy brings to it an actorly muscle-mass.Hardy took a walk on the wild side and was sufficiently confident in his own resounding masculinity to play a very gender-challenging character in this weird film set in the 14th century. It features a strolling troupe of players led by Willem Dafoe one of them is Straw, played by Hardy, who specialises in cross-dressing and applying lipstick with dainty precision before going out on stage.Hardy isn’t especially known for patterned knitwear but maybe he should be, considering his woolly attire in this gonzo-violent Prohibition-era mob drama. He plays the deadpan Forrest Bondurant, a hooch runner in Virginia whose jumper really needs a handwash. His brother is Howard, played by Jason Clarke, and there’s a nervy younger brother, Jack, played by Shia LaBeouf. Hardy’s slow-moving, cool presence gives the film some ballast.This was a film widely considered in its day to have brought the smackdown and delivered the action wowsers. Hardy plays Tommy, an Iraq war veteran returning home to Philadelphia to settle the score with his boozy, bullying dad, Paddy, played by Nick Nolte. The father contritely agrees to coach Tommy in his career as an MMA fighter, but Tommy’s opponent turns out to be his equally tightly wound brother Brendan, played by Joel Edgerton. It’s by-the-numbers stuff, but Hardy is simmeringly charismatic.This is just a returning cameo, but what a cameo and what a film, from a director who gave Hardy some his best roles. The scene is the victory-from-defeat miracle of Dunkirk, when thousands of stranded British soldiers were rescued from the beaches of northern France with the aid of a plucky flotilla of small boats. Hardy plays Farrier, the lone RAF pilot who engages the enemy overhead at almost suicidal risk: it’s a role supercharged with significance considering how much the RAF was resented for a perceived failure to provide sufficient air cover during the evacuation.A very strange but arresting performance from Hardy as the prematurely ageing Al Capone, under house arrest in Florida in the last year of his life, suffering from dementia and syphilis, starting to hallucinate and displaying an unfortunate habit of soiling himself in moments of stress. Hardy growls and rasps his insults in Italian and English.Many Hardy connoisseurs believe that it was this film, from the Danish provocateur Nicolas Winding Refn, that really propelled the actor into the big league. Crucially, he gained 100lbs (which meant he had a new Russell Crowe-type beefiness and solidity) to play the notorious British prisoner Charles Bronson (a self-given name, having been born Michael Peterson), a lifer whose bizarre delusions and propensity for violence in jail has kept him banged up for the past three decades. Bronson addresses the audience directly, like a droll and dapper music hall turn. It’s a strange film, but a strong performance from Hardy.Playing twins is a test for any actor, and Hardy tackles it with gusto in this dual role that he was surely born to play – Reggie and Ronnie Kray, the hideous cockney siblings who ruled East End gangland in the 1960s. Reggie is the supposedly more rational one, although without glasses, and Ronnie is barking mad, with glasses, and a tiny bit more weight. Hardy’s Ronnie has a perpetual pop-eyed stare of psychopathic disapproval, insisting on his own gayness in a growling voice, like a scary Tommy Cooper. Reggie, in all his comparative normality, is closer to being the film’s romantic lead.This excellent, undervalued film from Rufus Norris was one of the most startling cinema experiences of the past decade: a movie opera based on the Ipswich serial killer case of 2006, in a reportage verbatim style, taken from eyewitness accounts – based on the stage play at London’s National Theatre. Hardy plays Mark, a minicab driver who has a choric function, singing about his own expertise on the subject of psychopathic homicide. He says defensively: “I’ve studied serial killers it doesn’t mean I am one.” (But there is a worrying pause before the phrase: “I am one.”) It’s the nearest Hardy has come to Travis Bickle.In Nolan’s dizzyingly hi-tech, high-concept cerebral thriller, Hardy plays one of a crew run by Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio), an industrial espionage hacker whose speciality is to invade people’s subconscious in order to steal their commercially sensitive secrets. Or, in this case, to mastermind the implanting (or inception) of an idea that will break up a business empire. Hardy is Cobb’s man Eames, whose speciality is shape-shifting identity theft, a skill that is very helpful in manipulating the enemy. It’s a posher, smoother and more sinuous role than we have come to expect from Hardy, and Nolan’s film brings out all the actor’s latent style and menace.This was probably the most purely and successfully villainous role of Hardy’s career, although he might as easily have been cast in the lead. Leonardo DiCaprio plays the real-life 19th-century frontiersman Hugh Glass, who was part of an expeditionary forceto establish a fur-trapping base in Missouri. Hardy’s John Fitzgerald is one of the shifty men working alongside him who abandons Glass to his doom after the group is set upon by a warrior tribe, and later claims extra pay for having supposedly given him a Christian burial. But Glass is still alive, survives against terrible odds, and comes for payback. In a way, Hardy is there to embody all that DiCaprio’s character is fighting against: he has to be a worthy alpha-adversary, not simply mean and duplicitous. His gloweringly malign presence bookends the movie at the beginning and end – we are heading for a mighty confrontation.John Le Carré’s intelligence thrillers are a far cry from the romanticised fantasies of James Bond. His is a world of dull chaps in dull suits trying not to think about shabby, shame-filled compromises and betrayals. But in this excellent version of Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, Hardy’s character Ricki Tarr is the nearest thing the drama has to a 007 figure, surrounded by Ms and Qs. He’s a young, physically fit spy who has a bit of derring-do and womanising in his life, dramatically reporting back to Gary Oldman’s Smiley from his posting in Istanbul. He is not posh like the others, and he wears a sheepskin jacket, racy denim shirt – and Hardy also has a reddish-blond wig for the role. The get-up is borderline absurd, perhaps, but Hardy carries it off and it is entirely consistent with the period. Smartened up, Hardy will make an excellent Bond.Of all the leading movie roles Hardy has had, this is probably the most conventionally sympathetic and heroic. In a Boston crime drama that is adapted from a story by Dennis Lehane, Hardy plays a nice, ordinary guy called Bob, who works in a bar owned by his glowering cousin Marv (James Gandolfini). The place is used as a drop point by Chechen gangsters for their illegal cash. Bob rescues a puppy from a trash-can nearby and this quaint act of altruism and innocence sets in train a series of dramatic and tragic events. Bob is a unique figure in Hardy’s CV: he is basically likable and relatable, and Hardy’s face and style have always resisted this kind of ingratiation. His character is also quite vulnerable, being bullied by a local cop and accused by him of letting down the church. The Drop is, in many ways, an outlier for Hardy, but it could point the way ahead for his future career.For the majority of his fanbase, this is probably the key Hardy movie: George Miller’s widely adored reboot of his Mad Max franchise – a bizarre convoy-chase action fantasia in the post-apocalyptic Australian desert, where a warlord controls oil, water, bullets and milk. Hardy plays the taciturn Max Rockatansky (approximately the character played by Mel Gibson in the original), a former interceptor lawman and now a lone wolf, tormented by memories of the wife and child he couldn’t save. He is captured by a hateful chieftain and taken to his stronghold from which he escapes in the company of the charismatic Charlize Theron. She is is to lead a feminist fightback against the misogynist tyranny that keeps the women oppressed, like farm animals, and she is to make common cause with Max. It is almost a silent movie role for Hardy, but his potent, bullish, violent presence and fierce face – rugged, yet sensually full-lipped – make him a living cartoon of rage in the desert sun.This is Hardy’s finest hour, a film that shows what he really can do as an actor, when all the films that had made him famous seemed to have been suppressing the very qualities of subtlety and sensitivity that he shows here. Hardy plays British construction manager Ivan Locke, and the entire film is simply a shot of him at the wheel of his car, like a dashcam, as he talks to the people who are important in his life on his hands-free mobile. He is a dependable, professional, unemotional bloke who had been about to supervise the pouring of thousands of tonnes of wet cement into the foundations of new building in the Midlands. But just when he is needed there in person, Locke has abandoned the site and is driving south to London. He is having a marital crisis and an emotional breakdown, but he is keeping it together Hardy’s outstanding less-is-more acting shows the awful damage that this is inflicting on him personally. It is a vocal and physical performance that could be compared to Richard Burton, but is entirely distinctive personal work. This is top Hardy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/32a8015073951d00a45d619e30e355e2dc56feee/0_1292_7819_4689/master/7819.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f452e4f07637582cb9a8d76593cf3a66","title":"its about time 10 meals that take 10 minutes and 10 that take 10 hours","story":"Whether you need a quick fix or have hours to while away, there is a delicious recipe for you.What you cook in lockdown can depend heavily on time. Some people suddenly have to feed multiple hungry mouths several times a day. Others have hours to while away and need a task absorbing enough to take their minds off the people and places they miss. Whichever camp you fall into, there are recipes here for you.Pea soupBettina Campolucci Bordi, a plant-based cookery writer, heats through 600g frozen peas with a little olive oil and a can of coconut milk, before blitzing until smooth. Divide between 2-3 bowls and serve with a dollop of yoghurt and fresh herbs.Pitta pan toastieOllie Templeton, of Carousel, London. fills a pitta (any bread would work) with cheese, salad leaves and sriracha, then toasts it in a heavy-based pan, with another pan on top to flatten it.Pasta with courgetteFelicity Cloake’s courgette carbonara is a thing of beauty. If you like the combo, another option is this pasta nerano by Robin Gill, of The Dairy, London. Cook 400g spaghetti to al dente – about eight minutes. Meanwhile, fry four medium courgettes sliced in rounds, in batches and in olive oil, until lightly browned. Sauté three sliced garlic cloves, add in the cooked pasta with a ladleful of the pasta water, then the courgettes and mix vigorously. Add a handful of grated provolone cheese and fresh basil, and mix until fully melted.Cornershop noodlesCarl Clarke, chef-founder of Chick ’n’ sours, London, says to boil a full kettle, and make an omelette with two seasoned eggs and some finely sliced spring onion, then slice into strips. Slice and fry on a high heat for a few minutes half an onion, a pepper (any colour) and a handful of button mushrooms. If you like, throw in some cubed tinned meat (Spam, ham, corned beef etc). Add 4cm sliced fresh ginger and four cloves of garlic, along with a handful of green leaves. Pour over 170ml boiling water and add half a packet of chicken-flavoured instant noodles, along with the packet seasoning, and cook until most of the water is absorbed. Add the omelette. In another bowl, mix together 1 tbsp curry powder, 3 tbsp soy sauce, 3 tbsp fish sauce, 1 tbsp rice wine or dry sherry, 1 tbsp sugar, 1 tbsp sesame oil and 2 tbsp cold water, and at the last moment, add to the noodles and stir. Garnish with sliced spring onion to serve.Chicken noodle soupFood writer Molly Wizenberg, meanwhile, has this even simpler chicken noodle hack (serves two), using tinned soup, vermicelli, egg and parmesan.Buckwheat noodle saladAs a post-home-schooling quick-fix for two, Nicholas Balfe of Salon, in Brixton, south London, says boil a full kettle then pour 1.5 litres into a saucepan on a high heat. Soft boil two eggs (six minutes – set a timer). Meanwhile, dress very thinly sliced carrot (use a peeler) with a pinch of salt and 50ml each of sesame oil and rice wine vinegar, some sesame seeds and some nori seaweed, cut up finely. In another bowl, season cucumber half-moons with 50ml soy sauce and a teaspoon of sugar. When cooked, plunge the eggs into cold water, then peel. In the reserved hot water, cook 250g buckwheat (soba) noodles according to the packet instructions (two to three minutes), then drain and rinse briefly. Divide the noodles between two bowls and place clusters of carrots, cucumber and protein (it could be shredded roast chicken, smoked fish, cubed silken tofu or red beans, seasoned with salt, lime zest and juice). Top each bowl with a halved egg, fresh herbs and toasted nuts, and serve with kimchi, pickles, andor hot sauce on the side.Spicy vegan bao bunsThese pineapple-glazed treats from chef Denai Moore (@dees_table) are reason enough to keep a packet of ready-made bao buns in the freezer … In a saucepan, mix 120ml pineapple juice, half a de-seeded scotch bonnet chilli (or a milder one if you prefer), two tablespoons each of coconut sugar and soy sauce, and two thinly sliced garlic cloves. Bring to the boil, then reduce for six to eight minutes until sticky and glossy. Meanwhile, slice 10 asparagus spears and 10 button mushrooms and fry in olive oil until caramelised and brown (four minutes) and season with a pinch of sea salt. Add the pineapple glaze, then remove from the heat, stirring to coat evenly. Microwave four frozen buns according to packet instructions, then fill with thinly sliced cucumber topped with the mushroom and the asparagus on top. Garnish with fresh herbs to serve.Eggs kagianaAsimakis Chaniotis, the Michelin-starred executive chef of Pied à Terre, London, says: grate three large tomatoes into a pan, over a medium heat. Stirring continuously, add in seven whisked eggs to form a thick paste. Season to taste with salt, pepper and oregano and pour into an overproof dish. Top with 200g crumbled feta and bake at 220C, until the cheese begins to caramelise. Serves 2-3.Chickpeas with feta and red onionMix a drained tin of chickpeas in a large bowl with a sliced red onion, 100g of feta cheese, cubed, a handful of cherry tomatoes, some chopped black olives and fresh basil. Drizzle with olive oil and a teaspoon of sherry vinegar, and season to taste. Tom Kitchin serves this with roast hake portions, which you can easily do in the same 10 minutes (season then pan fry, skin side down, for a couple of minutes then place in a 180C oven for four minutes more). Cheat’s chicken shawarmaAfter a long day, chefs Itamar Srulovich and Sarit Packer, of Honey and Co, London, often turn to this dish. Dice an onion and fry in a hot oily pan, add as much garlic and chilli as you want, dice a breast of chicken and toss it in, mixing until almost cooked. Then, they say, hit the spice rack: choose from baharat, Lebanese seven spice, ras el hanout, curry powder or a mix of cumin, paprika and a pinch of cinnamon with lots of black pepper. Serve with sliced tomato, flat breads and yoghurt. GumboThe night I spent meticulously following Sara Roahen’s recipe (live-chatting colour swatches with her to check my roux was asdone as it should be) is etched in my brain as the foundational culinary experience. I measured, dredged, sweated. There were times when I hallucinated … No wonder Matthew McConaughey pictures his father up in heaven in his pants, Miller Lite in hand, and a big pot of this southern wonder on the go. Read Roahen’s Gumbo Tales to get a taste …Roast porkThe Michelin-starred Andrew Wong’s char siu involves a six-hour marinade and lengthy oven roast followed by a six-hour steep in sugar syrup. For his pork shoulder, meanwhile, Ottolenghi makes a marinade with Szechuan pepper with citrus and pomegranate molasses and leaves the joint in the oven all night. Jane Baxter, by contrast, uses fewer aromatics, instead drying the meat overnight to ensure perfect crackling.Chocolate sourdoughIf you have spent the past six weeks of lockdown nursing a sourdough mother into bubbling life, take things up a notch and bake a chocolate-studded loaf. Sliced hot and slathered in mascarpone, it is enough to make anyone weep. There are several recipes online – Jennine Walker’s is simple Shiao-Ping on The Fresh Loaf gives more complete instructions.Pie artAs Lokokitchen’s Lauren Ko put it recently:“Don’t try this at home, kids. Or do because it will occupy you for approximately 469632154239 hours.” Ko has mastered the art of the geometric pie, an edible cross between string art and high-stakes tiling. Other decorative pie accounts to ogle at include Thida Bevington, Julie Jones and Jo Harrington. To start, get a hold of some rhubarb and a protractor, and make Bevington’s pink herringbone number.A Bake Off showstopperBaking will take as many hours as you can put in, really, as Kim-Joy’s two-tiered lavender lemon curd fox cake proves. The Spanische windtorte was one of 2015’s technical challenges: it will see you spooning oversized meringues, shaping fondant violets – replete with stamens – and piping Swiss meringue borders on it. So much sugar to get lost in.The 20-hour applesIn his 1999 reference tome, Desserts, the pastry chef and chocolatier, Pierre Hermé, gives a recipe – for the Melody cake – which is almost 10 pages long. One of the cake’s seven layers is comprised of wafer-thin apple slices slow-cooked in butter and sugar for 10 hours, then rested in the fridge for 10 more.MufulettaThis only takes 10 minutes to prepare – but it’s the overnight press in the fridge that makes it sing. You gouge out a boule of bread, then fill it up with layers of deli meat, cheese, salad and pickles. Put the lid, as it were, back on, wrap tight in clingfilm and foil, then weigh down with something mighty heavy. Just the kind of celebratory door-stopper you will need once we’re allowed to spend the day picnicking in the sun.Cure some egg yolks (they make superbly savoury rice toppings) and make candied fruit. You can glacé wedges of citron, slices of orange, halved and stoned stone fruit, stalk-on cherries, whole clementines or even a pineapple with its crown intact. To be sure, it is the very definition of non-essential cooking. But what with the wildly protracted escapist prep time, the glistening jewel-like hues and the luxe touch even the smallest sliver gives whatever you pop it on, making a batch of fruits confits truly is a kind of holiday. Arrange in old-school muffin cases under cellophane wrappers with little gold ties, and pretend it’s August in Aix-en-Provence.

The government and our medical experts will continue to offer guidance and support to the game ahead of any final decision which would put these plans into action.”The Premier League is in negotiations with its broadcast partners Sky and BT over finding a way of showing some matches free-to-air if and when the season resumes. The government’s preferred solution is that the remaining 45 matches not already covered under the terms of existing TV deals are shown either on freely accessible TV channels or via a streaming platform such as YouTube.The government has also instructed the league to factor ‘solidarity payments’ into any final reckoning should the season be completed. Broadcasters have demanded a rebate from the Premier League even if they are able to screen their full complement of matches, because of subscribers lost owing to the current postponement of the season and because the league has not been able to deliver the product as promised. The DCMS has asked, however, that a tranche of any remaining TV money received should in part be shared with the rest of the football pyramid.The precise amount of any sum is yet to be determined and although the government has asked football to find a solution themselves, this may not prove straightforward. The EFL is understood to expect an extra one-off payment, a contribution towards filling the potential £200m black hole in club finances it faces by September. Sources at the Premier League, meanwhile, suggest they see the government’s request as being about ensuring that funds owed under current solidarity arrangements are made available.Rows over broadcast revenue are hardly new and other concerns are taking precedence. The immediate hurdle, well before any matches can be played, is enabling players to return to training after two months away from the field. The EFL and Premier League have devised medical protocols that conform with new government advice on training for elite athletes. The Premier League hopes to convince its 20 shareholder clubs to give their assent in a vote on Monday.The outcome of the vote is not guaranteed, following a series of meetings on Wednesday between players, club managers and officials. Some of the players – the influential Watford captain Troy Deeney among them – are understood to have left the meeting feeling concerns over safety had not been resolved, and managers are believed to have asked for any pre-resumption training period to be longer than the three weeks budgeted for in the Premier League’s Project Restart plans. Managers and players will this week feed their thoughts back to clubs before the vote.If the protocols are passed, players would be allowed to train in groups while observing social distancing. Any contact training, a vital component in preparing for matches, would be allowed only following new protocols and further government advice.Tottenham’s manager, José Mourinho, said: “I want to train and I am desperate for the Premier League to return as soon as it’s safe to do so, particularly now as we are seeing other leagues preparing to return to action.”Speaking at the daily coronavirus briefing, the government’s deputy chief medical officer Jonathan van Tam, who was directly involved in drawing up government sporting guidance and spoke with top flight players via video-link on Wednesday, suggested that any further steps would not be immediate.“The overall approach with easing social distancing has been one that has been tentative, measured, slow and step-wise,” he said. ‘That is exactly the plan that is underway for all of elite sport, not just football. The first of those is really to return to safe training still observing social distancing, and plans are taking place at quite some depth to be ready to do that.“We will have to see how that goes before it is time to move on, or even think about moving on, to the return of competitive football matches. I think we have to be slow, we have to be measured.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ce2aa69eabb946dd975db7dc894243fc7b641fc6/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4c3a825c7f1470cfdc943e87452dadbd","title":"we get up obscenely early how were balancing kids and work in lockdown","story":"Staying connected online is helping one couple with young children cling to their sanity as they try to do it all. Video chats, YouTube Kids and Google Classroom are just the start ...We’re now in month two of the Great Coronavirus Lockdown of 2020. Of my friends without children, one half have become ninja masters of the sourdough arts, and the other half are practising mindfulness during their enforced solitude, as they hunker down quietly at home.My family is doing the precise opposite. The TV goes on at the beginning of the day. Laptops are set up in the dining room. Tablets and games consoles are whipped out at will, and the house is alive with the sound of typing and overlapping voices on video-conferencing software and Sonic the Hedgehog game walkthroughs (thank you YouTube Kids).It’s a functioning, necessary chaos. I am in lockdown with my family – two full-time working adults, my husband and me, and our two small sons.Unlike the sourdough and mindful people, lockdown has given working parents less time in the day, not more. We’re having to work full-time, as though our kids were in school or childcare parent full-time, as though it were a weekend and work was the furthest thing from our minds and we’re also home-schooling our kids so their brains and social skills don’t atrophy before term-time comes back around.Plus we’re having to do all of this simultaneously. Our older son, at just five years old, is too illiterate to curl up with a book while we work. And his younger brother is only two, so he doesn’t quite understand that he can’t clamber all over me while I’m in a virtual team meeting, “play piano” on my laptop keyboard, or ask who “that ugly angry man” is.So, how? How, in my home, do we manage this series of impossible tasks without the assistance of a magical, Harry Potter-style time-turner? First, by dramatically relaxing how we define working, parenting and, sometimes, “the acceptable length of time to leave a nappy unchanged”.Second, we get up obscenely early so one of us can parent in the morning and work in the afternoon (and vice-versa). Finally, we squeeze our wireless broadband connection for every spare nanosecond it can give us. Here’s how our broadband connection is helping us cling on to our sanity ...Empowering our five-year-oldLockdown came six months into our older son’s first year at primary school, just when he was beginning to imprint his own personality on the world. It has shut him away from his friends, and made him share his space, time and toys with a two-year-old.When he’s good, we give our son total control over our smart TV, and tell him he can watch whatever he likes on YouTube Kids – providing he spells out the search terms himself. As a result, our son is much happier about sharing with his brother, and – as his teacher noticed during his Google Classroom sessions – his spelling is improving. I just hope she doesn’t read this and figure out why.I don’t like to imagine how we’d cope without access to YouTube Kids, but I very much expect it would involve me spraying myself blue like Sonic and running around the house as fast as I could, until I keeled over.Socialising our toddlerAlthough our younger son’s nursery has ostensibly closed for the time being, its staff are still diligently posting videos to its Facebook page so that the kids can have dance sessions, storytime, and music lessons. When our toddler isn’t watching these raptly, he is video chatting with one of his classmates. This involves each child holding up random toys to the camera and shouting non-sequiturs over each other. Are they even communicating? Barely. Is it reminiscent of a real-life playdate? Totally.Indulging our interestsAt the end of our long day, when the children are in bed and the work laptops finally closed, my husband and I wearily crack open a beer, catch up with a friend over our own video chat, and then – because we’re determined to remain relevant, and maintain our identities as people and not just parents – flip on a streaming service and settle down to watch whichever prestige drama is trending. We will last precisely four scenes and half a beer before conking out, of course. But I guess there are some things even wireless broadband can’t give you.What it has done, though, is keep us sane for two months of social isolation. So, honestly, if broadband were a person, and this wasn’t a transgression of social distancing convention, I’d give it a giant hug of gratitude.Vodafone #KeepingTheUKConnectedWorking from home and looking after children at the same time will leave you crazily busy, but with a strong broadband connection it might actually be doable.That’s why every day, we at Vodafone are working hard to maintain our network.

Here are expert tips for how to get it organised – and what you should never put in thereDo not feel guilty if you neglect your freezer. It happens to the best of us. “I don’t think I cleaned ours at home in a year until lockdown,” confesses Nina Matsunaga, the chef-owner at the Black Bull Inn in Sedbergh, Cumbria. “We do our work freezer every couple of days.”You can work productively with whatever you have, from giant chest freezers to single compartments in small fridges. All sub-zero space is useful. But how many of us know how best to utilise what in her book The Ice Kitchen Shivi Ramoutar describes as an “unfashionable” preservation method? What freezes well? What doesn’t? How do you manage those icy depths? We asked the experts.Freezing produces structurally damaging ice-crystals. Slow freezing produces bigger crystals. Therefore, “drier” ingredients freeze best. Peas thrive at -18C, while berry fruits turn to mush as they defrost. If you are making jam that is fine but freezing can ruin less flexible foods.For instance, the Michelin-starred chef Tom Kerridge, owner of the Butcher’s Tap butcher in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, warns against freezing prime cuts – even high-grade, dry-aged beef – and particularly cheaper, watery steaks: “The muscle fibres get stretched and when it defrosts water comes out and that steak’s juiciness becomes insipid. You’ve broken its body.”Exposed to freezing air, loosely wrapped foods become dry, icy and corroded – so-called “freezer burn”. To avoid that, place food in reusable silicone pouches or heavy plastic food bags, push as much air out as you can, and seal. Freeze each pack laid flat at first to minimise ice crystals. “Flat surface areas freeze quicker,” says Dan McGeorge, the head chef at Rothay Manor, Cumbria, which also allows you to arrange your freezer like a filing cabinet.We tend to dump stuff in freezers where it sits for years, unlabelled and unidentifiable. Avoid that by labelling your flattish packs of rice, soups, sauces, shredded meat, chopped vegetables etc top right and storing them upright in a freezer drawer like files, rotating the oldest to the front. “You just riffle through to find the right pack and pull it out,” says Lulu Grimes, the managing editor of BBC Good Food.Ramoutar’s labels include the date the food was frozen (her general rule is to use everything within three to six months) and: “How I reheat it, so H for hob, O for oven, a temperature and time.” You can buy special freezer labels, but paper, pen and sticky tape works. Avoid washable markers that rub off easily.Tip! From bacon rashers to egg whites, portion food into identifiable, user-friendly quantities. “Don’t freeze berries, sausages or meatballs in blocks,” advises Si Toft, the chef-owner at the the Dining Room in Abersoch, Gwynedd. “Lay them on greaseproof paper, freeze for two hours, then bag them and take out inidual handfuls.”Very little gets a flat no. Defrosted boiled eggs and raw potatoes are grim, however, and raw egg yolks go rubbery. “Whisk them slightly and add a stabiliser – salt or sugar, depending on what you’re doing with them,” suggests Ramoutar.Generally, this is a question of preparation and end use. Can you be bothered to protect a food’s textural integrity and will that matter? Deseeded, salted, sliced, rinsed, dried and frozen cucumber makes lovely crunchy batons for dips, but that is a lot of graft. Conversely, soft herbs that turn into dark mulch as they defrost taste fine in soups and sauces – as do finely chopped vegetables. Large pieces of raw vegetable become spongy in the freezer, which will not enhance your Sunday roast. Cook before freezing for a better result.Broadly, if you are going to blitz it later, if you just need the flavour and not the mouthfeel, you can freeze anything. But blanching soft herbs and vegetables – submerge briefly in boiling water, plunge them into ice, dry them thoroughly – helps to retain colour and flavour.Milk, yes. Cheese is complicated. “I don’t recommend it,” says Dan Bliss of the cheesemonger Paxton \u0026amp Whitfield. “The moisture and fat splits. Defrosted cheese has a weird texture. But avoiding food waste is close to my heart. Hard, mature cheeses and firm blues freeze better – they are fine in a toastie, and you get amazing pockets of molten cheese in scones when you add grated frozen cheese to the mix. With soft cheeses, make lasagne or sauces and freeze those.”Historically, “fresh” fish was regularly frozen at sea and defrosted for sale, which meant you could not freeze it at home without cooking it first (on the basis that you should not refreeze defrosted food). That is no longer always true. Ask your fishmonger for guidance or check the label, which may explain: “This product was previously frozen and has been restored to chill temperature under carefully controlled conditions. It is still suitable for home freezing.”Molnar dislikes freezing seafood – although, interestingly, freezing helps to tenderise fresh squid and octopus – but, carefully separated and wrapped, scallops work well: “Stacked like a packet of Rolos.”If you want them to look great, yes. If you just need flavour, no. Soft herbs can be blitzed and frozen in cream or oil, and you don’t need to carry a vast array of fresh spices to make curry. “I freeze whole spices to keep them fresh: tamarind paste, curry leaves, blitzed ginger, garlic and whole fresh turmeric, which I grate when needed,” says Sumayya Usmani, a Pakistani food expert and owner of Glasgow’s Kaleyard Cook School.Ramoutar makes no-cook, soft-set freezer jam (“Blitz fruit, sugar and a little citrus and pop it in”) and Carl Clarke, the chef-founder at Chick ‘n’ Sours, London, creates instant ice-cream by freezing, for example, bananas, dark chocolate, peanut butter and coconut yoghurt and combining them in a powerful, Nutribullet-style blender.“Professionally, I’m not keen,” says Kerridge. Indeed, most chefs use the freezer as a tool for meat rather than for storage. If you want perfectly cubed pancetta or incredibly thin beef for carpaccio, firm the meat by freezing it for 30 minutes, then slice it. James Cochran, the head chef at 12:51 restaurant in London, uses a Microplane to grate frozen beef on to poached eggs (“like fancy tartare”) and bone marrow into mash, “like parmesan, to add umami”.Kerridge is more open to freezing meat at home – “cured meats work fine” – and in braises, curries or stews, where the sauce is the main flavour, it will be impossible to detect if the beef shin, ham hock or chicken breasts used were frozen. “Packet chicken breasts are just protein which takes on the flavour of whatever they are cooked in,” he says.It certainly lends itself to cool hacks (sorry). Chilling layers of a celebration cake makes them less fragile as you trim and level them, but also, says Rachel Stockley, the head chef at Baratxuri in Ramsbottom, Bury, if you freeze the icing as you complete each layer it produces a smooth, hard finish, so the cake “sits in those even layers the pros get”. After glazing sausage rolls and pies, Andy Waugh, of Mac and Wild, London, freezes them for 30 minutes and repeats that before cooking: “It gives you an extra-lush finish.” The freezer will even save wedges of dry fruit cake, advises Scott Paton, the head chef at Boringdon Hall, Devon: “The fruit plumps up and makes the cake moist.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/caa313ea1c48ebd22686fbc34e8809b4dd8eb515/0_0_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=257c2b4949ea0c07fab9a943a60c1770","title":"bbc four presenters rally to save channel amid closure rumours","story":"Lucy Worsley and Waldemar Januszczak are among those to have taken to social mediaBBC Four presenters are rallying to save the arts and culture channel which is rumoured to be facing closure as the corporation looks to cut costs and invest in younger audiences.Presenters including Lucy Worsley, art historian Dr James Fox, Oxford historian Dr Janina Ramirez and Waldemar Januszczak have taken to social media to campaign against widespread rumours that it could be shut as a TV channel by the end of this year.BBC Four, which has an annual budget of £44m, attracts a small, niche audience of mostly older viewers to its schedule of shows, although it was responsible for creating the hit comedy The Thick Of It.Rumours that BBC Four could be under threat have been circulating for some time as the corporation has made it clear that its goal is to pursue younger audiences increasingly slipping away to rivals such as Netflix.Speculation intensified earlier this month when it was announced that Cassian Harrison, BBC Four’s long-serving controller, is to move to BBC Studios, the corporation’s commercial arm, on a nine-month attachment.“There are no plans to close BBC Four,” said a BBC spokesman.However, there are several options available as an alternative to a full closure of the channel. One option, which has been floated a number of times over the years, is to merge BBC Four with BBC Two. Another is for BBC Four to follow sister channel BBC Three and cease to exist as a TV channel, instead becoming online-only.Earlier this year it emerged that the corporation’s bosses have discussed a return to TV for BBC Three, which moved online-only in 2016 as the corporation pursued its youth audience, which could replace the slot held by BBC Four in electronic programming guides.BBC Three has flourished during the coronavirus lockdown with youth drama Normal People fueling its best week ever.The corporation is in the process of making major cost cuts to plug a huge hole in its finances, including hundreds of millions of pounds to pay for the end of free TV licences for the over-75s.In addition, the BBC has said the coronavirus will cost it £125m as door-to-door enforcement activity stops and a call centre that handles payments shut down because of the lockdown and physical distancing rules.A decade ago a vocal campaign saved radio channel BBC 6 Music from closure after the then director general Mark Thompson looked to shut it, and digital sister station BBC Asian Network, to cut costs. The campaign raised awareness of the music station, which recorded its biggest-ever weekly audience, 2.56 million listeners, in the first quarter this year."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ef97c5bb4000f3ce74faf4c047523cb5b7250236/0_155_4635_2781/master/4635.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=654b2a08cfa441f8aaddd1e390f96ed6","title":"uk scheme signs up 440000 self employed workers on first day","story":"People whose finances have been impacted by coronavirus rush to claim cash grantA government scheme to support self-employed workers signed up 440,000 people on its first day at a cost of £1.3bn, according to the Treasury.Launched this week, more than two weeks ahead of schedule, the scheme is expected to support up to 3.5 million of the UK’s 5.2 million self-employed people.The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, said: “Britain’s self-employed workers are a crucial part of our economy and will be key in our recovery – which is why we’re doing everything we can to support them.“I’m pleased to see our world-leading support scheme is already helping so many people, with more than £1.3bn claimed on the first day alone.

This was usually for becoming self employed within the last year when they needed two years of self-employment records to qualify.Others have worked as employees for a portion of the last two years and suffered deductions that mean they receive a fraction of the £7,500 maximum backdated grant.IPSE, the lobby group for consultants and self-employed workers, has campaigned for the scheme to be more flexible and include groups such as limited company contractors and the newly self-employed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c1efd4f907d2424df956a2ccf8b493d1733cdd8c/0_370_3936_2362/master/3936.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a05801c6cecc87f800840c1cdce64055","title":"paul epworth lockdown listening tony allen jazz","story":"The Oscar, Grammy and Brit-winning producer talks about his spiritual jazz quest and ‘the greatest drummer ever’, Tony AllenI’ve rediscovered Jimi Tenor and what a mercurial genius he is, including his album, Exocosmos. I don’t know that many people who have managed to forge a career in the last 20 years that is truly as good as the film score greats: he’s got that mad 60s Lalo Schifrin thing, and that Brian Wilson or Joe Meek sense of ambition. The music I’m about to release is like a 70s concept album about space, but an updated one. So going back to these really virtuoso moments has been part of the journey: rediscovering this weird and wonderful music with a combination of overt musicality and eccentric production that I find fascinating.As far as newer stuff goes, I’ve discovered 100 gecs – it’s like future mutant indie, bits of trap music, a bit of Crystal Castles or Sleigh Bells dystopian 8-bit … Super modern production but it’s quite lo-fi.The Paul Institute’s records – there’s a sense of real honest integrity to the fact that no one but Jai Paul and AK Paul could have made them. They’re part Daniele Baldelli, part Phil Collins, part J Dilla, part Bollywood film score and part D’Angelo. If you sat down with a piece of paper and said, “This is what I want my music to sound like”, you could never do it. It doesn’t feel self-conscious, and it’s effortlessly cool.I’ve been listening to Tony Allen, who died recently – possibly the greatest drummer who ever lived. I was obsessed for about 25 years with the music he made with Fela Kuti, but the newer electronic records he made with Jeff Mills, Moritz Von Oswald Trio and Motor City Drum Ensemble are all amazing, too. I would never call myself a drummer, but I have played drums on a few records people don’t know I’ve played on, like Paul McCartney’s Queenie Eye – it wasn’t on my bucket list, but I’ll take it! It takes learning a bit of drums before you realise how amazing Tony Allen was, how he changed a rhythm and feel from track to track so subtly.There are loads of players who have been inspired by him, like Yussef Dayes who I was lucky enough to play with recently. He also has his own amazing, unique style by the time he’s Tony Allen’s age, he may have had the same impact. To take it to another modern context, you could also look at the way the rap producer Mike Will Made It does hi-hat programming – it always seems to lead a rapper to the bounce of their flow. From my experience of watching people listen to a beat or a drum track, the subtleties of the hi-hat or the way the drums are played, that’s what an artist is going to use to find the melody and the rhythm. I’m some way on my journey to study it, and I still feel like I don’t know anything!I’ve spent the last few years listening to loads of spiritual jazz, obsessing over Sun Ra and discovering Alice Coltrane growing up I also listened to a lot of jazz, the Miles Davis electric stuff and Mahavishnu Orchestra. Once you go into that world, it’s infinite. People start recommending you records that don’t even exist – you have to go to some record market in Brazil to find them and they only pressed 10 copies. It feels like an adventure. The idea that music is a spiritual pursuit, a representation of an artist’s consciousness, and the idea of spirit as universe – all this really struck a chord with me, as did the infinity of possibility.The interest in jazz has reignited over the past few years more generally, from kids rediscovering musicianship as a way to push the envelope more than production. By the middle of the last decade, every production trick in the house had been used on every single record. So for musicians around the world, but particularly in LA – Thundercat, Flying Lotus, that whole Brainfeeder scene, Dorian Concept – jazz ceased being a dirty word and it was something to be nurtured and respected. The magic of playing together with a bunch of musicians who are really great, when you get that feel together and you click, it’s something you can’t put your finger on, and that in itself feels like a sort of spiritual connection. It’s like Frank Zappa said: music’s always out there, you just have to reach out and plug in."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/58f33e906e0bc799fa5e09e9b818601c4999b563/0_84_2029_1217/master/2029.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dd3040ffe83f93655bcbc95f1f8ee436","title":"the greatest uk no 1s ever no 17 kylie minogue cant get you out of my head","story":"This perfect fusion of hypnotic dance pulses with melodic majesty and is a global smash that even the anti-pop brigade can enjoyLast month, Kylie Minogue shared on Instagram a viral video of a dog, eyes closed in blissful repose, nodding along to its favourite song. The tune in question was Minogue’s 2001 classic Can’t Get You Out of My Head, a minimalist, timeless smash that, as the dog’s reaction clearly shows, affects the head as adeptly as the feet. A global No 1 that even the anti-pop brigade can enjoy, it is both the sweaty highlight of any wedding reception dancefloor and the crux of an argument in Words and Music, a gloriously verbose book by critic Paul Morley in which he calls it an example of pop’s “occasional odd shine of mind-changing art”.Written by then semi-retired pop star Cathy Dennis and the former Mud guitarist Rob Davis, it was initially offered to S Club 7. Quite rightly, their manager Simon Fuller rejected it, before it was rejected again, more surprisingly, by Sophie Ellis-Bextor. It took Kylie 20 seconds of listening to the demo for her to realise the track was special. And what an opening 20 seconds it is: straight out of the gate there is that pulsating, unnervingly timeless bass line, instantly recalling electronic pioneers such as Kraftwerk and New Order (Kylie performed the song’s bootleg mashup with Blue Monday at the Brits in 2002, arriving on a giant CD) before the chorus arrives earlier than expected on a hypnotic flurry of “la, la, las”. (Also of note: the oft-ignored meandering organ flurries that lurk behind the verses, subtly massaging the song’s forward momentum.)Preferring constant shape-shifting and delayed gratification (the title line and the “la, la, la” chorus only coalesce, brilliantly, in the song’s final 30 seconds) over traditional verse-chorus-verse structure, Can’t Get You Out of My Head is the perfect fusion of dance music’s hypnotic pulse and the melodic majesty of pop. It’s also surprisingly mid-tempo, giving it the eerie sensation of always being slightly slower than you remember it, almost as if the memories she sings about are fading.Despite the song’s near fatal brush with S Club 7, this was always a Kylie classic in the making. Blessed with the perfect pop voice, she delivers each line with just enough blank space for the listener’s own interpretations. Is it about a crush? A recent heartbreak? Does the person Minogue is singing about know about the obsession? What is the dark secret she is harbouring? Even those infamous “la, la, las” take on several functions, catalysing an irresistible earworm, a delirious, dancefloor-ready singalong moment and a distraction mechanism for the recently brokenhearted.If 2000’s more straightforward Spinning Around rightfully brought Kylie back to pop’s top table after a few years lost in indie, then Can’t Get You Out of My Head – complete with its sleek, retro-futuristic video of robotic dance moves and fashion-forward hoodies – elevated her to a new level of pop-culture ubiquity."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c28b3d7368da45026707d244fda0bd8a6734a7c6/0_0_5472_3648/master/5472.jpg?width=880\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9f93511ada212f7576784bac7ba98214 880w","title":"englands covid 19 infection rate too high for further easing experts say","story":"ONS data throws possibility of opening schools on 1 June into serious doubtMinisters and scientists are nervous about how far they will be able to ease the lockdown in England at the end of the month, as it emerged that the country needed to more than halve its daily infection rate of around 10,000 new cases a day.A new study from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) suggested that one in 400 people had the virus outside hospitals and care homes over the past two weeks, described by Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, the deputy chief medical officer for England, as “very low” circulation in the community.However, getting the daily infection rate below 5,000 – or even 4,000 – is a main factor in decision-making about lockdown-lifting measures such as opening schools and some shops from 1 June.Two senior government sources said there were still doubts about whether enough progress would be made to allow the reopening of parts of the economy or permit more social contact through the idea of “household bubbles” in the coming weeks.The ONS data, the first national snapshot of Covid-19 rates, also showed children were as likely to catch coronavirus as adults, and that frontline healthcare workers were much more likely to contract it than the general population.The Scientific Advisory Group on Emergencies (Sage) discussed expert reports on “bubbles” at a meeting on Thursday, including the New Zealand model of two households joining together to include close family, bring in caregivers, or support isolated people. Evidence from behavioural experts looked at whether it could cause discrimination, how to communicate the policy and how enforceable it would be.In relation to hitting the 1 June lockdown easing date, there remain serious worries about the prevalence of the virus in care homes and hospitals, different levels of infection throughout the country, and whether the contact-tracing and testing regime will be fully up and running. “There is still a lot of uncertainty about how far we will be able to do it,” one senior Whitehall source said.Boris Johnson said in his report on Monday that an easing of the lockdown would be conditional on enough progress being made by 1 June, but his address to the nation raised hopes that some aspects of life could get back to relative normality – albeit with physical distancing – in just two weeks’ time.One of the main deciding factors is whether the daily infection rate falls below 5,000, although some experts believe below 4,000 would be better. Another is whether the “R rate” of reproduction remains substantially below 1.Sage experts are understood to be looking to publish a range for the R rate on a more consistent basis from next week to increase transparency of the figure, which is sometimes referred to in press conferences but not regularly released.The latest estimate was 0.6 to 0.9, while research from Public Health England and the University of Cambridge suggested it was just 0.4 in London and up to 0.8 in Yorkshire and north-east England.The ONS study tested 10,705 people in more than 5,000 households and suggested about 148,000 people across the entire population would have tested positive on any day between 27 April and 10 May 2020.Experts suggest the current rates of infection remain “some way off” what would be needed to lift the lockdown.The results are likely to fuel concerns about the risk of opening primary schools on 1 June. No evidence was found of differences in the proportions testing positive between the age categories 2 to 19, 20 to 49, 50 to 69 and 70 years and over. The numbers testing positive in this first release were small – 33 in total – and so this picture could change and the figures are expected to be tracked closely over the next two weeks.Previous ONS figures suggested people working in social care in England and Wales were twice as likely to die with coronavirus as the general working-age population, but healthcare workers were no more likely to die than other workers.Paul Hunter, a professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia, said the figures show “we’re still some way off getting to a point where we can relax restrictions a lot”.The latest figures would suggest a “crude estimate” of 10,000 new cases each day, according to Hunter. However, a more accurate calculation would take into account the average number of days over which a person would test positive and other factors. The current pilot phase of the ONS survey will be rolled out to cover up to 300,000 people over the next 12 months. From now on, weekly updates will be published including regional breakdowns.Azeem Majeed, a professor of primary care at Imperial College London, said the data suggest some previous studies, based on hospital admissions, may have underestimated the rates of infection in children.“Children usually have mild symptoms and therefore may not often need medical care. The next step will be to try to determine whether children are as likely as adults to infect other people,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b25e3e19cae3ffabd28944426a032ac514f37087/72_0_1591_956/master/1591.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=66b7cc625e69d4a007d97e13f54a2fcd","title":"whats at stake in britains post brexit trade talks","story":"As EU and US negotiations continue, how many deals have been made and what proportion of UK trade do they cover?British trade negotiators have been exceptionally busy this week.

But it would also be wrong to imagine that Britain could just turn its back on Europe and conduct all its business with the US instead. The UK imports a large amount of fresh food, particularly from the Netherlands. Currently this produce can be shipped to Britain quickly and lorries carrying it pass directly through ports with minimal bureaucracy. Increased customs procedures and tariffs would make this trade more difficult, and getting fresh lettuces across the Atlantic has its own challenges.Currently, Britain’s trade with the US has a very strong services component. Trade in services (such as financial and legal services) are relatively unaffected by customs procedures or tariffs, but can be affected by mutual recognition of standards and qualifications.

Between 75 and 100 children are now receiving treatment across the country. Typical symptoms include a fever, skin rashes, red eyes, cracked lips and abdominal pain.Doctors suspected early on that coronavirus played a role in the new disorder by triggering an excessive immune reaction in the children, but there was no proof that the two were linked.The latest evidence comes from doctors in Bergamo, the city with the highest rate of coronavirus infections and deaths in Italy. Medical records at the Papa Giovanni XXIII hospital showed that since the outbreak reached Bergamo, cases of Kawasaki-like disease rose to about 10 per month compared with one every three months in the previous five years.Of 10 children treated for the disorder between mid-February and mid-April, eight tested positive for antibodies to the virus. The two negative cases may be explained by faulty test results, the doctors believe.“Our study provides the first clear evidence of a link between Sars-CoV-2 infection and this inflammatory condition, and we hope it will help doctors around the world as we try to get to grips with this unknown virus,” said Dr Lorenzo D’Antiga, director of child health at the hospital. “I have no doubt that Kawasaki disease in these patients is caused by Sars-CoV-2.”Writing in the Lancet, the medics warn that the “strong association” between the virus and the inflammatory condition should be taken into account when governments ease their lockdown restrictions. They stress, however, that the disorder is very rare, affecting no more than one in 1,000 children exposed to the virus. A fraction of these require intensive care.Dr Annalisa Gervasoni, a paediatric specialist at the hospital, said: “In our experience, only a very small proportion of children infected with Sars-CoV-2 develop symptoms of Kawasaki disease. However, it is important to understand the consequences of the virus in children, particularly as countries around the world grapple with plans to start relaxing social distancing policies.”Kawasaki disease, which overwhelmingly affects infants, causes inflammation of the blood vessels and in some cases a swelling of the heart. Swift treatment can prevent potentially lethal coronary aneurysms. The cause is not known, but studies suggest it is a post-infection inflammatory response that turns against the body.The rise in cases points to a form of Kawasaki disease that affects young schoolchildren more than infants and is triggered specifically by coronavirus. Since the first cases were reported in Britain, dozens more have emerged in the US, France, Spain, Italy and Switzerland.Health officials in Britain launched a surveillance study this week to monitor cases of the disorder, which they have tentatively named PIMS-TS, for Paediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with Sars-CoV-2.Prof Russell Viner, president of the Royal College of paediatrics and child health, said it remained the case that children were largely unaffected by Covid-19, but that surveillance for the new syndrome would shed light on who it affects, how, and what the longer-term outcomes are. “The great majority of children with this condition have been well treated and are getting better and have gone home,” he said.Dr Liz Whittaker, a clinical lecturer in paediatric infectious diseases and immunology at Imperial College London, said cases followed the curve of the coronavirus outbreak and appeared to have peaked, though she could not rule out more as restrictions are lifted. “We are not seeing many children who are really unwell with this condition,” she said. “It shouldn’t be a factor when we reopen the schools.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/41398e3a547813f5786e8c9169f947c318a1010a/516_1069_1028_616/master/1028.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e30978e0b65d3d9f996017bcdb0feb4a","title":"they know what theyre doing oxford covid 19 vaccine trial volunteer praises staff","story":"Student participant praises ‘calm professionalism’ of academics and NHS healthcare workers As one of hundreds of volunteers involved in the University of Oxford’s coronavirus vaccine trials, Dan McAteer said he had a few nerves on the day of receiving the jab itself. However, he recalled an unexpected incident from the night before.“They were well meaning, but a relative shared an online post of what was obviously a piece of fake news claiming that one of the trial participants had died,” said the 23-year-old student.“It didn’t give me pause to stop in the least, but there was a sort of weird dynamic because it was on Facebook, which had played a role in my recruitment when I saw an original callout for volunteers. In fact it emphasised why the vaccine was so important. You get a sense society is sort of fraying.”Two weeks have now passed and the fact that a vaccine for the global pandemic could be pulsing through his body (half the study participants get the Covid-19 jab and half get a control one) has largely faded to the back of his mind.Like others, he will soon have the first of monthly blood tests, but in the meantime has been taking his temperature and logging in online to record any symptoms.“It’s all very well organised and you’re given emergency contact details if needed, but by the second week you have basically just become a data point in someone else’s spreadsheet,” he said.If that sounds like a modest assessment of his role in something that could save millions of lives and allow the world to return to some semblance of normality, then he is equally self-effacing about his reasons for taking part.“I felt guilty, to be honest – aware of the privileges of youth, health, and being able to stay at home,” said McAteer, a postgraduate studying the history of science, medicine and technology at St Edmund Hall, one of the university’s colleges.“There are thousands of people out there fighting for breath, skewed dramatically by class and race. But there are also thousands of carers, nurses and doctors collapsing with exhaustion at the end of another mega-shift every day. So I thought: my brain is quite useless, maybe my body can help.”That admiration for healthcare workers also comes through in his invocation of staff he met on the day when the vaccine was administered, comparing them to the generation mustered for the war effort in 1939.He recalls feeling flattered after arriving on his bicycle when a nurse also participating in the trial mistook him for a young doctor. “No, I’m one the guinea pigs,” he replied at the time.“For an ancient university, they’ve really kicked into gear at speed. You can tell that things have been put together with urgency, but also that they know what they’re doing. There’s a particular kind of doctor who exudes a gentle, studious authority as they work. There seem to be a fair few of them around. For a small group of medics and scientists, this is like an engineer corps throwing a bridge together in a warzone: fast and methodical.”McAteer also spoke of medical students who had been enlisted to help across the NHS, encountering one who helped him with some paperwork: “I was struck by how his university life had been turned upside down even more than mine. He should have been on a rotation or cramming for exams, but had instead been deployed to Covid work for the foreseeable future.”Inside a small room – “just like any other in a doctor’s surgery” – he lay down and was given the injection by a nurse who, like him, didn’t know if it was the vaccine or the control, a well established meningitis vaccine.“She was one of those really experienced people, who have amazing skill but are also really soothing, one of those people who can just keep conversation going.”A little over an hour later, after undergoing temperature and other checks, he was on his way home, where he experienced some mild symptoms that evening in line with some of the expected common side effects of vaccines.“I had a fever, some shivering and a headache the evening of my jab, but this all cleared up within 24 hours. Nothing to fear, in my personal experience.”Life switched back to a lockdown routine at the house he shares with his girlfriend, in which the need to meet looming academic deadlines have kept boredom at bay.Like many people, their news consumption has rocketed - although interest in the evening Downing Street briefings has fallen – and he likened the national picture to “a bit of an Oxford psychodrama” involving Chris Whitty, Boris Johnson, Keir Starmer and other alumni.McAteer has also closely followed coverage of the vaccine trial: “It’s clear that the university has been very upbeat in their communications and Prof Sarah Gilbert, who is leading the project, even publicly floated the idea of being ready by September.”It’s a degree of optimism that he doesn’t quite share: “September, or October even, feels like a very optimistic scenario.” But he very much wants the vaccine to succeed.Above all, however, there’s an overarching admiration for those involved in the trial and wider efforts to tackle Covid-19: “We’re talking about people who are getting on with it with calm professionalism and compassion. Some snidely call the NHS a national religion.

Which team that will be with, beyond 2020, I don’t know yet.”Geraint Thomas and Egan Bernal, Tour champions in 2018 and 2019 respectively, have recently asserted their claims as the Ineos team’s Tour leaders while Froome, who missed last year’s Tour after a career-threatening crash, is also desperate to return to top form. He has not won a Grand Tour since the 2018 Giro d’Italia and has not won a major race for two years.“I have no intention of retiring any time soon,” Froome said. “If anything, the crash has given me a renewed focus and drive. I have worked harder than I ever have to get back to where I am. I won’t let that be for nothing.”Internal rivalries with fellow Grand Tour champions Thomas, Bernal and last year’s Giro winner Richard Carapaz have been brewing and cycling’s transfer market growing fraught as sponsors struggle to fend off the effects of the coronavirus pandemic. Froome, who will be 35 next week, may be seeking one last lucrative move before the market becomes even more pinched but may have few options. Leading the field for his signature will be Bahrain-McLaren run by the former Team Sky coach Rod Ellingworth and headed by former Sky riders Mark Cavendish, Mikel Landa and Wout Poels.The Spanish Movistar team, having shed Landa, Carapaz and the Grand Tour winner Nairo Quintana, are also in need of a rider capable of landing a Tour de France win and may have the estimated £4m a year it would take to secure Froome.Most World Tour teams are dismissive of the possibility of signing Froome. “Our transfer activity is parked,” said one, while another added: “Who has millions lying around now?”In late April Froome said that if he won a fifth Tour this summer it would be “massive”, and that it would be “one of the biggest comeback stories in sport”.Bernal’s comments a few days later may have accelerated Froome’s need for clarity over team leadership. The Colombian, more than a decade Froome’s junior, said he would not “throw away an opportunity to win another Tour de France, that’s for sure”.The rapidly growing financial crisis that has led to redundancies and pay cuts, may also have forced Froome’s hand. According to the UCI president, David Lappartient, “three, four, five teams have more problems than others. We hope they all reach the end of the season”.Team Ineos were contacted for comment but have yet to respond."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1a66e7d27898d6dcc0f4ceacbc2810ad29d74d40/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ad5b8b790b0d22681dd0c3c954b334a9","title":"review recommends change in attitude to restore trust in premiership clubs","story":"England’s leading clubs have been warned that a fundamental change in attitude is needed to restore public trust in the wake of the Saracens salary cap affair. An independent review undertaken by Lord Myners also makes a raft of significant recommendations, including stripping titles from clubs found guilty of cheating their way to silverware.Myners’s comprehensive 55-page report takes an axe to large chunks of Premiership Rugby’s existing salary cap regulations and makes clear that attempts to cherry pick from the 52 recommended improvements would further undermine faith in the competition and those administering it.Among the suggestions is that clubs could, in future, be suspended, stripped of their titles and forced to return any prize money, that marquee player exemptions should be abolished, and that players be required to produce their tax returns or bank statements if any breach of regulations is suspected. The PRL board has also beenurged to become more accountable and more transparent in how it communicates and to grant its salary cap director extended investigatory powers.It is also proposed to introduce a fit and proper test for club owners and to require the latter to sign a copy of the regulations to indicate their intention to abide by them, with potential lifetime bans for serial offenders. Random mini-audits of clubs’ books would also be introduced, with all co-investments with players banned and player loans to other clubs more strictly policed.Perhaps most striking of all is the report’s conclusion, which suggests that an insidious culture of rule-bending and legal nit-picking has become de rigeur in top-level English club administration, dating back to the decision in 2015 to brush under the carpet previous serious salary cap breaches involving Saracens and another Premiership club, widely reported to be Bath.“It is important that my recommendations should be viewed as a package of measures which, if taken together, will go a long way to restoring the integrity of the regulations,” Lord Myners wrote. “They should not be viewed as a menu of options from which to pick and choose.“If any club or other participant in professional club rugby seeks to use the legal definition of certain terminology to get around the clear intentions of these recommendations then they have entirely missed the point of this exercise and failed to learn the lesson of this painful episode. For PRL to fall short of those commitments in the pursuit of narrower interests would be detrimental to its reputation and consequently to its ability to trade at the highest commercial level possible.”The report also reveals that words like “fiasco” and “shambles” frequently cropped up in feedback from 450 iniduals and organisations who contributed to the review and that it was “overwhelmingly clear … that trust has been damaged”. Even the decision to deduct Saracens a total of 105 points to ensure relegation to the Championship in addition to a fine of £5.36m was technically flawed as it involved fellow clubs acting as judge and jury rather than independent justice being seen to be served.The recruitment of expensive marquee players is also singled out for its inflationary effect on wages across the sport. The number of players costing their clubs at least £300,000 per year has risen from five in the 2013-14 season to 99 in 2019-20, with the 24 marquee players costing their mostly loss-making clubs a total of £14m in 2019-20. Premiership Rugby’s chief executive, Darren Childs, said the clubs would now be consulted with a view to introducing a fresh set of regulations.It comes at a time when rugby is already staring into the financial abyss courtesy of the coronavirus crisis. England’s game against the Barbarians in June is the latest casualty, with the July tours certain to follow.European organisers have confirmed a revised plan to host the finals of its delayed tournament on 16-17 October and to stage a 24-team 2020-21 Champions Cup over eight weekends featuring the top eight clubs from each of the three major domestic leagues."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff1f1cf142ad2be9a00dd43913e650ca762c95dc/0_155_4288_2573/master/4288.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7c89ce0432441d46ab0ebc9aab733027","title":"bourdain buena vista social club readers travel heroes","story":"Writers, chefs and musicians have instilled a wanderlust in our readers but so, too, have heroic grandads and intrepid auntsAnthony Bourdain every time. He was not perfect, and some episodes of his TV shows are hard to watch given what we know now about his mental health struggles. But he showed the joys of travel: a drink and a chat with the table next door eating street food at the stalls with the longest queues and navigating the morals of travelling with humility and open eyes when you’re often richer than the local people. I started watching his shows in my 20s, and it was because of him that we roughed it across Morocco, landed in Mumbai with no plans, and went to the most expensive wineries we could on a shoestring in Italy (arriving sweaty on bikes – they weren’t impressed). He changed my life.Lydia TaylorAunt Linda was from humble beginnings: growing up, a holiday for her was a day trip to Weston-super-Mare. On leaving school she became a nanny. My earliest memory is of Christmas Eve when I was two, and my aunt randomly turning up on our doorstep in Birmingham, fresh off a flight from Australia. As I grew up, I would get so excited when, every few months, we’d receive a postcard from her from Jordan, the US, Germany, Lebanon, Greece or wherever. It was so exotic: no one from Erdington did that. Subsequently, I did a decent amount of travelling and have lived abroad. All because of those postcards, with their funny-looking stamps and indecipherable postmarks. I’m looking at the boomerang she gave me that Christmas. I’m 44 now. (Also, apologies Weston.)Antony TWhile I sat in my grandfather’s lap, he would spin a globe. If he’d been to where my finger landed (and he often had), he’d tell me a tale of his adventures there. As an officer in the Norwegian navy, he’d searched for lost polar explorers around Svalbard, and survived both the London blitz and numerous torpedo attacks on the convoys he led from Canada to Russia. After the war, he helped establish the Ethiopian navy and got to know the country’s emperor. He instilled in me such a wanderlust, that it has truly become the core of who I am today.Kim L’Orange SørenssenWhen Brian Keenan and John McCarthy were held hostage in Lebanon in the 1980s, they dreamed of setting up a yak farm in Patagonia. Between Extremes is the account of their real trip to Chile five years after their release. They revel in the freedom to travel the length of that erse country, bringing alive the wonders of geysers in the Atacama, Pablo Neruda’s poetry and pumas in Torres del Paine national park. I was inspired to follow them and had the best holiday of my life – stargazing in the desert, street art in Valparaiso, palafitos (stilted seaside houses) on Chiloé island, and the sight of a puma in Patagonia. Their trip was tailor-made by Journey Latin America, as was mine.Jane LawI don’t know this man. In fact, I know very little about him. I don’t know where he lives, his name or even if he is still alive. This photo was taken by my father in August 1977 in a town called Guelmim, while on a road trip around Morocco. Hanging in my father’s house, the Bedouin nomad – AKA “the blue man” – filled my inquisitive mind with daydreams of the unknown and the world outside my four walls. To this day I credit this picture with igniting my love for travel, people and culture. I sometimes wonder if it would ever be possible to meet this man on a future adventure.Elena Mura-BatesMy travel hero is Cheryl Strayed. I read her Wild: A Journey from Lost to Found during this lockdown. Her determination to stick with a journey full of uncertainties and challenges is empowering. More than the physical journey, it is her quest for discovering herself anew from the bruised past she left behind that is touching. The honesty with which she dealt with all the emotional and physical challenges left me in awe of her spirit. Her every step felt like a personal journey, and in the process I’ve found confidence to take a leap like hers after the pandemic is over.Simanta BarmanElizabeth Gilbert’s Eat, Pray, Love not only inspires the traveller in me, but also the woman in me, empowering me to live more, seek more and be open to newer experiences.

Her confidence to explore new places alone, her sheer enjoyment of relishing food, her craving to learn new languages and nuances of the cultures and her desire to rediscover herself might just remind you of everything that you have always loved about escaping and exploring.Ashiqua AhmedIt was early 2016 when I met Clifin (pictured above), a 26-year-old Keralite, on the patio of a hostel in remote Bagan, an ancient city in Myanmar. We spent the evening chatting over beers, and agreed to wake up at 5am to cycle and see the sunrise over the temple plains. On our way there, I discovered Clifin had embarked on a mammoth, overland, one-year journey from Kerala, through Bangladesh and into Myanmar. His budget? $1,000. His intention? To show dedication was more important than money. A few years later, he cycled from Dubai to Moscow for the World Cup.

We agreed that this decision would be in the best interests of the committee and will be effective at the end of the day tomorrow,” at statement from McConnell said.Burr’s phone was seized by the FBI on Wednesday night, when investigators served him a warrant at his Washington home amid an ongoing investigation into whether he engaged in insider trading.Burr previously denied he had kept the public in the dark about the scale of the threat of coronavirus and also denied insider trading, saying he was relying on publicly available information when he dumped stock as the pandemic hit the US.Burr and his wife sold between around $628,000 and $1.7m in more than 30 separate transactions in late January and mid-February.Burr faced calls for his resignation when the news emerged in late March. Burr denied any impropriety and called for an ethics investigation on Capitol Hill in order to establish his innocence.Several of the stocks he and his wife sold were in companies that own hotels and followed senators receiving confidential briefings on the seriousness of the approaching pandemic even as the public was not yet fully aware of what was about to hit the US. More than 80,000 Americans died of Covid-19 between 11 March and 11 May, and the death toll continues to rise.Burr said in late March: “I relied solely on public news reports to guide my decision on the sale of stocks February 13,” he said in a statement.He told reporters at the US Capitol on Thursday he decided to step aside because he did not want the investigation to distract the intelligence committee from its work. “I thought this was the best thing to do,” Burr said.The warrant marked a significant step-up in the investigation.Donald Trump said, as he departed the White House for a visit to Pennsylvania, that he did not know anything about Burr’s decision, but added: “That’s too bad.”A senior justice department official said the FBI did not conduct a raid, but paid a visit to Burr’s home to collect his cellphone. Approval of the warrant – a significant development because it was served on a sitting senator – was obtained at the “highest levels” of the justice department, the official said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dfef76e42da6298d528fb31c11e6361facff69f7/0_1_4981_2989/master/4981.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8b7f41c0deffe24243d2ee99dc2404ad","title":"are you planning to return to your workplace on wednesday","story":"If you’re preparing to go back to work – away from home – we’d like to hear from you.

Experts suggest the current rates of infection remain “some way off” what would be needed to lift the lockdown.The results are likely to fuel concerns about the potential of opening primary schools on 1 June to fuel transmission in the community, as no evidence was found of differences in the proportions testing positive between the age categories 2 to 19, 20 to 49, 50 to 69 and 70 years and over. The numbers testing positive in this first release were small – 33 in total – and so this picture could change and the figures are expected to be tracked closely over the next two weeks.The figures do not include people in hospital or care homes where rates of Covid-19 infection – and possibly transmission – are likely to be higher.The World Health Organization (WHO) guidance on face masks has remained consistent during the coronavirus pandemic. It has stuck to the line that masks are for healthcare workers – not the public.\u0026nbsp“Wearing a medical mask is one of the prevention measures that can limit the spread of certain respiratory viral diseases, including Covid-19. However, the use of a mask alone is insufficient to provide an adequate level of protection, and other measures should also be adopted,” the WHO has stated.Nevertheless, as some countries have eased lockdown conditions, they have been making it mandatory to wear face coverings outside, as a way of trying to inhibit spread of the virus. This is in the belief that the face covering will prevent people who cough and sneeze ejecting the virus any great distance.\u0026nbspThere is no robust scientific evidence – in the form of trials – that ordinary masks block the virus from infecting people who wear them. There is also concerns the public will not understand how to use a mask properly, and may get infected if they come into contact with the virus when they take it off and then touch their faces.Also underlying the WHO’s concerns is the shortage of high-quality protective masks for frontline healthcare workers.Nevertheless, masks do have a role when used by people who are already infected. It is accepted that they can block transmission to other people. Given that many people with Covid-19 do not show any symptoms for the first days after they are infected, masks clearly have a potential role to play, especially on crowded public transport as people return to work..Paul Hunter, professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia, said the figures show that “we’re still some way off getting to a point where we can relax restrictions a lot”.Sources close to Downing Street say the target for new daily infections is 5,000 before the lockdown can ease, but other more cautious voices in government are understood to be pushing for fewer than 4,000 new cases a day. There is scepticism within the government that the UK will have reached that figure before 1 June, the first possible date for easing the lockdown.The latest figures would suggest a “crude estimate” of 10,000 new cases each day, according to Hunter. However, a more accurate calculation would take into account the average number of days over which a person would test positive and other factors. And unlike the target of 5,000 cases each day, the latest ONS figures exclude hospital patients, meaning the ONS infection rate is a slight underestimate. So it is difficult to assess from the ONS data how far we are from the 5,000 target.The ONS survey is expected to give a clearer picture of the country’s trajectory as the current pilot phase of the survey is rolled out to cover up to 300,000 people over the next 12 months. From now on, weekly updates will be published, designed to provide a rolling estimate of current infection levels and community transmission rates.Future updates are also expected to give regional breakdowns, which could highlight hotspots for infection, as well as the results of antibody testing, showing how many people have been infected in the past.Azeem Majeed, professor of primary care at Imperial College London, said the data suggested some previous studies, based on hospital admissions, might have underestimated the rates of infection in children. “The ONS data suggests that these studies did not reflect the true rate of infection in children because they were focused on the sickest patients,” he said. “Children usually have mild symptoms and therefore may not often need medical care. The next step will be to try to determine whether children are as likely as adults to infect other people.”The result does not give a direct measurement of R, the effective reproduction number of the virus, which tells us whether the country is on an exponentially increasing trajectory or whether infection numbers are on the way down. The current number is a snapshot, while R is about the gradient of the curve and is calculated using the current infection rates and other data such as hospital admissions, serology surveys of past infection and behavioural contact surveys."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/901de7d5f655afd0cdd837c7ef0920f170d37890/0_87_4980_2987/master/4980.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b9296ebbccdf24962e886469d071932b","title":"burundi expels who coronavirus team as election approaches","story":"Official says health minister has accused UN agency of ‘unacceptable interference’Burundi has ordered the expulsion of the World Health Organization’s (WHO) expert team backing the country’s response to the coronavirus pandemic, just days before the country’s elections.The foreign ministry, in a letter to WHO Africa headquarters and seen by AFP on Wednesday, said the UN agency’s representative in Burundi and his three colleagues “are declared persona non grata and as such, must leave the territory of Burundi” by Friday.The directive, dated 12 May, expels the WHO’s top official in Burundi, Dr Walter Kazadi Mulombo the country’s coronavirus coordinator, Dr Jean Pierre Mulunda Nkata communicable diseases head, Dr Ruhana Mirindi Bisimwa, and a laboratory expert in the testing for Covid-19, Prof Daniel Tarzy.“Late yesterday afternoon I was made aware through a note verbale about this decision of the government of Burundi which has asked our WHO representative and three other persons, one of whom is a consultant … to leave the country immediately,” the WHO Africa director, Dr Matshidiso Moeti, said on Thursday.“We are in communication with the government of Burundi to clarify and understand the reasoning behind this decision they have taken. We are in the meantime then working to organise the departure of our staff.”The letter does not provide a reason for the decision. Diplomatic and administrative sources said the foreign ministry aborted a similar attempt to expel the same four officials a month ago.“They are expelled and the health minister has totally excluded WHO, accusing it of unacceptable interference in its management of the coronavirus,” a Burundian official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.The Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention described the move as “unfortunate” at a time when greater cooperation was needed to tackle the virus on the continent.“We are in dire need of technical expertise as a continent, which has a very weak health system and fragile infrastructure, where we don’t have the luxury of kicking out WHO,” its director, John Nkengasong, said.Meanwhile the UN commission of inquiry on Burundi, tasked by the Human Rights Council to investigate alleged violations and abuses in the country since 2015, said in a statement that it “deeply regretted” the decision.The announcement comes just days before Burundians go to the polls on 20 May to choose a new president, parliamentarians and local officials.The country has officially recorded 27 cases and one death from the coronavirus.But it has taken few precautions against the disease and the rate of testing is low, fuelling concern that the true extent of the outbreak is not known.A health ministry official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said seven patients had gone to hospital at one institution with symptoms such as respiratory distress and had not been tested and that “a whole wing has been dedicated to them at the military hospital”.Meanwhile a doctor, also seeking anonymity, reported six deaths of patients “presenting all the symptoms of coronavirus” last week.A resident of Gitega, the capital, recounted that her neighbour, who had a fever and respiratory problems, was refused a test.“This man was 65 years old and died at home last week,” she said.The National Institute of Public Health, the only place carrying out tests, has had six of its staff responsible for taking samples fall sick with the virus.“Since then all activity is paralysed, no test can be carried out, it is a catastrophe,” an employee of the institute confirmed, on condition of anonymity.Rights groups say the government is pressing ahead with the vote no matter the cost, and accuses the ruling party and its youth wing of crushing dissent and threatening those taking their own measures against coronavirus.Huge political rallies have been held across the country, drawing tens of thousands of supporters together in mass gatherings that have been banned in other parts of Africa and around the word.Nkengasong warned such congregations were an opportunity for the coronavirus to spread far and wide.“We’ve seen that in countries where they’ve gone ahead and conducted elections, or where they’ve enabled people to come together in a political rally, the cases have increased,” he said.Officials in Burundi have cited ine protection for the country’s ostensibly low infection rate and urged citizens to go about their daily lives without fear.“Do not be afraid. God loves Burundi and if there are people who have tested positive, it is so that God may manifest his power in Burundi,” said Gen Evariste Ndayishimiye, the presidential candidate for the ruling CNDD-FDD party."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fe6629053717057bfb1a9db6544f438b67a39cb4/0_273_4096_2458/master/4096.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5b9ea18916a1c98d114cc3163d9705c5","title":"catholic churches should be allowed to reopen before others england wales coronavirus","story":"Head of church in England and Wales cites styles of worship in argument for early reopeningCatholic churches should be allowed to reopen before Pentecostal churches, or mosques owing to their different styles of worship, the leader of the Catholic church in England and Wales has said.Places of worship come under step three of the government’s recovery strategy, meaning they cannot open until 4 July at the earliest.But Cardinal Vincent Nichols, the archbishop of Westminster, said Catholic churches should be allowed to open for private prayer by iniduals before places of worship in which large numbers of people gather.Speaking on Radio 4’s Today programme on Thursday, Nichols said: “The issues of how people are able to practice their faith are profound and sensitive, and we’d like a bit more sensitivity from the government.”The Catholic church has been creative in moving mass and other services online since the lockdown. “But there is a big, big feeling in the religious communities of wanting to get back to a fuller practice of their faith as long as we can do it safely,” he said.“I’d like to see churches available for people to go and kneel and say their prayers privately, inidually and it would mean a routine of supervision, a routine of social distancing, a routine of cleansing – and all of that we believe we can do.”The government taskforce on reopening places of worship, which meets for the first time on Friday, “needs an understanding that what goes on in places of worship is quite different from one to another”, said Nichols. “A personal, inidual prayer in a Catholic church is not something that is much done in Pentecostal churches which tend to concentrate on big gatherings. It’s not what’s done in mosques, where people pray side by side. So we need a bit of differentiated thinking.“If I could use the analogy of sport. At the moment, it’s OK to play tennis with your family. In a bit, it will be OK to have a kick around with your mates in the park. It will be quite a time before we can go to formal football matches.

The World Health Organization later said one case was of a Rohingya man and the other was of a local man who lived near the camp and was being treated at a clinic inside the area.“One patient is from the refugee population and the other one from the surrounding host population,” said Catalin Bercaru, a WHO spokesman.Bercaru said rapid investigation teams were being deployed to follow up on the two cases.

Gantz agreed to the request, the two sides said.Under the power-sharing agreement, Netanyahu, currently interim leader, will remain in the role for 18 months before handing over to Gantz, a former army chief, for the remainder of a three-year term.The deal envisions a huge 32-minister cabinet, which will rise to 36 members in six months – the largest in the country’s history – in part to accommodate the demands of multiple ergent parties within the coalition who have little in common.Netanyahu’s Likud and Gantz’s Blue and White parties released the joint policy principles of the new government on Wednesday, stating they would initially form an emergency cabinet to deal with the coronavirus crisis before moving on to different matters.Despite fighting three brutal elections within the space of a year, as well as multiple failed attempts to reach a compromise, the two men agreed a deal last month.Gantz, who entered politics two years ago primarily on the promise to oust Netanyahu, argued the pandemic and the urgent need to end the political crisis meant it was time to put “personal scores aside”. Without a fully functioning government, Israel has been unable to pass a budget.While he managed to break the stalemate, Gantz saw his Blue and White party break apart with resentment that he had joined its nemesis, Netanyahu, who faces three damning criminal corruption cases.For Netanyahu, Israel’s longest-serving leader, the deal was a stunning turnaround after he appeared to be flagging in recent weeks under the strain of the charges, which he denies. He is now likely to remain in office throughout his upcoming corruption trial.Gantz will serve as defence minister before taking over as prime minister in November 2021.Writing in the country’s top-selling newspaper, Yedioth Ahronoth, columnist Ben-Dror Yemini, said the new administration was “a far cry from being what most Israelis would consider to be their dream government”.“It is inflated, it is wasteful, and it’s unclear if it has any ideology,” he wrote, before adding further down: “Nevertheless, we must wish this government success.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8d5df3e244753a3ea2aaca82916f5d22aff19d90/1_0_4997_3000/master/4997.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=994a8c69da4157123d1eb90546595ab9","title":"mutual aid coronavirus pandemic rebecca solnit","story":"Amid this unfolding disaster, we have seen countless acts of kindness and solidarity. It’s this spirit of generosity that will help guide us out of this crisis and into a better future. By  Rebecca SolnitPeople behaving badly is a staple of the news, and the pandemic has given us plenty of lurid snapshots. In the US alone, we have seen protesters with guns in Michigan’s capital demanding an end to lockdown, anti-vaxxer women in a frenzy at California’s capitol, opportunists stockpiling hand sanitiser to resell for profit.One of the biggest cliches about disasters is that they reveal civilisation as a thin veneer, beneath which lies brutal human nature. From this perspective, the best we can hope for from most people under crisis is selfish indifference at worst, they will swiftly turn to violence. Our worst instincts must be repressed. This becomes a justification for authoritarianism and heavy-handed policing.But studies of historical disasters have shown that this is not how most people actually behave. There are nearly always selfish and destructive people, and they are often in power, because we have created systems that reward that kind of personality and those principles. But the great majority of people in ordinary disasters behave in ways that are anything but selfish, and if we’re stuck with veneer as a metaphor, then it peels off to reveal a lot of creative and generous altruism and brilliant grassroots organising. With the global pandemic, these empathic urges and actions are wider and deeper and more consequential than ever.A dozen years ago, the term “mutual aid” was, as far as I can tell, used mostly by anarchists and scholars. Somehow it has migrated into general usage in recent years and now, in the midst of the pandemic, it is everywhere. Mutual aid has generally meant aid offered in a spirit of solidarity and reciprocity, often coming from within struggling communities, empowering those aided, and with an eye towards liberation and social change. Generally it meant volunteer coalitions doing work such as rebuilding or food distribution or supporting resistance camps. One of the most striking aspects of this global crisis is how many forms of aid and solidarity there are. These new forms of generosity we are seeing – organising, networks, projects, donations, support and outreach – are numerous beyond counting, a superbloom of altruistic engagement.This work has been made more difficult by the great withdrawal – the empty schools, shops, streets and offices. And that withdrawal is itself altruism in action – a withdrawal carried out by billions for the benefit of their communities, as well as their own safety. In the initial phase, we withdrew from the spaces we share out of solidarity: we moved apart to come together. We intentionally produced, in the form of business and school shutdowns and staying home, an unprecedented economic calamity as an alternative to accepting mass death.In March, many small business owners and service workers in the US willingly shut down their enterprises, and thereby their livelihood, even before the official orders came. In April, 50 restaurant owners in the Atlanta area publicly rejected the Georgia governor’s invitation to reopen. Together they took out an ad in a local newspaper and wrote: “We agree that it’s in the best interest of our employees, our guests, our community and our industry to keep our dining rooms closed at this time.”For some, staying home may be a strain, but for others it means financial ruin. Sacrificing your own financial security for the common good was a solemn commitment that people made across the world. It was one of the things that made this crisis distinct: how often refraining, not doing, not going anywhere, not continuing activities, was also an act of public-spirited generosity. This is willing sacrifice for the public good. But people have been doing more than that.In March, the UK’s National Health Service called for 250,000 volunteers to sign up to help seniors, people who were isolating and medical staff who needed deliveries. More than three times that many signed up. Appreciation for the NHS grew even stronger, and the widespread weekly rounds of applause for its workers became one of the welcome interruptions of isolation. In mid-March, a website was launched listing several hundred new mutual aid groups across the country, so people could search their local area.A few weeks ago, I heard someone complain that Lexington, Kentucky, had four mutual aid groups – they were concerned that so many volunteers would be redundant I was awestruck by the abundance. In the course of writing this piece, I looked at various new mutual aid projects: meal deliveries to the elderly in Paterson, New Jersey the Twin Cities Queer and Trans Mutual Aid group in Minneapolis-Saint Paul projects to aid the Hopi, Zuni and Navajo on reservations in the US south-west a Washington state project to support the undocumented sex workers organising to raise emergency funds.I saw people stuck at home in isolation teach dance and drawing classes, tell stories, play music online to encourage others quarantining in place Italians singing together from their balconies and Iranians reciting poetry from theirs a young native Nevadan going fishing to feed members of her Pyramid Lake Paiute tribe. Most of us have seen, or performed, one-off acts of kindness – running an errand for a frail neighbour, chalking a cheerful message on the pavement, picking up the shopping bill for the struggling couple at the checkout, donating to a fundraiser for an acquaintance who has been laid off or taken ill. But such inidual actions are not enough to address this triple catastrophe of a viral pandemic, a financial collapse and the emotional, educational and other consequences of the great withdrawal.Thus there are also people building organisations to provide broader, ongoing practical aid – such as the young people in more than a dozen US cities delivering groceries and supplies to older and immunocompromised people via a network called Zoomers to Boomers – and others organising emotional support for those who feel isolated, including the UK’s adopt-a-grandparent programme. There are new groups, projects, organisations and networks, and old ones retooling for the crisis.Fiji-based climate organiser Thelma Young-Lutunatabua told me about the return of traditional Fijian forms of equitable, cooperative food distribution to make sure no one was left out. “The way we get through this is together,” she said.Fifteen years ago, in the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, a mutual aid organisation called Common Ground Relief was founded by a handful of people inside the damaged area, including the former Black Panther Malik Rahim. (In the US, perhaps the most famous past examples of mutual aid are the Black Panther party’s 1960s-era food programmes to assuage hunger in inner-city neighbourhoods.) The group’s slogan was “solidarity not charity”, a phrase inspired by the Uruguayan writer Eduardo Galeano: “I don’t believe in charity. I believe in solidarity. Charity is so vertical. It goes from the top to the bottom. Solidarity is horizontal. It respects the other person. I have a lot to learn from other people.”As a definition of mutual aid’s ideals, “solidarity not charity” surfaces constantly today. Charity often implies that the afflicted population is powerless or incompetent to address its own needs. Sometimes, it can take away confidence and pride even as it gives tangible aid. Solidarity is, first of all, an affirmation that we are in this together, and mutual aid demonstrates that even in crisis we have strength and capacity to care for ourselves. The term comes from the anarchist philosopher Peter Kropotkin’s 1902 book Mutual Aid: a Factor of Evolution, which argues that aiding and protecting others and serving the needs of the group rather than the inidual has been essential to the survival of many species, and is evident in early and traditional human societies. In the time of coronavirus, mutual aid has been used to describe myriad new volunteer cooperative projects that have arisen in response to disaster. But the landscape of outreach is complex and varied. Take, for example, the creation and circulation of masks. There is a whole spectrum of mask economies from corrupt profiteering and outright theft – including by the US federal government – to the very different world of creative mutual aid. Many of us, myself included, have made a few masks for those we know. Others have gone into bulk production.San Francisco local government supervisor Matt Haney fundraised and organised the distribution of thousands of masks for the impoverished, densely housed – and houseless – residents of the city’s Tenderloin district, which he represents. Adriana Camarena, a lawyer from Mexico City, realised that the undocumented day labourers near her home in San Francisco’s Mission district had few supplies and little access to health information to meet the crisis. So she began making and distributing cloth masks and hand sanitiser, and giving brief educational talks to go with them.Meanwhile, the artist and art professor Stephanie Syjuco settled into mask mass production to meet the needs of people in Oakland and Berkeley, starting with masks for a group working to address food insecurity among UC Berkeley students. By late April, she had personally made 700 masks. And the Auntie Sewing Squad, founded by Los Angeles performance artist Kristina Wong, now includes more than 500 members, and has produced more than 20,000 masks, by Wong’s count.The aunties (and uncles, but mostly aunties) began by making masks for hospital workers, and then for farmworkers, people released by ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) or getting out of prison, immigrant communities and other vulnerable groups. It’s a model of decentralised, volunteer-driven organising: whoever finds a need obtains pledges from makers until the required number is reached, and the beautifully made masks are gathered and shipped to their destination. Many pay for their own materials and shipping, and donations support others. This week, the squad is sending a van full of supplies, including masks, materials and three sewing machines, to the Navajo nation, which has been hard hit by the virus. The Navajo is just one of several indigenous communities they have reached out to.The Auntie Sewing Squad even expanded to include cooking to support those who sew. “When you’ve been bent over a sewing machine for 12 hours, a nice order of pad thai is really welcome,” one auntie told me.The US mask-makers, like donors to food-distribution programmes, are in part compensating for governmental failure. Had the federal government prepared for crisis, and supported the scientific advice on how to respond to pandemics, the need for these mutual aid efforts could have been smaller. There has been much talk of the underlying health conditions that make iniduals more vulnerable to Covid-19. The US as a whole has underlying conditions – systemic racism, poverty and financial precariousness, lack of access to healthcare and the internet for rural and poor families – that have made this crisis far worse than it should have been. The old conservative argument against social programmes was that these needs should be met by inidual and independent institutions’ generosity. In unequal societies, these were never enough to meet the need.What is noteworthy for me about this crisis is that there is no clear distinction between purely volunteer- and donation-driven projects, and a host of other endeavours trying to meet the needs of the moment. There are many ways that businesses and workers are stepping up or shifting what they do and how they do it, out of altruism. A Buddhist group in Tallahassee, Florida, raised $500,000 to purchase masks from China for medical workers in their area. The jet belonging to the New England Patriots football team brought 1.2m masks directly from China to circumvent the federal government’s outbidding of Massachusetts on personal protective equipment (PPE).Elsewhere, the New York Times reported on Amish families who, as other jobs dried up, turned to mass-producing cloth masks, face shields and other PPE for the Cleveland clinic, which urgently needed them. (This, like the California government program that lets otherwise shuttered restaurants deliver meals to isolated senior citizens, is when aid becomes literally mutual, meeting needs on both sides of the interaction.) Then there’s the 43 Pennsylvania factory workers who chose to isolate themselves in their workplace for a 28-day marathon of 12-hour days, during which they produced tens of millions of pounds of polypropylene, the raw material from which a lot of PPE is made. Like the Amish, they were paid for their work, and were working in intense new ways, fuelled by social commitment, to meet an urgent need. One of the workers said: “We’ve been getting messages on social media from nurses, doctors, emergency workers, saying thank you for what we’re doing. But we want to thank them for what they did and are continuing to do. That’s what made the time we were in there go by quickly, just being able to support them.”During the final 1,000 days of the second world war, shipyard workers in the San Francisco Bay Area produced 1,000 warships – a warship a day. Something like that epic, urgent industry seems to be at work now, but outside the federal government, or any government. In early April, the Bay Area branch of the news site Hoodline reported: “On Thursday morning, two tons of rolled sheet plastic arrived at a warehouse in Alameda. By the end of the weekend, it had become 16,000 plastic face shields. That remarkable turnaround is entirely owed to self-organisation by Bay Area makers, who have transformed maker spaces, universities, fabrication shops and almost anyone with their own sewing machine, CNC machine or 3D printer into an ad-hoc corps of medical supply manufacturers.” The report called the self-organised effort involving industrial-design students and teachers a “distributed factory”. Such decentralised efforts, organised without top-down authority, are exemplary mutual aid.In April, 14 nurses and seven doctors from the same institution set off for a one-month assignment on the Navajo reservation, whose residents are facing high levels of infection. They were coordinated by the existing UCSF Heal Initiative (Health, Equity, Action and Leadership), which works with impoverished and vulnerable communities from Haiti to Nepal. Its mission statement is: “We seek to embody solidarity and contribute to the movement for global health equity led by communities themselves.” This initiative, based on the principle of “solidarity not charity”, has been working with communities under stress for six years, and will still be there when the immediate crisis is over.During “ordinary” disasters – a hurricane, an earthquake – there’s a phenomenon called volunteer convergence, whereby people eager to help gather in the impacted areas. Sometimes so many people and so much donated material shows up that they pose management problems for those at the centre of the crisis. This is not an ordinary disaster – the impacted area is all over the world, and convergence is banned – but people are showing up in many ways. Some of this work is always going on – there is always suffering and injustice to assuage, and there are always people trying to do so.Even ordinary disasters never really end. There are many ways in which Hurricane Katrina’s impact on New Orleans and other parts of the gulf coast lasted – though there are, at least, some positive aspects to this lingering impact. The Common Ground Health Clinic spun off from Common Ground Relief. Fifteen years on, it’s still delivering free medical care in the New Orleans region.The Covid-19 pandemic and economic crisis will not end – if ending means things going back to the way they were. Whatever “normal” meant on 1 January 2020, it will never return, and neither will millions of the jobs financed by the disposable income that has just dried up. It’s worth remembering that, in the past few decades, the return to 19th-century robber-baron capitalism – via the dismantling of social safety nets, and the transformation of education, healthcare and other basic human needs into for-profit schemes that served shareholders first – meant that everyday life had already become a disaster for too many billions of people before this crisis.There is a long, rough road ahead. Without radical change, the way food, shelter, medical care and education are produced and distributed will be more unfair and more devastating than before. It seems likely that conservatives will argue for brutal austerity and libertarian abandonment of the most desperate, while the rest of us are going to have to argue for some form of post-capitalism that decouples meeting basic needs from wage labour – perhaps the kind of basic income that Spain is planning to introduce.The devastating economic effect of the pandemic will make innovation essential, whether it is rethinking higher education or food distribution, or how to fund news media. The Green New Deal offers a model for how to move forward on jobs and leave fossil fuels behind as that sector founders and climate catastrophe looms. Protests in many fields – including nurses demanding PPE, and warehouse, delivery and food-service workers protesting against exploitative or unsafe working conditions – suggests that workers’ organisations may be gaining strength.I believe the generosity and solidarity in action in the present moment offers a foreshadowing of what is possible – and necessary. The basic generosity and empathy of most ordinary people should be regarded as a treasure, a light and an energy source that can drive a better society, if it is recognised and encouraged. Mostly, it’s overlooked, undermined and sabotaged. Capitalism, and its octopus arms of entertainment, advertising and marketing, endeavour to reduce us to consumers. This means making us the kind of miserable, selfish, lonely people who seek fulfllment through buying stuff, and believe in competitiveness as a basic social force. Competitiveness, that driving word behind free-market ideology, means we are rivals and there is scarcity each of us gets more by seeing that someone else gets less.Competition is the antithesis of mutual aid, which is not only a practical tool but an ideological insurrection. The fact that even in places like the US, where these competitive, isolating messages have bombarded us for at least 150 years, millions still reach out in generosity, and are still moved to meet the needs that become visible in moments such as this, is testament to something about human nature and human possibility. Those urges are strong and deep, and they can be a foundation for something different. Indeed, they often have been before, when European social welfare was built up, when US social safety nets were created, and when people self-organised on smaller scales to take care of each other.Some of that sense of urgency and shared destiny will fade away, as it often does after a disaster, but one of the important things to remember is that some of it was here before this pandemic. I sometimes think that capitalism is a catastrophe constantly being mitigated and cleaned up by mutual aid and kinship networks, by the generosity of religious and secular organisations, by the toil of human-rights lawyers and climate groups, and by the kindness of strangers. Imagine if these forces, this spirit, weren’t just the cleanup crew, but were the ones setting the agenda.What I have seen after earlier disasters is that a lot of people aspire to “go home” and “back to normal”, but some find in the moment a sense of self and a sense of connection so meaningful that something about who they were and what they did in the crisis carries forward into how they live the rest of their life. Sometimes this is as intangible as a change of priorities and habits, and a new sense of agency not uncommonly, it’s as substantial as a new coalition, a new network, a new set of policy priorities, a new political career or a decision to go into work that supports the whole. And even those who want things to get back to normal often find they are changed permanently in their sense of who they are, and what matters most.The pandemic marks the end of an era and the beginning of another – one whose harshness must be mitigated by a spirit of generosity. An artist hunched over her sewing machine, a young person delivering groceries on his bicycle, a nurse suiting up for the ICU, a doctor heading to the Navajo nation, a graduate student hip-deep in Pyramid Lake catching trout for elders, a programmer setting up a website to organise a community: the work is under way. It can be the basis for the future, if we can recognise the value of these urges and actions, recognise that things can and must change profoundly, and if we can tell other stories about who we are, what we want and what is possible.• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5d3b0bbff8852a49371c1d8e4069af26a424e3f7/0_136_4636_2783/master/4636.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0a203a598b77917a4b7b63c931397280","title":"now i can feed my children parents step help vulnerable madrid","story":"With social services overwhelmed by coronavirus crisis, a group from a primary school is filling the gap After three days of being unable to afford bread or milk for her four-year-old daughter, Carmen Morales finally knocked on a neighbour’s door to ask for help.The 40-year-old mother of three, originally from Santa Cruz in Bolivia, had been furloughed from her job as a hotel cleaner after contracting coronavirus and was at the end of her tether, and her finances.Calls to her overworked, overwhelmed social worker had gone unanswered, leaving her desperate and out of options.Although her neighbour kindly obliged with the loan of three bottles of milk and a gift of some rice, more permanent help has come not from the Spanish authorities or even charities or NGOs, but from fellow parents at her youngest daughter’s school.Aware that some people were struggling, a group of parents from the Marqués de Marcenado primary school in Arganzuela, central Madrid, sent round an anonymous survey to gauge the needs of vulnerable families. Eighteen families replied saying they needed help with food, while four said they had no income at all.Between them, members of the parents’ association and teachers have been doing what they can to help, turning cash donations into vouchers that the families can use in local shops to buy fruit, vegetables and meat.“I don’t care about myself but I was so worried and at least now I can feed my children,” says Morales. “Things would be a disaster without this help. You call the social services, but they’re completely inundated and they can’t help everyone. They always say the same thing: patience.”Almost as importantly, the school group has managed to supply Morales’s 15-year-old daughter with a tablet so she can keep up with her studies while Spain’s schools remain closed.As the pandemic bites deeper and jobs are furloughed or lost, Morales’s situation – and the response to it – is being replicated across the capital.According to the Madrid Regional Federation of Neighbourhood Associations (FRAVM), small local groups around the city are assisting more than 20,000 people who are struggling because of the Covid-19 crisis. Almost 6,200 volunteers have stepped in and 37 food pantries have opened in the past month.Many of those relying on the neighbourhood groups for food, medicine, and cleaning and hygiene products are doing so for the first time.Spain’s socialist-led coalition government has promised a €200bn (£175bn) relief package and “the greatest mobilisation of resources in Spain’s entire democratic history” to help the country deal with the socioeconomic effects of the pandemic.The next few weeks should also see the introduction of a minimum basic income scheme to help Spain’s most vulnerable families, with monthly payments of between €462 and €1,015.Beatriz Moncó, one of the parents who is coordinating the response, says such help cannot come soon enough.“All this is no more than a sticking plaster while people wait for help from the authorities,” she says. “But while the politicians argue about things and about when the universal basic income will come in, these people have nothing to eat.”There is a finite supply of vouchers for local shops, she adds. Teachers at the school have already stumped up €600 of their own money, and the other day she bought a family €25 worth of fruit and vegetables. Others simply share what their own families have.“The other night, a colleague was rung by a woman who didn’t have anything to give her family for dinner. So she said, ‘Look, come over here and you can have some of what I’m cooking’.”Pilar Molina, 47, who lives in the San Blas neighbourhood of north-east Madrid with her partner and two children, has also come to rely on the kindness of strangers.She is in a high-risk category because of her asthma and other medical conditions, her partner has not worked for two years because of neurological complaints, and one of the children has developmental problems.The €430 a month she gets in unemployment benefits for vulnerable groups leaves her with nothing once the rent and phone bills are paid, and the family are desperately struggling to cover their basic and medical needs.Twice a week, they head to a local school to pick up hot food for the four of them.“They do really nice, ready-cooked meals, like beans and rice and meat stews,” says Molina, who was born and bred in Madrid.“It means a lot to me because I can’t afford it with everything else I have to pay for. Other people also help out so we can buy things.”Molina has known tough times before – she has been evicted and the memories of the 2008 financial crisis are still raw in her mind – but is not one for self-pity.“I try to look after the boys as best I can. I’m a normal person and we’re a family unit. This is just the way my life is.”Still, she adds, that life would be a little easier if she had the money to buy pants and socks for her eldest son, and if the politicians would take a break from their habitual blame game.“I wish they’d stop going for each other’s throats and would just knuckle down to the job in hand so that I – and so many other people like me – can have a plate of food,” she says.“If they ever found themselves in our situation, which is something I wouldn’t wish on anyone, I don’t think they’d look the other way.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd496d34b734ad21be7ca1455f95ca6acb529359/0_241_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=4fe149f672a2f7bb1b087b6598605f71","title":"what are your new rights during englands lockdown","story":"The new laws have become increasingly complex as restrictions start to ease Off to play tennis or purchase fresh dahlias? Changes to emergency health protection regulations have significantly altered the laws restricting our ability to leave home and travel during the coronavirus crisis.Although more permissive than the first versions, the new laws have become increasingly complex as lockdown begins to ease and devolved governments devise their own legislation.The initial emergency powers were contained in the Coronavirus Act and the 2020 Health Protection Regulations.Under the government’s amended health regulations in England, the list of “reasonable excuses” for leaving home has been extended. It now includes taking exercise with your household or “one member of another household”.Public open spaces can be visited in similar company to promote “physical or mental health or emotional wellbeing”. Trips to estate agents and to view properties are now permissible, as are visits to waste or recycling centres, garden centres and outdoor sports courts.Those categories are in addition to the already allowed activities of obtaining food and medical supplies, seeking medical assistance and providing care to a vulnerable person.It is also permitted to attend a funeral of a close family member, “move house where reasonably necessary” and keep up any existing arrangements for access between separated parents and children. Travel for the purposes of work where it cannot be carried out from home is also legal, as is the provision of voluntary services.As the pandemic crisis continues there have been an efforts to make government guidance – as articulated by ministers and public health officials – align more closely with the underlying law.There is nothing in the English regulations about social distancing. Revised police advice issued by the College of Policing and National Police Chiefs’ Council makes that clear: “Officers should only enforce the Health Protection Regulations – government guidance is not enforceable, for example two-metre distancing, avoiding public transport or the wearing of face coverings in enclosed spaces.”The amended Welsh regulations do, however, specify that social distancing of two metres must be observed between people from different households. Because they are new, there has been concern that courts, police and prosecutors do not understand the emergency laws. The Crown Prosecution Service is examining all charges in relation to Covid-19 to ensure there have been no miscarriages of justice.Fines for failure to comply have risen significantly. Fixed penalty notices, which were previously £60, are now £100 (£50 if paid within 14 days). For subsequent penalty notices, fines can rise to as high as £3,200. Those who do not pay can be taken to court.Anyone who feels they have been fined inappropriately can contest it. Courtroom challenges are likely to see police interpretations of the law questioned.The amended regulations, made under the executive’s powers to create statutory instruments, have not yet been scrutinised by MPs or peers. The initial version of the regulations were only debated by parliament the day before they were replaced by the current laws.“Instead of narrowing those sweeping powers, the government is ramping up fines for falling foul of the lockdown … This pandemic is a public health crisis – not a criminal justice issue.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2026a0da1339013c83d70aea837ea4969c89beb5/0_114_1024_614/master/1024.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=34b027c44ce4d11736135f454adac661","title":"why should you cry ghanas dancing pallbearers find new fame during covid 19","story":"Benjamin Aidoo, the group’s leader, wants to teach the world to hold joyful funerals, and is planning to expand his business across the globeThe Nana Otafrija pallbearers might look slick, but they are not afraid to get dirty. Their signature moves, carried out with a coffin in tow, include dropping to all-fours and crawling in unison or lying on their backs, the coffin balanced on top of them, legs moving in time to the music – as though they have been crushed by the casket.The dancing pallbearers first became famous in 2017 when their so-called “coffin dance” featured in a BBC documentary. Then, someone added an EDM track and a meme was born: footage of the dancers was spliced with botched feats of strength and other accidents and posted all over the internet.Now, the coronavirus pandemic has transformed their performance into a way to warn people of the dangers of ignoring social distancing.In India, policemen dressed in uniform danced along to the track while carrying a (healthy) man on a stretcher. In Peru, police dressed in riot gear did the same, with a mock coffin.The dance has even been used by protesters mourning the economy in Lebanon: in Beirut men dressed as the pallbearers marched a mock coffin decorated with the fast-depreciating Lebanese Lira down the streets.Fans can buy miniatures of the Nana Otafrija dancers from Hong Kong, or go to a Taiwanese bar where drinks are served by pallbearers. There’s also a video game-inspired version, where Mario dies and the pallbearers appear in pixellated form, moving in time to chiptune.Benjamin Aidoo, the lead pallbearer, lists the Mario version among his favourites. His dancers have also taken it upon themselves to warn the public about the dangers of ignoring social distancing measures, with the help of a new slogan: “Stay at home or dance with us”.Speaking from his home in Accra, Aidoo told the  that he started working as a pallbearer while in high school in 2003. He came up with the idea of dancing with the coffin because he wanted people to be able to celebrate their dead. He also noticed that people would often grow so upset at their solemn funerals that they would faint or injure themselves. If they could focus on the dancing, he reasoned, they would be less likely to get hurt.Once the pandemic is over, Aidoo hopes to teach people around the world to hold uplifting funerals.“Most people love the display”, said Aidoo, “because they want to be happy.” When people’s parents die, for example, “You know what your mom and dad did for you,” said Aidoo. “Why should you cry?”“When you know the life that he or she spent before dying, I think it’s a great thing for you to celebrate.”Things changed for Aidoo’s business when the family of a member of parliament who had died hired Aidoo and his fellow pallbearers – but insisted they wear all-white, matching outfits. The MP’s family paid for the outfits and the funeral celebration went so well that they tipped handsomely, too.“That was the first time I ever saw a $100 bill,” said Aidoo.After that, he said, “I had a vision for what I am doing.” Aidoo now employs about 100 staff: 95 men and five women. Two of the women are lead pallbearers, like Aidoo: they march in front of the coffin with a cane – decorated with the Ghanaian flag – and top hat.Aidoo has also recently hired a manager and together the pair are trying to build a global brand. Asked how the coronavirus pandemic is affecting his business in Ghana, Aidoo explained that funerals are now restricted to 25 people – including pallbearers – and are sombre affairs. There’s no singing and dancing – so some people are keeping their loved ones’ bodies in the morgue until restrictions are lifted and they’re able to hold a large burial, with his dancers.Once the pandemic is over he hopes to travel and to open branches of his pallbearing business in other countries, where people will be able to hire Adioo-style coffin dancers.He urged his fans to “Stay safe, stay alive, respect the rules and regulations given to them.”“One day we will surely get there. This pandemic will be over and then we’ll all meet.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a3c1c1d7ad3459d4227fe5ad0cf8fdd2dcb216d6/1863_547_2400_1440/master/2400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=84a7c087f96ec237590b3a4fa15b7cf3","title":"tokyos state of emergency in pictures","story":"As Japan considers lifting state-of-emergency conditions in many regions this week and the country inches towards a gradual return of economic activity, photographer Dai Kurokawa looks at life in the capital"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4253644.1589472089!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"is it safe to reopen schools other european countries are finding out","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSchoolchildren, some wearing masks, attend a class in a school of Strasbourg,  France on Thursday. Photograph:Jean-Francois BadiasAPAcross Europe, millions of children are returning to classrooms for the first time in months to schools which are radically transformed by strict hygiene and distancing rules.There is a patchwork of approaches, creating a huge testing ground for how to safely operate institutions which are so central to the resumption of public life.Just how our neighbouring countries manage the return of pupils is being watched closely by health and education officials in Ireland, where they have decided to wait until September before reopening.DenmarkDenmark was one of the first European countries to reopen its primary school almost a month ago. It was seen by some as a bold experiment which risked a second wave of infections. The result?It announced recently that the reproduction factor of the virus remained below one and older students were allowed to return to school last Monday.Teachers’ unions and school principals say the move has been a success and early indications are that it has no significant impact on falling infection rates.All primary schools operating under strict rules aimed at limiting the risk of infections among children.In classrooms, each desk is at least two metres apart. A maximum of 10 children is permitted in each class. These children are required to stay together during lunch break and play time and are taught by a single teacher.Drop-off and collection of children takes place at intervals, while schools are using every available space - such as sports halls and even outdoor areas (weather-permitting) - as teaching area.While some schools reported that a minority of parents did not want to return their children to school, many report that these concerns have eased afterMarco Damgaard, principal of Tingjerg primary school in Denmark, says public health experts, parents, teachers and educators helped review and prepare the reopening plan.“It’s an absolute quality stamp,” he said. “There are a lot of questions from parents and employees who need to be answered and that is only quite understandable . . . Clear and constructive communication between adults is crucial to the well-being, safety and learning of children.”FranceMost of the country’s pre-schools and primary schools began opening their doors to about 1.5 million pupils this week.Administrators have been told to prioritise instruction for children ages five, six and 10.In Paris, officials estimate about 15 per cent of the city’s students will be able to go back to school. Other towns and cities think they can serve about half of the children normally in preschool and primary.Schools are guided by a 60-page document which provides detailed instructions over social distancing rules in classrooms and disinfecting surfaces.Teachers, for example, are required to wear face masks and children’s chairs be separated. A maximum of 10 children are permitted in pre-schools, while it rises to 15 at primary level.School attendance is compulsory and parents may keep children at home and teachers will provide lessons like they have during the nationwide lockdown.Teachers are also required to juggle between face-to-face and distance teaching. Junior secondary schools are due to reopen on May 18th, while older children are scheduled to return on May 25th.Germany Following a two-week trial run in secondary schools which did not stop overall transmission numbers from falling, Germany has been reopening its schools since last month.It allowed older children back to school first on the basis that they are better able to comply with rules on masks and distancing.Schools have been transformed by new hygiene rules. For example, class sizes have been cut in half and students are taught on alternate days.Breaks nowadays are staggered, with certain groups allowed out at certain tines, and hallways have become one-way systems.Teachers are required to wear masks and students, in many schools, are encouraged to dress warmly because windows and doors are kept open for air circulation.Pupils typically wear facemasks while entering and leaving, but most schools allowed them to be removed in the classroom.One secondary school in Neustrelitz, a small town in northern Germany, has gone so far as requiring students to take twice-weekly self-administered Covid-19 tests. Any student with a green sticker is allowed move around the school without a mask - until the next test four days later.NetherlandsThe Dutch government has allowed primary school children to go back to school part time since the start of this week. Secondary schools are not due to open until June.Class sizes and school hours have been cut in half with students spending the remainder of their time doing distance learning.Each district is setting its own policies for reopening, with many accept students only on alternate days. At some schools, the teachers wear medical masks, while others have set up plastic shields around pupils’ desks.Parents are required to drop their children at school gates and there one-way systems in operation at most schools.Children are also allowed to practice sports again under supervision. Competitions, however, are cancelled.Under these rules, young people between the ages of 13 and 18 may exercise together under supervision, but must remain a distance of 1.5 metres apart.Older or vulnerable teachers do not have to return to work, while some schools have taped off a “safe area” for teachers at the front of the class.Despite the safety measures, some schools report that as many as a third of parents are keeping their children at home.SwitzerlandSwitzerland has made headlines due to its government’s belief that children up to 10 years of age are not at risk from the virus.Authorities recently announced, for example, that it was safe for grandparents to hug their grandchildren.However, studies cited by the country’s health ministry - and a review released by Switzerland’s own national Covid-19 task force - acknowledge children’s role in transmission remains “highly uncertain”.Despite the relaxed approach to children, primary schools are reopened under very changed circumstances.Regions have been given considerable autonomy in deciding what measures to take.Many schools are splitting classes in half, with attendance trimmed to just two days a week per group, to accommodate that change.There are also hand-sanitising facilities, while desks are being moved further apart and markings are being taped to floors to help children observe new space limits.Secondary schools and university students, meanwhile, must wait until at least June 8th for classes to begin."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4253498.1589468888!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"primary schools likely to reopen on phased basis with smaller classes","story":"\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                                            Schoolchildren wait in line to use the toilet in the schoolyard of the Sainte Aurelie primary school of Strasbourg, France.

Photograph: Martin BureayAFPPrimary schools will need to reopen on a phased basis with smaller class sizes and pupils attending on certain days of the week, school managers and teachers have said.The views of education stakeholders are contained in documents submitted to the Department of Education as part its consultation process over key issues to be considered if schools are to reopen safely.Under the Government’s roadmap for easing Covid-19 restrictions, schools are due to reopen in September.The Irish National Teachers’ Organisation’s (INTO) submission states that not all children in a class will be able to attend school every day due to social distancing rules and distance learning will need to continue.Teachers, it says, cannot be expected to provide remote teaching and learning for pupils at home after or alongside teaching the pupils who are attending school.“Given the current guidance of physical distancing, it will be necessary in almost all schools to reduce the number of children attending at one time,” the document states.“This will pose huge organisational challenges for schools and clear communication with parents will be necessary.”It says measures should be put in place to assist children with physical distancing, including providing for smaller class groups, floor markings, new arrangements for assembly and break-time, as well as one-way access systems.“We seek firm assurances that schools are not reopened prematurely and then might face a second period of enforced closure, which would only compound an already difficult situation,” the union says, in the document.Rolling attendanceThe largest primary school management body said a “phased return” to school may be required, along with a “rolling cycle of attendance”.The Catholic Primary School Management Association (CPSMA) said this could see schools opening for certain cohorts of pupils at certain times or days of the week to help manage numbers.It says risk assessments should be carried out in each school building and grounds to determine how many pupils could be accommodated in each classroom and other measures such as cleaning procedures , hot water requirements, personal protective equipment and hand sanitiser.Parents should also be surveyed on whether they plan to return their children to school, give that experience in other jurisdictions indicates that a minority of will not send children to school, at least initially.If reduced numbers are required in the school on any one day, options include rotating on half days, daily basis, half weeks or a week-on, week-off rota for pupils.Inidual schools should have flexibility on what suits them best in consultation with all stakeholders, it states.The INTO submission says staff and pupils should also have access to any personal protective equipment - such as face masks - which are recommended by public health advice.This equipment should be centrally procured by health or education authorities and provided to schools.ClarificationIn addition, it says schools should remain closed in cases where boards of management believe that a school cannot provide a safe environment.Teachers in at-risk groups - such the over-60s and those with long-term medical conditions or weak immune systems - should be permitted to work from home.The union is also seeking a specific clarification from the public health authorities of the level of risk – or of additional risk, if any - to pregnant teachers.The CPSMA document also raises questions on how will children get to school and whether buses will still be available.It also asks whether school start and finish times should be staggered to avoid large crowds arrivingleaving at the same time, along with one-way entry and exit routes.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4253371.1589456907!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"primary schools must reopen it s time for parents to make their voices heard","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPupils listen to their teacher in a classroom of of the Saint-Exupery school in the Paris’ suburb of La Courneuve. This week,  primary schools in France re-opened  after an almost two-month closure. Photograph: Martin BureauAFPTwo weeks ago the Government published its roadmap for reopening society and business. In the 23-page document, its plans to keep schools closed until September merited just a footnote.On page eight, under education and childcare measures, are the words: “Commence opening on phased basis at the beginning of the academic year 202021: Primary and secondary schools universities, third level education centres and adult education centres.”There was no explanation as to why schools are to open last of all after offices, construction sites, garden centres, restaurants, bookies, bars and barbershops.There was even an acknowledgement in a footnote to the footnote that infections are “less frequently observed in children and that child-to-adult transmission appears to be uncommon”.QuestionableYet, the roadmap envisages schools remaining closed for the next four months. This approach is looking increasingly questionable.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar’s comments yesterday that reopening schools is “among the safest things that we can do over the next couple of months” has raised hopes that schools will open sooner rather than later.By sooner, parents and pupils mean the current school year and not in September.Mr Varadkar was maddeningly vague on the details. What does the “next couple of months” even mean? Is it now, next week, next month or in September?Does he understand that this kind of casual speculation only leads to false hope and disappointment among children who desperately want to go back to school?We have been here before. In April, Minister for Health Simon Harris said children might be able to go back to primary schools one day a week. The Irish National Teachers’ Organisation expressed a hope that children could return to school in June. What happened to those proposals?No explanation has been forthcoming because parents and pupils, the key stakeholders to use managerial jargon, are supposed to put up and shut up when it comes to Irish education.It is becoming clear that the high-handed and peremptory decision to close schools until September, without keeping the situation under review, was unnecessary.The medical reasons for it look increasingly tenuous. A study by the Health Information and Quality Authority concluded, albeit from limited evidence internationally: “It appears that children are not, to date, substantially contributing to the household transmission of SARS-CoV-2. From one study, SARS-CoV-2 transmission in children in schools is also very low.”The Taoiseach suggested yesterday after a meeting with the World Health Organisation’s Dr Mike Ryan, that it would not be a “good reflection on us as a society to be the last people who are able to re-open our schools and re-open our childcare facilities”.Only Italy and Spain in Europe have planned to keep their schools closed until September and they have been hit hardest of all by the coronavirus pandemic.We have the spectacle at present of the horse racing and vintners’ representative groups lobbying the Government to reopen earlier than planned.Who will speak for the 500,000 primary school pupils in this country who have seven weeks of schooling left? Why should they have to wait?TransitionBy the time schools return in September, if they do, these children will have been out of the classroom for almost six months.\u0026nbspChildren in sixth class will make the huge transition to secondary school without the careful preparation needed for such a change.While the public debate has been fixated about the fate of the Leaving Certificate, primary school children too are suffering stress and have had their lives upended by this pandemic.If there are sound reasons why schools cannot go back until September, these reasons have not been explained to the Irish public.The chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan acknowledges there have been many studies carried out which justify the contention that children are not major spreaders of the disease and are not adversely affected by it.However, he would not budge on the health advice that schools should remain closed.“It is an entirely different thing to conclude in policy terms that we have enough evidence to say that transmission from children doesn’t occur but as yet it hasn’t been identified as a significant issue in the small number of studies that have been done,” he said.Dr Holohan wants evidence-based public health policy. So do we. He should, therefore, point to the studies that show children are significant spreaders of Covid-19 and that it constitutes a significant health threat to them.He might explain why the Republic cannot follow Denmark where children went back to school almost a month ago.The experiment there has worked to date. The Danish R0 has continued to decrease from 0.9 to 0.7 since the schools reopened and pupils in middle school are also returning.They are also returning this week to school in Belgium, the Netherlands and France, three countries which have higher mortality rates than Ireland from Covid-19.In Switzerland primary schools started back on Monday. The country’s public health spokesman Daniel Koch justified this decision succinctly: “It is very rare for children to transmit and get the disease. Children very rarely infect other children. The situation is stable and there is no contradiction that the schools are reopened - it is understandable and correct.”If the Government and the National Public Health Emergency Team know something about the danger of sending primary school children back to school that the rest of Europe does not know, they should share it with us.StrainThere is still time for primary school children to get a meaningful education this year. It is not just education they are missing school is a huge part of their socialisation.The absence of routine is causing a huge strain. That strain will only get worse as the economy starts to reopen.How are those parents who are expected to go back to work on May 18th, June 8th and June 20th supposed to provide childcare for primary school pupils?The closure of primary school needs to end sooner rather than later.There is a fear among parents that schools will stay shut until September, not because it is the best option for children - it clearly is not - but because it is the most convenient one.Parents need to make their voices heard on this issue. Things cannot go on as they are going on.

Photograph: Birmingham City CouncilPA Wire While coronavirus may have knocked Brexit off the front pages, it hasn’t gone away, and Sinn Féin junior Minister Declan Kearney set the cat among the pigeons again when he said there soon will be new physical trading posts set up at Northern Ireland ports.He let this information out when taking a question from former Sinn Féin MEP Martina Anderson at a meeting of the Assembly’s Executive Office scrutiny committee on Wednesday.He told committee members “without breaching executive confidentiality” that, following negotiations between the British government and the European Commission and also following a briefing of Arlene Foster and Michelle O’Neill’s Executive Office, London had “confirmed it will urgently put in place detailed plans with the executive, which does include the physical posts at ports of entry”.This was to meet the protocol for January 1st next year, he said, while adding that the British government indicated it would provide the funding to put that infrastructure in place.LivestockMs Anderson seemed to have the information to hand that these new Border posts would be at Belfast, Warrenpoint and Larne. Her understanding also was that the posts would be required to facilitate extra customs officers, and extra vets checking trade in livestock.It took a while for the pigeons to notice the cat, so to speak, but politicians took their concentration away from Covid-19 for a while to consider the implications of Mr Kearney’s information.DUP member of the committee Christopher Stalford did detect what was afoot. At Wednesday’s committee meeting he countered that the UK was no longer in the EU and “therefore no longer obligated to live under their rules and their conditions”, and also that the EU was “no longer facing a prime minister without a majority and a parliament that’s hamstrung and unable to make any decisions”.“We actually have a government which is capable of governing and capable of going ahead without the consent of the European Commission,” he added.Nonetheless, Mr Kearney’s report of east-west border posts in Northern Ireland annoyed and distressed unionists.The British government sought to calm concerns by saying it had “always been clear that there will be requirements for live animals and agri-food, building on what already happens at ports like Larne and Belfast”.RamificationsBut that didn’t work. First out of the blocks on Wednesday was Traditional Unionist Voice leader Jim Allister who said “no unionist could agree to the imposition of such posts”. He added that it also would have constitutional ramifications.He was followed quickly by Ulster Unionist Party leader Steve Aiken who said that an “Irish Sea border was now a certainty” while lamenting, “It is unforgivable that we have ended up here.”The nationalist and pro-Remain response was more of the “I told you so” variety. The SDLP South Belfast MP Claire Hanna said it was clear from the EU-UK Brexit deal “that unfortunately there would have to be checks somewhere”, and from her perspective it was better to have them in Belfast, Larne and Warrenpoint than on the North-South Border.She took “no pleasure” from referring to the DUP previously keeping the Tories in government and now seeing, as Mr Aiken said, Boris Johnson acceding to an Irish Sea border, which is anathema to unionists.And, conjuring an often-repeated line by the late Seamus Mallon, she said the moral of the story was, “If you can be bought, you can be sold.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4253814.1589485566!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"northern ireland born british and irish win eu citizenship rights","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tEmma DeSouza and her husband, Jake, said they know a number of families who will benefit from this change. Photograph: Justin Kernoghan PhotopressEvery person born in Northern Ireland will be regarded as a European Union citizen for immigration purposes, following a significant climbdown by the British Home Office.Emma DeSouza from Magherafelt in Co Derry had fought a lengthy legal immigration battle to allow her US-born husband, Jake, stay in Northern Ireland, without compromising her to identify as an Irish citizen.However, the Home Office rejected the couple’s application deeming that Ms DeSouza was British, notwithstanding her argument that she never held a British passport.Now however, the Home Office has changed its rules so that Mr DeSouza can seek UK residency while his wife continues to identify solely as Irish.Expressing delight at the outcome, the couple said the Home Office had finally brought its rules into line with last January’s New Decade, New Approach deal that restored the Northern Executive and Assembly.The Home Office had requested Ms DeSouza either apply for residency for her husband as a British citizen or renounce her British citizenship and apply as an Irish citizen.Ms DeSouza challenged that decision, stating that she had never held a British passport and citing how the Belfast Agreement allowed her to identify as Irish, British or both.In October the Home Office won an appeal against an immigration tribunal case that had originally upheld Ms DeSouza’s right to declare herself as Irish, without first renouncing British citizenship.Ms DeSouza, who marred in Belfast in July 2015, applied under her Irish passport for a residence card for her husband in December that year.“This delivers on the commitment the UK government made in the New Decade, New Approach agreement in January 2020 which restored the power sharing Executive in Northern Ireland,” the Home Office said in a statement on Thursday.Expiry dateThe rule changes, which Tánaiste Simon Coveney has pressed for, mean that all British and Irish citizens born in Northern Ireland will be treated as EU citizens for immigration purposes. The rule changes are due to expire in June next year.Mr DeSouza now will be permitted to remain in the UK indefinitely if he applies for residency under the EU settlement scheme.Ms DeSouza said she and her husband were “delighted to see the British government move to fulfil their commitment to change the immigration rules as outlined in the New Decade New Approach deal”.“These changes are on the back of years of campaigning for the full recognition of our right to be accepted as Irish or British or both under the Good Friday Agreement,” she said. “We have always contended that no one should be forced to adopt or renounce a citizenship in order to access rights. To do so goes against both the letter and the spirit of the Good Friday Agreement. I am an Irish citizen and have the right to be accepted as such. The Home Office now concedes that point.” She said the rule changes “will have a positive impact on families across Northern Ireland and will provide a route to family reunification under the EU regulations whether that person identifies as Irish or British or both”. “We personally know a number of families who will benefit from this change and are filled with joy and relief that these families will not face calls to renounce British citizenship or face years in court like we have,” said Ms DeSouza. Sinn Féin senator Niall Ó Donnghaile said the decision was a “victory” for the DeSouzas. Changing the rules clearly showed “that there are distinct political, historic and societal differences here – the very reason we have the Good Friday Agreement in the first place”, he said.“Many of us are concerned, however, with the time-limited nature of today’s announced changes – they only run until the end of the transition period – and more broadly with the British government’s continued failure to address our citizenship and identity rights by codifying the GFA provisions within their own domestic law,” he added.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4253583.1589477759!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"tensions between officials over covid 19 testing plan laid bare in letters","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tHSE ceo Paul Reid (left) said the announcement by chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan (right) bore ‘absolutely no resemblance to that which we previously discussed and has taken no account of what can be achieved by when’. Photographs: Gareth ChaneyCollin KeeganCollinsNewly-released correspondence shows serious tensions at the very highest levels of the HSE over what it saw as attempts by the National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) to pressure it into providing 100,000 Covid-19 tests per week without adequate advance consultations or preparations.The head of the HSE Paul Reid wrote to the secretary general of the Department of Health and its chairman Ciaran Devane wrote to Minister for Health Simon Harris in mid-April to express concerns about an announcement by Nphet for the level of testing for Covid-19 to be increased to 100,000 people a week, operating on a seven-day-a-week basis, for a minimum of six months.Mr Reid in his letter to the department on April 19th said the Nphet direction bore “absolutely no resemblance to that which we previously discussed and has taken no account of what can be achieved by when”.He also said the announcement of plans to test all residents in long-stay facilities, “in the absence of detailed operational considerations and clear requirements for guidance on prioritisation, introduces considerable risk to the continuity of service in these settings”.Mr Devane said in his letter to the Minister that it had “been clear to me and to the board of the HSE for a while that operational requirements have at times not adequately been considered at the centre of Nphet’s decision making”.The department published the letters on Thursday afternoon. The letters had been sought for a number of weeks by Labour Party leader Alan Kelly who described them as “explosive” in the Dáil on Thursday.The Tipperary TD said Minister for Health Simon Harris and the Taoiseach denied there had been tensions “when we now have it in black and white there were real issues particularly in the roll out of testing”.Mr Harris said, however, that Nphet was chaired by Dr Holohan and gave public health advice but the Government “makes decisions”. He said the emergency team was a collaborative body and nine of its members were from the HSE.“I don’t think the letters are explosive. I think what the letters show is people working extraordinarily hard in real time,” the Minister said.He added that, of course, there were tensions. “When has there never been back and forth between officials working their backside off to try in a global pandemic to save people’s lives?” he asked.“I’m very satisfied that the Nphet is working extremely well with the HSE,” he said.When Mr Kelly said that Dr Holohan’s announcement about ramping up testing was outside the agreed process, the Ministrer replied that the HSE and Nphet were not infallible. “None of us are.”HSE surpriseIn his correspondence Mr Reid said he had been very surprised to read a letter from the chief medical officer at the department Dr Tony Holohan just before 9pm on April 17th and also by a Nphet press conference a little earlier at which the increase testing plan had been announced.“The directions as set out in the above letter and press conference are at odds with the process that we have been jointly engaged in at both the Government Cabinet committee and in subsequent meetings with secretary general (Martin) Fraser. They are also at odds with the process in place with the HSE Board.“At the Cabinet committee on Tuesday 14th April, I presented a paper which set out the current capacity with regard to testing and tracing. Following this, a meeting was called by Secretary General Fraser for the afternoon of Friday 17th April, at which Dr Holohan and both you and I attended.“An action from this meeting was that ‘Department of Health to confirm position re (i) testing and contact tracing capacity and (ii) health service capacity on Friday 24th April’. There was no mention at this meeting of the directions that were to issue from the NPHET that evening.“A Cabinet Committee meeting is also scheduled for Monday 20th April at which we are to provide a further update on testing and tracing capacity. Separate to this, and at the request of Dr Holohan, we had committed to developing a paper for consideration and approval at the Nphet meeting on the 21st April 2020. That in itself is no small undertaking, and we have been working intensively to ensure that the Department receives a response that is both thorough and capable of rapid implementation.“I had updated the chairman and the board of the HSE in this regard on Wednesday 15th April and I am to present on the same topic to the HSE Board on Friday 24th April.“Given that all of this was agreed, I am extremely disappointed that these understandings appear not to have been respected. I’m at a loss as to why this direction from the Nphet to the HSE was given and publicly communicated without completing the jointly agreed processes and without regard to appropriate governance. The directions set out effectively attempted to commit the HSE to an intensity of implementation which bears absolutely no resemblance to that which we previously discussed and has taken no account of what can be achieved by when.”‘Pre-empted process’Mr Devane in his letter to Mr Harris said the chief medical officer’s letter and the press conference had “both cut across and pre-empted the process which had been agreed to develop the implementation plan in order to meet and exceed the target of 100,000 tests per week”.“This paper was to be brought to Nphet, the HSE Board and the Cabinet Committee this coming week.”Mr Reid in a separate note to the department said scaling up to providing 15,000 community referrals per day, seven days per week would require engagement with GPs and GP bodies regarding the demand volumes and weekend service model.He said at that point the maximum current community swabbing was approximately 7,000 swabs. He said it would take a number of days to scale up to this with the full time operating of 48 community testing centres.Mr Reid said scaling up to 15,000 would require 30 laboratories working at full capacity.“Some of the new laboratory capacity is brand new and will require time to scale up testing output.“The significant risks with regard to reagent supply for hospital laboratories still has to be managed and will have to be managed in the coming months for the HSE’s partner laboratories also.“A comprehensive strategy on laboratory testing would take this into consideration, prioritise actions to mitigate the risks and ensure we have robust prioritisation guidance and protocols in place that allow us to ensure that all available capacity is at all times directed to areas of greatest need.”Mr Reid said the HSE did not have at that point sufficient mobile community testing or National Ambulance Service capacity to test all residents and staff in long term residential facilities over the next week to ten days.“This is an enormous and complex undertaking.”Work began on the development of a plan to increase this capacity on the evening of the April 17th.“The announcement of this decision, in the absence of detailed operational considerations and clear requirements for guidance on prioritisation introduces, introduces considerable risk to the continuity of service in these settings.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4253769.1589481435!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"unionists react with dismay to proposals for brexit border post at north ports","story":"Unionist politicians have responded with annoyance and dismay after a junior Sinn Fein Minister told a Stormont committee that there will be new physical Border posts at Northern Ireland ports.An “Irish Sea border is now a certainty”, the Ulster Unionist Party leader Steve Aiken said on Thursday following comments by Sinn Fein Minister Declan Kearney that Border posts are to be created to deal with trade coming into Northern Ireland from Britain.Mr Kearney told the Assembly’s Executive Office scrutiny committee that the “British government has confirmed it will urgently put in place detailed plans with the Executive, which does include the physical posts at ports of entry”.Mr Kearney informed former Sinn Fein MEP Martina Anderson that the British government had signalled that “delivery on that infrastructure needs to start as soon as possible”.“The British government has indicated that it will provide advice on the requirements and the funding to put that in place.”Ms Anderson in her questioning of Mr Kearney on Wednesday indicated the posts would be at Belfast, Larne and Warrenpoint and would be designed to accommodate additional customs officers and vets, who would be dealing with livestock.While it appeared implicit in the EU-UK deal that allowed for Brexit to proceed that there would be checks on some goods and livestock coming in from Britain unionist politicians have campaigned against any such border at Northern Ireland ports.He said his party had warned “this was sadly inevitable” if the British government continued with the deal it struck with the European Union. “It is unforgivable that we have ended up here,” said Mr Aiken. “For all the big talk and bluster, Northern Ireland will now have to deal with border control posts at our ports and airports.” “This places a huge burden on businesses here who will be expected to be totally prepared for the changes in just over seven months time, amidst the crisis many are currently facing due to Covid-19,” he added.Mr Aiken said that EU “intransigence” also played a big role in creating the current situation.Traditional Unionist Voice leader Jim Allister said Mr Kearney’s “claim” about new posts suggested that “unionists at the Executive face a major test of their mettle”.He said, “No Unionist could agree to the imposition of such posts at Larne, Belfast and Warrenpoint. Not only would they represent a serious assault on our place within the United Kingdom but it would create a barrier between us and our single biggest market in the rest of the U.K.“Quite apart from the constitutional ramifications it simply doesn’t make economic sense.”A British government spokesperson said it had “always been clear that there will be requirements for live animals and agri-food, building on what already happens at ports like Larne and Belfast”. “We want to work with Northern Ireland businesses and the Executive to ensure new administrative procedures are streamlined and efficient,” the spokesperson added. The SDLP Brexit spokeswoman Claire Hanna said that checks at Northern Ireland ports should come as no surprise as it was clear for a long time that this must happen. “This is an inevitable consequence of Brexit,” she said.Ms Hanna said the proposals gave “a little bit of comfort” that if there were checks at Northern Ireland ports that North-South trade could happen seamlessly.She said that the proposals contradicted previous British government commitments about there being “unfettered” trade across the Irish Sea after Brexit.“The only way to minimise the checks in the Irish Sea is to soften Brexit overall,” added Ms Hanna.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4253512.1589480079!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"covid 19 clusters in meat plants gravely serious d%C3%A1il told","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin said: ‘There has been a significant lack of transparency on this issue.’ Photograph: Dara Mac Donaill  The Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin has described the situation in meat processing plants as “gravely serious” and expressed concern that clusters of coronavirus in the factories were not being treated comprehensively.Mr Martin called for factories to be inspected and said he had “alerted the authorities six weeks or two months ago about the dangers of what could happen”.He said: “There has been a significant lack of transparency on this issue.”Rise TD Paul Murphy told the Dáil that 200 complaints had been made about workplace breaches of Covid-19 guidelines including at meat plants but no inspections had been carried out by the Health Safety Authority (HSA).Mr Murphy said Minister for Enterprise Heather Humphreys had confirmed the number of complaints.In reply, however, Ms Humphreys said some of the 200 complaints had been made by people who did not even work at these sites. Last week the National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) reported 10 outbreaks of Covid-19 in meat-processing plants with 566 staff infected.Siptu union organiser Greg Ennis said on Thursday the number of confirmed cases in meat processing plans in the Republic had now risen above 600.Independent TD Carol Nolan said she had been told that 60 workers in the Rosderra Irish Meats plant in Edenderry had now been confirmed as having Covid-19.Mr Martin said “the situation with meat plants is gravely serious and it is not obvious that these clusters are being dealt with comprehensively. “Without calling for the shutting down of the sector, it seems very surprising that the blanket testing of a facility is followed by no interruption of work until the results are returned. “Would it not be reasonable to halt production for a deep clean and putting in place of new control measures while waiting for the results? Simply sending workers back to work and, indeed, not testing their families does not make sense, particularly given the Minister’s assurance that testing capacity is not an issue.”He said that the number of infections were high in towns across the country where “ordinarily, there would not have been a high incidence of Covid-19”.“More needs to be done on this issue. The authorities need to visit factory floors to see the reality”.Mr Murphy later said a complaint was made to the HSE about Moyvalley Meats “that sick workers were working and living alongside other workers”.There was a number of confirmed cases of coronavirus in the factory. There were reports “some were even doping to keep temperatures down while clearly sick, with management turning a blind eye”, the Rise TD said.He claimed big businesses were breaking the rules. “That’s 200 groups of workers potentially working in unsafe conditions, 200 appeals to the HSA falling on deaf ears.”Independent TD Denis Naughten said the reason for the clusters in meat plans was because of the “inordinate delays in providing results through the contact tracing system”.He said that in one case a family waited seven weeks for results and TDs were being fed “organic manure” when they tried to get answers about test turnaround times.Hitting out at claims by the HSE of a swift turnaround in testing he said that if it was so good why were meat plants “not closed by public health officials until the Covid screening results came back”.He also said test results were going to employers before those who had been tested, an issue Ceann Comhairle Sean O Fearghail said “would be fundamental concern to the public and needs to be addressed”.Minister for Health Simon Harris said he had asked Mr Naughten to provide details of these incidents.Speaking on RTÉ Radio earlier, Mr Ennis said meat processing was also a low wage sector, meaning workers often shared accommodation and transport making it “ripe” for the spread of infection.“Workers, by its very nature in the meat industry, work in close proximity to each other you have got industrial air cooling systems you have got bottle necks in canteens and toilet facilities,” the Siptu official said.“We have been calling for mandatory temperature testing for a number of weeks at this stage and I would call on the Minister to put in a sector specific strategy to deal with the meat industry to ensure that we protect our members, their families and the wider community.” "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4253801.1589484428!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus vaccine could be approved in a year says eu medicine agency","story":"Dr Michael Ryan, the World Health Organisation\u0027s emergencies chief, says coronavirus could become another endemic virus in our communities.

Photograph: Rungroj YongritEPAThe number of lives lost worldwide in the pandemic is nearing 300,000, according to Johns Hopkins University figures, with 297,197 deaths reported. There are 4,347,015 confirmed infections.The true figures are likely to be significantly higher as a result of underreporting or differing definitions of what constituteA vaccine to counter the new coronavirus could be approved in about a year in an “optimistic” scenario, a agency which approves medicines for the European Union said on Thursday.As the world rushes to develop a vaccine, the European Union, hard hit by Covid-19, fears it may not have sufficient supplies, especially if a vaccine were developed in the United States or China.The European Medicines Agency, in communication with 33 developers, was doing all it could to speed up the approval process, the EMA’s head of vaccines, Marco Cavaleri, said, but he was sceptical of claims any could be ready by September.“For vaccines, since the development has to start from scratch . . . we might look from an optimistic side in a year from now, so beginning of 2021,” he told journalists.He ruled out the possibility of skipping the third phase of a vaccine trial, which he said would be needed to be sure a vaccine was safe and effective.Dialogue and co-operationThe EMA is also looking at 115 different therapeutics, or treatments, for the coronavirus, which has killed nearly 300,000 deaths globally, according to World Health Organisation (WHO) data.Mr Cavaleri said some of those therapeutics could be approved in Europe as early as this summer, but he did not specify which.A leading EU lawmaker said the European Union should circumvent pharmaceutical companies’ intellectual property rights if a vaccine were developed outside the bloc, a new sign of EU fears of lagging behind in the global race.“If a vaccine is first developed outside Europe, we must do everything possible to ensure that the vaccine is actually available to all countries,” said Peter Liese, who is a prominent member of Germany’s Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party, the same as Chancellor Angela Merkel’s.“We are counting on dialogue and co-operation, but we must also expect others to reject dialogue and cooperation. This is why we need a plan B”, said Liese.The United States and China have been wary of supporting a global funding campaign promoted by the EU which raised $8 billion to research, manufacture and distribute a possible vaccine and treatments for COVID-19 this month.Liese called on EU governments and the European Commission to consider a waiver under World Trade Organisation rules that allows states to produce generic drugs without the consent of the pharmaceutical companies that have first developed them and still own intellectual rights.The EU has insisted that any coronavirus vaccine must be available fairly to all countries, after the British chief executive of French drugs company Sanofi said it was reserving the first shipments of its vaccine for the US.“The vaccine against Covid-19 should be a global public good and its access needs to be equitable and universal,” said the European commission spokesman, Stefan de Keersmaecker.Global mental health crisisThe World Health Organisation (WHO) has warned that coronavirus “may never go away” as its experts predicted that a global mental health crisis caused by the pandemic was looming.The global health body on Wednesday cautioned against trying to predict how long coronavirus would keep circulating, and called for a “massive effort” to overcome it.“It is important to put this on the table: this virus may become just another endemic virus in our communities, and this virus may never go away,” said Michael Ryan, the WHO’s emergencies chief.“I think there are no promises in this and there are no dates. This disease may settle into a long problem, or it may not be,” he said.A report by the WHO’s mental health department to the UN warned of another looming crisis: “The isolation, the fear, the uncertainty, the economic turmoil – they all cause or could cause psychological distress,” said the department’s director, Devora Kestel. She said the world could expect to see an upsurge in the severity of mental illness, including amongst children, young people and healthcare workers.“The mental health and wellbeing of whole societies have been severely impacted by this crisis and are a priority to be addressed urgently,” she said.LinkDoctors in Italy have reported the first clear evidence of a link between Covid-19 and a rare but serious inflammatory disorder that has required some children to undergo life-saving treatment in intensive care units. The mysterious condition emerged last month when NHS bosses issued an alert to doctors after hospitals admitted a number of children with a mix of toxic shock and symptoms seen in an inflammatory disorder known as Kawasaki disease.The British head of a French pharmaceutical company has caused an outcry by saying any vaccine discovered by his firm would initially be reserved for the United States. Paul Hudson, chief executive officer of Sanofi, told Bloomberg News that any vaccine invented by his firm would go to the US first since it had done the most to fund the company’s research.France’s higher education minister, Frederique Vidal, said Sanofi’s plan to give the US priority access would be “incomprehensible and disgraceful” since a successful vaccine must be “a public good for the world”.The European commission has said it is monitoring the Hungarian government over coronavirus laws that created a state of emergency with no end date. The commission, the body charged with upholding European Union law, said the absence of a clear time limit on the emergency decree raises “potential concerns as regards legal certainty”, while a media law criminalising the spreading of misinformation about the pandemic “may have a chilling effect on freedom of expression in Hungary”.RussiaMeanwhile, Russia became the nation with the second highest number of infections at 242,271, behind the US with just under 1.4 million. The official death toll in Russia is 2,212, although authorities ascribed the deaths of more than 60per cent of coronavirus patients in April to other causes. Moscow, the centre of the country’s outbreak, accounted for 1,232 of those deaths. Tatyana Golikova, Russia’s health minister, denied any falsification of the statistics.In the US, president Donald Trump said warnings from his top infectious diseases expert on the dangers of lifting restrictions too soon were “not acceptable”.Mr Trump said he was “surprised” by Anthony Fauci’s caution on reopening the economy and schools too soon.“To me it’s not an acceptable answer, especially when it comes to schools,” Trump said. “Our country has got to get back and it’s got to get back as soon as possible, and I don’t consider our country coming back if the schools are closed,” he said, adding that the only thing that would be acceptable would be professors or teachers “over a certain age” not holding classes.Global infectionsIn South Korea, 24,000 people have been tested in relation to the Seoul nightclub cluster, which prompted the closure of bars and entertainment venues in the capital, according to the city’s mayor. Cases linked to the cluster have grown to 120.Japan was expected to lift the state of emergency for 39 of its 47 prefectures on Thursday, local media reported, while the capital Tokyo is set to keep restrictions in place until it sees a convincing containment of the coronavirus.While the nation has avoided the kind of explosive growth seen elsewhere, its testing has also been among the lowest, at 188 tests per 100,000 people, versus 3,159 in Italy and 3,044 in Germany. Hardest-hit Tokyo has conducted just 50,000 tests so far, of which about 5,000 were positive. With hospitals still stretched, the capital and surrounding prefectures are set to remain in a state of emergency.BrazilBrazil has registered a record number of new cases of the novel coronavirus on Wednesday, surpassing France’s tally to become the sixth-worst hit country, as the disease sends the economy toward its worst year since at least 1900.The UK government confirmed 11,385 new cases in the last 24 hours, bringing its total count to 188,974 cases of the coronavirus since the outbreak began. Early on Wednesday, France revised its total number of confirmed and suspected cases down 0.3 per cent to 177,700.In other coronavirus developments:China reported three new cases of Covid-19, all locally acquired, and no new deaths or suspected cases.Stock markets in Asia reacted poorly to Powell and the WHO’s comments and on a worries about a second wave of infections. Japan’s Nikkei fell 07 per cent, while indexes in Australia, Hong Kong, Korea and China all fell about 1 per cent. But Australia reported an unemployment rate of 6.2 per cent, which was lower than expected.Spain’s daily death toll report rose above 200 on Thursday for the first time since 8 May, the health ministry reported. The overall death toll from the disease rose to 27,321 on Thursday as 217 people reportedly died overnight, the ministry said, according to Reuters. The overall number of diagnosed cases rose to 229,540 on Thursday. The number of confirmed cases in Germany rose 933 on Thursday, a similar number to Wednesday, to stand at 172,239, according to the Robert Koch Institute for infectious diseases. The reported death toll rose by 89 to 7,723.Hong Kong will screen hundreds of families, local media reported, after its 23-day run of no local infections was broken with the diagnosis of Covid-19 in a 66-year-old woman with no recent travel history, and her five-year-old granddaughter.

Photograph: Paul SancyaAPIn Michigan, gun-toting men demand the reopening of businesses. In Florida, gym regulars do roadside push-ups to protest at the closure of their facilities. In California, Tesla starts its car plant again in the teeth of local restrictions. If impatience to resume normal life builds as spring becomes summer, the past few days will be remembered as the inflexion point.Until such time, though, the dissent is more striking for its smallness and slowness in coming. All of the flash points above stand out in a wider context of general compliance.For upwards of two months now, people in the US and other democracies have mostly gone along with mass confinement and economic torpor. They have done so on the guidance of a political class they are meant to despise and unelected experts that they are assumed to mistrust.It has been likened to wartime discipline, but this is to undersell it a tad. Wars at least give us an enemy with a name and a face to unite against. The virus is invisible and, except for those of a medical ken, hard to understand. The show of civic togetherness is all the more impressive for that.Nor can it be said that people have had no other choice. Had, say, one-fifth of the population bucked the rules, the government would have been left with very little recourse. Unable to police that many, the choice would have been martial law or some degree of capitulation. Civilised order ultimately rests on consent. We are forced to entertain the possibility that society is in better shape than billed. This stark news I address to conservatives but also to the left, as both sides have come to traffick in versions of cultural declinism.For the first, the problem is several decades of irreligion, permissiveness and the debasement of a national way of life through immigration. For the second, the problem is several decades of unfettered markets and the commodification of people. But both converge on the same bleak picture: an atomised and decadent society, less than the sum of its parts, brittle for all its outward riches. Both are nostalgic for the mid-20th century, when most western nations were more homogenous and more equal.Theirs is an analysis that makes intuitive sense. In fact, it is strange that it is not true. If liberalism means anything, it is that society has limited claims on the inidual. Collective action must therefore be harder to pull off.Hobbesian free-for-allAnd yet if it were as straightforward as that, the past two months would have been much uglier. We should have seen more resistance, more quickly, to a lockdown that has no precedent in peacetime. And cities, those pits of liberalism, should have been the most anarchic. The Republican senator Ted Cruz once referred to “New York values”, which he implied were selfish and nihilistic. Well, the city has been the worst-afflicted part of the US, and it has not yet curdled into a Hobbesian free-for-all.At the least, I expected public pressure for a more bespoke shutdown, isolating the old and the otherwise vulnerable. In fact, we are seeing almost the opposite clamour. By two to one, Americans worry that restrictions will be lifted too soon, not too slowly. That margin is unchanged since early April. Many did not even wait for their state governor’s edict before cloistering themselves.The dissenters are real and it takes only a small number to undo a whole nation’s public health efforts. They may yet multiply to ruinous effect. But their photogenic gatherings fool us that they, not general obedience, has been the story. And it is obedience that, at least in the US, is achieved through mutual social pressure as much as through uniformed agents of state. The lightness of policing in Washington, capital of the world’s most militarised democracy, has been scarcely believable.As the shutdown eases, it is natural to anticipate better days. But in one sense, there is good news already behind us. The shutdown was a test of the social fabric’s tensile strength. The cloth is still in one piece. Fiscal support helps, as does fear of infirmity or death. But there are cultural pessimists who would not have predicted such discipline, even with these things.It turns out that liberalism does not by definition breed egoism and irresolution. A lot of the easy calumnies against it (“We could never fight a war now”) appear less certain. And if the “horizontal” bond among citizens is a bit stronger than assumed, so is their “vertical” cord with government. Anti-elitism – the spirit of the age, we thought – is broad but it can also be shallow, or at least selective. The speed with which people deferred to the medical and bureaucratic establishment was telling. The crisis has found nothing more wanting than our cynicism. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2020Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"schools start opening amid covid 19 children nothing","story":"Around the world school gates are reopening after months of lockdown which left playgrounds empty and classrooms forlorn.But where there were once excited shouts as children arrived for a new day, there are now instructions to keep your distance and regularly wash your hands.As children return to class in countries that have begun to ease their lockdown measures, new school regimes have been introduced to minimise the risk of renewed infections leading to a second wave of Covid-19.How countries manage the return of pupils is being watched closely in Britain, where the Government has asked primary schools to reopen on June 1 for reception, Year 1 and Year 6.Parisian nursery teacher Dominique Sicard has been pouring over a 57-page protocol from the French education ministry on how to respect social distancing with a class of five-year olds and is categorical.“If the people who govern us think we can respect all this to the letter, there’s no point in re-opening at all,” said the 53-year-old.“I’ve already warned parents that while children will have a table and chair with their name on, it is impossible for them to remain at that desk all day. Most are happy with it.”As France slowly re-emerges from two months of confinement, the Ecole des Trois Bornes in Paris is one of tens of thousands of the country’s nursery and primary schools opening its doors to around 1.5 million pupils this week, roughly a quarter of the total.While nursery and primary schools in France’s “green”low-infection areas began classes on Tuesday, those in Paris - deep red given ongoing contagion levels - only start widening intake beyond the offspring of essential critical workers on Thursday.Among a long list of sanitary measures, teachers must wear face masks and the children\u0027s chairs be separated to avoid spreading the disease.One Ms Sicard and colleagues have already written off is to coop children inside a metre-square enclosure in the playground far from their classmates.“It’s inhuman and impossible. Five-year-olds need to be able to run around and let off steam otherwise they lose the plot,” she said.Pupils are not supposed to touch teachers and vice versa. “But what about a child that hurts itself and requires treatment, can’t hang its coat up or goes to the toilet and can’t do its trousers up?,” she asked.“We can’t turn them into adults just because the context dictates they should act as adults. If they see their friends, they’ll want to go and play with them,” she said.That said, she said many of the rules will be applied, including disinfecting toys and surfaces.Despite her reservations, she said she approved of France re-opening schools in particular out of “solidarity for families whose parents have to work”.Paris’ town hall expects 600 of its 652 primary and nursery schools to open this week to welcome a quarter of its 130,000 pupils. Nation-wide, most will re-open but classes will be small - a maximum of 10 in nursery schools and 15 in elementary schools.“There are more risks in staying home than going to school,” insisted education minister Jean-Michel Blanquer.The return to school is on a voluntary basis and the vast majority of children remain at home. Teachers are supposed to juggle with real and remote teaching.Secondary school children are not due back until May 25.Unions have criticised the decision to reopen the schools calling it “premature and pointing out that the government overruled its scientific committee’s advice to keep them shut until September, like the UK.Why have we started with the youngest children to end the lockdown when we know they\u0027ll be the hardest ones to make apply protective measures? said Francette Popineau, chief of the primary school union, on FranceInfo radio.Parents have mixed feelings. Bruno Timsit, 41, is keeping his three children away from nursery, primary and secondary school for now.“It wasn’t an easy decision but we decided there is no rush. We weren’t sure how schools were going to cope and were a bit worried about the kids contaminating each other and us,” he said.“I also with the idea of leaving it to parents to decide whether to take risk of sending they kids back to school. The government should have taken responsibility and either called everyone back or no.”However, Tarek Elachkar, 45, said he “decided to trust the official guidelines”. His nine-year old daughter Olivia will return to primary school on Thursday.“She misses school. We tried to tell her it would be different but she said she was happy to go back. That nailed it for us,” he said.Nursery headmistress Pascale Chartier said she was not worried about infections. “We have been looking after children of high-risk health workers throughout the confinement period and have had no infections of teachers or pupils,” she said. Studies suggests transmission from children under 10 is very low.“We are being careful but we are confident it will be alright,” she said.Dutch parents have been instructed to ‘kiss and go’ at the school gates, as primary children in the Netherlands began a staggered return this week.It would be normal for parents in primary school to take their kids into the classroom in the morning. But most schools are now asking parents to drop their children at the school gates or at the doors and stay out of the premises to minimise the risk of spreading infection.Audrey Verschuren, principal of the Leonardo Da Vinci school in Amsterdam, which admits half its children in the morning and half in the afternoon, said: “The parents have had to get used to it. It\u0027s a bit nerve-wracking for them to see their four-year-old child who has been with us for just two months walk into the classroom on their own! But children get used to new situations quickly and always find the fun side.Each school has come up with its own solution to keep the required 1.5m distance between staff and pupils.Ribbons mark out one-way routes and there are separate entrances for different age groups. Older or vulnerable teachers do not have to return to work, while some schools have taped off a ‘safe area’ for teachers at the front of the class, while children sit at a greater distance at their desks and play outside in their half-class groups. Some parents are still anxious. At the British School of Amsterdam a third have kept their children at home.But Paul Morgan, the schools’ Principal, told The  of the joy of welcoming back those who came.“It has been so heart-warming to see the children back in school: smiling and enjoying seeing their teachers and friends again,” he said.Denmark pioneered the start of the European return to school from May 4 by keeping its primary school children in small groups and with as little contact with others as possible.These micro-groups arrive at a separate time, eat lunch separately, have their own zones in the playground and are taught by one teacher.Dom Maher, head of the international section of St Josef\u0027s school in Roskilde, on the Danish island of Zealand, said: There was anxiety in the community. A large percentage of parents were in two minds.But the Danish experiment appears to have been a success, so much so that the insistence on children washing their hands frequently has led to problems with skin irritation and eczema.Schools began to reopen in Germany last month, but parents and teachers have voiced frustration with measures to contain the virus.Most schools have reduced class sizes so social distancing can be observed, but many can only achieve this by iding classes and teaching children on alternate days. “It’s an absolute farce,” one parent in Berlin said, complaining that her child will only get four days of lessons before the summer holidays under the new timetable.Many parents say employers expect them to be able come back to work because the schools are open and don’t realise they’re still stuck taking care of their children three days a week.Pupils are expected to wear facemasks while entering and leaving but most schools allow them to be removed in the classroom.One school in a remote part of north-eastern Germany has won plaudits for coming up with an alternative solution. Henry Tesch, headmaster of the Carolinum School in Neutsrelitz, says iding classes and teaching on alternate days isn’t an option because of the long distances his pupils have to travel, with some travelling as far as 40 miles each way.So the school is offering coronavirus tests to pupils twice a week, in partnership with a local company.Switzerland has taken a radical approach to reopening schools because its government is convinced children are not at risk from the virus.Swiss authorities recently announced it was safe for grandparents to hug their grandchildren and they have taken the same attitude to reopening schools. “Young children very rarely get infected and transmit the virus to others even less,” Alain Berset, the Swiss interior minister said.Primary and secondary schools were allowed to reopen this week and in most regions they are teaching full classes as usual.A notable exception is Zurich, where classes have been ided in two to prevent overcrowding.Regions have been given considerable autonomy in deciding what measures to take.Authorities in Basel said iding classes “would not solve the problem of childcare for families and would pose additional challenges for teachers”. But there has been resistance to the government advice in areas which have been harder hit by the virus.In Taiwan, which has avoided a lockdown due to its successful pandemic strategy, schools were closed for the month of February, but have since functioned in a relatively normal fashion with some social distancing restrictions.Children have had to wear masks in disinfected classrooms, sit at least 70cm apart and wash their hands after every break. School assemblies were restricted and parents were not permitted to attend sports days but activities like swimming lessons have now resumed.Fergus Meiklejohn, a British filmmaker who lives in Taipei with his wife and two primary school age daughters, said: “For us parents we are happy that the school and government are doing their best. If we had the infection rates currently in the UK, we’d still be scared kids would bring infection back to the family even with these precautions.”.  Sean Kramer, an American teacher based in Taiwan, said: “Kids will be kids and interact with each other, their lives haven’t changed that much. But the school won’t take any chances if a student has a temperature. I’ve had noticeably more absences in my classes this semester.”China - where the coronavirus pandemic began - has been reopening its schools cautiously and in phases, running classes with a maximum of 20 pupils to allow children to sit a safe distance from each other. Some schools are even using video calls so that teachers can instruct classes from a separate room.Students now have shorter lessons and have been told to avoid public transport to and from school.In Hangzhou, children at one elementary school made their own bespoke “social-distancing” hats with metre-long wings to remind them to help them avoid getting too close to each other.In Greece, students in the final year of high school returned to school on Monday, with all other high school students, as well as middle school pupils, going back next week.Each class is limited to 15 to ensure social distancing regulations and break times will be staggered so classes.Schools are livestreaming classes so that they can rotate student attendance and keep classrooms at 50 per cent capacity or below.That decision has been criticised by a national teachers\u0027 union, which says it could infringe on children\u0027s privacy rights.By swiftly implementing a national lockdown, Greece managed to contain its coronavirus outbreak. So far the death toll is just 151 – compared with more than 30,000 in nearby Italy. Around 2,700 people have been infected.Austria was one of the first countries in Europe to lift its lockdown but it is taking a cautious approach to reopening schools.Classes resumed on May 4 for those facing school leaving exams, but for others they do not resume until May 18. Sixth formers who do not have exams will have to wait until June 3.Austria has formalised the practice of iding classes to limit numbers with a clear and simple system to be used across the country.All classes will be ided in two, with one half attending lessons from Monday to Wednesday, and the other on Thursday and Friday. Each week the two groups will swap over, so all children get the same number of lessons.Austria has also taken steps to get round the problem of childcare for parents returning to work.On the days they do not have lessons children will be able to study under supervision in school gyms, if parents wish.Facemasks will be compulsory while moving around the school but not in classrooms. Schools will be issued with “emergency masks” for pupils who forget to bring theirs.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus positive good news round up captain tom author","story":"Captain Tom Moore had already lived quite a life until the beginning of this year. A World War Two veteran, he lived through most of the major events of the 20th century, including wars, space races, the fallout from the Spanish flu and several monarchs.He has fought in Burma, competitively raced motorbikes, loved and lost, become a father, grandfather… And then the coronavirus happened.Since Britain went into lockdown in March, ‘Captain Tom’ has turned 100, raised more than £32m for NHS Charities Together, had a number one with Michael Ball, been awarded the Freedom of the City of London, had a miniature train named after him, became an Honorary Colonel, had his debonair style heralded in this very newspaper, become an international celebrity and, of course, walked 100 lengths of his garden. It is, I think we can all agree, enough to fill at least one book of memoirs. And Penguin Random House, the publishers, happen to agree.This morning, Captain Tom announced he will release two new tomes in the autumn: an autobiography, Tomorrow Will Be A Good Day, and a children’s book, both produced in support of the Captain Tom Foundation. (Which is a new charity he’s set up, rather than a cosmetics line. Though watch this space.)“I am so looking forward to sharing my autobiography with you which will help launch my new Foundation,” Captain Tom said. “I’d better get writing!”The as-yet untitled fully illustrated children’s book, apparently, will be about a man walking 100 laps of his garden. Write what you know, Tom. A safe strategy. That’s Christmas presents sorted for everyone’s parents and kids, then. Meanwhile, there’s some genuinely exciting news on the testing front.Health officials in England have approved an antibody test to find out whether people have been infected with coronavirus in the past might now have some immunity. Developed by Swiss pharmaceutical company Roche, the test has been hailed as a “very positive development” by Public Health England, and rather more bombastically as a “game-changer” by Boris Johnson. If proven effective, it could see millions able to return to work earlier than expected.And finally to Belgium, where cranes have been utilised to allow families to visit relatives in care homes – even if they\u0027re up high. The method came about when Tristan Van den Bosch, an operations manager at a cleaning and maintenance company, saw a man on the ground shouting to his mother, three stories up. “We can help this man!” Mr Van den Bosch, who has some spare cranes, thought. And with that, a genius idea came to him. Now, who says we don\u0027t bring you uplifting stories? Sorry.Here’s Harriet Barber with the rest of today’s good news:Three pleasant things to put into your head...1.  If you thought the speed with which NHS Nightingale was built was impressive, wait until you see NHS Knittingale...2.

After two months in lockdown, the nation can finally strike out for the beach or beauty spot without fear of breaking the law. Sunny weather is being forecast but the truth is storm clouds are gathering. Boris Johnson’s decision to ease the lockdown is facing a concerted backlash with tourism bosses, the Tory shires and the Prime Minister’s own MPs pleading for the public to stay away from popular seaside towns and countryside. One Conservative stalwart backbencher described the rule change as “sheer folly”. Authorities in some of England’s favourite resorts said they were keeping public lavatories closed and car parks shut to try to ward off day-trippers. Weston-Super-Mare’s official tourist board altered its slogan from \u0027Visit Weston\u0027 to \u0027Don’t Visit Weston\u0027 while Visit Whitby, the body in charge of the resort’s tourist industry, posted on its website the stark message: “Please do not visit Whitby for now.”With many seaside resorts home to an elderly population, the fear of Covid-19 being spread by day-trippers is a real and grave concern. Restaurants, cafes and pubs will stay shut but takeaways that have opened can expect a thriving business amid fears of long queues that will struggle to maintain social distancing. Enterprising pubs have also begun selling beer as a takeout drink to anybody turning up with their own jam jars and refillable bottles.Sir Roger Gale, a veteran Conservative MP, urged visitors to steer clear of Margate and Herne Bay, two major resorts in his Kent constituency. It breaks my heart to have to say, for the moment, \u0027please don\u0027t come to the seaside, we\u0027re still shut\u0027,” said Sir Roger, MP for North Thanet, “I believe that the \u0027drive to wherever you want to take exercise\u0027 advice from the Government is premature and possibly sheer folly.”He said “baby steps toward reopening” were needed rather than “a leap in the dark”.Robert Goodwill, a former minister and Tory MP for Scarborough and Whitby, pleaded with day-trippers to head for obscure destinations rather than the two popular seaside resorts he represents. “There are very real concerns for this weekend,” said Mr Goodwill. “My advice to people is to dust off their old ordnance survey maps and go to the places they have not visited before. We will be open at some point hopefully and then we will be delighted to have you back.”Sheryll Murray, Conservative MP for South East Cornwall, which includes many of the country’s best loved beaches, said tourists were always welcome “at the right time” which, she said, might not be until next year. For the moment she called on outsiders to keep clear of Cornwall. “Cornwall is a beautiful place and I’m happy to share my beautiful duchy with other people, but at the right time… Once we come out of this pandemic period, of course tourists will be welcome. So next year, and maybe even later this year,” she said.A number of England\u0027s national parks have expressed their unease, including two of its busiest, the Yorkshire Dales  and the Lake District. Its chief executive Richard Leafe said: For now, we\u0027re asking people not to rush back to the Lake District - help protect our communities, the fells will still be here when this passes.In Whitby and Scarborough, the public lavatories and car parks are staying shut. “We are very worried about this weekend,” said Pam Dobson, the town council clerk. “The police cannot now stop people from coming but we don’t want them. But now the lockdown is lifted we will have a massive influx of people and the local residents are really concerned. Day-trippers have been told by Boris Johnson to go out and enjoy themselves but we are not ready yet.”The body that represents rural counties issued a statement urging day-trippers to stay clear. Julian German, County Councils Network rural spokesman and leader of Cornwall Council said: “We recognise with the easing of restrictions many people will be considering driving long distances to enjoy these areas but for now we are urging the public to think twice. Our coastal and rural areas will be there when this is over – but we are asking households to bear with us and please do their bit over the coming weeks by exercising locally.“A surge in the number of people poses a risk to everyone’s safety, and the figures show county areas are vulnerable to rises in coronavirus cases at the moment. Those travelling may also do so only to find long queues of traffic, difficulties parking and closed facilities such as toilets and other amenities.”The Woodland Trust has asked people to stay local while the National Trust said it was re-opening car parks - but not anywhere that might be too popular. In a statement, the National Trust said: “All opening decisions will be guided by local judgement. It’s important that we avoid hotspots developing for the safety of visitors and local communities, and we may not open places where this is too great a risk.”Keep Britain Tidy said anybody striking out must take their rubbish home with them because bins were not being emptied as regularly during the pandemic.In a further easing of the lockdown, authorities gave the go ahead for boat owners to go back on the rivers in narrow boats. One company took this to mean narrow boat rentals were back on the agenda.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"france unveils 18bn marshall plan save tourism","story":"France unveiled an €18 billion “Marshall plan for tourism” to save the “jewel in the crown” of the world’s most visited nation in the wake of coronavirus.The massive package came as Italians were offered financial incentives to holiday on home soil along with a €4bn bailout plan for the country’s tourism industry.France welcomed nearly 90 million foreign tourists last year but a two-month nationwide lockdown to stem the viral epidemic has forced 95 per cent of its hotels to remain shuttered since mid-March with many facing imminent bankruptcy.The country started cautiously unwinding confinement this week, allowing people to return to work but hotels, along with cafes, bars, restaurants, major museums and public parks remain closed while the French can travel no further than 100 kilometres (62-miles) from home.Amid mounting despair over the impending summer season, the government pledged to do what it takes to keep afloat an industry that accounts for almost eight per cent of the country\u0027s economy and employs two million people.“Whatever strikes tourism strikes the heart of France,” said prime minister Edouard Philippe as he announced the measures on Thursday.Tourism is facing what is probably its worst challenge in modern history. Because this is one of the crown jewels of the French economy, rescuing it is a national priority.The nation’s very soul was a stake, he insisted.This very French pleasure, which is at the heart of our identity, to meet up, eat well and have a chat, has been compromised by the lockdown first, and then the conditions of lifting that lockdown, he said.The plan includes €1.3 billion in direct public investment as well as government-guaranteed loans and extended access to a solidarity fund”.In all, the government intervention represents a commitment of more than 18 billion euros in public finances: it is without precedent, it is massive, it is necessary, he said.To prevent job losses, the state will continue reimbursing companies for 70 per cent of the gross wages of workers they put on furlough until at least the end of September.That support will not continue in other less-affected sectors.In a huge source of relief to a nation that relishes its long summer break, Mr Edouard said that the French “will be able to holiday in France in July and August” unless the outbreak flares up again.He also expressed hope that restaurants would be able to reopen on June 2 in the country\u0027s green zones where the virus is not circulating widely.That would, however, rule out an immediate return of the dining scene in Paris, a virus hotspot red zone”.Italy’s government also threw a lifeline to its hard-hit tourism sector  by offering incentives for nationals to take their holidays in Il Bel Paese (The Beautiful Country) this summer.The holiday bonus will be given to families with a household income of less than €40,000.Families of three people or more will be entitled to €500, while couples will be given €300 and single people will receive €150.The bonus must be used to book a holiday in Italy between July 1 and the end of the year.The initiative was part of a long-awaited package of measures worth €55 billion designed to help the country recover from the pandemic, which has killed more than 30,000 people.Despite the severity of Italy’s outbreak, the government has also promised that Italians will be able to go on holiday this summer.Tourism accounts for around 15 per cent of Italy\u0027s GDP, or €270 billion a year.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"number nuisance calls spam texts britain plummets two thirds","story":"Nuisance calls and texts have plummeted by more than two thirds during the lockdown, latest figures obtained by The  have shown.Statistics from the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) show it recorded only 2,660 such calls and messages last month, a 76 per cent drop on the 11,078 in April last year.However, it comes as there were widespread reports on social media this week of junk calls returning as lockdown restrictions began to ease.The figures showed that calls and texts dropped precipitously as the UK went into lockdown in March to stem the spread of coronavirus. In January and February, spam communications were recorded at 8,379 and 8,991 respectively before dropping steeply in March to 6,484.The figures showed that the sharpest declines between February and April this year were in live and automated calls, which dropped 76 and 77 per cent in that time, as Covid-19 restrictions hit call centres and crowded workplaces.Yet this week, people across the UK started reporting a resurgence of spam calls.On Sunday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said that people who cannot work from home would be able to return if their employers are able to make their work environments safe for social distancing.One annoyed recipient, Donna Swabey, a language therapist from Glasgow, said on Twitter on Thursday: “Anyone noticed they\u0027ve started getting nuisance calls again after a few weeks\u0027 respite?”Another, Tim Jones tweeted: “Nice to see that the ‘life insurance review team’ nuisance calls have started up again. Not having a sales call in so long it was good to hear the silence before the pitch kicked in. Ah the good old days of blocking random numbers returns.”On Thursday, the consumer watchdog Which? warned that the ending of lockdown could see people start to be ‘flooded’ with nuisance calls as centres opened up again.Natalie Hitchins, Head of Home Products and Services at Which?, said: “Nuisance calls can have a huge emotional impact for the people who are plagued by them everyday and to make matters worse many of the cold calls reported to Which? often turn out to be scams.“As workplaces reopen and restrictions ease, cold colds may come flooding in again. We\u0027d advise consumers to continue reporting nuisance calls and texts to the Information Commissioner, so that they can take enforcement action against those companies who flout the law.”Meanwhile, the ICO figures showed that nuisance texts only dropped by less than a third, 29 per cent, between February and April.The ICO said that during lockdown it had detected a rise in text message scams ‘preying on people’s fears’ during the pandemic.A spokesman for the ICO said: “We’re also aware of a growing number of organisations using the public health emergency opportunistically to set up scams and contact vulnerable people using nuisance calls, unsolicited emails, and spam texts.“In recent weeks we’ve seen an increase in complaints about nuisance marketing clearly aimed at preying on people’s fears and we are prioritising such cases.”Earlier this week, the Chartered Trading Standards Institute (CTSI) warned people are already being targeted by text scams pretending to be from the NHS contact-tracing app. The app is currently being trialled on the Isle of Wight ahead of being rolled out to the rest of the country.The CTSI said it had uncovered phishing operations sending people bogus texts that told them they needed to contact someone who has tested positive for Covid-19. A link would then take them to a sham site where they would be asked to enter personal details, which can be used by scammers in identity theft crimes.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2015/12/23/17/Dictionary.jpg","title":"ai new word does not exist gpt 2","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.The algorithm was developed by an ex-Instagram engineer who helped build the app\u0027s recommendation algorithmA new AI has been created to generate words that do not exist.The one-shot website develops new, artificially-generated definitions for the non-existent words.ThisWordDoesNotExist generates new words such as “wacamole” (a single serving of waffle batter made with a sweet cornmeal mixture), “pileset” (form a mass of, or make a shape about, something), or “prayman” (the principal or leading men in a society or enterprise).Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesUsers click a button on the site, and a new word is made.The website was developed by San Francisco-based developer Thomas Dimson, an engineer who used to work for the Facebook-owned Instagram developing its recommendations algorithm.

More than 40 per cent of those surveyed said sale prices could drop by more than 4 per cent this year.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesPredictions on house prices vary wildly thanks to huge uncertainty about the economic impact of the virus. A forecast by the Centre for Economics and Business Research was more gloomy, pointing to an estimated 13 per cent drop in average house prices.It came as the government announced plans this week to reopen the housing market, which has ground to a halt during the pandemic thanks to a ban on almost all home moves. That meant around £82bn of sales had stalled, according to property website Zoopla.Seven charts that show the true scale of the UK coronavirus outbreak‘They can blame it for everything’: What coronavirus means for BrexitThe Americans who think that coronavirus is a hoaxDo you need a face mask and where can you buy one?UK lockdown: Can I see my family and friends under new rules?Other measures aimed at helping homeowners attracted criticism on Thursday as it emerged that taking a payment holiday on mortgages or other forms of debt could affect someone’s ability to borrow money in future.The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) told lenders to help people struggling financially during the pandemic by temporarily halting payments on credit cards, personal loans and mortgages for up to three months.Borrowers had been told this would not affect their credit score, but MoneySavingExpert highlighted on Thursday that some lenders take other factors into account when deciding whether to grant borrowing.Interest still builds up during a payment holiday, leaving borrowers with a larger bill to pay afterwards.The number of mortgages in arrears increased slightly in the first three months of the year, figures from trade body UK Finance showed.Some 72,380 homeowner mortgages were behind by more than 2.5 per cent of the outstanding balance, compared to 70,880 in the fourth quarter of 2019, figures from UK Finance show.That number is expected to rise in the second quarter as households begin to feel the impact of Covid-19 on their finances.The FCA announced on Thursday that insurance customers will be able to request payment holidays from next week. Some may also be able to move onto a cheaper deal or get a partial refund of the cost of their policy.The measures will come into force on Monday 18 May and be reviewed in the next three months. Customers’ risk profiles may have changed because of coronavirus and there may be scope to offer customers lower premiums, the FCA said.​No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Losses could widen further if lockdown measures are extended into the next quarter, making the bill for Covid-19 bigger than the 911 terrorist attacks and all the devastating Caribbean hurricanes of 2017 combined, Lloyd’s warned on Thursday.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesIt said that Covid-19 was “vastly different” to natural disasters that have previously racked up big losses for insurers. Those events were geographically contained whereas the pandemic is global, systemic and will have a longer-term impact.“Lloyd’s believes that once the scale and complexity of the social and economic impact of Covid-19 is fully understood, the overall cost to the global insurance non-life industry is likely to be far in excess of those historical events,” the insurance market said.Seven charts that show the true scale of the UK coronavirus outbreak‘They can blame it for everything’: What coronavirus means for BrexitThe Americans who think that coronavirus is a hoaxDo you need a face mask and where can you buy one?UK lockdown: Can I see my family and friends under new rules?Some $28bn is expected to be paid in 2020 across a wide range of policies, including event cancellation, property and travel. Further payouts are expected as the effects of Covid-19 continue to unfold, on policies such as professional indemnity and credit insurance.Lloyd’s chief executive John Neal said: “The global insurance industry is paying out on a very wide range of policies to support businesses and people affected by Covid-19. The Lloyd’s market alone is currently expected to pay claims amounting to some $4.3bn, making it one of the market’s largest payouts ever.“What makes Covid-19 unique is not just the devastating continuing human and social impact, but also the economic shock.“Taking all those factors together will challenge the industry as never before, but we will keep focused on supporting our customers and continuing to pay claims over the weeks and months ahead.”Llloyd’s paid out $4.8bn in 2017 as three of the most damaging hurricanes in history destroyed parts of the Caribbean. After 911 it paid out $4.7bn.Lloyd’s said that its estimates for 2020 assume that social distancing and some form of lockdown continue to the end of the year.

Matlis asked whether the coronavirus had seen him glued to the news. “Well yes and no,” Brooker replied. “For the first couple of weeks of this I was sort of glued to the news, reading everything I could, radio was constantly on and…” He paused before continuing: “It’s like eating fruit, isn’t it? If you watch a lot of the news, it’s good for you up to a point, but then it gives you the s***s. You have to limit it, you have to eat it in small portions.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesMatlis also asked him whether he had any scripts written about pandemics that were now ruined due to the coronavirus. “Well, now that would be a first world problem” Brooker joked.“It’s certainly weird,” he continued. “And it’s the sort of thing I have long worried about happening and now its happened so in that respect not a script and more it’s like the world has reached into my head and stolen some of my nightmare fuel that’s probably kept me awake for years.”Avatar 2: Kate Winslet swims on set in first-look photo at sequelNew Woody Allen film shunned by cast tops global box office Matlis also asked whether Brooker thought it was important in these difficult times for the media to be patriotic. In response, the 49-year-old said: “There’s a role in discriminating accurate information and there’s a role in providing comfort and a sense of community. That doesn’t necessarily have to be: ‘We’re great because we’re British.’ “There’s not much point in banging on about what island we’re on. But it’s a perfectly valid thing to want escapism at this time, it’s valid, it’s important. But that’s not the same thing as blindly supporting the government or blindly opposing it either.”Viewers were left in stitches after hearing Brooker’s comments about watching the news.“@charltonbrooker saying fruit gives you the s***s on #Newsnight has really brightened up my day”, said one.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Comets rare enough to be seen without needing to use a telescope are rare, Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe show could be seen in the coming weeks, becoming most clearly visible at the end of May and beginning of June.Comet Swan came closest to Earth on 13 May, when it will swing by around 53 million miles away. It will then carry on to get closer to the Sun on 27 May, before sailing back off through the solar system.Nasa shares images of \u0027doomed\u0027 Comet Atlas as it breaks into piecesThe behaviour of comets is notoriously difficult to predict, especially as they fly closer to the Sun. Just weeks ago, starwatchers had been hoping to get a glimpse of the comet Atlas as it headed past Earth – but it broke up on its way, leaving a series of impressive if somewhat tragic photos.As comets get nearer to the Sun, and the temperature gets hotter, they tend to heat up and start shedding material in a dust trail that can be visible in images. The ice, dust and rock that makes up a comet can then break up or become more visible, and it is difficult to know how any given object will behave in the circumstances.The Comet Swan was first spotted last month, by an amateur astronomer called Michael Mattiazzo. He saw it in data from an instrument on the SOHO satellite called Solar Wind Anisotropies or Swan, which gives the object its name.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas flom fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telelscope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

More than 40 per cent of those surveyed said sale prices could drop by more than 4 per cent this year.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesPredictions on house prices vary wildly thanks to huge uncertainty about the economic impact of the virus. A forecast by the Centre for Economics and Business Research was more gloomy, pointing to an estimated 13 per cent drop in average house prices.It came as the government announced plans this week to reopen the housing market, which has ground to a halt during the pandemic thanks to a ban on almost all home moves. That meant around £82bn of sales had stalled, according to property website Zoopla.Seven charts that show the true scale of the UK coronavirus outbreak‘They can blame it for everything’: What coronavirus means for BrexitThe Americans who think that coronavirus is a hoaxDo you need a face mask and where can you buy one?UK lockdown: Can I see my family and friends under new rules?Other measures aimed at helping homeowners attracted criticism on Thursday as it emerged that taking a payment holiday on mortgages or other forms of debt could affect someone’s ability to borrow money in future.The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) told lenders to help people struggling financially during the pandemic by temporarily halting payments on credit cards, personal loans and mortgages for up to three months.Borrowers had been told this would not affect their credit score, but MoneySavingExpert highlighted on Thursday that some lenders take other factors into account when deciding whether to grant borrowing.Interest still builds up during a payment holiday, leaving borrowers with a larger bill to pay afterwards.The number of mortgages in arrears increased slightly in the first three months of the year, figures from trade body UK Finance showed.Some 72,380 homeowner mortgages were behind by more than 2.5 per cent of the outstanding balance, compared to 70,880 in the fourth quarter of 2019, figures from UK Finance show.That number is expected to rise in the second quarter as households begin to feel the impact of Covid-19 on their finances.The FCA announced on Thursday that insurance customers will be able to request payment holidays from next week. Some may also be able to move onto a cheaper deal or get a partial refund of the cost of their policy.The measures will come into force on Monday 18 May and be reviewed in the next three months. Customers’ risk profiles may have changed because of coronavirus and there may be scope to offer customers lower premiums, the FCA said.​No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Losses could widen further if lockdown measures are extended into the next quarter, making the bill for Covid-19 bigger than the 911 terrorist attacks and all the devastating Caribbean hurricanes of 2017 combined, Lloyd’s warned on Thursday.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesIt said that Covid-19 was “vastly different” to natural disasters that have previously racked up big losses for insurers. Those events were geographically contained whereas the pandemic is global, systemic and will have a longer-term impact.“Lloyd’s believes that once the scale and complexity of the social and economic impact of Covid-19 is fully understood, the overall cost to the global insurance non-life industry is likely to be far in excess of those historical events,” the insurance market said.Seven charts that show the true scale of the UK coronavirus outbreak‘They can blame it for everything’: What coronavirus means for BrexitThe Americans who think that coronavirus is a hoaxDo you need a face mask and where can you buy one?UK lockdown: Can I see my family and friends under new rules?Some $28bn is expected to be paid in 2020 across a wide range of policies, including event cancellation, property and travel. Further payouts are expected as the effects of Covid-19 continue to unfold, on policies such as professional indemnity and credit insurance.Lloyd’s chief executive John Neal said: “The global insurance industry is paying out on a very wide range of policies to support businesses and people affected by Covid-19. The Lloyd’s market alone is currently expected to pay claims amounting to some $4.3bn, making it one of the market’s largest payouts ever.“What makes Covid-19 unique is not just the devastating continuing human and social impact, but also the economic shock.“Taking all those factors together will challenge the industry as never before, but we will keep focused on supporting our customers and continuing to pay claims over the weeks and months ahead.”Llloyd’s paid out $4.8bn in 2017 as three of the most damaging hurricanes in history destroyed parts of the Caribbean. After 911 it paid out $4.7bn.Lloyd’s said that its estimates for 2020 assume that social distancing and some form of lockdown continue to the end of the year.

Reduced energy demand more generally also saw a drop in output from fossil fuel power stations.Recent data from multiple environmental organisations has revealed a massive\u0026nbspdrop in CO2 emissions in 2020, showing that the coronavirus pandemic has caused the biggest carbon crash on record.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesData from Carbon Brief and the International Energy Agency (IEA) reveal the unprecedented\u0026nbspscale of the emissions decline, which is six-times larger than the previous record reduction that followed the 2007-2008 Financial Crisis.Projected figures for 2020 forecast the biggest ever percentage drop in CO2 emissions - more than any previous war or global economic crisis.There has also been a huge reduction\u0026nbspin air pollution in the form of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) emissions.NO2 is\u0026nbspreleased when fossil fuels are burned in cars, airplanes and other combustion engines, contributing to the formation of harmful smog that causes respiratory and other serious health problems.Stay at home orders that were in place across the UK throughout April saw NO2 emissions plunge, as people avoided driving, flying and using public transport.The reduction in NO2 and other pollutants as a result of the coronavirus lockdown has resulted in 11,000 fewer deaths from air pollution in Europe, according to the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA).A recent CREA report also revealed that reduced energy demand during lockdown resulted in power generation from coal falling by 37 per cent across Europe in April.

The high street chemist was seeking to recruit hundreds of people on behalf of ministers striving to hit a target of 200,000 Covid-19 tests a day. But unions and opposition parties criticised the call for volunteers to work as swab testers, accusing the government of trying to take advantage of the goodwill of the public. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesLegal experts also warned that Boots could be risking investigation under minimum-wage legislation. Other firms, such as Sodexo, are also advertising for roles at drive-through testing sites, but at rates of up to £13.50 an hour. The company also suggests it would be desirable for applicants to have a medical, clinical or health background.Seven charts that show the true scale of the UK coronavirus outbreak‘They can blame it for everything’: What coronavirus means for BrexitThe Americans who think that coronavirus is a hoaxDo you need a face mask and where can you buy one?UK lockdown: Can I see my family and friends under new rules?Boots has now removed the advertisements from its own website and other job sites. Sources within the company said the expectation was that the adverts seeking volunteer coronavirus testers would be reposted after a review. They stressed that the company was acting on behalf of the government and that the requirement to work “at least” 32 hours a week was not intended to be binding. But the high street giant is facing calls to advertise the positions again only when there are generous terms and conditions attached. The adverts were first revealed by The Independent earlier this week. In response Unison said the roles took the idea of volunteering “too far”. One advert stated that Boots was seeking to recruit “up to 1,000” volunteers and current Boots staff to fill the roles.   Applicants were promised full personal protective equipment, in line with NHS standards, as well as training.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Volunteers were also told the job would involve standing for hours at a time and require enough mobility to “be able to reach into a vehicle to take swabs of both throat and nasal passages at potentially awkward angles”. Recruits would be expected to be able to work “at least” 32 hours a week, according to the advertisements.  Sources close to Matt Hancock, the health secretary, defended the use of volunteers, saying they had long been part of the successful national fight against the global pandemic. In a statement, a Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson also said that the speed at which the government had increased its testing capacity was “unprecedented and a real success made possible by fantastic teamwork between the government, key private companies and amazing volunteers”.Stewart McDonald, the SNP MP for Glasgow South, said: “I’m glad to hear that this has been withdrawn – quite why they thought this would go down well is beyond me. It was poor judgement that Boots can now rectify by advertising these positions with the generous terms and conditions that they deserve to be attached to them.”Andy McDonald, from Labour’s shadow cabinet, said: “These ads should never have been posted. This is medical work that is physically and mentally demanding and it should not be voluntary.“The fact the government sanctioned this raises serious questions about its attitude to workers’ rights and suggests it is not learning the lessons from the pandemic.”Sir Ed Davey, acting Lib Dem leader, said: “Nationwide testing to keep people safe is crucial for relaxing the lockdown, so it was always ludicrous to see companies depending on volunteers.“The government should never have tried to take advantage of the public’s willingness to help fight the virus.“The testing strategy is incredibly important and must be treated as such – those performing the tests for coronavirus should be formally employed, trained and paid.”“Not only that, but all those willing to take on the role deserve to have all the benefits that come with employment. When thousands of people across the country are struggling to get by, it was scandalous to try and get them to work on the front line unpaid. If these job adverts are to be put back up, they must be a part of a formal employment offer – nothing less is acceptable.”Sara Gorton, Unison’s head of health, said: “It’s good to see the ad’s been withdrawn. Hopefully it won’t be back.“Increasing testing is crucial. As well as maximising capacity in NHS labs, ministers should be using some of the 40,000 experienced health workers who’ve come out of retirement, not relying on private firms who expect people to work for free.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It’s just horrible to think of it in this day and age. I’ve had help from some brilliant volunteers too. I’ve got three young girls at home and I hope they’re learning something about giving back to the community from all this.“I think The Felix Project is doing fantastic work right now. Stopping food going to waste is such a brilliant thing.”Tim Young decided last month to start volunteering with Bread n Butter: a social enterprise in Barnet getting up to 600 cooked meals and food parcels out each day, thanks to around 80 crates of produce supplied weekly by The Felix Project.The 55-year-old – who is still recovering from a heart operation he had earlier this year – has been cooking up to 150 meals a week from his own kitchen.“I’m relatively lucky, I’ve got quite a big kitchen and lots of pots and pans – so I wanted to do what I could. It’s hard to see how much people are struggling at the moment, because the level of need seems to be going up and up. But it’s a pretty good feeling being able to help others out.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The social enterprise adapted to the crisis by delivering free meals to vulnerable people’s doors and NHS hospitals.“I thought they were doing such important work, so I was delighted to lend a hand and do some of the cooking,” said Mr Young. “The Felix Project is doing amazing work too and all the food they’re supplying is fantastic. I’m so glad it isn’t going to waste. It’s going to the people who need it most.”The Felix Project has quadrupled its deliveries since the beginning of the lockdown to 40 tons a day, and supplies more than 100 charities, school groups, hostels and community hubs across London.The Independent is encouraging readers to help groups across the UK that are trying to feed the hungry during the crisis – find out how you can help here.

If the people putting these horrific traps think they may be helping in some way, all they will do is add to the pressures on our hospitals.”The first traps — essentially nails hammered through wood — appeared in the area’s Margrove Woods at the beginning of May. More have since been laid there with others also being reported at a range of other spots including Guisborough Forest.Janclare Miller, whose husband Paul had to call for a lift home after his bike tyre was punctured by one, said: “They had been buried under the soil and leaves so he didn’t see them the first time.“I couldn’t believe it all I kept thinking was what could have happened if he had fallen on them?”Speaking to the local Gazette newspaper, she added: “He’s lucky he only rode over it. I dread to think what could have happened if he had fallen, or if a child had.”The revelation comes on the same day North Yorkshire Police said they had spoken to a former parish councillor and retired teacher who had admitted building a blockade of rocks and branches across a cyclist trail in woodland near Leyburn.Created with Sketch.Care home hit by coronavirus: A rare glimpse of life inside Show all 18Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Jack Dodsley, 79, with a carer in PPE at Newfield Nursing HomeJackie Wilson, a healthcare assistant, wearing PPE before going into roomsJack Dodsley, 79, speaks to a carer at Newfield Nursing HomeCarers working at Newfield Nursing HomeJack Dodsley, 79, sits with a carerJack Dodsley, 79, with a carer in PPEA staff member at Newfield Nursing Home looks after a residentA carer helps Jack Dodsley, 79, from his chairA staff member at Newfield Nursing HomeA carer brings food to a resident at Newfield Nursing HomeJack Dodsley, 79, with a carer in PPEA staff member puts on PPE at Newfield Nursing HomeJackie Wilson, a healthcare assistant, puts on PPE before she enters a roomA bench at Newfield Nursing HomeJack Dodsley, 79, with a carer in PPE at Newfield Nursing HomeJackie Wilson, a healthcare assistant, wearing PPE before going into roomsJack Dodsley, 79, speaks to a carer at Newfield Nursing HomeCarers working at Newfield Nursing HomeJack Dodsley, 79, sits with a carerJack Dodsley, 79, with a carer in PPEA staff member at Newfield Nursing Home looks after a residentA carer helps Jack Dodsley, 79, from his chairA staff member at Newfield Nursing HomeA carer brings food to a resident at Newfield Nursing HomeJack Dodsley, 79, with a carer in PPEA staff member puts on PPE at Newfield Nursing HomeJackie Wilson, a healthcare assistant, puts on PPE before she enters a roomA bench at Newfield Nursing HomeIn a statement about the nail traps, a spokesperson for Cleveland Police said it had made the Forestry Commission aware of the traps and that officers would now patrol the areas affected.They said: “Police would also like to make it clear that anyone who is caught planting the traps will be arrested and will be potentially left with a criminal record.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But even if they were to open, separate research by online data firm Statista shows that a significant proportion of people would still be unwilling to visit them.More than half of the 713 UK adults questioned in the Statista Covid-19 Barometer survey, which was conducted between 4-10 May, said they would avoid restaurants, pubs, cinemas and large events, even if lockdown restrictions were lifted.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

I was having a Zoom drink with a friend and it got to a stage where I was so exhausted. I thought maybe I was just a bit hungover or was in a weird mood but then it continued and I felt exhausted the next night on another Zoom call.”How to support our campaignHer condition deteriorated rapidly. “I was having to consciously remember to breathe,” she added. “My lungs hurt. It was really scary. I was an alien for a while, I could barely speak. I wasn’t sure if I would make it.”Ms Khan rang 111, who told her to wait it out at home and see if she got worse. But within days, she said she couldn’t even walk. “I felt weak and dizzy. I couldn’t move at all, I was just on the sofa, trying to remember to breathe. I thought I might be having a heart attack or a stroke. My left side felt numb.”A friend called 999 on her behalf and medics came to her home. Ms Khan said: “They checked my vitals and they were happy enough with me. My oxygen levels were OK\u0026nbspand they said it might be that I was fatigued.“They said sometimes people get another blow when they are almost over the virus and that is what probably happened to me. It felt like an exorcism.” At the peak of her illness, Ms Khan went online to seek help. The artist, whose mother is in her seventies and is isolating so could not provide support, found out about Help The Hungry via Facebook, where she was connected with Made In Hackney.For the past three weeks, the musician\u0026nbsphas been receiving daily meals via the organisation. The service has made her life “so much easier”, she said.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I am on universal credit as I am meant to be launching my music career, but that has taken a back seat now.Help The Hungry: Where our readers have led, the government followsWembley Stadium taken over by food charity“I have been using Made In Hackney for about three weeks. I have a daily meal, like tofu curry. I can’t cook at the moment, I am not strong enough, especially with my arthritis my body is just not in a good way. I am still exhausted. It has been a real lifeline to know I will be fed once a day.”Ms Khan is slowly on the mend but says her previous conditions have worsened.

That fresh air, though. God, amazing.”Test everyone in Norwich for Covid-19 weekly, say scientistsJohnson and Starmer clash over care home deaths and global stats: liveMPs accuse Deliveroo of ‘putting people at risk’‘Very likely’ some unexplained care home deaths due to Covid-19She, along with housemate Holly Clifton and dog Charlie, had driven an hour and half to be at Ilam Park for 10am. They planned on staying all day: walking, exploring and taking photos. They’d ended up bringing that tent as it happened – “just in case”.Their enthusiasm was shared by many here. One couple, Gurpreet and Helen Randhawa, said the lockdown constituted the longest they had ever been without going on a hike together since they first met at a university hiking club. They were now 28 and 29, and had seven-month-old daughter Jasmine in tow.“Every walk we’ve done over the last couple of months has started and finished at our front door,” said Helen, a software developer. “That’s in Derby so not exactly the great outdoors.”Another visitor, Greg Butler, was a landscape photographer. “I’ve been taking a lot of pictures in my garden in Leek,” he said as he set up his camera at Dovedale Stepping Stones. “It’s not quite the same.”The only problem is, perhaps, that for people actually living here in the Peak District – a 550 square mile stretch of rural uplands spreading across six different counties – those roads signs which visitors encounter are not expressing an out-of-date sentiment. They are not there because the owners have forgotten to take them down. “Stay home” is still meant by many in the towns and villages here.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

People have spent nine weeks isolating and they fear that hard work will be wasted if the virus is brought into their communities now.”However, he accepts that visitors’ reasons for descending on the area appear well-founded enough.How coronavirus has changed life on a single UK streetNumbers coming here have already been on the rise over the last couple of weeks after a drop of 95 per cent in the first fortnight of the lockdown, according to figures compiled by the Peak District National Park Authority (PDNPA).Although there was no obvious uptick on Wednesday, the feeling is that eased restrictions will probably see significantly more people arriving over the weekend. That, in turn, could make social distancing far more difficult. If that sounds implausible in such a wide open space, think of the pictures of people snaking up Everest and you have an idea of what, for instance, Derwent Edge can look like on a summer’s day.As a result, both Sarah Fowler, chief executive of the PDNPA, and Richard Fitzherbert, chairman of Derbyshire Dales District Council, have, separately, urged people to reconsider any trips they may be planning.“Continuing to use local parks and outdoor areas close to your home can continue to provide the crucial breathing space for you and for us,” said Ms Fowler.Visitors, councillor Fitzherbert told The Independent meanwhile, brought considerable risk to locals but – given local shops, cafes, pubs, hotels and attractions were all largely shut – almost no economic benefits. Essentially: the worst of both worlds? “To some extent, yes,” he says.Yet, nonetheless, back at Dovedale, on a Wednesday morning, when visitors often have 20 metres, let alone two, separating them from others, it seems churlish to suggest they shouldn’t be here.“We’ve spent nine weeks unable to escape the concrete jungle,” said Simon Davis, visiting from Coventry with partner Leanne Farrell and their two children Annabelle, 6, and two-year-old Eden. They have been to parks, added nursery nurse Leanne, but “you have a toddler with you and they just end up getting upset because they see the swings and can’t go on them.”Do they appreciate why residents here may be worried? They do but believe a balance needs to be struck. “The Peak District belongs to us all,” said 32-year-old caterer Simon. “Just because you live here, you don’t have a right to ban others, do you?”The family were to have a picnic later. “We’re not going into any shops or even into the villages,” he said. “How can that be a risk to anyone?”It was a question that at least a couple of residents felt had some merit. Retired teachers David and Sue Crossfield were out walking in Ilam Park when approached – from two metres – by The Independent. As it happens, they explained, they lived in nearby Ashbourne, in the Peak.“We’re very lucky,” said Sue. “It’s a beautiful part of the world. We must remember that, be generous and not begrudge others coming here to share it, especially in a time of crisis.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

After weeks of tense negotiations, the embattled premier had hammered out a power-sharing deal with his rival-turned-ally Benny Gantz, and secured the support of his elections partners, giving him the 61-seat majority needed to form a ruling coalition.The incoming cabinet, which comprises of 32 ministers and is Israel’s largest, was supposed to be inaugurated late on Thursday, ending a nearly 18-month deadlock that has brought the country to a virtual standstill. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesBut with just a few hours to go, Mr Netanyahu requested the session be postponed until Sunday as Likud members bickered over who would be appointed to the cabinet. Israeli media reported that several Likud lawmakers were so furious they had decided to boycott the inauguration. “Prime minister Netanyahu asked Gantz to postpone the swearing-in ceremony until Sunday so as to enable him to finalise ministerial appointments within Likud,” read a joint statement released by Likud and Mr Gantz’s Blue and White party. “Gantz agreed to Netanyahu’s request,” it added.Pompeo flies to Israel despite coronavirus to discuss peace planBlue and White had initially opposed the postponement, with Mr Gantz insisting the swearing-in take place at all costs, according to Israeli media.Mr Netanyahu has billed the incoming government as an emergency body that would break the political stalemate and bring rival factions together to fight the deadly coronavirus, after three inconclusive elections left the country leaderless once again. But it has sparked controversy as Mr Gantz, the country’s ex-army chief, had initially vowed never to join forces with Mr Netanyahu, after he was indicted on multiple corruptions charges, which he denies. Critics have said the sole purpose of the government is to keep Mr Netanyahu in office: under the deal he remains prime minister for 18 more months before Mr Gantz, the new defence minister, takes over and they swap roles for the remaining 18-month period.

Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailMeanwhile, bitter battles have erupted within the coalition over ministerial appointments.Likud is set to take the finance, education and health ministries, key positions during the coronavirus outbreak, while the country’s foreign and justice portfolios have been given to Blue and White.However Israeli media reported that many key Likud lawmakers were upset by the decisions made, and some had even revolted saying they would boycott the swearing-in ceremony.Channel 12’s political commentator Amit Segal called the delay “less a drama, and more a farce”. Israel has been led by a toothless caretaker government since early 2019 as no political leader was able to scrape together enough seats across three separate elections. Israel’s top court paves way for Netanyahu’s unity deal with Gatnz From Israel to the US, coronavirus supplies are going awryWhy Netanyahu is the real winner in Israel’s power-sharing dealNetanyahu self-isolating after aide tests positive for Covid-19Jewish and Muslim paramedics pray together in Israel amid outbreakMr Netanyahu’s popularity had been dented as he campaigned under the shadow of three graft trials. Mr Gantz, who also failed to drum up enough support on his own, had initially sworn never to sit with a prime minister on trial but made a dramatic U-turn earlier this year with the spectre of a fourth election on the horizon.And so, it remains unclear in which direction the unwieldy new government, populated by political rivals, will take the country.Under the isive power-sharing deal, for an initial six-month period, the emergency government is only be permitted to bring legislation to the parliament that concerns the fight against Covid-19, while a negotiating committee hammers out its “policy outline”.Israel has implemented one of the strictest lockdowns as 16,500 people were infected with the deadly disease and 262 more have died.But analysts say far from being preoccupied with Covid-19, which Israel appears to have under control, the sole focus of the body will be ensuring Mr Netanyahu stays in power.Amos Harel, a defence expert at Israeli daily Haaretz, said that Mr Netanyahu is “the only political persona that matters” and warned that, despite the deal, Mr Gantz many never make prime minister.“The coronavirus no longer seems to be a huge issue as it was a month ago. The economic and financial complications of the lockdown are more challenging than the health struggle,” he told The Independent.This is a national unity government to save Netanyahu“In the end, this is a national unity government to save Netanyahu. Everything should be looked through the lens of what is best for his survival.“There is nothing balanced about the relationship between Netanyahu and Gantz.”Mr Gantz, the country’s ex-army chief, and Mr Netanyahu have been bitter rivals for the last 18 months and disagree on many key issues which may flare in the coming months.The incumbent prime minister has vowed to immediately push ahead with the annexation of the strategic Jordan Valley in the occupied West Bank, after receiving what appeared to be the green light from the Trump administration.Mr Gantz has insisted that annexation will not be unilateral but instead implemented “in coordination with the international community”.The debacle over the inauguration came a day after an extraordinary one-day trip by US secretary of state Mike Pompeo, who flew to Israel despite coronavirus restrictions to discuss the pandemic, Donald Trump’s peace plan, annexation and Iran.After the meetings with both Mr Netanyahu and Mr Gantz, state department officials were keen to downplay reports the purpose of the visit was to advance Israel’s immediate seizure of occupied territory, saying in a briefing they wanted to “dispel the notion that we flew halfway around the world to talk about annexation”.Mr Netanyahu’s elections promise to immediately seize the strategic Jordan Valley has been heavily criticised by Jordan, Gulf states as well as the UK and the European Union, which is reportedly mulling sanctions.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Indeed, in a worst-case scenario, we may never find a vaccine.So our plan must countenance a situation where we are in this, together, for the long haul, even while doing all we can to avoid that outcome.WHAT’S the UK doing A potential vaccine being developed at the University of Oxford has begun its human trials — the first in Europe.HOW will it be produced The Oxford study has linked up with UK pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca to mass produce the potential vaccine on a not-for-profit basis for the duration of the pandemic.WHEN will one be available Most experts reckon by mid- but the Oxford team are saying they will knowtheirs works by this summer.IS there a drug to treat the coronavirus Early results of a US trial suggest antiviral drug remdesivir cuts the number of days patients take to leave hospital by almost a third.HOW does it work Remdesivir, originally developed to treat Ebola, targets a cell enzyme the virus needs.IS it a game changer Potentially. Dr Anthony Fauci, leading member of the US coronavirus task force, said: “What it has proven is that a drug can block this virus.” But a second trial in China showed no benefit.WHO is looking for a drug cure There are around  clinical trials going on worldwideOxford isnt the only British university attacking coronavirus.Hancock also announced a boost of £.million to Imperial College London for its vaccine research.Meanwhile, Boris Johnson has asked world leaders to commit £.bn for coronavirus vaccine research, as the Prime Minsiter wants countries to copy the UK in pledging £m to the cause.There are reportedly around  groups across the globe working to find a vaccine, as there remains no preventative measure for Covid- at the moment and no real treatment either.Imperial College London and University Hospital Southampton have offered up to £ as they advertised for people to take part in trials.On April , Britains Business Secretary Alok Sharma said that the Government has set up a vaccine task force to accelerate the development of a coronavirus vaccine - one that is hoped to be made available as soon as possible.The task force will be facilitating trials, working in the UK and internationally.He confirmed that the Government has green-lighted  research projects - with £m going towards them.Sharma said that we cannot put a date on when we will make a vaccine, but hopes that through the best of British scientic endeavour, it will be available soon.The first human volunteers were injected with an experimental jab in Seattle in mid-March.Professor Robin Shattock, head of mucosal infection and immunity at Imperial College London, said further human trials could begin in coming months with testing on mice currently looking promising.He told Independent: Currently we have a prototype vaccine in animal models where the early results are encouraging.We are hoping to progress to clinical testing by the summer depending on obtaining sufficient funds for the next stage.Another potential vaccine is being developed by cigarette manufacturer British American Tobacco .The Benson and Hedges maker said on April  it could produce between  to  million doses per week by Junetesting goes well, but it will need support from government agencies.The London-listed company says it will begin clinical trials on humans after running pre-clinical tests.The treatment is being developed by the companys bio-health ision, Kentucky BioProcessing .KBP previously came up with a drug to combat Ebola.It claims to have found an antibody that appears to fight Covid-, using genetically modied tobacco plants, but needs US drug authorities to fast-track permissions.US drugmaker Gilead Sciences Inc is testing an experimental Ebola antiviral therapy, remdesivir, on patients with coronavirus in China and Japan - with positive signs so far.In Wuhan where the virus outbreak began, Chinas Changjiang Daily reported that researchers at Zhejiang University have found that drugs Abidol and Darunavir can inhibit the virus in vitro cell experiments.And scientists in Australia have developed a lab-grown version of the virus, a major step toward creating a vaccine.Meanwhile, over in Germany, CureVac are also working on a vaccine, with majority investor and owner of football club Hoffenheim - Dietmar Hopp - revealing that a breakthrough could be made in the next six to seven months.Talking to Sport, he said: It has to be tested first with animals then with human beings.But I think it could be available in autumn at the time when possibly the next wave of infections will come.Hopp, having already gained headlines for protests in football stadiums, revealed that the vaccine will not be privatised after German reports claimed US President Donald Trump was looking to secure some of the scientists working on the project.A vaccine normally takes years or even a decade - but this is unlikely to be the case with coronavirus.Researchers, like Dr Kate Broderick, and Yuen Kwok-yung, from the University of Hong Kong, predict that the fully formed and licensed vaccine will be available from early summer but it will still take at least one year evenexpedited.”The news comes as the global research community steps up its efforts to halt the fatal epidemic.Teams around the world are working on their own vaccines, a process that typically takes at least a decade.British-America Tobaccos scientic research director Dr David O’Reilly said vaccine development was challenging and complex work, but he believes the company has made a signicant breakthrough with its tobacco plant technology .Researchers in Australia revealed they had successfully synthesised the virus in the laboratory, using a sample from an infected patient.The sequencing and publication by Chinese scientists of the viral genome in only a few days, compared to the five months it took during the  Sars outbreak, is considered to be a game-changer.Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: The UK is one of the first countries to have developed a world-leading test for the new coronavirus.It has similar symptoms to the common cold, making it tricky to identy early.The NHS states the key symptoms are:Doctors may order laboratory tests on respiratory specimens and serum, part of your blood, to detect human coronaviruses.The testing is more likelyyou are suspected of having Mers .A No spokesman said: “The NHS is doing a fantastic job and the nation will want to find a way to say thank you when we have defeated this virus.”SAS hero Andy McNab added: “The award of a George Cross would show an emotional appreciation.”We are asking our readers to please sign the petition below.The UK Government has bought . million antibody home testing kits to ensure more people are tested quickly and simply without having to leave home.On March , , the Government announced the tests would soon be available to the masses, including NHS workers.The Health Secretary pledged to test , Brits a day for coronavirus - but the nation appears to be falling behind this target.Patients in hospital are quarantined and treated for their symptoms to try and help their bodies fight off the virus and prevent it spreading.In cases exhibiting pneumonia, around  per cent, patients are given oxygen and sometimes a ventilator.If their lungs become too inflamed then doctors work to relieve the pressure on other organs.In less severe cases patients are given a drip for dehydration or ibuprofen for pain relief while the body fights the infection.These treatments are reportedly effective for the most part.There are currently unveried theories that HIV medication could work too as it allegedly did with the  Sars virus, but it is only suggested for last-ditch compassionate use for extreme cases of coronavirus.Other than treatment, detection, sanitation and quarantine measures are being used to restrict the spread of the virus."},{"url":null,"title":"free paper delivery 6 weeks","story":"This means no one has to miss out on their favourite daily read.Simply head online to delivermynewspaper then search your postcode and choose your local newsagent.Select “The Sun” and let us know how often you would like to receive your newspaper.Finally, fill in your details and click “Send My Vouchers”.Vouchers for  weeks of free delivery will be posted to your address.Take these vouchers with you to your chosen newsagent to claim your free -week delivery.Alternatively, you can get your free delivery vouchers by calling us directly on   .Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The public’s response to this challenge has been magnicent, but there is an urgent need to get Britain working again.The cost of the furlough scheme alone is already an eye-watering £billion and is spiralling by an unsustainable £.billion a day.Our poll shows most people are far more afraid of a second wave of coronavirus than the risk of losing their jobs.

I wanted him to die,” she told Channel  cheerleaders.The Harry Potter star is the authentic voice of Corbynistas who loathe this Prime Minister with a visceral hatred.If they can’t dance on his grave, the Dementors will do everything possible to kill his political career.Covid- has morphed from a battle for the nation’s health into a lethal struggle to stop Boris leading Britain successfully out of lockdown.An early victory came last night, as the PM unveiled his new slow-motion escape motto.Some ministers hoped for: “Back to work. Go to school. Save the economy.”Instead we heard a feeble “Stay alert. Control the virus. Save lives.”This is a Prime Minister paralysed by indecision, kicking himself for unforced errors, terried of being blamed for every new death.Downing Street is now hostage to the health-and-safety mafia, whipped into line by opportunist public sector unions who have, to coin a phrase, taken back control.Teaching unions, already on guaranteed public sector pay, even want to restrict some online lessons for education-hungry kids.Transport unions are making Tube, rail and bus travel impossible with draconian social distancing.Health unions blame ministers for blunders made by NHS and Public Health England managers.We are in thrall to a shroud-waving public sector “blob” warning of mass fatalitiesthe Government makes one  step.We must heed the experts who swallowed “Bonking Professor” Neil Ferguson’s crackpot forecasts of half a million dead without lockdown.They are the same experts whose advice on testing, PPE and care homes led to one of the world’s biggest death tolls.The nation’s long-term physical, mental and economic health is being held to ransom by a bug which has virtually no impact on children, young adults and most people under .That same low-risk generation faces a potentially catastrophic price for a disease which should leave them and their parents free toalmost immediately to normal le.Coronavirus is an old person’s disease. Out of ten million under-s in Britain, just two have sadly died from Covid-.For under-s, the risk is a “trivial” one or two per million, says respected statistician Sir David Spiegelhalter. Little more than the chance of dying by accident.For over-s, he says the risk is “ten thousand times” as high.This is no consolation for elderly victims, but it does suggest a speedy route back to a new normal with productive under-s kick-starting the economy.Getting people back to work will be hard. The work ethic propelling us out of bed each morning has been sapped by warm spring sunshine, online food and wine and a Treasury- funded cost of living subsidy.People are enjoying paid-for-time with their families. they are also scared witless by sermons about death and disaster and Downing Street’s daily mortality rate briefings.One day there will be a public inquiry. Everyone is covering their tracks.With hindsight, global lockdown is likely to be judged a terrible mistake, forced on a panic-stricken world by China’s authoritarian example.Sweden alone rejected lockdown, keeping schools open, and the economy ticking over, yet its death toll is lower per head than Britain, France, Spain and Italy.Former Swedish medical chief, Professor Johan Giesecke, believes we overreacted to a disease which is just twice as severe as winter flu and cannot be avoided anyway.“I don’t think you can stop it,” he says, “it’s like a tsunami sweeping across Europe.“We should do what we can to slow it so the health service can cope, but let it pass.”But he won’t say this in public.He will have seen the bizarre charges of betrayal and “fat shaming” against singer Adele for daring to lose seven stone.Yet Liverpool University researchers say obesity increases the risk of death from coronavirus by  per cent.Boris should say loud and clear that fat can be fatal. Losing weight prolongs le.Our health service, by the way, has coped brilliantly.Prof Giesecke says there are three golden rules: “Wash your hands, keep social distance, trust the people.”After Brexit, Boris should know more than most he can trust the people.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

These boys have been given up for dead. Funerals have been held. If it’s them, this is a miracle!”The boys were very much alive and, far from being starved and emaciated as you might expect, doctors marvelled at their muscular bodies — and the perfect setting of Stephen’s leg.But, while the families rejoiced at theof their lost sons, their ordeal was not over.As soon as they arrived in Nuku‘alofa police boarded the boat and arrested the boys, throwing them in jail for the theft of Taniela Uhila’s boat.Once again coming to their rescue Peter paid Uhila £ for the boat and they were released.Finally they couldto their families in Haʻafeva, where the entire population of  turned out to welcome them.Peter was summoned to meet the King of Tonga, Taufa‘ahau Tupou IV, who thanked him personally and asked himthere was anything he could do in .In a charming postscript Peter, who worked as an accountant for his father’s wealthy electronics firm in Australia, replied: “I would like to trap lobster in these waters and start a business here.”Peter resigned from his father’s company in Sydney, moved to Tonga and bought a fishing boat — hiring all six of the boys as the crew.Rutger Bregman’s Humankind, translated by Elizabeth Manton and Erica Moore, is published by Bloomsbury on May .Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The Government cannot afford to repeat such a shambles.“Stay home, save lives” was a simple and effective message. The next steps are far more nuanced.They did not need another vague Churchillian rallying call. That merely sowed confusion, even among the PM’s deputy Dominic Raab and the staunchest Tories, and exposed Boris to a tsunami of snark on TV and social media.It needed instead the level of detail we eventually saw in the Government’s guidance released yesterday afternoon — and then in Boris’s Commons QA.Supporters claimed the PM’s new “stay alert” message was merely common sense any fool could grasp. That misses the point. We are being asked to live in highly unusual and restrictive ways. One person’s common sense is another’s idea of dangerous risk.Our circumstances are all dferent and specics are important — especially when police are to hand out increased fines for transgressions.But while the Government’s recent messaging has been poor, we at least now have our first welcome, albeit ­tentative, steps out of this nightmare:Outside exercise without limit, including the freedom to drive for a day out. The first chance in weeks to see a friend. All assuming social distancing.More solid guidance on masks. Precious little relief on schools, but the glimmer of some sport. Some, many Sun readers included, are being told toto work, though they may justiably fear it is unsafe.Their jobs also make them some of those most likely to die from Covid-.Their firms, factories and sites must bust a gut to ensure their safety, take every precaution and heed reasonable concerns. The grim reality, though, is that our economy must get moving again.It is typical of the infantile Left to complain that profits are being put before people. The Government is not a bottomless well of money. That’s why Rishi Sunak is limbering up to cut the sums paid to furloughed staff. He has to.Only a healthy economy and the taxes it generates can keep public services afloat, the NHS especially.Bankrupt Britain with an endless lockdown and you wreck those too.

All you need is a TV and the inclination.But while many will have used this virtual house arrest to shake off some unhealthy old habits , the reaction to Adele’s weight loss suggests that, for some, her transformation is a betrayal of everything fat activists hold dear.Of the , largely positive comments about the star losing an incredible seven stone, some sniped that she looked “unhealthy”and questioned how she lost it — the inference being that she had succumbed to having a gastric band.But as Pete Geracimo, her former personal trainer, points out: “It was never about getting super-skinny. It was about getting her healthy.”Not least, one suspects, for the benefit of her seven-year-old son Angelo. He adds: “She embraced better eating habits and committed to her fitness and ‘is sweating!’ I could not be prouder or happier for her.”Hear hear. Yet alarmingly, research out earlier this year found that millions of women hid their efforts to slim for fear of being mocked or labelled “anti-feminist”.Saints preserve us. The truth, of course, is thatsomeone is deeply insecure about their own weight, they either pooh-pooh or, worse, lash out at the efforts of those who manage to transform their lestyle via willpower and hard slog.Far easier to do that than take a look at our own bad habits and attempt to change them. True, there are plenty of people who look overweight but are physically fit.And there are plenty of skinny malinkies who can’t run for a bus without needing oxygen. At the end of the day, being happy within yourself is not about how you look, but how you feel.Andyou feel that you are unfit thanks to lousy eating habits and lack of exercise, then you should be able to do something about it without being taken to task by those who don’t have the same self-discipline.Particularly as last week’s research from the University of Liverpool found that obesity increased the risk of dying from coronavirus by  per cent. You can’t argue with that.BOREDOM at Moore Towers has reached such a crisis point that, on Sunday, I linked my iPhone to our portable speaker, put the songs on Shuffle and said we had to endure enjoy whatever track came up.At first there were plenty of goodies from Floyd, Bowie, Prefab Sprout and Talk Talk, but then Twinkle Twinkle Little Star popped up, followed by You Spin Me Round by . . . Alvin And The Chipmunks.For the record, our youngest is now . It seems it’s not just the kitchen cupboards that need a clear-out.BRINGING million people out of lockdown was never going to be easy.But Boris’s much-trumpeted grand statement was a damp squib that’s left us as confused as Adam and Eve on Mother’s Day.In a nutshell, four-year-olds will be able go to school with lots of kids they’re not related to but not see other kids in their family, we can go to work with colleagues but not have a chat with them in their garden, we can do unlimited exercise which we could have done anyway,we go abroad we have to self-isolate for a fortnight . . . unless it’s France, and you can drive to other destinations but not too far, whatever that means.As for “stay alert”, is that the same as Police  presenter Shaw Taylor’s old mantra of: “Keep ’em peeled ”Except we could actually see someone coming at us with a crowbar.A virus that can fit squillion times on to the head of a pin might prove harder to spot.GIVEN that the use of face masks is being actively encouraged but not the professional ones needed by key workers, a number of DIY versions are being suggested.Some involve an element of seamstress skills, but for those who want a quick and effective mask they can drum up with the minimum effort, this is my favourite.Loop a child’s hair tieover each end until it resembles a boiled sweet, then fold over the ends to meet in the middle .Then simply place the wrong side against your face, loop the hair ties around your ears, and voila.You’re welcome.FASHION designer Freya Edmondson – daughter of Ab Fab star Jenner Saunders and actor Ade Edmondson – has posted this photo of herself doing a “sumptuous, heart-opening backbend”, while writing on a notepad.Freya, who teaches free online yoga courses, is just  and, therefore, wonderfully flexible.As a former enthusiastic gymnast, it reminds me of my youth, when I would watch TV while doing the box splits – with my legs stretched out at right angles to my body.With my th birthday looming this Sunday,I attempted it now it would take four paramedics and a system of pulleys to get me on my feet again.ACADEMICS may lord it over the rest of us when it comes to quadratic equations, subatomic phenomena or the three components of the epidemiological triangle, but when it comes to common sense they are often found lacking.Quite how “Professor Lockdown” Neil Ferguson thought he could preach to the rest of us about social distancing while inviting his mistress to his house is anyone’s guess, but he did, and now he’s rightly had to resign for hypocrisynothing .He says: “I accept I made an error . . . I thought I was immune.”From Covid- . . . or criticism THE latest series of Killing Eve may have had a lukewarm reception from critics, but central character Villanelle’s fashion choices have been attracting a lot of attention.One frock cost £,, another £,, and her red leather catsuit would set you back an eye-watering £,.I know these are desperate times for all businesses, but since when have fashionistas been clamouring to get their clothes on the back of a psychotic murderer It gives a whole new meaning to “dressed to kill”.HAIRDRESSERS are to stay closed until July  at the earliest.Up to now I have been making do with the occasional fringe cut using a pair of nail scissors.But given that my “style”is supposed to be choppy bob, and I now resemble Richard lll, it seems I will have to tackle the rest of it too.Worse, The Bloke will have to do the back and, God forbid, baldlygo where no man has gone before.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And I’ll admit, I didn’t correct the ­lawyer .But there’s a darker side to it. A generation of young city dwellers who know nothing about Britain were always bound to underestimate our four great nations.And so they did in the  referendum.The overlap between London and the Remain campaign has been well documented —  per cent of the capital voted in favour of remaining in the EU.Among London’s student population, the depth of ­support for the EU was overwhelming.And with some ultra-liberal friends, there were moments when it would have seemed easier to come out as a ­paedophile than a Brexiteer.Of course, ardent young Remainers convinced themselves that their love of the European Union was borne out of a sophisticated appreciation of all things global.But it seems more likely to me that they saw the EU as the ­saviour to a backwards, grisly country they imagined in their ignorance to be Britain.This summer, that ignorance could finally be shattered.Thanks to Covid-, the nation’s young people won’t have the option of scurrying to ­Heathrow the second their uni exams are over.Instead —they want holidays at all — they’ll be minibreaking in Manchester or camping in the English countryside.Yes, they might turn their noses up at rolling hills, stunning architecture and incredible free museums.But I have a sneaking suspicion they’ll be surprised and impressed with what they find beyond the confines of the M.And, reconnected to their roots at last, they might just begin to feel the first stirrings of patriotism running through their British veins.When the Government published its new guidelines for lockdown in England, I – like the rest of Twitter – found myself getting very worked up about whether or not I’m allowed to play tennis with someone outside of my household.The problem, as my mum gently reminded me, is that in my case it’s a bit of a moot point: I’ve never played tennis before and I’m not entirely sure how to hold a racket.I doubt either my housemate or my friends will be begging for a game any time soon.IT’S not often I find myself welling up at the radio. But LBC caller Liz, from Witham, Essex, got me in the gut this week.Through uncontrollable tears, she explained thatcoronavirus didn’t kill her, being forbidden from touching her grand-children surely would.She’s not alone. After nearly two gruelling months of lockdown, millions of us are experiencing real, gut-wrenching loneliness.They don’t like to complain – they know their suffering is dwarfed by that of frontline health and care staffers. But starved of the company of those they love, they are withering like plants out of sunshine.You’d expect a Conservative government instinctively to get this. For generations, Tory MPs have told us that family is crucially important to the ing of the UK.They’ve thrown their weight behind policies designed to strengthen families and made many moving speeches about how a family unit is more than the sum of its parts.But it seems all that was just for show. For in their admirable haste to propel Brits back to work, this Government seems to have forgotten about families altogether.Boris Johnson’s Sunday night speech – stuffed full of specic advice for workers – didn’t have a single word of hope for single adult relatives craving each other’s company.And the millions of young adults longing to know when they can next hug Mum will have been bitterly disappointed.Of course, the PM is right to say we need to get the economy going again.Forecasts from the Treasury on the upcoming recession could hardly be more alarming – and despite the best efforts of Chancellor Rishi Sunak and his bailouts, millions of businesses will go bustthey can’t get up and running again soon.Butwe’re expected to get up close with colleagues for the sake of the economy, surely we should get to see those we love best for the sake of our mental health The people of Britain are humans, not cash cows. Andthey are to get through this long, draining war in one piece, they need the support of the people they love.LISTENING to BBC News anchor Fiona Bruce casually describe carers as “low-skilled workers” really set my teeth on edge.To the shame of this nation, care home staff are indeed low paid.But low skilled  I reckon plenty of them would be more than capable of reading the news from an autocue for £, a year.And I’d like to see cofed Fiona feed, clean and comfort a newly widowed dementia sufferer without losing her cool.FOR the best part of the past decade, bespectacled “experts” gravely predicted that online dating would kill romance.Apps – they told us – would transform the dating scene into an endless virtual marketplace where singles could shop for each other , or  would turn dating into a minimal-effort pursuit of on-demand hook ups .How wrong they were.Rather than bonking their way round new digital acquaintances, millennial Brits in the st Century spend their downtime uploading photos and biographies to their smartphones and earnestly looking for love.And my, do they succeed.Last year a whopping  per cent of newly married couples met online, and Hinge – the dating app geared towards lelong relationships – is gaining users faster than any of its competitors.Granted, these apps aren’t perfect.We all like a good romance story, and Dad messaging Mum with a winky face because he liked her bikini selfie is hardly the stuff of Hollywood.But now that flirting in the pub is a thing of the past, let’s thank our lucky stars that the country’s poor singles have a shot at love at all.Rather than sitting on the sofa twiddling their thumbs, furloughed folk have been busy sculpting, chiselling and painting – and selling the fruits of their labours online.These plucky, small-time entrepreneurs are the very best of Britain.And with them around, I have no doubt this country will be back on its feet in no time.I’M absolutely loving Normal People on BBC.The chemistry between Marianneand Connellis really quite something.And as an ode to young love, the whole thing is pitch-perfect.In fact, my only quibble is why on earth are all the characters so darn sophisticated They’re , for goodness sake.Let’s see fewer candle-lit, red wine-soaked dinner parties and more tins of warm Foster’s. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And this virus may never go away.HIV has not gone away, weve come to terms with the virus and we have found the therapies and we found the prevention methods, and people dont feel as scared as they did before and were offering long healthy le to people with HIV.The doctor also said lockdown shouldnt be eased with appropriate surveillance measures in place otherwise it will be a case of counting the bodies in the morgue to seerelaxing the measures have worked.Dr Ryan echoed his colleague and said the best way to globally eradicate the virus would be developing a vaccine made available to everyone.But he warned the world has lacked the will and determination in the past to invest in health systems and distribute vaccines already capable of fighting diseases such as measles.The doctor continued: Its a massive opportunity for the world.The idea that a new disease could emerge, cause a pandemic, and we could - with a massive moonshot - find a vaccine and give that to everyone who needs it and stop this disease in its tracks will turn, maybe what has been a tragic pandemic, into a beacon of hope for the future of our planet and the way we care for our citizens.Meanwhile, British scientists who have been carrying out a coronavirus vaccine trial on humans have said their results could be available by mid-June.Professor Sir John Bell, regius professor of medicine at Oxford University, said several hundred people have been vaccinated and the challenge now is to be able to manufacture at scale once it is approved by the regulators.At the end of April a team of researchers at Oxford started testing a Covid- vaccine in human volunteers.Around , are expected to take part in the trial, half receiving the vaccine candidate and the other half - the control group - receiving a widely available meningitis vaccine.Prof Bell told BBC Radio s Today programme: We also want to make sure that the rest of the world will be ready to make this vaccine at scale so that it gets to populations in developing countries, for example, where the need is very great.We really need a partner to do that and that partner has a big job in the UK because our manufacturing capacity in the UK for vaccines isnt where it needs to be, and so we are going to work together with AstraZeneca to improve that considerably.He rejected the idea of challenge therapy - that would deliberately infect healthy volunteers with coronavirus - and said there should be results on the vaccine trial by using normal exposure to the virus,you keep your head down.Prof Bell said: Well, weve got over , people that want to start phase   project.And so far so good, and were now starting to wait for an advocacy signal to see whether people whove been vaccinated, dont get the disease so thats the next step.He added that with the disease on the wane, there is a risk there may not be enough active disease to catch people.Were doing those calculations because we have quite good data now on how much disease there is around, Prof Bell said.He also explained that the researchers had discussed deliberately exposing people to the virus, but the practicalities are complicated, as there is no treatment yet to rescue peoplethey get sick.He added that to check its effectiveness, you would need to give the virus to those most at risk, and the risk of them dying would be very highit did not work.Earlier this week, Boris Johnson warned we may never find a coronavirus vaccine - as he warned of large epidemic waves in future.Mr Johnson said: While we hope for a breakthrough, hope is not a plan.A mass vaccine or treatment may be more than a year away. Indeed, in a worst-case scenario, we may never find a vaccine.So our plan must countenance a situation where we are in this, together, for the long haul, even while doing all we can to avoid that outcome.The PM also warned that despite the strict measures that have been taken, Brits could face living with the threat of Covid- for the long-haul.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

As of April  there were , reported cases.Dr Adrian Heald from The University of Manchester, one of the researchers, said: “Covid- is a highly infectious condition and very dangerous for a small group of people.However a much larger group seem to have low or no symptoms and have been unreported.“This study tries to provide an estimate of the number of historic infections – and gives us all a glimmer of hope that there may be light at the end of the tunnel.“We show how effective social distancing and lockdown has been. Though this is a tragedy, it could have been far worse”.Dr Heald added that the findings, which are published in the International Journal of Clinical Practice, may help to inform the Governments decision in easing the current lockdown.The Consultant Physician in Diabetes and Endocrinology at Salford Royal NHS Foundation Trust, part of the Northern Care Alliance NHS Group, said: We also demonstrate that like any virus, Covid- has taken its natural course and infected a signicant percentage of the UK population.“The more people that are exposed to this - or any - virus, the less easy it is for further transmission to occur.“Government policy can only moderate the impact using measures like widespread testing, social distancing and personal protective equipment.“The social and economic impacts of lockdown have been very dficult, but we believe this analysis may aid policy makers in a smoother transition to reducing social containment and sustainably managing the Covid- disease.“This will allow policy makers to avoid a ‘one size fits all’ approach to pandemic policy, which does not consider the iation in both infection rates and impact across localities.”Mike Stedman from Res Consortium who carried out the data analysis said: “Using our experience working with the NHS on improving patient services, we conducted this work in our own time as we felt we could make a valuable contribution to the public and policy makers by calculating the progression in the local and national daily infection rate.“The figures are not perfect, with the numbers of severely ill patients as a proportion of the total cases being used as a market for estimates of wider infection.“Only extensive antibody testing could give us a more accurate picture - but as that is only just becoming available, we believe this form of modelling is important in informing the best approach to unlocking the population.”Dr Heald and Mike Stedman argue that incremental lting of current social restrictions as soon as possible is vital to minimise further damage to the economy and the impact of prolonged social containment.However, they add, this must be balanced against containing the current pandemic and minimising future waves of  infection.Speculation is currently mounting over potential plans for social bubbles to be created in the next step to ease lockdown, but the Government has not yet made an official announcement.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

which includes £.billion of bailout cash and a £million loan.It will guarantee theof all transport services, back to pre-Covid- levels, after earlier today the Mayor had said he was only planning to take it up to  per cent capacity next week.The Government has also forced the Mayor to take down any confusing signs which tell Londoners to stay at home, and replace it with stay alert messaging.People in the capital were left battled by the conflated messages earlier today as they went back to work for the first time since the lockdown began.It comes as:Under the conditions for the £.billion bailout deal, there will be a review of TFLs finances and structures.The organisation has been struggling for years to stay afloat and has long had a black hole in its finances.Government officials will now sit on TFLs board too and provide greater scrutiny of how they operate.The mayor had been accused by No and Tory MPs of “playing politics” during the Covid crisis to try and up the amount of money handed to the network.A senior Government source said tonight: “We were always prepared to consider putting more money into keeping tube and buses services running in London and to help the travelling public stay safe from coronavirus.“But we were not prepared to accept ludicrous demands from a profligate mayor and this money comes with many strings attached.”But Londoners will have to pay more for trips, with ticket prices expected to rise at the same rate as the Retail Price Index, plus one percent, according to those close to the deal.With London seeing the lowest R rate of infection in the nation, at just ., the Mayor’s cuts could potentially force up cases in the capital.Speaking on LBC radio, Mr Khan said that TFL was losing £ million a month and had lost  percent of income through lost fares, advertising and congestion charges.He said: “We’ve been involved in weeks and weeks of negotiation with the government and its really hard in getting support from them.“Being blunt… Unless the government today gives us confirmation of the grant that we need then the consequences could be quite severe and ramications for all of us will be huge.”Former Tory Transport Minister Theresa Villiers, the MP for Chipping Barnet told The Sun that he Mayor’s negotiation strategy had been akin to “blackmail.”She said: “The Government has come to the rescue of the Mayor.“I welcome this bail-out for the transport system in London but its vital that the Mayor now restores a full level of service for my constituents.“He must also get a grip on the TfL budget.“If he hadnt disastrously mismanaged TfL finances London would have better prepared for this pandemic shock.“He failed to fix the roof while the sun was shining and taxpayers have had to foot the bill as a result.“He needs to focus more on delivering services efficiently and less on sound bites and press conferences blaming the Government for every problem in London.  Former Tory minister Stephen Hammond, MP for Wimbledon added: “The mayor should concentrate on running as big a service as possible so people can travel socially distanced and in as responsible a way as possible.”And Tory MP for Romford Andrew Rosindell said: “The mayor seems to want the best of all worlds and I dont think in these circumstances thats possible.“Hes been accused of playing politics at a time when its not really a time for playing these sorts of games.“Every time he opens his mouth he plays politics and I dont get the impression that he is genuinely concerned about the provision of services.But a source close to the Mayor denied he had played any politics during the negotiations, adding: “It’s hardly playing politics when the simple fact is TFL has lost  percent of its revenue that it needs to operate.”Today, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said people had a civic duty to avoid public transportat all possible during the coronavirus crisis.At the Downing Street press conference, he said the lockdown had been used to carry out a range of maintenance projects on the road and rail networks, and set out plans for nearly £ billion of extra spending.However, he said bureaucratic bindweed meant British infrastructure was some of the most expensive and slowest to build in the world.He said: If building a new hospital takes just two weeks, why should building a new road still take as long as  years If GPs surgeries can move online, why are most rail passengers still travelling on cardboard tickets We must exploit our new-found capacity to respond at pace and apply it to rapidly improving our infrastructure.To receive The Suns Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Nadine Dorries shared a clip from an anonymous Twitter account which featured a heavily edited video of Mr Starmer during his time as the Director of Public Prosecutions . It was also shared, and deleted, by two other Conservative MPs, Lucy Allan and Maria Caufield. The three MPs were giving a dressing down by Downing St after the incident. Mr Starmer was DPP until , and ordered a restructuring of how the Crown Prosecution Servicedealt with grooming gang cases and admitted that victims had been failed. In the unedited clip, which you can watch below, Mr Starmer is seen explaining why the system he inherited to prosecute people sexually abusing children wasnapost fit for purpose.  But the edited video instead cuts bits from the video and claims to show in its own words  “why he [Starmer] didn’t prosecute grooming gangs when he was head[sic] the Crown Prosecution Service”. The account which posted the edited clip has since been deleted. The original clip reveals Mr Starmer is critical of his predecessors when discussing how the cases were handled “The approach taken in the past was the wrong approach,” Mr Starmer said. “It was based on a number of assumptions, which don’t withstand scrutiny.“The guidelines change that, and they require the police and prosecutors to focus intensely on the allegation actually being made, and not so much on the weaknesses or vulnerabilities that are iniably there in some of the victims that come forward.” Before Ms Dorries deleted the tweet a Labour source said: This is a doctored video tweeted by far-right social media account. As a government minister, we hope Nadine Dorries acknowledges this and takes it down. In the undoctored clip, Mr Starmer adds: “The assumptions that were made included the assumption that a victim of child sexual abuse will swtly report what happened to them to the police, will be able to give a coherent and consistent account, first time. That they themselves will not have engaged in any offending or other behaviour, and that they will not have misused drugs or alcohol at any stage.” From the coronavirus to Brexit, this is an era of great change and uncertainty.

According to the latest Government figures, at least  people in Barrow-in-Furness, tucked away on the coast of Cumbria, caught the killer bug since the outbreak began in February. There are just , people living in the town on the Furness peninsula in the north west of England, so with a rate of  cases per , this means equates to . per cent. This means Barrowaposs infection rate is more than double that of Walesand over three times Englandaposs rateand Scotlandaposs . When compared to the rate in Northern Irelandaposs rate of  it is quadruple. Out of the cases in Barrow,  people have died after contracting coronavirus, giving it a death rate of  for every , – this is one the worst death rates outside of London. Officials are perplexed as to why the town has suffered so badly even though it attracts far fewer tourists than the number that visit the nearby Lake District. An Office for National Statisticsreport this month claimed that people living in the poorest parts of the country are dying at twice the rate of those in wealthier areas.  Experts say poorer people are more at risk as they are more likely to work in jobs that cannot be done from home, live in overcrowded homes and use public transport more. Lee Roberts, deputy leader of Barrow Borough Council, believes high levels of deprivation could be a factor of the high number of cases. He called the figures in Barrow a aposbig worryapos as lockdown measures are relaxed today.  He added: Most of Barrow is very compact:  to  per cent of Barrow is terraced housing and we’ve got a lot of flats, we’ve got a lot of deprivation, a lot of health inequalities. The poorest are also more likely to suffer from underlying health conditions and have compromised immune systems - putting them at an increased risk. Barrow has high levels of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary diseasecompared with the national average – both of which make symptoms of the virus worse.  Mr Roberts added: We have quite a lot of historic respiratory problems from people who worked in old industry, in the ship yards. Barrow also has higher than average numbers of patients with diabetes, high blood pressure and obesity, which are all risk factors for Covid-. According to some estimates, over s are  time more likely to fall critically ill with coronavirus and Barrow’s population is also older than average, with . per cent of residents aged  to .  In England the average is . per cent. But some of the cases can be traced to a house party in Barrow which took place before lockdown in March. It was attended by a apossuper spreaderapos resulting in at least six people contracting the virus and the townaposs first ever death, according to . But how the disease infected hundreds more in Barrow is a mystery.  The figures show Lancaster in Lancashire has the second highest rate at  and Cumbria is also home to the area with the third highest infection rate as South Lakeland, which is east of Barrow-in-Furness, having a rate of  cases per , people. Experts are unable to work out why the North West has become a hotspot for coronavirus cases but local public health officials think it might be because more people are being tested.  The University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay Foundation Trustcovers three hospitals treating coronavirus patients - the Furness general in Barrow, the Royal Lancaster Infirmary and the Westmorland general in Kendal in South Lakeland. According to NHS England the trust has recorded  deaths. Colin Cox, the director of public health for Cumbria, claims the NHS trust began mass-testing its employees and patients at the end of February and has done three times as much tests on average.  He told : The rate of testing in Barrow has been two to three times higher than in many other parts of the north-west, so that will explain a fair chunk of it, but I don’t think it will explain all of it. Ashford in Kent has the fourth highest infection rate of  cases per ,, followed by Gateshead , Sunderland , South Tyneside , Middlesborough , Carlisleand the tenth place has been named as Brent - the only region in London to feature in the top . ONS figures shows there have been  deaths around a small cluster of streets in Harlesden, which is in Brent, alone.  Hastings in East Sussex has the lowest rate in England with  in , contracting the virus. This is followed by Mendip, Somerset , Torridge in North Devon , Rutland in East Midlands , West Lindsey in Lincolnshire , North East Lincolnshire , Rother in East Sussex , South Hams in Devonand Arun in West Sussex . University Hospitals Birmingham has been revealed as the hospital trust to be hardest in the country by coronavirus with at least  deaths.

They are more likely to come close to large numbers of strangers, rely on public transport and touch contaminated surfaces such as handrails or door handles. While  hospitals have recorded  or more deaths, and make up half of the entire victim count , there are only  which have recorded just one death each.

Drivers collected their hot drinks, which were served on cardboard trays, while a queue snaked around the waiting area. One barista, who wore blue plastic gloves and a face mask, appeared happy to be back at work as he made the peace sign with both hands. It was the first day business resumed in Livingston, West Lothian, since they were temporarily closed in March. Starbucks has reopened around  stores across the UK today in the first phase of its reopening plans, which are predominantly focused on drive through stores.  New safety measures at UK sites will include regular hand-washing for at least  seconds, two metre social distancing, screens at payment areas and the use of contactless payment only. The coffee chain said it has been learning, testing and refining our operational standards every day behind closed doors. It said the reopening plan - which will start  per cent of its branches - will focus on ensuring the health and wellbeing of its employees and customers. Starbucks has already reopened some of its sites in other regions, including the US and China. It said it has taken learnings from changes to its operations in China - where  per cent of sites are now open - and the US in consideration of its UK sites. Earlier this month coffee fans spent hours in their cars and created traffic chaos by queueing at reopened drive-through Coasta branches.  The chain was one of the first coffee shops to start opening branches again but queues at some branches created huge tailbacks. McDonalds will open  of its drive-through branches next week.

People have signed up from every walk of le – from nurses to ­builders, pensioners to students – and been incredibly open and honest about how the coronavirus is affecting them personally. From a lady who spent her cancelled wedding day having a curry with her fiance, to exhausted ambulance drivers and shattered hospital cleaners, to people who describe the pain of missing their grandchildren’s birthdays or losing a loved one – so many people have shared the bad times and the good. The aim of Britain Connects is to do exactly that – connect people across the country in pairs for an online chat on the weekend of May -. All you need to do is sign up at britainconnects and we will find someone who is having a dferent experience to you and lives in a dferent part of the country. We’ll then send you a link where you can meet safely over video and have a chat. We’ve had two pairs of Britain Connects guinea pigs testing our project. Retired nursing sister Lynda Felton-Scott and university student Jovan Nepaul, who we introduced you to last week, and ASDA checkout worker Thomas Webb and ICU nurse Joan Pon Laplana who you will be meeting in the coming days. Follow all coronavirus updates on our live blog here Matching our second pair – two key workers with very dferent ­experiences of the pandemic – has been particularly challenging due to the gruellingly long and exhausting shts they have been working. Yet Thomas and Joan’s chat was poignant and cheerful in equal measure.  Meanwhile, our Mirror columnists have volunteered to meet some of the people signing up so far, with interesting results – you’ll be hearing from them too. The ersity in the people who have signed up so far is striking. From those facing financial ruin to those “getting on top of the garden”. Those falling out with their housemates to those getting on better with their teenagers. Whether you are volunteering, watching old football matches, bingeing on Netflix, home-schooling kids with special needs or going out every day to work in an intensive care unit – every one of our unique experiences of the coronavirus pandemic matters. Covid- is a challenge for every single one of us, whether we are facing bereavement, unemployment, ­loneliness or boredom. But one of its positives is connection. People have strengthened their local connections all over the UK – with their ­neighbours and through community businesses and networks.  We want to build on these new networks by extending them out of our local areas – and towards people we might never normally meet and don’t already know. If we don’t, there’s a risk thatwe only strengthen our local tribes or in-groups, we could end up with a country that’s actually even more ided after lockdown ends and we face the far-reaching consequences of deep economic recession. The All Party Parliamentary Group on Social Integration this week published a report entitled Social Connection in the Covid- Crisis by the APPG and British Future. It highlighted a risk that while the upsurge in community volunteering is fantastic, it may be benefitting more resilient areas. This brings the danger of entrenching existing ides – and leaving struggling communities further behind.  “There is a risk that in the long term the crisis might strengthen rather than break down social isions,” the report says. This includes the ide between old and young “ the health impacts of Covid- are being felt most by older people, while the economic impacts disproportionately fall on younger people”. As Steve Ballinger from British Future says: “Many of us have been heartened by the surge of community spirit in this crisis. But the longer-term impacts on social connection are less clear. If new networks are based mainly in the most cohesive and ­resilient areas, there’s a risk that others will be left further behind.” Hard Professor Robert Putnam said in a recent interview with Tortoise media that the world after coronavirus will only change for the betterwe “connect with people who are not like you”.

Coroner Graeme Hughes heard Coolio, whose family live in Maesteg, died on May , at just three days old.

The Newcastle-upon-Tyne house buyer claims she has had six months of hell since moving into the £, three-bedroom detached house as ious snags have cropped up - although Barratt Homes insists all repairs were promptly dealt with. Pauline Collins, , was excited toto her native North East from Hertfordshire with hopes of a fresh start with her son Daniel, . But she claims herto the region has been ruined after enduring what she claims were six months of hell since moving into her Blakelaw home in November last year.The mum was immediately unimpressed as soon as she set foot inside her Barratt Homes new-build, reports Chronicle Live. Barratt Homes said all issues raised were completed promptly, other than garden work delayed by coronavirus, and vowed to continue working hard to look after Ms Collins. She said: I was really excited, it is the first time I have bought a brand new house. But now I want them to buy it back off me. Itaposs absolutely shocking. As soon as I opened the door I noticed the terrible plasterwork on my staircase. There were so many little snags that you would just expect to be right. The finish was very poor and I was fuming. In her kitchen, which she paid extra to be upgraded, she says she found part of the skirting board missing, a lump out of a door as well as her units and fridge freezer not being installed properly. Pauline claims her bath, shower and toilet all overflowed within weeks of moving into the property and she says the sealant on her tiles too were poorly finished. A few months ago, while having her garden shed installed, a workman pointed out her grass was soaking wet. She said: The grass was so wet you could barely stand on it. I called Barratt and they did come out and dug trenches in my back garden and installed the drainage. But surely this should have been done in the first place.They were supposed to be turfing my garden but then the coronavirus lockdown has meant itaposs gone unfinished. So weaposve had lockdown without a pleasant garden to sit in.The stress of the housing situation has come at a time when Daniel is recovering from a triple heart bypass after suffering a heart attack in February. Pauline, a retired British Airways worker, said: We have been through enough with Daniel then for all this on top has been incredibly frustrating and stressful. Barratt Homes agreed to come out to the house but I asked them to make appointments so I can make sure Iaposm in and itaposs a good time with my son ill. But on a number of occasions they just turned up. Pauline accepts that some of the issues have been rectied, but says they are jobs which should have been done correctly in the first place - brandishing the standard of work at her Prunus Walk home as diabolical.

I donapost knowthey ended up in some sort of prison, or decided to just not come home at all. Today I found out their basement had flooded, probably sometime within the last week. Apparently a pipe burst, but the entire basement is completely f*****. I paid for have the leak fixed, and I spent all of today using my shop vac to drain their basement to the best of my abilities. Between this and one of their dogs needing surgery I have spent several thousand dollars of my own money, and frankly the damage to the basement was pretty awful. I donapost have their insurance paperwork, and donapost really knowi can even do a claim for them. But after a year of looking after two big dogs as well as a cat, things got a little too much to handle, so they tried to track them down.

They also said that they had asked his weaposs brother to collect the animals months before but apparently he never followed up on it.

The video shows friends and family members gathered round as a priest reads prayers while the person is being buried. However, as the camera zooms in on the white coffin, which has a clear glass  on it, there appears to be a hand and fingers moving underneath. The disturbing footage was filed in Manado, North Sulawesi, Indonesia on May .During the service, the priest is heard saying: God has said in the book of John. I am the resurrection and the le. Whoever believes in me he will live even though he is dead, Daily Mail reports.Just seconds after the speech is when the hand appears to be waving from the coffin. The video sparked debate as to whether the movement was from the corpse. One person wrote: Yes, he waved, maybe he was still alive and try to dig his way out. But another theory is that maybe itaposs a mouse, Toink Khan said. Despite the ious claims, it is likely that the corpse was moving due to decomposition.Last year, a study revealed that dead bodies move ‘signicantly’ as they decompose. Researchers at the Australian Facility for Taphonomic Experimental Researchcarried out the research, where they set up time-lapse cameras to study how dead bodies move. The cameras filmed the bodies at  minute intervals, and revealed that the the arms were ‘signicantly moving.’Speaking to  ABC News, Alyson Wilson, a researcher involved in the project, said: “What we found was that the arms were signicantly moving, so that arms that started off down beside the body ended up out to the side of the body.”While you might think that the movements would be subtle, according to the researchers, this isn’t the case at all. Dr Xanthe Mallet, who supervised the study, said: “I think people will be surprised at just how much movement there was, because I was amazed when I saw it, especially how much the arms were moving. It was astounding.” The researchers believe that the movement is caused by the build-up of gas in the body in the early to mid-stages of decomposition.

As of Wednesday , the new advice is that people should consider wearing  face coverings in enclosed public spaces where you may be more likely to come into contact with people you do not normally meet.According to the experts, enclosed public spaces include public transport such as buses and trains, as well shops.A post on gov.uk reads: The public is being strongly urged not to purchase surgical masks or respirators. These are prioritised for healthcare workers working in more high-risk environments where the risk is greatest.Instead the public is encouraged to make face coverings at home, using scarves or other textile items that many will already own. Andyouaposre looking to make your own, weaposve just come across a very easy way to do so - and all you need is a sock. A woman has shared a video on TikTok showing how you can easily turn an odd sock into a face covering. The video has gone viral, being shared across several social media s including Twitter.In the clip, the woman who posts under the username @safiaaggoune starts by taking the sock and turning it upside down, so the toe end is at the top. She then folds the toe end over, so that itaposs touching where the heel is and takes a pair of scissors to cut along the fold.  Discarding the toe piece, the womanaposs next step is to cut all the way down the side of the sock that doesnapost have the heel. She then opens the piece of fabric up into a rectangular shape. The fourth step sees her fold the piece of fabric in half widthways along the bit that was the heel, so you have one long straight edge and one that has a bump in the middle. Finally, she turns the fabric so that the bump is facing down then makes two incisions along either of the smaller sides to create the straps to hold it on the face. And voilà, one face covering.  People on Twitter were amazed by the clip, with one saying it was the simplest DIY version theyaposd seen yet. Another commented to say that one layer of cotton isnapost enough protection, so they suggested adding another layer of fabric. They recommend several layers. You could put other fabric behind the sock though and use the sock to hold it in place. But any layer is better than no layer.

The outlet called the governmentaposs response to Covid- as flippant and ill-prepared. The Beijing-based publication tore into the Prime Minister after Mr Johnson told the nation on Sunday to go back to workthey unable to work from home. Shocking images have since emerged this week of commuters on packed Tube trains which has left them unable to social distance from each other. The newspaper said Mr Johnson was prioritising the economy over virus control as the track-and-tracing system had not been set up and it would need a miracle to get out of the health crisis. The Global Times also referred to a column by theon Sunday, in which Simon Tisdall called Britain the sick man of Europe. Adding: It is startling to see the UK, once on which the sun never set, acting poorly in this global fight against the deadly coronavirus. It also slammed the Governmentaposs initial strategy, known as herd immunity saying it wasted a few weeksapos time when China fought hard against the virus.  The commentary also slated Boris Johnsonaposs coronavirus exit strategy, saying a contact-tracing system should have been in place before the move. The author said: Scholarly analyses have all suggested that the UK governmentaposs response to the crisis was as flippant and ill-prepared as that of the US...apos Britain is currently trialling a apostest, track and traceapos app on the Isle of Wight in a three-part plan to stop a second spike. The app works via Bluetooth and will alert peoplethey have been in close contact with someone who later tested positive for coronavirus.  The UK Government was tracing contacts in the very first stage of the virus, but stopped as the country went into lockdown. This decision has been heavily criticised as the track, trace and test regime has been used very effectively in other countries - notably Germany and South Korea as they aim to ease their lockdowns. The Global Times wrapped up its piece saying Britainaposs resources had gone to waste due to the Governmentaposs decisions. It said: The UK is not supposed to end up like this. After all, it is where the Industrial Revolution started. It has abundant capital and medical resources. Exercise Unlimited exercise outdoors is to be allowed, with the previous aposonce-a-dayapos rule scrapped Sunbathing People will be allowed to sit on parks and beaches, provided they stay two metres away from other people Drive Boris Johnson said in his speech on Sunday night that people will be able to drive to other destinations from Wednesday, presumably to exercise there, although more detailed plans are likely to follow Meet others From May , people will be able to meet one friend or relative from a dferent household in a public place, provided they stay two metres apart. Gatherings of more than two people remain banned, so people cannot meet both their parents, for example Play golf and tennis Golf courses and tennis courts will reopen from May , with social distancing relatively easy to achieve, although you can play only with people in your household. Team sports such as football are not likely to be encouraged, as social distancing is dficult and more people than the average household would be required Fishing and swimming Angling and water sports are also to be allowed to resume in England from Wednesday. Again, you must be within your own household and two metres from other people Return to work Rather than a change to the rules, the government is now encouraging people toto workthey cannot do so from home. But they also urge people to drive, walk or cycle to work rather than use public transport,possible To put it in Chinese proverbs, it didnapost play well despite having good cards in hand. The Global Times calls itself Chinaaposs aposmost belligerent tabloidapos and is a strong defender of Beijingaposs actions while it scolds the West, especially the US, over its criticism against the Community Party. The coronavirus pandemic first emerged in the city of Wuhan in central China last December.

It was taken in the northern town of Tourcoing, on the Belgium border, and shows a group of boys and girls being kept away from each other using squares marked out in chalk.The three and four-year-olds ed to classes following almost two months of coronavirus lockdown as the French government eased restrictions. I can’t get over this, historian Laurence De Cock, who posted the picture on Twitter, said. This image is heartbreaking. We can’t call this aposschoolapos.Lionel Top, a TV journalist with the BFM news channel, took the photo on Tuesday and said the children had been told to stay in their zones. To ensure respect for distances, while taking advantage of recreation, the teaching team drew squares on the ground for the little ones, he reported. The children play, dance, jump, laugh together ... but from this square. From what we have seen, they do not view it as a punishment. But other commentators expressed their sadness and anger at a scene which looked like it was out of a ‘horror film’. I’ve never seen such a sad picture, said Myriam Cau. It’s horrible to subject children to this. Lily, another Twitter user, wrote: Just inhuman, shameful for children but also for teachers and institutes! What horror !!!!.Others said it was like a scene from the Halloween series of slasher movies.And Antoine Diot commented: The picture of the children in the chalk squares will eventually illustrate this very strange situation in the history books. A spokesman for the Ministry of Education in Paris said there were no ‘specic instruction’ for teachers to draw chalk squares for their pupils. But he confirmed that everybody was under instruction to ‘maintain social distancing’ and not to share anything. Schools across France started to reopen this week as the country emerged from an eight-week lockdown to contain Covid-. Teachers are among those who have expressed extreme concern about this, with many parents keeping their children at home.

The North Korean leader, now , attended a boarding school in Bern, Switzerland, in the s. But he was ordered home by his father Kim Jong-il after spies informed him his son had been caught with a kinky magazine stuffed in his school bag. Kim Jong-un attended the school with his three siblings - who all lived there under fake identities as the children of a North Korean diplomat. After the now -year-old Jong-un was caught with the porn magazine, all four children were ordered tohome, reports the Daily Star. Sources said the childrenaposs father was growing increasingly worried that his children were being led astray by their western peers. Itaposs is believed the magazines were found when teachers searched his bag for aposcheat sheetsapos ahead of exams. The despotic leader still holds a deep love for all things Swiss, and gts his statesmen with expensive Swiss watches. Details of the embarrassing incident come after much speculation about Kim Jong-unaposs rumoured death.  As rumours swirl that the aposSupreme Leaderapos of the secretive, totalitarian state has in fact died, a video from July ,  has sleuths claiming near-perfect body-doubles could have stood in for him on several occasions and without the watching world being any the wiser. In the footage, Kim chats to the lookalikes as he oversees the launch of the Hwasong- missile. They sport Kimaposs distinctive haircut and are dressed in the same clothing. Kim is rarely seen without a pair of Cuban heels on his feet and a black pinstripe suit.  The despot is known to travel with body doubles to thwart assassination attempts. But when the terrible tyrant went missing for three weeks in April and suddenly reappeared - supposedly on a visit to a fertiliser factory - as observers across the world were convinced of his death, speculation turned to whether the figure we were seeing was in fact one of his lookalikes.

My plan was to work as hard as I could to be part of the team.“If they wanted things done a certain way then I was going to do that to the best of my ability thenit doesn’t work out, I’ve done all I can.“There were big changes to training but going away for three weeks in pre-season to Italy was a big one. Usually you’d only be away for a week but this was a long time.“They did lay everything that was to happen out in front of you, though. However, there was a strict menu on offer –you didn’t like it, you’d go hungry.”Training too was completely dferent as Dundee adopted a football strategy that had served the Bonetti brothers in their homeland.As a future coach and boss, Smith says he learned a lot during their time in the City of Discovery, evensome elements of their approach were dficult to get to grips with.“The way they structured training was completely dferent as well but dferent managers all have dferent views,” he added.“Training would change time but we’d train every day and there were a few double sessions.“They relied on doing the same thing rigidly over and over so you knew what you were getting and there was very little change.“I have to say I learned a lot about working on shape and positional play. Previous managers had done shape but not to the extent the Bonettis worked on it.“Training could be a bit off-the-cuff sometimes. They were obviously new to coaching themselves and learning as they went.”There were high-profile disagreements as foreign signings kept Scottish players out of the starting XI.The Bonetti brothers’ volatile nature also led to fall outs behind the scenes, but Smith focused on working hard in training and reaping the rewards.“I always treat people as they treat me and the Bonettis treated me very well,” he said.“I’m not saying they did that with every player – there were definitely a few not treated as well as they should have been.“I played with players I never expected to line up alongside at Dundee. Georgi Nemsadze was wonderful, Claudio Caniggia was a top talent, but they also needed the Scottish guys like myself, Gav Rae, Steven Tweed and Willie Falconer to make the core of the team.“I don’t think the foreign guys really understood Scottish football or knew what to expect.“We all just got our heads down and knuckled down to work. I think the Bonettis appreciated that.“They were good times and I’m sure the fans wouldn’t change seeing those players in dark blue even with what happened afterwards in administration.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/05/717515-1-548x564.jpg ","title":"dundee fc juan sara manager","story":"Juan Sara was heartbroken when he left Dundee as a player in  – now he’s eyeing up aas manager.Dens Park gaffer James McPake shouldn’t be too concerned by that statement, however, as the South American is still working his way up the ranks in Argentine football.Currently assistant manager at second-tier promotion hopefuls Estudiantes de Buenos Aires, Sara has great memories of his time in dark blue and hopes toone day soon.In an exclusive interview with the Tele, Sara said: “Dundee is one of the most important clubs in my le.“I would love to go back to Dundee. People always show they loved this time and always remember it. I’ve always said we’d love to go back but it is not easy with football to do so.“I am coaching just now and I have a hope that one day, one of my dreams is to go to Europe and, hopefully, be Dundee manager.”Sara arrived in the city as the Bonetti era got into full swing at Dens Park  years ago, coming in alongside fellow Argentine Fabian Caballero to form a potent front line.Immediately, the striker felt at home in Scotland.Speaking from his home in Buenos Aires, he said: “I have great memories. The people were great, I felt at home in Dundee. It was really comfortable.“The people in the city were very friendly and I made a lot of friends in the team. There were a few Argentines and Italians as well as Scottish guys.“I had been playing in Paraguay and doing really well for a big team. I had the same agent as Fabian Caballero and Dundee were looking for a striker. I had the chance to go to Portugal but I chose Dundee because I wanted to play in the UK and the football there suited my style.“Playing with other Argentines made it easy and to have an Italian coach when I spoke Italian was great for me, too. It was the perfect place for me.“We started the season well, I scored goals and it went well. I was one of the top scorers in the league in my first season with  goals.“Straight away I noticed it was a physical game, tough football with long balls and the ball in the air but we tried to play another type of football. We tried to play with the ball on the grass and more combination football.“I really felt good in that team and the way we played.”Then a -year-old, Sara made a strong start to le in dark blue with three goals in his opening nine games before etching his name into Dundee history books with a derby hat-trick in a - win at Dens Park.“The hat-trick against United was one of my best moments,” he added.“At that time I didn’t realise what I had done! It was the first derby I played in, we won - and I scored all three. I don’t know how many times that will have happened.“People always remember that match. I didn’t realise how big it was. For the fans it was so important and I still get messages on facebook from Dundee fans about it!“I scored at Celtic Park, scored against Rangers and a lot of goals but I think the hat-trick against United was one I will always remember.“It was a fantastic atmosphere. It was amazing with the stadiums so close and to be able to walk down the street was a great experience.”As was the chance to play with one of his heroes, Claudio Caniggia, after the Argentina World Cup star arrived as replacement for injured Caballero.“It was a dream for me to play with Claudio,” said Sara. “I didn’t believe it when he signed!“He knew Ivano and Dario and when Fabian got injured they brought him to Dundee.“I couldn’t believe I would have the opportunity to play with him. Both being strikers, we played together up front and it was a dream for me.“He was so easy to play with but not just him – Fabian, Beto , Georgi , Gavin , there were so many good players.”Sara’s departure, however, was more nightmare than dream as the club tumbled into administration in .Ending on a sour note, however, doesn’t taint the Argentine’s memories.He said: “Leaving was disappointing. I really felt at home and to leave in the way we did was very dficult for us.“We lost a lot of money and were very upset. My we was pregnant at the time and it was dficult being in a dferent country with no job and no living. I didn’t know what to do. There were a lot of players in that situation.“However, it was one of the best times of my career, in Dundee.

If you had to have them it would be in a final, but the draw was kind to us with Raith.“They’d been doing well under John McGlynn but it gave us an opportunity to go to Hampden.“One of the things that sticks in my mind is we had the Sunday game but on Saturday, Ross County were playing Celtic.“We were going to the Westerwood Hotel in Cumbernauld to stay overnight.“We’d trained at Tannadice and headed down. I was off to Falkirk to watch them play St Mirren but Gary Kirk and Paul Hegarty went with the team on the bus.“I was listening to the radio all the way and about half-way down Ross County went one-up.“By the time I’m in the car park at Falkirk, Ross County score again with minutes to go to make it - and it really hit me then.“That was the first time I thought to myself, ‘There’s only three teams left and we’re now the favourites for the cup’.“I felt a bit of pressure going into the Raith Rovers game that we had to go out and do our business.“We were nervous but, thankfully, I had a group of players behind me who were magnicent and we beat Raith comfortably after a slow -minute start.”Although they were indeed favourites at that stage to go on and lt the cup, Houston insists that wasn’t always the case.The -year-old believes the Tangerines still had to do it the hard way in beating Partick, St Johnstone and champions Rangers after a replay to get their shot at Hampden glory.He continues: “A lot of people say Dundee United had it easy because we played Ross County in the final but they forget about the journey.“The fact is we had an away game at Partick Thistle then we were away to Premier League St Johnstone in the next round. That’s never an easy fixture.“We went down there and I remember Gary’s father had died during that week.“The players decided they wanted to wear black armbands and dedicated the win to Bobby Kirk, who was an ex-Hearts league and cup winner way back.“It was a nice gesture for the players, that’s the type of boys they were.“We went to Ibrox after that to play a strong Rangers side, who were the champions.“That was three in a row away from home in the Scottish Cup so we didn’t have an easy draw.“We were - down after Rangers got a couple of penalties, the usual at Ibrox, but to our credit we scored goals.“To see Andis Shala and Mihael Kovacevic on the scoresheet was something unusual. We got a wee break as well with wee Morgaro Gomis’ volley being deflected in.“They thought the game was won at -. They had downed tools a bit and the crowd was away to miss the traffic.“That set us up for our only home tie, the replay at Tannadice. That was a memorable game for the supporters.“The treble-buster, as he calls himself, David Robertson scored with his backside in the last minute.“That was the best thing for us because there wasn’t much time for Rangers to go and put up a comeback.“We were the better team and deserved to win.”United would see off Ross County in the final thanks to a second-half strike from David Goodwillie and a Craig Conway double.Nearly , Arabs rejoiced in watching on as Houston  Co climbed the steps to lt the Scottish Cup for the first time since .He continues: “It hits you when you’re walking out prior to kick-off and it’s just a sea of tangerine.“There were , Arabs there and that was a sight to behold. It’s so colourful.“A lot of people thought it wouldn’t be a good atmosphere because it was Dundee United and a smaller club like Ross County but to be fair to them I think Dingwall emptied for that day.“It was a busy final and the pressure was on us that we should win this cup.“There’s an added pressure there because you’re desperately keen to not mess it up for the fans.“The Saturday night and Sunday celebrations at Tannadice and City Square were amazing.“It’s something you can’t take away from that group of players and it will never leave my memory.”The celebrations would go on for days after but it is only now Houston looks back at their win as greatness achieved not bestowed.He credits predecessor Craig Levein for laying the foundations and admits there is a special sense of pride at achieving Scottish Cup glory, something the man who started it all, Jim McLean, couldn’t do.“As you get older you start asking yourself, ‘Where did those  years go to ’” he says.“It brought joy to a lot of United fans who’d only seen them win it once prior with Ivan Golac.“It felt surreal that Jim, who was the best manager of them all, hadn’t been able to get it over line with the amount of times he took United to Scottish Cup Finals.“It was great for me, personally, being the manager of United then and doing that.“The big thing for me was we had a brilliant group of players.“Craig and I had went in a few years before and he deserves credit as well. Him and I worked really hard building a new squad.“We were bottom of the league when we went in back in . Wee Eddie Thompson’s only words to Craig and I were, ‘Just keep my team in the top ision’.“We managed to finish ninth that season then fth for the next couple of years.“I was delighted that when I took over and Craig went away to be the Scotland manager we finished third, won the cup and went into Europe three years in a row.“It had been a long time for the club since it had been on that stage and they haven’t been since.“A lot of people forget that, yes we won the Scottish Cup, but we finished third behind a very strong Rangers and Celtic, and nine points ahead of Hibs.“It was a magnicent achievement and turned out a wonderful season.”Dundee United#s Scottish Cup-winning boss Peter Houston hopes Robbie Neilson can lead Terrors to Hampden triumph\" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp dundee-united-peter-houston-robbie-neilson embed # secretIXeWqxySKj\" data-secret\"IXeWqxySKj\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":null,"title":"love-island-anton-danyluks-mum-shaves-bum-joins-instagram-delight-fans","story":"Love Island star Anton Danyluks mum has become an instant hit with fans after joining Instagram."},{"url":null,"title":"tunnel-mystery-paisley-abbey-solved","story":"EXPERTS have discovered one of Scotlandrsquos best-preserved medieval tunnels was a m long drain beneath Paisley Abbey - after centuries of mystery."},{"url":null,"title":"scotlands-new-transplant-system-launch-date-confirmed","story":"LEGISLATION to introduce an opt-out system of organ and tissue donation for deceased donors will come into force in Autumn ."},{"url":null,"title":"hamilton-grammar-schools-tribute-pupil-brandon-rice","story":"THE headteacher of a pupil who collapsed at home and later died has paid touching tribute to the ldquocharismatic teenager."},{"url":null,"title":"skyes-limit-sabhal-mor-ostaig---unique-gaelic-only-college-set-stunning-island-location","story":"AS global interest in Gaelic grows, students from across the world are travelling to Skye to study at Sabhal Mograver Ostaig, the National Centre for Gaelic Language and Culture."},{"url":null,"title":"jiving-gis-glasgows-george-square---ve-day-memories","story":"BONFIRES so hot they cracked tenement windows.

politics and sport to sample its suppers.The list # which ranges from Mel Gibson and Gregor Fisher to Sir Elton John and Lewis Capaldi and Annie Lennox to Denis Law # testies how this Granite City locale has become one of the most famous restaurants in the whole of the north-east.There was the time when operations manager, Stuart Devine tried to deliver some food to the former Prime Minister, John Major, and nearly sparked a diplomatic incident.And another occasion where the master of illusion, Paul Daniels, parked his swanky Rolls on the kerb and waltzed into the premises with future Strictly star Debbie McGee.Throughout the decades, there has been no shortage of Devine inspiration from the man who was awarded an MBE in the New Year Honours List in .And he gave us a trip down memory lane as he remembered the myriad stars who have tasted his company#s wares.Mr Devine said: #Over the years, we have seen many famous faces from music, sport, stage and politics.#Rab C Nesbitt actor Gregor Fisher was one of my favourites.#He would come in for his supper before every show he had at The Capitol and he was actually quite a shy person.#So he loved the Ashvale, because we would always go about serving his fish and chips without any fuss.#The only problem was, of course, trying to hide him from the rest of the customers as he sat there with his thick stubble, which was the only way we all could identy Rab C!#Later on, we employed his son when he went to university in Aberdeen and Gregor would always come to visit and never left without half-a-dozen mealie puddings in his pocket.#Mr Devine said some of the leading stars who have come to the fish and chip shop include Kenny Dalglish, Graeme Souness and Liam Brady.#And we have welcomed many players, management and directors of Aberdeen FC and still enjoy the company of chairman Dave Cormack and manager Derek McInnes,# he said.#On one visit, a few years ago, he was meeting a face that I recognised, but to whom I

were re around the city of his imminent arrival.#I had let the cat out of the bag. In a later interview, Barry laughed at how he knew he was in the right place to enhance his career when he signed up over an Ashvale fish supper.#Mr Devine also recalled one of the more flamboyant entrances at the Ashvale back in the late s.He said: #In the early days, we found ourselves serving the late Paul Daniels and his lovely we Debbie McGee.#But it wasn#t too easy to keep these two under wraps as they turned up in a bright red Rolls-Royce.#It also displayed the registration plate MAGIC, which created a lot of interest.#But again, they were very nice customers.#Mr Devine has rubbed shoulders with many figures from the world of ballot boxes and party manestos, including former first ministers Alex Salmond and Jack McConnell, and a string of members of the House of Lords, including Sir Menzies Campbell and Lord Nicol Steven.However, he found himself skating on thin ice while carrying out what he imagined was a routine assignment.He explained: #One episode that went terribly wrong was when I was delivering  fish suppers to theAECC for the former PM John Major.#I thought I was being very conscientious as I sped towards the venue, but suddenly I was stopped by what could only be described as half of Grampian Police.#One officer asked: #Where do you think you#re going ##I replied, in a polite but slightly cheeky young tone: #Oh, I’ve to go straight to the front door with the PM#s supper#.#At which point, I was ordered to open my boot # there were no fancy vans in those days # and the great whf of fish and chips greeted the officer and I was sent on my way.#The next day, I featured across the front page of a tabloid newspaper with the headline: #Major#s Fish Suppers go Down a Bomb#.#They obviously suspected I was arriving with a bomb.#There has been no shortage of support for the restaurant from the world of music and the stage with visitors including Aberdeen-born Annie Lennox and Elaine C Smith who has made a habit of travelling up from the central belt with her #lovely mother just to give her a treat#.Su Pollard, Gerard Kelly, Buff Hardie, Fairground Attraction and Runrig#s Donnie Munro have also dined at the Ashvale.Mr Devine said: #Mel Gibson was here while he was in the north-east filming Hamlet . - Trailer\" width\"\" \"\" src\"https:www.youtube embed OrTNdgtLZCs featureoembed#enablejsapi#originhttps:wpcluster.dctdigital\" frameborder\"\" allow\"accelerometer autoplay encrypted-media gyroscope picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen#He was a very nice guy, but again, he was served his fish and chips with as little a fuss as at all possible.#And, more recently, suppers have been delivered to the stage of the PJ Live for Sir Elton John, Sir Rod Stewart and Lewis Capaldi, the latter of which became an Instagram sensation.There#s no denying the eclectic appeal of the Ashvale and how it has drawn people from all ages and backgrounds.But Mr Devine has been thrilled at having the opportunity to entertain one of his most revered sporting heroes.He said: #I save the best for last.

As a group of players we were looking forward to the Motherwell game, it was a big game live on TV and we’d the opportunity to go third.“That would have been nice but it’s been outwith our control and it’s been disappointing.“Even internationally we had a massive game away in Bosnia that I was looking forward to and it’s all come to a halt at not a very good time.“But everything international football or club football has to be put to the back-burner and it’s about the safety of everyone.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast podcast episode 10 nessie and the lost golf balls","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWelcome to Episode  of the Oban Time#s BOBcast.Charting Bob#s progress  and discussing lots of things golfare  presenters Stephen Day, George Graham, Martin Laing and Keith McIntyre.

Included in this is the Isle of Jura.This is as shockingly reckless as it is offensive.The Isle of Jura is not a #bolthole# as the Daily Mail has chosen to state but a very beautul island steeped in culture and rich history.On both Jura and Islay we, like so many rural areas, are struggling to deal with all of the challenges related to the Corona virus out break. Our local health services have very limited resources as it is, along side a population that has many elderly residents who are more at risk to the virus.We have seen a local uptick in people traveling to Islay in camper vans and this is happening at a time when the UK government is advising against non essential travel.Those who are choosing to travel to our islands of Islay, Jura and the many other islands in Argyll and Bute in order to avoid the coronavirus may end up inadvertently spreading it to islands who arenot as much affected in the same way as so many built up urban areas are. Such actions are as reckless as they are selfish and I would implore people who do not need to travel to our rural constituency to avoid doing so until this global pandemic has passed.Jura, Islay and the rest of Argyll are some of the most beautul places you will ever visit and you won#t find an area where the people are more hospitable and friendly but while this crisis is ongoing I would ask everyone who is not currently living here to avoid traveling here for the time being.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands ward.To the Scottish public,During this time of unprecedented uncertainty, we are all concerned about the safety and wellbeing of our families, friends and colleagues.Our hearts go out to those who have been affected personally by the outbreak of coronavirus , as well as the many communities around the world that are facing extreme measures in an attempt to slow its spread.We appreciate and are mindful of the challenges iniduals are currently facing as well as the impact this pandemic has had on our vital emergency services as well as the grocery retail sector, supply chain and producers.Like our retail partners, we want to take this opportunity to assure you that Scottish farmers, auctioneers, hauliers, processors and butchers are doing everything they can to maintain the ongoing availability of fresh, locally sourced Scotch Beef PGI, Scotch Lamb PGI and Specially Selected Pork.We would like to thank all those who work in the Scottish red meat industry and their families for their ongoing and unwavering efforts to keep our supermarket shelves and butcher shops stocked, fuelling Scotland with top-quality red meat during this challenging time.As bodies supporting the Scottish agricultural and red meat industry, we are constantly reviewing the developing situation and are doing all we can to support everyone involved in putting nutritious food on your plates.Alan Clarke, chief executive, Quality Meat ScotlandMartin Morgan, executive manager, Scottish Association of Meat Wholesalers Duncan Todd, secretary, Scottish Beef Association Jen Craig, president, National Sheep Association Scotland Penny Montgomerie, chief executive, Scottish Association of Young Farmers Clubs and Gordon King, executive manager, Scottish Craft Butchers.What on earth is going on  It was banal enough when Ben Goldsmith # English financier and environmentalist # tweeted that #overgrazing# by upland sheep farmers, was responsible for the devastating floods in South Wales, rather than record-breaking torrential rainfall.Unbelievably we now have a government official, Dr Tim Leunig, suggesting the whole of the UK does not need farming, and his comparison of the UK to Singapore in this context is absolutely ludicrous. You truly have to wonderthere is something in the water that he is drinking – could it be flood contamination Surely, every person having a full and ing set of neurons and synapses, the complete opposite is the truth, as we dearly need our hard working farming community.The UK Government should be fully supporting the farming industry and indeed, good land management. The Welsh Assembly has totally lost its way with its mindless policy of devastating Welsh forests with thousands and thousands # an understatement # of trees being felled for wind farms, and compounding the felony by covering acres of land with very limited electricity generating solar parks # Wales is not the Sahara and the sun disappears at night! Solar  will generate about  per cent of their maximum capacity in the UK.Returning to farming perhaps some kind person should tell Dr Tim Leunig that the answer lies in the soil and then lead him to a darkened and quiet room so he can lie down and contemplate the truth # wise men recognise that truth is the daughter of time, not of authority.Dave Haskell, Cardigan."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column april 3 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWe join our communities in applauding the people at the sharp end of the coronavirus outbreak.In this time of crisis, we have nothing but admiration for frontline health, care and other local authority staff # and even management # who are having to deal with the virus close-up.Let#s not forget everyone  working on for the benefit of our society, from shop workers to lorry drivers and the emergency services # and many more besides.

From his throne he dispensed news, advice and anecdotes – albeit not always historically accurate. His inimitable irony, perfectly-timed humour and the occasional reprimand to a wayward customer were all fuelled by a generous glass.As former president of the Scottish Licensed Trade Association and Keeper of the Quaich, Donald knew the intricacies of the business intimately from personal experience. His taste was eclectic and his appetite substantial, extending from Dom Perignon and Saint-Émilion Grand Cru to Tennent’s lager and Glen Dronach single malt. On a hot day he’d have an icy Martini or a gin and tonic, proportionately scaled up in a pint glass. Being askedhe had time for a quick ‘small one’, he would reply: #I’ll decide the size for myself,you don’t mind.#The records suggest that his frequent claim to be Scottish Slimmer of the Year, after getting his weight down from  stone to  stone, was fancul.Big D, as he was often called, was fastidious about standards in the little public bar, training his regulars to clear tables of empty glasses and plates promptly, and to keep the log fire stoked on winter evenings.If one of his regulars turned up untypically well-dressed, Donald would raise an eyebrow in mild surprise:  #What’s the occasion for the suit   A funeral   Your latest marriage   Or has your court case come up #In summer, an erratic stream of foreign tourists would have their first encounter with a Scottish pub, standing in the doorway bewildered as to what happens next – sit or stand  Fight their way to the mobbed bar or go to a table and wait for the non-existent waitress  Donald would call them over to his corner and was soon plying them with drinks, food and conversation, not infrequently paying the entire bill for his astonished guests.When a tourist asked him about the quaint red GPO telephone box in Church Square, he told them: #We have the fastest modern communications here – telephone, teletext and tell Donald.#Donald was a Francophile and loved his summers in Collioure, where #Le Grand Ecossais# was almost as well-known as in Argyll. A fixture of the local bars and restaurants, and frequently crossing the border to patronise Spanish hostelries, he revelled in the region’s seafood, wine and culture.His hobbies included cooking, opera, reading and lively conversation on a sweeping range of topics from local history to civil engineering. His knowledge was genuinely wide, but when occasionally encountering someone with a superior command of the topic in question, he would quickly change the subject and admonish: “Och, you’re showing off now.”Donald Clark was born on  July , in Rotten Row hospital, Glasgow. He was the youngest child of Donald Clark and Elizabeth Inglis, following by nine years his only sibling, Fiona.His early years were spent in Inveraray where family le revolved around his parents’ hotel in the little white-washed town.He was schooled at Inveraray Primary and Larchfield in Helensburgh, then Strathallan from  to  where he acquired his love of sports. Contrary to what his dimensions in later le would suggest, he was athletic when young, excelling at rugby and playing for his school and West of Scotland First XV and the old boys’ As.Donald also enjoyed curling, motor boating, snow skiing and water-skiing, where his party piece was to mono-ski down Loch Fyne while drinking a pint of beer.Although not a shinty player, he used his sports experience to coach the Inveraray team in the s and like his father chaired the club. In , he flamboyantly arrived in Inverness by helicopter for Inveraray#s Camanachd Final against Kingussie."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column april 17 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSuch is the all-consuming impact of the coronavirus pandemic and response on all our lives, it is something of a relief to report something away from the subject.The relatively new owner of Inveraray Pier wants to encourage community involvement, but people will need to raise moneythey choose to get involved. A community buy-out was, in fact, an option mooted in the bad old days, but negotiations proved dficult at that time.With a new spirit of openness, this has to be an opportunity worth grasping. Inveraray has pretty well lost its connection with Loch Fyne since the pier has been out of bounds. To have full control over the pier is something townsfolk have dreamt of for years.

They feed on flying insects and spend most of their le in the air # including when they sleep # usually coming down to earth to breed. They are fast fliers, often chasing one another over buildings when they give a screeching call.Swts arrive back in Argyll in early May and breed in towns, villages and other buildings in Argyll. They spend around three months in Argyll, departing early-mid August to their wintering grounds in Africa.The British Trust for Ornithology’s Breeding Bird Survey indicates the population of Swts in Scotland has declined by around  per cent since . A similar decline has taken place in England and Wales. The reasons for the decline are not fully known but are believed to be related to changes in insect numbers and a lack of nesting sites as buildings are modernised.Argyll is at the north-western limit of the world range of Swts. Their distribution and numbers in Argyll is not well-known and the purpose of the Argyll Bird Club Survey is to try to find out the size of the breeding population and where they remain.If you have a Swt nesting in your building, or near you, or would like to take part in this survey further information is available at http:argyllbirdclub.org argyll-surveysFor more information about Argyll Bird Club, email Jim Dickson at Argyllbirder@outlook."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor april 24 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSir,A few weeks ago I launched an appeal on social media aimed at supporting nurses and medics at the Mid Argyll Hospital during this terrible COVID- pandemic.I was initially trying to find outthere was anyone locally who might be interested in dusting down their sewing machine to make a few sets of protective ‘scrubs’ to donate to the hospital. Within a couple of days the response was staggering.There were volunteers from all corners of Mid Argyll willing to sew, donate material and give freely of their time. Local businesses were also quick to respond with offers of material, pattern printing and transport for moving stock around.I am overwhelmed by the support and generosity of people in Mid Argyll. They have risen to the challenge and far exceeded my expectations.We have around  stitchers from Cairndow to Ardfern, and villages and towns in between, producing brightly coloured ‘scrubs’ using mainly donated fabric, scrap material and jazzy duvet covers. The first donation of ‘scrubs’ is expected to be handed over to the hospital this week and we are sure they will brighten up the wards.Our crowdfunding page, ‘Let’s Get Scrubbing for Mid Argyll’, was originally set up to buy everything to make the scrubs. It has broken the original £ target and we would love to hit the £, mark so please feel free to donate.I am overwhelmed and humbled by this experience and publicly thank the group team leaders, the volunteer stitchers, those working behind the scenes and the wider community for their support and generosity.My thanks is also extended to the following businesses who have helped in so many ways: MacLeod Construction, Kit-You-Out, Mary’s Meals, Top Designer, West Coast Motors, LG Upholstery, Clock Tower, Tarbert COS Thrt Shop, Premier Laundry, Ian Y McIntyre, Willie Leitch Sailmaker, Owen Sails and the Lithgow Family at Ormsary Estate.Nikki Thompson, Ardrishaig.Sir,The time will come when we are through the turmoil of this pandemic but as we work our way through it, I wanted to share a situation that reflects the actions of many.I was recently collecting shopping in Tarbert for registered vulnerable people and, as I was taking off my gloves before getting into the car, I was aware of another#s presence close by pushing a mobile rubbish bin. It was Damon. He saw me about to put my gloves into the rubbish bag in my own car and said cheerily #You can pop them into this bin here,you like#.I was so taken by that gesture. What an example of initiative, thoughtfulness and kindness. It summed up the incredible work of so many volunteers, co-ordinated by Team Tarbert#s Fiona, with Margaret co-ordinating prescriptions, and many others.Perhaps there is no better time for us all to reaquaint ourselves with Rudyard Kipling#s poem #If#.It seems to perfectly summarise humanity working at its best, in which, during this crisis, thanks to so many, Tarbert can walk tall. Stay safe.Peter Minshall, Tarbert.Sir,I write regarding the Argyllshire Advertiser edition dated Friday April  and the front page heading #Hospital prepares for Pandemic#.The article states: #No figures have been released about the incidence of coronavirus in Argyll and Bute# because the HSCP spokesperson said #we are following national guidance and due to reasons of patient confidentiality we will not be able to make public where in the Highland health board areas the positive cases are#.This statement is complete nonsense and shows either the HSCP in Argyll has not been privy to this information or they are just using the term #national guidance# as a smokescreen and an excuse and or sheer incompetence.No-one was asking them for patients# names and addresses, merely figures of those affected in a given area.The people appointed to positions of responsibility in Argyll and Bute HSCP are hopeless when it comes to joined-up thinking and accountability.All they will do is spin you a line and quote stuff like #national guidelines#, which is code for #I don#t have a clue#.Karl Edwards, LochgilpheadSir,Scottish and Southern Electricity Networksis extending the support it provides to those most vulnerable by expanding the eligibility of its Priority Services Registerto include customers at increased risk of severe illness during the coronavirus pandemic.Nearly , customers already receive additional care and support through SSEN’s PSR – a free, tailored service.In addition to those self-isolating or shielding for  weeks, customers are eligiblethey:Julie Walker, SSEN."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column april 24 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsMidton has been making the distinctive and coveted awards for the Royal Television Society for the past  years # and this week the company#s resourcefulness in adapting to face shield production was acknowledged by the society.

This year the figure fell to less than  per cent.The council also refuses to allow children whose parents opt to keep them home and fund the nursery place themselves to remain in school nurseries.Parents who decide to pay for an additional year of nursery themselves to keep their children out for a year face bills of up to pound, and a hunt for alternative child care places.Another mum who was refused funding said she had initially been supported in her view that her child was too immature to start school by her nursery.But they withdrew that support after pressure from the councilrsquos education department, she said.ldquoThey were told that they couldnrsquot support us because we didnrsquot meet the council policy criteria and withdrew their support, she explained.ldquoOur views meant nothing and the impact on our child meant nothing.And other parents expressed fears that their children were being robbed of nursery experience because they have been in lockdown for some of the vital months they would have had and would have no transition into school.One mum said: Children who start school at -years-old already receive a year less nursery time than those who are older, that has been reduced further by the closure of nurseries.ldquoHow can we ask these young children to go from months at home with their family to suddenly starting primary one with no transition A spokesperson for East Lothian Council said: ldquoconfirmed they have now agreed to approve all deferral requests for the year ahead.They said: ldquoAs a result of the ongoing closure of schools and nurseries, we have been reviewing applications for deferred entry to P, ahead of session  .

The Spirit of Speyside Whisky Festival has become an iconic event on the international whisky calendar, appealing to both the whisky curious and connoisseurs in a region that has become one of the fastest-growing tourist destinations in the UK.As well as being home to the highest concentration of distilleries of all whisky regions in the world, Speyside also produces the largest volume of whisky, as well as an increasingly wide range of spirits ndash we are now home to  dferent gin companies.This is why we introduced our Speyside Gin Festival in June, to create a new weekend for both locals and visitors to enjoy, then we celebrate all our great Speyside whisky companies and local gin and craft beer companies at our Distilled Festival, all under one roof in Elgin, normally at the end of August.This yearrsquos Gin Festival has sadly been cancelled and a decision is yet to be made about Distilled. However, based on current guidance, we feel itrsquos unlikely it will go ahead.But the appetite for whisky is there and it will remain. I am confident our economy will be rebuilt and we will work hard to do this together. According to VisitScotland, the Spirit of Speyside Festival welcomed visitors from  dferent countries to its th anniversary festival last year. This is a sector that is worth pound million to the regionrsquos economy. When we emerge from the other side of the pandemic Irsquom certain these figures will only increase.International travel is sure to take a downturn in the short term, while people look for local and regional travel opportunities on their doorstep. Domestic travel is set to be the first to bounce back when restrictions are eased, and I canrsquot wait to welcome tourists from all over the UK to beautul Speyside.Our Team Speyside approach to tourism will pull us through these tough times in our part of the world, of that I have no doubt. Our whisky distilleries will reopen, glasses will be raised to good health, and visitors from across the world will once again immerse themselves in Malt Whisky Country. Never will the term ldquoslaacuteinte mhaith hold more weight than it will when this is all over.

I wanted to bring culture into peoplersquos living rooms and to have a sense of everybody doing it at the same time, because one of the things that has been happening a lot is that people have been pre-recording these cultural experiences and sometimes they can seem dead on arrival ndash but I wanted this to feel very live.Beginning on Thursday at pm, Kay will launch this series of online literary and musical performances, produced by the National Theatre of Scotland and streamed on its YouTube channel. In its mix will be not only readings and singing, but conversation about art and poetry, as well as the strange times we are going through and the struggles they bring. Kay, who will host, hopes they will offer ldquofood for the soul.Having lost her father, pre-lockdown, and struggled with not being able to see her mother who is in a care home, she acknowledges that, like many, she has found these times hard. ldquoIrsquove been traumatised by lots of things. The last time I saw my mum I had to persuade the home to let me in just to say goodbye. Hers was one of the first homes in the country to go into lockdown, on March , and though at the time it felt shocking it was definitely a wise move. I know two homes, near hers, that have had many die just in the last few days. Itrsquos terrying. I find it worse, this situation, having my mum in the home at this time, than my dad dying. I know that loss canrsquot really be measured in scales butI had to say what was the most dficult experience I would definitely say this is the most dficult experience ever.One of the things Kay want to do is ldquoaccompany people through these times. That accompanying is partly what we have a Makar for. Itrsquos one of the reasons we turn to poets, singers and artists. In times like these we need such voices. ldquoI feel itrsquos important, now, to accompany people, she says, ldquobecause I think that this particular crisis has turned the volume up. Kind people have got kinder, anxious people more anxious. Itrsquos showed the huge problems we have in our society already. Poor people are more likely to die quicker of this virus, BAME people are more likely to die quicker ndash so I just wanted to create something that takes note of our time but also offers something up to them.The series is curated by Kay and produced by the National Theatre of Scotland in association with HOME Manchester and Edinburgh International Book Festival and School of Arts and Media, Salford. The writers and musicians are being paid in an attempt to support artists during this dficult period. The commitment to the four-month stretch of the series is also an acknowledgement that we will not be ing to social gathering, theatre-going and the live arts experience any time soon. Most of the summerrsquos live events, including Edinburghs festivals, are already cancelled.ldquoI think, says Kay, ldquoeven when people start trying to put their heads out of the door, theyrsquoll want to pull their head right back in. People are not going to gather publicly for some time. I donrsquot think theatres are going to be open till January next year, at the earliest, and even when things do open, people will be wary about gathering in public groups.Many artists, she observes, are shting to trying to deliver their work online ndash and this may be increasingly the way of the future. ldquoWe all needed to be travelling less, flying less, and so perhaps some of these new formats are new formats for our times and point the way to cleaner air.Makar To Makar will be part of the flowering of creativity that has already been happening online. ldquoWe know,\" says Kay, \"from reading about all dferent crises throughout time, that people will turn to poetry and music. During the siege of Sarajevo, they had years of no water, no electricity, very little proper food, bombs going off, but they still managed to erect these theatres and people still managed to come out and see shows.\"The Covid- crisis, she notes, ldquohas been musicrsquos defining hour\". ldquoPeople have been touched by things like the Italians singing on their balcony.But whats missing with much online art is that sense of us all coming together in a moment of time, as we would around a live event. This is what Kay hopes to create. ldquoRight now wersquove lost our communality because wersquore not able to do communal things together, like go out and eat together or go to the theatre together, and it seems to me this is one way of bringing the communal back.\" What she wants, she says is to give people ldquosomething stimulating, hopeful, thought-provoking, funny, sad, a whole range of things ndash and that people will get a chance to experience it all together."},{"url":null,"title":"letters-must-face-heavy-price-society-going-pay","story":"If everyone in the UK stayed indoors until a vaccine or cure is discovered for Covid- there would be no deaths attributable to the disease. Fact. However, as soon as one person breaks that restriction, the odds change, by however small a degree. Fact. Multiply that one person by any number and the odds of transmission begin to shorten exponentially. Fact. The now infamous R number is just a reflection of those odds.The obvious conclusion, however unpalatable, is that any move whatsoever away from total isolation, in whatever set of circumstances in respect of social distancing, PPE equipment, hand washing, masks, and so on, will cause that R number to increase. And such a scenario will remain the case until a vaccine cure is produced. Fact.An obvious corollary of this is that the virus will spread, the population will become infected, people will die. Therefore, current strategies, however well-intentioned, are merely ways of seeming to be doing something positive when, in fact, denying the virological evidence from the scientic community. In other words, no matter what Boris Johnson or Nicola Sturgeon tell us, without a vaccine, any loosening of current restrictions in the direction of \"opening up\" the country will, without doubt, lead to fatalities. Fact. Perhaps, as in any struggle, this a price society is willing to accept. Who knows However, the political, economical, social and personal cost of any measures are, of course, quite a dferent matter. But they will not, cannot, change the facts of this pandemics reproduction trajectory. It is said that we are \"at war\" with this disease and we know that people die in wars. Yet apparently the first casualty of war is truth. So maybe a sad dose of truthful reality might help us all to grasp, to deal with, but most vital of all, to cultivate the patience required to defeat the horror that is coronavirus.Gerard McCulloch, Saltcoats.SCIENCE is simply defined as a body of knowledge acquired by measurement, repeated measurement, precise measurement. Mathematics is considered Queen of Science.Scientists giving advice about Covid- management are unable to measure, with laboratory support, incidence or prevalence in the living community. A further dficulty arises in the deceased community due to lack of precisionof definition of cause of death. Certied involvementof Covid- in causing an iniduals death may be a scientic statement, with technicalsupport, but may be no more than a guess which may be plausible rather than credible.Politicians who lean upon scientists for advice must bear in mind that the quality of the advice given and received is no better than the reliability of the sources of the data utilised. Those who lack scientic training, such as politicians trained in law, may demonstrate excessive trust in what a scientist unwisely alleges. Unfortunately, at the present time many politicians are experienced only in politics and are vulnerable to charlatans.Dr William Durward, Bearsden.The BBC Disclosure programme quoted scientists whose modelling suggested that more than , Covid- deaths could have been preventedScotland had gone into lockdown two weeks earlier .However, for that to have happened Scotland would have needed to be a normal independent country in control of finance, welfare plus our borders and air transport rather than be wedded to a bumbling and shambolic Westminster Government.On January  Boris Johnson ignored the WHO declaration of a Public Health Emergency of International Concern and on March  dismissed the pandemic as not medically rational, which has resulted in the UK having the highest number of Covid- deaths per head of population in the world and trashed the UK economy with the loss of one million jobs.We donrsquot know whether Nicola Sturgeon received the same medical and scientic advice as Boris Johnson, but she has certainly handled the situation much better and been more straightforward with the public.Fraser Grant, Edinburgh EH.NOT very long ago, Nicola Sturgeon told us that she would enter into a grown-up conversation with the Scottish public about coronavirus. So far it appears to consist of \"shut up and do what you are told\", but we can hope that it will eventually begin.When it does, a good start would be to be informed whether Scotland is to have its own Covid Alert Level, which seems to be a useful tool in the battle to get out of lockdown. Crucially, it also would allow us to come to our own conclusions as to whether the measures in place at any time are necessary and proportionate.Or does the First Minister not think we are grown up enough to handle such information Peter A Russell, Glasgow G.RUTH Marrrecommends to readers that during the phased release from Covid lockdownyou happen to live in Scotland we should listen to Nicola Sturgeon for national guidance.If there is indeed statistical medical evidence justying Scotland following a dferent exit programme from England and indeed other nations within the UK, an obvious question is raised.Where does the argument for the issue being directed by local circumstance end  There are fairly obvious and rational reasons why pubs and restaurants in Scotland should all reopen at the same time. However.the fall in the rate of contagion is consistently and signicantly dferent across areas of Scotland perhaps it should be left to local authorities to decide, on the evidence, when their own schools should reopen.The latest results from the National Records of Scotland indicate that in terms of deaths involving Covid per , of the population, people residing in Greater Glasgow and Clyde Health Board areas are the worst hit by the virus. However Orkney, Shetland and the Western Isles are relatively least affected. I would suggest that schools in these three areas could reopen before the schools in very badly affected authorities such as Inverclyde.Bill Brown, Milngavie.NICOLA Sturgeon determines that Scotland requires dferent, more restrictive Covid- lockdown criteria to England because the circumstances are dferent. Fair enough, but that same logic applies to areas within Scotland, such as the islands, where virus cases have been relatively light.Somewhat ironically perhaps, the new English restrictions are more relevant to the present situation in Orkney than the Edinburgh-imposed ones.James Miller, Kirkwall.READING Guy Stenhouses articleI was not surprised by the points made, coming from the financial perspective as they did. They followed neatly on from the UK Prime Ministerrsquos broadcast on Sunday evening and pointed to the direction to be taken on the Monday.I was, however, shocked by its later tone and lack of empathy shown towards a workforce thrown back at short notice to an environment which may not be fully prepared for this and social issues arising such as childcare. It went on, it seemed, to weigh and to evaluate the limited contribution of those most vulnerable to the virus by stressing the lower death rates in younger people who could nowto work and contribute to economic recovery. It alluded to lestyle behaviours among some of these vulnerable groups and apportioned blame for the consequences of these in the current crisis to those suffering from drug and alcohol dependence and even cake consumption, presumably in light of the consequences of obesity.At a point in our history when the positives arise from the care and compassion of those caring for those affected by Covid-, be it in the NHS, care at home or in homes and by that section of the workforce still involved in food production and delivery and sales, plus our postal workers and refuse collectors and many others, often in jobs which are not highly paid, statistics only contribute to one part of the whole picture and to the decisions to be taken in these challenging times.Margo Biggs, Falkirk.MARIANNE Taylor bemoans the fact that tone of lockdown debates constantly needs ldquoto judge the motives of others within an ideological context . As I pointed out recently, we have had, for a decade in Scotland and for almost a similar period across the whole of the UK, political leaders who have made ideological causes the central plank of their drive for power, and the bedrock of their policies once in power. In doing so, they have fostered an atmosphere where binary, ideological argument is the order of the day.It can surely be of no surprise to Ms Taylor that almost every issue in UK politics is thus framed  If, when discussing garden centres, independence or Brexit, one side says black, itrsquos an absolute given that the other will say white.I fear this trend may continue for a generation.Stuart Brennan, Glasgow G.I WONDER what the UK Governments response will be when the country finally emerges from this horrendous period. Will Priti Patel continue with her policy of only accepting so-called professional immigration and remove \"unskilled\" workers who have in some cases died keeping the country going ndash cleaners, bus drivers, hospital staff, hospitality staff, security staff and the like Charles Thomson, Glasgow G.I AM pleased to see thatwe are now recommended to \"Stay at Home\" rather than the unidiomatic \"Stay Home\".

When it came to creating the menu there was a scene in the with Hagrid and Harry before the dragons arrived. The starter I created, Dragon of the Wood, was a venison tartare with celeriac remoulade and a smoked mayonnaise. I used wood sorrel and mushrooms as well - things you might associate with a walk in the woods.ldquoIn the heats the judges asked for more theatre so for the final the starter was presented to them after a fire-eating display. It was tougher than I thought it would be linking the food to a story.Read more: Lockdown recipes: Chef Paul Tamburrini brings you his family feastsEach night a team of eight chefs compete to have their starter, fish course, meat and dessert chosen for the banquet. And hosting this yearrsquos series for the first time is Scots comedian Susan Calman who provided moments of light relief when needed and picked up the chefs when tensions were mounting high.ldquoIt was great to have Susan around in the kitchen. I just think she is very funny, but she was also very supportive and would keep us going when we needed it.Facing the judging  of Irish restaurateur Oliver Peyton, restaurateur Andi Oliver and food critic Matthew Fort, had the finalists on tenterhooks to find outtheir dishes had made it through.While reading was one interest, Mrs Hall-McCarronrsquos main passion growing up was food. Although from Edinburgh, it was holidays on the west coast on her fatherrsquos boat that sparked her interest in cooking. Catching ingredients such as langoustines and scallops proved to be an inspiration.She worked in a restaurant as a teenager before going to catering school, but was keen to get back into the kitchen and worked at Number  in Glasgow and Slaley Hall in Northumbria before heading to the Balmoral Hotel in Edinburgh. After working in Dubai for  months, Mrs Hall-McCarron ed home where she took up a post at Tom Kitchinrsquos restaurant in Leith. She worked at another Kitchin venture Castle Terrace, in the capital, but with along with husband Shaun McCarron they decided to open up their own place.ldquoJust before lockdown we had started a takeaway service, but then it became clear we would have to close.

He got a result, too, securing an admission from Boris Johnson that a lack of testing capacity was the reason for the early halting of track and trace.Neilrsquos praise did not stop there. On his performance against First Secretary Dominic Raab while the PM was convalescing, the former Sunday Times editor declared that ldquothe UK now had a ing, probing, measured, informed official opposition. The government will need to raise its game.Not everyone is as impressed. An Ipsos Mori survey at the end of April asked a sample of the public who they thought was doing a good or bad job in holding the UK Government to account during the virus crisis. Top of the league were the journalists at the pm Downing Street press briefings, with % of respondents praising their effectiveness.: Poorest Scots twice as likely to die from virusBottom was the Labour Party, %, with its new leader faring not much better with %.With % backing him, Piers Morgan, motormouth co-presenter of Good Morning Britain, was hailed as being a better leader of the opposition than the actual leader of the opposition.As Ipsos MORI pointed out, Sir Keirrsquos low rating may be explained by his not yet appearing on many peoplersquos radars. Any leader of the opposition struggles to break through the noise of the everyday cut and thrust. Few have faced the roaring din of the coronavirus crisis.Slowly and surely, however, he is making his presence felt, whether it be in a televised response to Boris Johnsonrsquos address on easing the lockdown in England, at PMQs, and in the press generally.He has been interviewed for this paper by our Westminster correspondent Hannah Rodger, and last Saturday he was the cover star of the FT Weekend magazine, complete with arty, moody, black and white photography. He intends to make more visits to Scotland when circumstances allow, and has already begun a series of virtual meetings with the Scottish public.Other than wartime it is hard to imagine more dficult circumstances for a new leader of the opposition to be taking up his job. He must hold the Government to account at the same time as supporting its efforts to save lives and keep people afloat financially he needs to point out mistakes without appearing to gloat and he has to call into question the competence of a Prime Minister who remains popularin many parts, and who was himself a victim of the virus.Sir Keirrsquos approach has been one of offering ldquoconstructive opposition. Yesterdayrsquos PMQs was another illustration of what this strategy looks like in action.As the second time the two men have clashed at PMQs, the session was also a chance to see how their relationship is shaping up. Every leader hopes to be lucky in their opposite number at PMQs, to be the Thatcher to the Kinnock, the early years Blair to the IDS.: Iain Macwhirter, border war off but tensions remainMr Johnson and Sir Keir have sharply dferent styles, the PMrsquos bluster and waffle contrasting with his opposite numberrsquos clipped precision. The Labour leader did not get the better of the PM to the same extent he did last week. The run-up to his questions was too long and meandering, and he was laying the civility on with a trowel instead of a kne. There remains, too, the not so small matter of his personality. Perhaps it is newcomerrsquos nerves, but his voice does take on a certain John Major tone, or should that be drone, at times. If the Commons chamber ever gets back to its usual packed state at PMQs he could struggle to be heard. In general, he is a man not overburdened with charisma.Then again, one personrsquos charm is anotherrsquos smarm. Where he impressed most yesterday was in his ability to get under the PMrsquos skin, this time on international comparisons of death rates ndash an exercise the Government took part in until the UK figures became the worst in Europe. The Labour leader had an advantage, and he pressed it home.Scotland has a stake in whether Sir Keirrsquos approach to opposition works. We should be in the market to learn about any kind of effective opposition, because heaven knows we do not have much of one at the moment.Before coronavirus, the opposition parties at Holyrood were failing to hold the government to account on a long list of subjects, from not meeting NHS waiting time targets to falling education standards.We know how this state of affairs has come about. In a matter of years both the Conservatives and Scottish Labour lost their leaders and replaced them with less effective candidates the Scottish Greens keep the SNP in power, and as for the Scottish Liberal Democrats, two words: Willie, Rennie. You do not need to be a fan of Nicola Sturgeon to acknowledge that she is head and shoulders above the other party leaders. Which is good for her and her party, but it makes for a pretty poor show when it comes to holding government to account.There is another reason, other than the present crisis, to hope the opposition parties in Scotland get their act together soon. The next Scottish Parliament election is less than a year away. Who knows what position Scotland and the UK will be in then. Given the ever more dire assessments of the impact of coronavirus on the economy, governments around the UK will be dealing with levels of unemployment and hardship the likes of which have not been seen in generations.The economic landscape has changed utterly, and in time politics will catch up.Now, more than ever, we need governments that are up to the job, and oppositions to match.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

Although some patients lsquosuspectedrsquo of having the virus were brought into intensive care during the seven days in between, they subsequently tested negative.The number of confirmed Covid patients in ICU has also continued to fall since the weekend, from  on Sunday to  as of yesterday, although two lsquosuspectedrsquo Covid patients were awaiting the results of tests.The figures are likely to add to pressure on the Scottish Government to step up preparations to resume NHS elective operations, including some cancer and heart bypass surgeries, which have been put on hold to focus resources on the outbreak and limit the risk of exposing very vulnerable patients to the virus in hospital.Thousands of other routine procedures, such hip and knee replacements or cataracts removals, were also suspended for a three-month period from mid-March, with other services such as bowel, breast and cervical cancer screening also paused for the same period.The Royal College of Physicians Edinburgh this week urged ministers to ldquomove swtly but carefully towards the restoration of planned medical procedures, adding that this ldquomust include cancer services.: Scottish Government advisor back two-track exit from lockdown that would benefit majority earlierIntensive care admissions for Covid peaked in Scotland on March , when  patients with the infection were admitted on a single day.Since April , new admissions have been falling almost steadily, but it is unclear exactly when the last Covid positive patient was admitted to ICU in Scotland.According to the first report by the Scottish Intensive Care Society Audit Group, which covers a period up to May ,  per cent of intensive care admissions were male, the median age of patients was , and % had no pre-existing conditions.Of those who did, the most common were diabetes or respiratory disease , followed by cancer , and cardiovascular disease .People from Scotlandrsquos poorest areas accounted for % of ICU admissions for Covid, compared to % from the most affluent areas.Overall mortality, based on the  patients who had completed their ICU stay by May , showed that % of patients died. That is lower than the % death rate reported for intensive care Covid patients in England and Wales, but may be skewed by a smaller sample size and does not include the outcomes for those patients who remained in ICU as of May .It comes as the latest report by National Records of Scotland revealed that men are % more likely than women to die from Covid, with Scots from the most deprived areas are more than twice as likely to die from the virus as those from the wealthiest postcodes.: Poorest Scots twice as likely to die from coronavirusThis is in line with patterns seen where in the UK which have been linked to existing health inequalities, such as higher rates of obesity, smoking and chronic disease among the poor, as well as potentially higher risk of exposure in low-paid occupations.Research this week from the Office for National Statistics found that security guards, care workers, builders, cleaners, taxi drivers, bus drivers, chefs and retail staff are all at a greater risk of dying from Covid.In Scotland, % of those who died in April had at least one pre-existing condition. The most commonwas dementia, reflecting the fact that three quarters of Covid victims are  or older.According to NRS, which bases its figures on death certicates,  people had died with Covid by May , although the numbers are now falling.From May -, Covid was linked to  deaths in Scotland - down  from the previous week. It is the second weekly reduction in a row.Care homes continue to account for the largest share of Covid deaths - % last week and % of the total to date - but the actual number of people dying in care homes was also down for the second week in a row, to .Nicola Sturgeon welcomed the decrease, but stressed the Scottish Government will ldquocontinue to err on the side of caution.She added: ldquoAlthough we are seeing positive signs in the case numbers, those in hospital and those dying from this virus, we are not through this pandemic yet."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/11368822.jpg?type=article-full","title":"coronavirus-half-scottish-families-children-financially-struggling","story":"Some , households with children in Scotlandare \"struggling to make ends meet\" or in \"serious financial dficulty\" according to the analysis which reveals the \"shocking\" toll that the coronavirus pandemic is having on family financies. This compares to  per cent of all households in Scotland reporting the same levels of financial stress.The leading think tank IPPR Scotland, which carried out the research is calling on the Scottish Government and the UK government to step in to provide new payments to financially-starved households.It comes as over  campaigners signed an open letter urging the First Minister to fund an ldquoemergency package to prevent a child poverty crisis.The key demand is for the Scottish Government to put the equivalent of pound a month into the pockets of low income families for every child.Child poverty in Scotland stands at around ,, but fears exist the Covid- crisis will increase unemployment and plunge more families into hardship.:Coronavirus in Scotland -Poverty warning for Scots hit by increased household billsAnd the IPPR Scotlands poverty survey of  households using the Standard Le Foundationrsquos Covid- Financial Impact Tracker created discovered what it described as a \"very worrying picture\" in the midst of the pandemic.The think tank extrapolated that around one in five families described themselves as being in \"serious financial dficulty\" while a further % said they were \"struggling to make ends meet\".Another % said they were \"potentially exposed financially\" while just % admitted that they were financially secure.Russell Gunson, director of IPPR Scotland said that despite current government support, including furloughing schemes which aim to protect up to % of workers earnings until at least the end of July, familes across Scotland were facing a \"signicant reduction in their income\" with many going into the crisis already struggling financially and without savings to cushion the blow.He said that meant a % reduction in earnings, and a potentially drastic drop in income to the levels of support offered by Universal Credit, would be \"impossible to absorb\".\"Our analysis shows that without question, hundreds of thousands of families with children in Scotland are struggling to make ends meet right now and we must look at what the UK and Scottish governments can do to help them with urgent support immediately,\" said Mr Gunson.\"The Scottish Government cannot shield low income families from the full financial hit many will face.\"Using the powers it has, the Scottish Government has moved to provide welcome additional funding to carers and to people in crisis through increased welfare funds, although more is needed.\"While the Scottish Government cannot do it all, it can do more.\"At the same time, and arguably to a greater extent, we must see action from the UK government to protect families with children in Scotland and across the UK. Most of the social security system is still reserved to Westminster, and the financial stress experienced by families in Scotland is being felt across the UK. So the UK government must act quickly to provide additional support to families with children.\"He said that in Scotland, the Covid- crisis has \"unfortunately\" forced the delay of one of the crucial measures that could have been used to help low income families in Scotland ndash the new Scottish Child Payment. The payment will see pound per week paid to low income families with children and was due to begin to be paid in late , starting with low income families with children under- before rolling out to all children under- by .He said this has now been delayed at least by months, while the crisis unfolds and limited administrative capacity becomes even more constrained.IPPR are now calling on the Scottish Government to urgently provide lump-sum payments of pound per child to low-income families this summer.This would get support equivalent to pound per week for the next six months to families now. It said it could be paid to families in receipt of Best Start Grantand through local authorities to those in receipt of the School Clothing Grantusing existing application, administration and payment routes to \"ensure payment is quick and the calls on administrative capacity are low\".It said the UK government should urgently increase the child supplements paid through Universal Credit by pound per week and provide a pound uplt in Child Benefit for the duration of the crisis. It said they should also end the two-child limit and benefit cap.\"We need to see the UK government act to support families with children,\" said Mr Gunson. \"To date this has been a key gap in its financial response to the crisis. By boosting child supplements paid through Universal Credit, by ending the two-child limit and Benefit Cap, and by providing an uplt in Child Benefit we could see at least some help provided to families at this point of crisis.\"As necessary as this action is, even this would unlikely be enough to prevent familiesrsquo levels of financial stress increasing. However, it would certainly help those facing the worst of the crisis so far.\"Governments across the UK have shown willingness to protect businesses and the wider economy through unprecedented levels of support. We must ensure we act to support families facing serious financial stress through higher levels of support, to ease some of the pressure on families now and to avoid some of the worst damage to children and familiesrsquo prospects in the future.\"Signatories to the open letter to the First Minister, which included Barnardos, Poverty Alliance, the Child Poverty Action Group in Scotland and Scottish Womens Aid, say the families they work with ldquoare reporting increased financial stress and associated anxiety, loneliness, and more complex mental health problems, and that the charitable hardship funds many of them operate have come under massively increased pressure. Aberlourrsquos Urgent Assistance Fund alone has, they say, seen a % increase in demand.The group urges the First Minster to use ldquoevery tool at your governmentrsquos disposal to deliver an emergency package of financial support to all low income families\".John Dickie, director of the Child Poverty Action Groupin Scotland, added: ldquoFamilies are already being pulled under by the financial impact of coronavirus, undermining childrenrsquos education, health and le chances, and putting progress on child poverty at real risk. Itrsquos right that government at every level should use every power at its disposal to provide an anchor of financial security through these extraordinary times. Boosting family incomes now is vital to shore up the foundations on which the recovery from coronavirus can be built and future progress on child poverty made.Peter Kelly, director of Poverty Alliance, said: ldquoEven before the current crisis, one in four children in Scotland were growing up in poverty. But in the last month we have seen record levels of applications for Universal Credit as people lose their jobs or see their working hours reduced.ldquoWhile many of us are struggling, families who were already getting by on low incomes have been hardest hit. Women have been particularly affected because they are more likely to live in poverty, have disproportionate responsibility for childcare and account for % of lone parents.ldquoUnless we take action now, there can be no doubt we are facing a child poverty crisis. The Scottish Government needs to use every tool in its box to protect children and families by putting money in peoplersquos pockets.A Scottish Government spokesman said: ldquoWe understand that this is dficult time for many families. That is why we are working on introducing the new Scottish Child Payment and will be paying carers in receipt of Carers Allowance an additional supplement this year.ldquoWe have invested more than pound. billion of support for businesses, which will enable them to keep people employed, and also specic targeted intervention for self-employed people experiencing hardship so we can ensure people are supported.\"In addition we have committed pound million of additional funding to support those most at risk, including more than doubling the Scottish Welfare Fund with pound million of new investment and over pound million to local authorities, with pound million targeted at food insecurity ndash investment which is supporting over , children to access Free School Meals.

It can also arise from the spontaneous decay of unstable atomic nuclei.The phenomenon can lead to an increase in air conductivity in the atmosphere through a process known as ionisation, releasing electric charge.Scientists have long suspected electric charge in the air can affect the way water droplets combine in the clouds which, in turn, can influence rainfall.However, these changes have been dficult to observe from modern-day weather data.So the team turned to the radioactive legacy of the Cold War nuclear arms race and combined bomb test data with historical weather records gathered from stations at Kew near London and Lerwick in the Shetland Isles.Although thousands of miles away from the detonation sites in the US and around the world, rainfall patterns in the Shetlands showed ldquosignicant changes during the test period as radioactive pollution spread widely throughout the atmosphere.The researchers wrote in their paper: ldquoSignicant changes occurred in daily rainfall distribution in the Shetland Islands, away from pollution.ldquoDaily rainfall changed by %, and local cloud optically thickened, within the nuclear weapons test period.ldquoThis supports expectations of electrically induced microphysical changes in liquid water clouds from additional ionisation.Scientists believe learning more about how electric charge affects rainfall will improve understanding of the weather processes and could help relieve droughts or prevent floods.The findings are published in the journal Physical Review Letters."},{"url":null,"title":"joanna-cherry-savages-snp-colleagues-bile-suppressing-debate","story":"Joanna Cherry, the partyrsquos justice spokesperson at Westminster, said some activists had tried to ldquoshout down and intimidate people who wanted an early independence referendum.The Edinburgh South West MP, who is closer to former First Minister Alex Salmond than Nicola Sturgeon, said ldquoanti-democratic, unhealthy behaviour was now present in the SNP.Writing in the National today, she said: ldquoThe anonymous lsquosenior SNP sourcesrsquo who brief against those of us who advocate wider democratic debate within the party should be aware that their underhand behaviour does not endear them to the activists whose hard work has put them in the senior positions they hold.ldquoI am working towards one goal alone and that is the goal of independence which most of our movement shares.ldquoSurely we should all be working towards it together...Only through respectful, open discussion and collaboration will we achieve our goal.

by example toto their workplace in London, has been likened to ldquosome sort of Victorian mill-owner by Alistair Carmichael, the Orkney and Shetland MP, who made clear that he and all his fellow Liberal Democrat MPs would not be ing to the Commons until it was completely safe to do so.And last night, Ian Blackford, the SNP leader at Westminster, said it was ldquononsense for Mr Rees-Mogg to suggest the digital Parliament, that had enabled MPs to safely work from home while holding the UK Government to account during the ongoing coronavirus outbreak, should be scrapped.On Wednesday, Mr Rees-Mogg raised hackles when he argued that the hybrid Parliament, where MPs participate in the Commons chamber while others do so digitally, was providing ldquoineffective scrutiny compared to the normal sitting.He decried how opposition politicians wanted to ldquohide behind a veneer of virtual Parliament, so that legislation is not progressed with.The Commons Leader went on: ldquoWe have heard it from the Scottish shadow spokesman, when he says that a virtual Parliament is a second-rate Parliament. He wants us all to be second rate, whereas I want us all to be first rate to get back to being a proper Parliament because democracy is essential.Mr Rees-Mogg added: ldquoHow can we hide away while schoolchildren are going back  Is that the right message to give to our constituents  Are we a people set apart, a special class who are exempt from what the rest of the country is doing  No, we are not. We are the leaders of our nation and we have a responsibility.But Mr Carmichael, arguably the farthest flung parliamentarian based in the Northern Isles, declared: ldquoIrsquom not going to put my family and my community at risk just because Jacob Rees-Mogg has an aversion to modernity. His behaviour yesterday was quite outrageous.ldquoHe looks ever more like some sort of Victorian mill-owner, having a bit of a spat just because his gentlemanrsquos club is not providing him with his favourite claret thatrsquos no way to run a modern Parliament.The former Scottish Secretary said it would be an ldquooutrage to switch off Westminsterrsquos ldquovirtual-feed before it was safe to do so.He went on: ldquoThe Conservatives, in particular, seem to be driving this, not because they are that bothered about the accountability of the Government we saw how much they cared about that on Sunday night when they went out with a broadcast to the nation before the Prime Minister had said a single word to Parliament.Decrying the Toriesrsquo ldquoresistance to change in the House of Commons, Mr Carmichael warned: ldquoThe message you start sending to people about bringing Parliament back before it is safe to do so would be just about as dangerous and self-defeating as it is possible to imagine.ldquoWhat you are seeing is internal party management from the Conservatives rather than pursuing the national interest and following the best scientic advice.The Lib Dem Chief Whip last trip home from Westminster took him  hours rather than the usual five, using the sleeper to Edinburgh, a hire car to Aberdeen and a ferry and another car home to Orkney.He added: ldquoThe Commons is a forum for the whole of the United Kingdom and, accordingly, we canrsquot leave it simply to people within driving distance of London to govern our nationrsquos affairs.ldquoSo, unless and until it is safe to do so, Liberal Democrats will not be attending the House of Commons but we are determined we will continue to represent our constituents in the meantime and we do that through the virtual Parliament.Mr Blackford was equally adamant that he and his fellow MPs would not put their staff and constituents safety at risk by continually travelling back and forth to London while the risks of catching and spreading the virus remained high.ldquoThe last three weeks have demonstrated that parliamentarians can make a contribution, can question ministers, hold the Government to account, debate and even vote digitally. Why would you put your staff and constituents at risk by going to London and thento your constituency Asked about Mr Rees-Moggrsquos desire toto a so-called ldquophysical Parliament by the beginning of June after the Whitsun recess, the Highland told The Herald: ldquoItrsquos a nonsense."},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"May ,  at : pmOrkney Islands Councilis experiencing disruption to two of its main internet connections.

This includes the establishment of a joint ministerial committee to discuss the ongoing pandemic and its management.A statement, released this afternoon, Thursday, on behalf of Alistair Carmichael MP and Lord Jim Wallace of Tankerness said: “Across the country, people are worried about their loved ones and their jobs in light of coronavirus – and they are getting mixed messages from governments.”In a time of crisis, confusion and inconsistency breed fear and put people at risk. A collective approach could help to restore public confidence that our leaders are pulling together.This is not about dropping blame at anyone’s door. The reality however is that in recent days and weeks, attempts to formulate responses to the coronavirus are more notable for apparent disagreements between national governments than for policy substance. We need governments to build consensus and create a shared responsibility across the UK.”We are calling for a more joined up response to what is a cross-governmental challenge – by establishing a coronavirus Joint Ministerial Committee “A coronavirus JMC with an enhanced remit, meeting regularly and with an approach based on consensus and shared responsibility would help to reduce disputes, with all governments involved in developing plans.”It would help to refocus coronavirus response based on national and regional needs rather than political borders. This solution could help reduce the chaos of the current political climate – and point the way towards a better long-term crisis response mechanism in future.”We believe that an enhanced JMC for the coronavirus crisis is the right way to give people confidence in their governments during this time – with a message that leaders are working with, rather than against each other.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

He also asked ministersthe businesses case would be reappraised in light of the impact of COVID- on air travel. In response, the transport secretary, Michael Matheson confirmed that the business case will not be reviewed and that work to implement the strategy “will continue in parallel with work to prepare the IIA ” rather than be deferred.As part of his answer to Mr McArthur, Mr Matheson said good air connectivity will continue to be essential to support economic recovery in all parts of Scotland and that recovery will benefit from having more reliable and sustainable air services.#The main argument for the centralisation of the ATC services has been that modernisation was needed and the use of new technologies at the airports affected, which includes Kirkwall, would maker services more reliable.After receiving the responses, Mr McArthur said: “This is a remarkable assertion by the Transport Secretary, which shows a blatant disregard for the provisions of the Islands Act. If a major procurement process can be allowed to continue before any island impact assessment is completed, it rather suggests that ministers have little interest in what that assessment might conclude.“At a time when the future shape of air travel is so uncertain, at the very least Ministers and HIAL should be taking stock. Instead, both seem entirely happy to press on asnothing has happened.“No-one disputes the need for investment in modernising air traffic control services at airports across the region. Yet, plans to centralise services was always recognised as the most risky and costly of the options available.  In light of current restrictions, the island impact assessment offered the perfect opportunity to review this decision. “Sadly, the Scottish Government and HIAL have chosen to pass up that opportunity, while also doing little to inspire confidence amongst islanders about the value of the Islands Act”.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

But that#s got to come from the islands themselves.#I#m not trying to say it will happen, at all, but it#s a live discussion. I am not discounting it, and neither am I going to say it#s going to happen — but I do think it#s worth considering. I think the people in Orkney and Shetland and, indeed, the Western Isles — they have a voice in this as well.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This had been planned for March before the coronavirus pandemic broke out.Sweyn Johnston is the council’s strategic projects director. He said: “We are very disappointed that we have been unable to carry out a public event in Hoy.#The previous event that we held in Hoy, and indeed public events we have held where in Orkney during the project, have been very beneficial in meeting with the public to talk about Orkney’s Community Wind Farm Project.“The emergency legislation passed by the Scottish Government is vital in keeping projects on track to support our future economic and societal recovery, businesses and jobs and avoiding delays to infrastructure and other developments.“It’s really important to us that members of the public are offered the best opportunity possible under the current circumstances to make their views known about the plans so that we can consider this before we submit our application.#We have worked hard to develop a consultation plan which gives as much flexibility as possible to allow folk to provide that input and are hopeful for a high level of participation.”The council intends to submit a planning application later this year.The project is part of a project which also includes proposed wind farm developments at Quanterness and on Faray in the North Isles.The development will consist of up to six turbines with a maximum blade-tip height of .m, access tracks, crane hardstandings, turbine foundations, underground cabling, on-site substation and maintenance building, a temporary construction compound, potential excavations borrow workings and a permanent meteorological mast.The objective of the PAC is for communities to be better informed about major and national development proposals and to have an opportunity to contribute their views before a formal planning application is submitted to the planning authority.It should be noted that comments made to OIC through this PAC process are not representations to the planning authority. If a planning application is subsequently submitted, neighbour notication and publicity will be undertaken, and iniduals and communities will have an opportunity to make representations on that application to the planning authority at that time.To discuss options for speaking to the project team please contact Kirsty Groundwater, Project Officer, Orkney Islands Council by email on kirsty.groundwater@orkney.gov.uk or by phone on . The deadline for submitting comments to the project team is Monday, June , at pm.Comments can be submitted through:copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

We write as Members of Parliament deeply concerned about the future of pubs in our constituencies.ldquoThese worries have been alleviated somewhat in recent weeks by Government support measures and the announcements of Adnams, Everards, Admiral Taverns, Timothy Taylorrsquos, Hall and Woodhouse, Robinsonrsquos, Wadworthrsquos, and Palmerrsquos Brewery, among others, that they will be offering rent-free periods for their pubs during the Covid- lockdown.ldquoHowever, we are dismayed that Ei Pub Company has not made any public undertaking to provide a rent-free period to its tenants and is instead simply deferring the rent to be paid off after the pandemic ends.It is understood that the group of MPs had been in discussions with Stonegate prior to publication of the letter, in an attempt to put pressure on bosses to offer more support.Stonegate had previously offered tenants a rent deferral and sources were keen to stress the rent payments, which will be offset by credit for beer, will not need to be paid for immediately. A planned price rise in May has also been paused.The credit will be given depending on the size of the pub and whether they are entitled to any Government and local authority coronavirus grants.Those receiving a grant of between pound, and pound, will get trade credits of either % or % of the value of three monthsrsquo rent, Stonegate added.Nick Light, managing director of Ei Publican Partnerships, pointed out that Chancellor Rishi Sunak has stipulated the grants ldquoare aimed at providing financial relief towards fixed costs, including rent.He added: ldquoIt is vital to us that our pubs and our publicans are in a position to trade successfully when pubs are allowed to reopen.ldquoThe rent support and trade credit initiatives are intended to provide our publicans with a strong  to do so and to help relieve some of the financial pressure required to restock and restart.The Government has said pubs could potentially reopen in July with strict social distancing measures, although this will depend on the success of easing lockdown restrictions.copy -.

THAT shouldn’t be necessary should it  But, in true B J fashion he is resorting to make do and mend bluster. I am mindful of the blind leading the blind.Let decisions be made by scientists not ill equipped dabbling politicians.That little pat on the head should appeal to you !!But never mind Nicola is letting us out exercise twice a day. It is a shame we are all being channelled into the same crowded places, through the same gates and chokepoints whilst the wide-open spaces and beaches of Shetland are closed down to the majority!!In the present serious crisis she is in full agreement with Wales and Ireland but not with England.

Boris Johnson claimed to be PM of 🇬🇧 Britain.He surely meant🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 not 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 Scotland or 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿Wales.Westminster is reluctant to let goIt is extraordinary sad news from Care Homes and Care Workers, but not unexpected. It takes months of training and years of experience to Barrier nurse to prevent cross-infection. Even the use of PPE requires extensive training. Our most vulnerable people conjugated into crowded homes was an accident just waiting to happen. Hopefully, next time, our care workers will have extensive professional training cross infection control with qualications and wages to match. Our most vulnerable, not all be herded into care homes but perhaps into a chalet system where separation and quarantine would be so much more effective..What is the R rate for Shetland  Looks like zero The politicians # all of them can #go away# .Do your gardening, go fishing, go for a walk whenever and where ever you want. Get the kids back into school. Get our economy open and people back to work.This is my opinion.Dive, e , e # incoming!!!What do you want  A Country with a minimised death toll but teetering on the brink of bankruptcy, or a country that#s suffered a higher death toll, and while perhaps shaken somewhat financially, is still resilient enough to continue without any great undue hardship for the survivors.England at present seems to be trying to steer an admittedly somewhat shaky course towards the latter, the rest of the UK, unfortunately seem hell bent on taking the direct route straight to the former.You cannot sustain increased Governmental expenditure and decreased Governmental income for any longer than the very short term, it called burning the candle from both ends#. We#ve been doing it now for  weeks### Very soon the time will come when Governmental leaders will have to make decisions on how many deaths are acceptable collateral damage to allow them to provide the services the majority need and keep their country afloat. The longer they leave it to make that decision, the more rushed, and by consequence, less appropriate, it is likely to be.There is no vaccine, there is no #cure#. Unfortunately some are going to have to take a hit for the team.It’s unfortunate that three centuries of free-market capitalism hasn’t generated enough wealth to feed the country for more than three months without going bankrupt but don’t worry Michael. Many people share your concerns about the economy and the government is onto it:A confidential Treasury assessment of the coronavirus crisis leaked to Theargues that it will require measures including a two-year public sector pay freeze in order to “boost investor confidence# in the British economy. So, a round of grateful applause for the NHS Staff, Care Workers, Police and everyone at London Transport.I hope the nurses are enjoying all the clapping and rattling of pots and pans every Thursday because that is all they are going to get.It is reassuring to know that things really are ing to normal.At least a public sector pay freeze will not discriminate. It will apply equally across the board and affect everyone from care home cleaners on minimum wage to the head of health and social care at Labour controlled North Lanarkshire council, salary £,“Some are going to have to take a hit for the team.”Yes Michael, in more ways than one.Well put, Malcolm.Incidentally, there is no freeze on public sector wages. Typical nonsense and  information being leaked, another left-wingPR leak from socialist civil servant perhaps The simple fact is unavoidable this virus is here to stay. One day we will all meet it. The single most important thing is to keep the numbers down, so ICUs are not swamped, learn the best therapies to reduce the death toll as much as is practical and research for treatments and a vaccine. Try and avoid peak outbreaks, especially in winter, when the flu   covid combination will be nasty. Isolate our most vulnerable, maybe for a very long time and leave people to chose. I am approaching  years old and have no intention of isolating forever. In due course, I will get this virus and take my chances. I would instead rather enjoy my time than clamber fearfully into a sterile hole forever!!! As for Sturgeons exercise twice a day, she can stick that where the sun does not shine. The simple fact is being fit is perhaps my and everyone best chance for survival, twice a day exercising and the rest of my time on my sweet derriere is stupid, just as Nicola#s latest dictates!!!I’m reminded of the proud mother watching her son taking part in the passing out parade at Sandhurst.She noticed that everyone was out of step apart from her son!Oh dear, did I just read #BO JO#s policy actually worked# Thats plainly pants, pure and simple.Briefly, to Michael#s point, it is only recently that we paid off our war debt to the USA, so some financial mechanisms will be found.But I think I heard Portugal went into lockdown straight after their first COVID  death, whereas the UK waited for over a hundred. Plainly things could have been very dferent, very much better, and acting quicker would have been far cheaper, with far less loss of le, and a quickerto a ing economy.But it would have also required people being put before profit right from the start.So it really had been business as usual from the bottom feeding disaster capitalists that run the UK.#BO JO#s policy actually worked# indeed.That would be laughableit wasn#t so tragic.Sadly without vaccines and anti-virals, it is that simple. The fact is it has only just started and will be with us until we are all immune or dead. Let us pray for the former and immunity by vaccination. To coin a cliche, it will be total isolation for the most vulnerable until herd immunity develops, as with every infectious viral disease in human history! Development of immunity and resistance is what will stopCovid  eventually, nothing , as withPolio, Smallpox, Measles, Herpes et alNo. We need to keep as many people alive as possible until vaccine is developed.People are not simply expendable.Effective PPE supplies and speed of sufficient testing is critical to this.The Tory led, Tory delayed UK response has been woeful on these.No scope for argument there.Thousands have died that need not have.No scope for argument there either.It has been an ideologically misled catastrophe. genetic iations from  samples when exactly do you envisage this wonder vaccine that covers all iations to be produced # genetic iations from  samples when exactly do you envisage this wonder vaccine that covers all iations to be produced #But now that you point out about all those genetic iations, we probably ought to phone them and tell them to call of the hunt since they#ve probably not thought of that. Best just let nature take its course and get the economy on track with hundreds of thousands of deaths, a swamped NHS and a profoundly sick and worried population.Bo Jo#s policy was actually endorsed and followed to the letter by all the devolved Governments of the Uk until we got our knickers in a twist about a slogan. I never realised Nicola was a # bottom feeding disaster capitalists # for endorsing Bo Jo#s policy for so long. She only on Sunday became confused and what a fuss out that she made. On the bright side, we may legally exercise twice daily now, what outstanding leadership!Ian your unwavering faith in BoJo the clown, in the absence of any logical rationale or evidence for doing so, is truly astonishing.Again, Tory apologist spin from Tinkler. From mid-Jan through Feb Boris missed  COBRA meetings on COVID  to which Sturgeon was not invited.Yes the UK#s other parliaments fell into line once the Bullingdon Club realised there was to be no Britains Open for Business, herd-immunity-now approach. Elements of that thinking lingered on and are resurfacing now, not the least within the twisted outpouring of local eugenicists.Act in haste, repent at leisure seems to sum up such weakness.I am trying very hard toto see things from your perspective, but I cannot ignore the indicators and commentary that indicates that the UK economy will officially be in recession by the end of  Q.GDP has fallen by % in the first quarter of this year and predicted to be possibly as high as % in the second quarter.The Bank of England has tried to put a brave face on things by saying #the impact is likely to be temporary with activity rebounding strongly once social distancing measures are lted#. The question is when will social distancing be lted.Are you advocating that we just wait and see how things pan out, maybe the idea of a V shaped recovery will happen in the rd and th quarters, a vaccine will be developed in time and the world can go back to the #old normal#A simple warning from history # Recession , Depression, War.Recession, depression, war. Exactly. We know that the mortality rate is roughly .%. UK population is approx  million. Let#s say we just let the virus take its course, albeit slowed due to some adjustments to how we work and % of the population catch it. An effective treatment or vaccine is by no means guaranteed. % of  million is . million. .% of that is about , deaths. Then there are the hundreds of millions of working days lost to people off sick with the virus. Then there are the people suffering long term consequences of the virus and the cost of caring for them. How is this a recipe for a healthy economy  How will this level of death and suffering motivate investment or spending  Where does this assumption that we can just get going again like things were before come from  The world has changed. I know it feels good to bury our heads in the sand and think we can just go back to how things were and let a few old folks die. But that is profoundly naive. There is no simple answer. Except Mr. Tinkler#s. Make of that what you will.Ali asks: # genetic iations from  samples when exactly do you envisage this wonder vaccine that covers all iations to be produced #I don#t know Ali.I#m not a dentist.To my understanding there does not need to be an exact genetic match for vaccines to be sufficiently helpful, but as I can#t trace my male line back over countless generations maybe Ali should consult a bard or a sage instead.There is, and has been, something of a medical research race on for understanding of transmission, for patient management treatment and for vaccines.Prompter action would have kept more folk alive longer whilst progress was made. The usual suspects are welcome to argue that and which way they may like, but it won#t change matters.There has been medical research and hard work for years into a reliable vaccine for corona viruses. How are they doing on that front  You don#t need to be a dentist to find that out.."},{"url":null,"title":"job retention scheme extended with greater flexibility for return to work ","story":"A Shetland business representative has welcomed the extension of a scheme helping employers retain their workforce through the Covid- crisis.Living Lerwick#s project manager Emma Miller said today#s announcement by the Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak was a #massive help#.Mr Sunak said the UK government#s job retention scheme would be extended by four months until October.Ms Miller had warned last week that without an extension to the scheme some businesses may have had to start considering redundancies.

debate night discussion ","story":"Scotland’s first chief scientic officer has said  a trial to ease lockdown in Shetland “would be worth considering” – but must be handled carefully.Professor Dame Anne Glover made her comments in response to questions raised on a Northern Isles edition of Debate Night on Wednesday.Asked by a member of the virtual audience whether there should be a “localised approach to ending lockdown” Prof Glover gave cautious support for the idea.“It would be reasonable to look across Scotland and indeed the UK to identy areas that could be subject to slightly earlier [easing of] of lockdown or slightly dferent conditions of lockdown,” she said.“In many ways a one size fits all is not really appropriate and we should have the flexibility to be able to consider dferent options.“The thing we’d have to bear in mind when you do something like that that people are moving around the country, so you’d have to be quite careful.Prof Glover said the Northern Isles would not appreciate visitors from parts of the country with high rates of infection.“You would have to be quite careful and sensitive about how we would implement something like that but I think it would be certainly worth considering,” she added.The possibility of a piloting an exit strategy in Shetland has already been raised by politicians.Shetland MSP Beatrice Wishart said last month her constituency was the “ideal place” for such a pilot.Cabinet office minister Michael Gove has also suggested lting lockdown restrictions at a “progressively greater rate” on the Scottish islands than the mainland.Responding to the suggestion, one Debate Night audience member said it would be a “positive step” – but added that there needed to be a “degree of resilience” in local services to ensure they could cope with a resurgence in the virus.Fiona Hyslop, the Scottish government’s cabinet secretary for economy, also indicated cautious support for the idea – though she stressed it had to be done with consent.”It should not be done to the islands,” she added.“They should want it and discuss it and be part of it, not be told by Edinburgh or London that we want to use them as an experiment.“I’m not saying no – but it’s got to come from the islands themselves.”Other topics for discussion included questions on whether there would be greater support for tourism operators, of which there are many in Shetland and Orkney.One BB owner explained she had been unable to receive any financial support because the government’s grants were only eligible to people who paid business rates, whereas she paid domestic council tax.Others questioned how the tourism season would be able to reopen again safely.Prof Glover said that while she could not say with any degree of certainty when tourism would be able to reopen – it would likely require ongoing social distancing.She highlighted a scheme in Europe where restaurant diners were seated in “perspex boxes”.“These are the sorts of things we could move towards,” she added. raquo"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/an-acar.jpg","title":"coronavirus latest an acarsaid staff negative for covid 19 while msp

follow-up tests of staff and residents weren’t carried out.Highland Labour MSP Rhoda Grant has asked NHS Highland to start daily testing of all staff and residents at Home Farm.In an email to NHS Highland interim chief executive Paul Hawkins, Mrs Grant also urged that concerns over staff movements at the home should be investigated.Mrs Grant has asked Mr Hawkins: “Did the health board know whether staff had been tested before they were moved in, and whether any contact tracing of staff had taken place to ensure staff brought in were not coming from other homes where patients had tested positive for the infectious disease ” reports.Mrs Grant has called on Health Secretary Jeane Freeman to disclose how all separate bits of government advice had been passed on to care homes by the Scottish Government.She added: “I understand the Home Farm Care Home has weak ratings with regard to infection control – was it identied by Health Protection Scotland as one which might need special attention or guidance before the outbreak occurred  If this is the case, what additional action was taken to protect residents ”Highlands and Islands Tory MSP Donald Cameron echoed calls for extra testing.He said: “The focus must be on testing care home workers to reassure them that they are free of the disease and to minimise the chances of care homes being infected.“It’s a sad fact that the proportion of deaths from Covid- in care settings in Scotland has been high and, as testing here has been carried out at a relatively low rate, it is right that there should be a great national effort to improve matters.“I believe it would also help to instil confidencethe number of care workers tested was published regularly and I hope that the Scottish Government starts doing that on a more regular basis.”Meanwhile, Skye councillors are urging NHS Highland and Home Farm operators HC One to communicate information to the local community “on a regular and timeous basis”.Local Councillor Calum Munro said: “Everyone is keen to have regular and informative information about the situation in Portree, good information helps us manage a dficult situation”Councillor John Finlayson added: “It is good to hear about the recent testing results have come back for Budhmor and An Acarsaid showing no cases of Coronavirus in these homes at this time.“We need regular updates so that we and the wider community, who have been so supportive right across the island in responding Covid , receive the honesty and transparency we deserve so that we can all understand what is going on.Councillor John Gordon praised the courageous and kind service that the workers in care homes are doing day after day.“We are all in their debt,” he added.The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no

thank frontline","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineChildren from Shieldaig Primary School and nursery have brought a ray of sunshine to the local area by creating artworks in support of frontline workers and the most vulnerable members of the community.Thanks to a grant of £ from the North Highland Initiative, local group Shieldaig Coronavirus Community Support was able to provide arts and crafts activity packs to the  children from the local primary and nursery.Shieldaig Coronavirus Community Support is run by the five members of the Shieldaig Community Council in tandem with a resilience team of  volunteers who operate in dferent areas of the village.Natalya Revitt who chairs the Shieldaig Community Council, told the Free Press that the idea for the arts and crafts packs came about to help local children and their parents during challenging times. She said: #As the weeks of lockdown passed it became clear to us that the children in our village were finding isolation particularly hard, as were their parents.“We wanted to provide something for the children to do that would give them, and their parents, a break from the same routine.“As part of the packs, we also worked with Julia Boger, the Shielding Primary School teacher, and set little tasks for the children to do using their new arts and crafts packs.“These include writing a letter to, or drawing a picture for, an elderly or vulnerable person in our community, colouring a poster to thank all our postmen and women, bin men, delivery drivers, shop staff, NHS, and key workers, and completing a Covid- time capsule workbook which will be included in the village record of how Shieldaig community came together to protect and help each other during this pandemic.#She added: #Not to leave out our older young people, we also provided an Amazon voucher to each of the teenagers in our village which were very warmly received.#In addition to securing a grant for the arts and crafts sets, the community council members have successfully applied for over £, of funding to help provide fuel assistance grants, weekly care packages of essential groceries, household items, and compost and seed potatoes for anyone who has started to grow their own food.The community support group has also created a thank you banner for the local GP surgery, delivered random acts of kindness to anyone nominated in the village, and will this week launch its latest project # The Grub Hub.The Grub Hub is a new community food cupboard open to anyone living in Shieldaig and along the Applecross Peninsula.Built by a local joiner Keith McNicholl, The Grub Hub will be located outside the village hall and will be stocked with non-perishable groceries and household items.The simple message to the community when using The Grub Hub is, #give what you can, take what you need#.Ms Revitt, who become Shieldaig Community Council Chair just days before Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced the UK-wide lockdown, added: #With just five members on our community council, who were only elected in February, and met for the first time on th March , we are very proud of how much we have achieved so far to help our community.#The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until st May .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/dachaidh-c-1.jpg","title":"an t am coimhead as deidh ar seann daoine gu","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineTha e air a bhith còrdadh rium bhith dèanamh sreath fon ainm ‘An t-Seachdain seo ann an Eachdraidh’ do BhBC Rèidio nan Gàidheal, oir chan eil seachdain air a dhol seachad nach d’fhuair mi grunn rudan a bha mi air diochuimhneachadh mu dheidhinn, no nach robh mi air cluinntinn mu dheidhinn, agus a tha làn airidh air an cuimhneachadh.An t-seachdain seo fhèin, mar eisimpleir, Murt na h-Apainne ann an  agus mar a thàinig Rudolph Hess a dh’Alba air itealan agus an uairsin parachute gu talamh ann an .Sgeul iongantach.Bha ùidh agam riamh ann an Eachdraidh: saoilidh mi gun tàinig sin bhon sgoil, oir bha am Maighstir Sgoile a bh’ agam ann an Sgoil Ghearraidh na Mòineadh ga dhèanamh gu math tarraingeach – ged is dòcha gun robh barrachd ùidh aige fhèin ann an Geography, no Cruinn-Eòlas, mar a their iad ris an-diugh!Co-dhiù, b’anns an sgoil bhig sin a dh’ionnsaich mi an Clàr-Eachdraidh ainmeil a bha tòiseachadh le #

Corona is incubated in the wider community.There are certain places where you do not want the virus to end up, because the death rates are bound to be very highit gets in there, and care homes are the most dangerous place of all.The failing in this case lies in the lack of oversight within Scotland, andwe are to learn anything from this, it is important that responsibility is fully and accurately apportioned.The Scottish Government have tried to say that care home owners themselves have been negligent.If this is the case, then anyone catching the virus since the outset must also be in some way negligent, orthey contracted it in a public institution, then it must have been negligent.Such is the downward spiral that arises when government chooses not to look at itself but wants to find some-one  to blame., Aberfeldy I would like to remind all reporters that Home Farm was a particular home at risk due to its persistent failure in even basic Infection Control Procedures.This has been evident since November . Their last inspection gave them a grade of  Where were the NHS and Social Services staff in making sure this home improved to an acceptable level before the outbreak  in relation to the horric impact the virus has had with a nursing home in Skye.I#m a little confused by some of your assertions, that suggest the UK Government are responsible.The National Health Service is  per cent devolved in Scotland and the private health care of nursing homes come under the regulation of the Scottish Government.Surely your points would be better addressed to the Scottish Government who are responsible and accountable for the support of care homes during this pandemic Kindly note that the SNP administration have admitted that patients were sent to care homes without the results of the Cov- tests being known.Ms Freeman was interviewed early by the BBC and admitted this point. It is also worth noting that the SNP have stated care homes will pay for the non-standard PPE issued by the Scottish Government.Not something I believe is entirely reasonable, given this being a global pandemic and the regulations enforced by the Government.Rest assured, our thoughts are with the victims of this horric virus. I hope accountability is aligned to where it resides here in Scotland. re Home Farm Nursing Home is not only inaccurate it is totally biased.I have a simple question for you#. the SNP and that woman Sturgeon are not responsible for anything why then do we need them So no doubt you will give them credit without hesitation but when truth and correct fact is required you cannot bring yourself to name and shame and there is indeed plenty to shame them for , including this.Perhaps your reporting needs closer scrutiny in future.I am disabled and use a rollator to get around. On Thursday last week I hurt my back and couldn#t walk even with the rollator.I needed to buy some food but discovered the co-op doesn#t do home delivery. They used to, but not anymore.I tried Skye community response and they put me on to the warehouse which is mainly vegetables.I found there was nowhere to turn to and was getting exasperated. Along with the pain it wasn#t doing me any good.My doctor suggested I increase the morphine that I#m already on to seethat helps.I#m angry that there is no help for people like me.The co-op could easily do home delivery. I don#t know why they don#t.The co-op could allow disabled people to go straight in and not stand in a queue and I mean disabled people # not the ones who can walk perfectly with a walking stick and have somehow managed to get a blue badge .There should be something in place to help people like me without having to go through reams of red tape.Meanwhile I#m just about out of bread and milk andit wasn#t for the kind actions of a neighbour I would be stuffed.Why isn#t there something in place for these who find themselves in a situation like mine. Andthere is then why is it being kept a secret last week reminded me that about  years ago, as part of the Their Past Your Future project, the Museum of the Isles at Clan Donald and the Archive Service in Portree collaborated on an oral history project relating to the second world war in Skye.One of the outcomes was a book The Crofters and the War, using excerpts from the many hours of recordings that were made, mainly by Mary Carmichael who was the project officer.The book included a chapter on the surrender. There were quotes from Annie MacLean of Raasay, and from Ruth Coghill, Vi Beaton, and Mary Black, who all remembered seeing the surrender, as well as a photo of German sailors at Kyle station which is in the Archive service collections.I seem to remember that Mary Carmichael located a film of part of the surrender, as I remember watching it, but I am afraid I can#t remember where it originated # maybe the Imperial War museum, maybe the Scottish Film Archive.There were probably many other references to submarine activity and the end of the war where in the book, and also in the actual recordings.I can#t remember whether both the Museum and the Archive service kept copies of the recordings, or whether it was just one of them.Every contributor got a copy of the book, as did local schools, and it was also for sale so you may have come across a copy. The museum at Armadale still have a few copies I think.Finally, thank you for keeping us informed online during this lockdown.The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until st May .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/lockdown-pic.jpg","title":"news round up isles virus testing lockdown guidance and lifeboat call","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineIn line with Scottish Government policy, NHS Western Isles has this week started a new long-term approach to addressing COVID-, known as Test, Trace, Isolate, and Support.The principles of this approach are to:NHS Western Isles Chief Executive Gordon Jamieson welcomed this new approach.He said: “The Test, Trace, Isolate and Support approach is at this point our best chance of suppressing and preventing transmission of the Covid- virus.

Everyone was asked to submit photos of how their home Tea Party celebrations would look like either in unorm, detachment T-shirt’s or period costumes. A video was then compiled combining photos old and new, with backing music from WWs National sweetheart Vera Lynn fittingly singing “We’ll meet again” as the cadets, due to the current “lockdown”, have not seen each in  weeks. It turned out very inspirational with cadets making their own flags and bunting to some of the instructors really embracing the WW Theme.

The Office for National Statisticsrevealed yesterday that activity plunged .% in March in the biggest monthly fall since records began in . Read MoreEsmond Birnie:Opinion Coronavirus casts dark shadow over Northern Ireland economy with risk of another prolonged recession and a badly damaged labour marketThe March tumble sent gross domestic productdown % overall in the first quarter - the biggest fall since the end of  when Britain was at the height of the financial crisis. The latest figures show the first direct effect of the Covid- pandemic on the UK economy after the country was placed in lockdown to control the spread of the virus. But with the lockdown only coming into place on March , the second quarter will show the full hit on the economy after the UK ground to a standstill. Experts said the first quarter data suggested the economy could contract by up to % between April and June as the full effects of the lockdown are captured. In an article for today#s Belfast , Dr Birnie stated: It will take several years to claw our way back to where we were in  and the implication will be that the Covid- recession will impose lasting costs.The last recession in NI, the one which followed the banking crisis, was extremely protracted. According to the official measure of the volume of regional output, output peaked in Quarter   and then declined all the way through to Quarter  . This time could be dferent but it would seem the NI economy has form in terms of allowing downturns to become very long -lasting recessions.There is a strong risk history will repeat itself, given that the virus has generated so much uncertainty and reduced business confidence very substantially.Unfortunately, there is precedent for not only very prolonged recession but also for the recovery phase being rather shallow, he added.The Bank of England last week warned coronavirus could see the economy plunge by as much as % in the second quarter and fall by % overall in  - the worst annual fall for more than three centuries. London#s FTSE  Index fell .% after the GDP data and amid concerns over a second wave of coronavirus cases in countries that have started to reopen post-lockdown. Chancellor Rishi Sunak has said it is very likely that the UK will face a signicant recession as a result of the coronavirus crisis. He told the BBC: A recession is defined technically as two quarters of decline in GDP. We#ve seen one here with only a few days of impact from the virus, so it is now very likely that the UK economy will face a signicant recession this year and we are in the middle of that as we speak. The Institute of Directors said that the official data was a sobering first glimpse of the economic turmoil caused by the outbreak.

I think it#s wrong that every business is categorised, he said.It#s not just from a selfish business perspective, but I think it#s important for people to see something happening.In stage one, four to six people can meet up, but where are they going to go and what are they going to do Unless there#s going to be something that people can go to, I think people are going to become very depressed.In an effort to prepare his cinemas for reopening, Mr McAdam has installed sneeze guards at tills and ordered temperature scanners from China.

Speaking to the committee, Mr Roberts said: The plan is progress, but we believe that there needs to be clear and indicative timings and dates in that plan.The recovery plan for the Republic has a target date of June for the reopening of non-essential shops - and we believe that is achievable for Northern Ireland, but we will also need appropriate childcare provision.He said footfall in towns and cities in Northern Ireland had all but collapsed during lockdown.It is now time for Executive to work on a reopening plan for towns and cities. He said such measures would mean provisions such as stewarding and cleaning would have to be put in place, and new arrangements made for car parking and public transport.

Then in the second half of the month we had the lowest sales figures since .The committee also heard evidence on the plight of small businesses from executives in Enterprise NI and InterTradeIreland.Michael McQuillan, chief executive of Enterprise NI - which represents  enterprise agencies around Northern Ireland - said firms should receive grant aid to help them implement changes in the workplace to adhere to social distancing. Small businesses are having to put in screening to protect staff, as well as providing hand sanitiser and developing one-way systems within their premises, he said. We think firms should be able to benefit from a grant of say £, or £, to pay for equipment to make your workplace safe.Also addressing the committee, Aidan Gough, designated officer and director of strategy and policy at cross-border body InterTradeIreland, said the Government would have a part to play in economic recovery as well as in keeping companies going through the crisis.

It#s about shielding them from the virus itself so we can protect their lives and support them in doing that.There is a role for the wider Executive to play in regards to how we support people with food boxes, community pharmacy deliveries and looking at where we are on our program to see that those who are shielding can be given additional support or access to loved ones or family members, even should that be to a closed numbers of iniduals.Dr Dorman, meanwhile, told this newspaper that shielding was having a huge impact on vulnerable people#s lives. It#s massive. If you are full shielding and you live with someone , you have to be in a separate bedroom and you have to eat your meals on your own. It#s really, really tough. Those are very stringent and dficult circumstances, he said.At the moment, it#s an initial  weeks. If that is to be extended, it will have a signicant impact on people#s mental health.He stressed that doctors were already beginning to see the adverse impact of the lockdown on the population.GPs are very keen to offer support and we#re already seeing an increase in our workload on mental health, particularly the low moods and depression, Dr Dorman said. But we also know the population is at an increased risk of domestic violence and increased risk of alcohol consumption, so all things tie into the holistic health of our population.He stressed his peers were poised to support those who required mental health support and maintained that any decision to extend the shielding period would be made by the Executive. In general practice, we are very keen to support people through this, whatever is decided at a higher level above us, he added.Dr Dorman said some GPs would be relying on their multi-disciplinary teams - made up of a physiotherapist, social worker and mental health practitioner - to offer support to those who need it.Those social care and mental needs will be massive. We can see a tsunami of mental health needs coming down the tracks in primary care, he explained.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClosePhil and Brian Bell from Eglinton FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappPhil and Brian Bell from Eglinton#We look forward to day our family can come in for hugs#Brian Bell and his we Phil, both in their s, started shielding on the advice of their family nine weeks ago, when the first community case of coronavirus in Northern Ireland was reported.Since then le has been very dferent for Mr Bell, who despite living with Parkinson#s enjoyed an active le, including the gym, shopping and daily Mass.From his home in Eglinton, Mr Bell said not being able to spend time with his family remains the biggest struggle.Along with our family we decided to shield as soon as the first community case of coronavirus happened because my we and myself have underlying health conditions, he explained.I have Parkinson#s and my we is a recovering cancer patient.Before March , I was very active and went to the gym for a swim on the recommendation of my doctor.I also went into Derry shopping and I drove to our local chapel for daily Mass and it has been frustrating staying inside.We are lucky in that we have a garden and I am a keen gardener so being outside has helped enormously.I learned how to make better use of the internet so we watch Mass on the webcam and we have had video calls with our grandchildren.

I really miss going to Lurgan park too.I#m  now and my we is  so we just can#t get into the car and go down to the park.My children and grandchildren would come to the door and see us but they keep their distance and stand at the gate, which is  yards away.Looking to the future, Mr Mitchell is hoping the lockdown in Northern Ireland can be lted sooner rather than later.I just want everything to get back to normal as soon as possible, he added.I would just love to get out, take my we to the hairdressers, go to the barbers myself, go down the town for a wee dander and a walk and meet all my mates down there.Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Dog dirt can be a danger to public health and especially to the health of children. “Mid Ulster District Council’s Environmental Health team have invested heavily in educational publicity warning of the dangers of dog fouling and in providing resources in warning signage and waste bins for collection of dog dirt. However, it appears that not everyone is listening.

James O’Donnell frequently takes photos of his beloved dog ‘Iggy’ in some of the most spectacular locations around the county. And she is now becoming a bit of a celebrity with thousands of people all over the world going online to see the Border Collie with stunning Donegal backdrops behind her. In one week recently, Iggy-related photos reached over a quarter of a million people on facebook. Falcarragh-based James has been building up a collection of photos with nine-year-old Iggy, and his work has attracted a lot of attention. googletag.cmd.push Indeed, in March, he had been scheduled to go to America for a number of exhibitions, starting in Florida. But the onset of Covid- meant the flights had to be cancelled. Nevertheless, he is hoping to go to New York later in the summer for another exhibition and possibly also to Connecticut. His talent is such that his work has attracted the attention of highly regarded veteran Magnum Photos member Elliott Erwittand Samuel Holmes , and through them steps were put in place for the planned exhibitions. The fact that they have been in contact highlights just what an impact James is making. googletag.cmd.push After World War II, a number of photographers banded together to form Magnum Photos, an organisation dedicated to chronicling world events - and named for the magnum-sized bottle of wine that they drank at each meeting! The process of becoming a full member of Magnum Photos takes a minimum of four years. Photographers are only considered once a year, during Magnums Annual General Meeting in June, where one day is set aside for considering and voting on potential new members portfolios. It is highly prestigious. “I love promoting Donegal,” James said, pointing out that he actually takes all his photos on his mobile phone! James lived in London for many years, before ing home to Donegal, and he adores the outside world and doing his bit to showcase and promote the county in any way that he can. Last year he produced a calendar called “Iggy’s Donegal” - filled with fine pictures from ramblings and hikes around Donegal - and it proved to be very popular. Recently a photo taken by James attracted the attention of BBC Northern Ireland weather forecaster Barra Best. Best tweeted the photo and commented that it was a “great example” of “an extremely rare phenomenon” known as Kelvin-Helmholtz clouds. The stunning imageof the cloud formation was taken from the Back Strand in Falcarragh, and needless to say, also featured Iggy. All the indications are that Iggy is on the way to being a great ambassador for Donegal, and while this will be a terribly dficult year for those in the tourism sector here, at least James and Iggy are publicising to the world some of the great sights to see. The story made the front page of this week’s Donegal Post newspaper and is featured in this Thursday’s Donegal Democrat .

When the buses started to come, it began to kick off. “They were getting transported up. They were young and they didn’t have to have their mother and father having to leave them up. googletag.cmd.push  As word spread and the disco began to grow in stature and reputation, the crowds funnelled down the narrow roads that led to the GAA club. That volume of hormonal adolescence in a confined area was sure to cause some friction, and from his perch on the stage, there wasn’t much Terry missed. “You had the odd row and then the bouncers went in,” he recalled. “Sometimes it was clean mad. There was a brave bit of fighting. You had the Dungiven boys and the Bellaghy boys, then there was Rasharkin and the Draperstown crowd. “One thing about the Slaughtneil bouncers was that they stood on the chairs right round the side of the hall and they saw everything. If anyone looked at each other at all, they were straight in.” Terry’s tenure as DJ at the famous south Derry venue spanned three decades, and with the march of time came the evolution of the music he was spinning. The rock and pop of the late s gave way as the rave of the mid-s found its way to rural County Derry. “In the s, you had the rockers, the slow sessions, so many types of music,” recalled Terry. “I remember then the rave thing started to come in instead of the standard music. Before that it was the s and general s kind of stuff. “The first real rave song was called ‘Acid’ and that was one of the first dance songs I was playing in Slaughtneil at the time.”  The hall’s growing reputation as south Derry’s romantic hotspot had an added benefit for the young DJ, as he was able to use the opportunity to create his own work. “After Slaughtneil I was flat out doing weddings for people who met there,” he said. “It was a spin-off, because when they were getting married, I was doing the disco because that’s where they’d met. “At that time, they might have been , but  years ago, people were getting married a lot younger, so it wasn’t that long that they met in Slaughtneil that they were getting married. “I started doing Walsh’s Hotel in Maghera in about  as well, and you had that Slaughtneil crowd following you then. It worked out alright for me!” Terry was privileged to accommodate a number of special guests on the stage, most notably Neighbours star Guy Pearce in , but not all visitors came by way of an invite. He said: “The Provos landed once – thankfully I wasn’t on that night! “There were a few groups fighting – I think it was the Draperstown boys fighting the Bellaghy boys – and what they did was give you a list of names that you had to read out. “They were toldthey didn’t behave themselves, the boys would be round. Maybe some chap got a bad beating or a car got badly damaged, and it had got out of hand. “That was a way of keeping them in line, but they were in and out and away again in maybe ,  minutes.” Like many who made their way up the the Halgain Road over the twenty years that the disco was running, Terry’s best memories are of the people he met. “I was there until near enough the end. I think I did nearly  years of it – a long pull, but it was enjoyable, you got to know a lot of people,” he said. “You could have been talking to somebody from Dublin that had come up to stay with friends, or Galway. I remember talking to a girl from Tipperary one night. “They might have been staying the summer with relations and that was the reason – to get to the Slaughtneil disco. “That’s my claim to fame, I was the first ever DJ at Slaughtneil disco.” Terry spun the soundtrack to much of County Derry’s adolescence. The disco may only have lasted three hours on a Friday, but its influence continues to be timeless.

When the buses started to come, it began to kick off. “They were getting transported up. They were young and they didn’t have to have their mother and father having to leave them up. googletag.cmd.push  As word spread and the disco began to grow in stature and reputation, the crowds funnelled down the narrow roads that led to the GAA club. That volume of hormonal adolescence in a confined area was sure to cause some friction, and from his perch on the stage, there wasn’t much Terry missed. “You had the odd row and then the bouncers went in,” he recalled. “Sometimes it was clean mad. There was a brave bit of fighting. You had the Dungiven boys and the Bellaghy boys, then there was Rasharkin and the Draperstown crowd. “One thing about the Slaughtneil bouncers was that they stood on the chairs right round the side of the hall and they saw everything. If anyone looked at each other at all, they were straight in.” Terry’s tenure as DJ at the famous south Derry venue spanned three decades, and with the march of time came the evolution of the music he was spinning. The rock and pop of the late s gave way as the rave of the mid-s found its way to rural County Derry. “In the s, you had the rockers, the slow sessions, so many types of music,” recalled Terry. “I remember then the rave thing started to come in instead of the standard music. Before that it was the s and general s kind of stuff. “The first real rave song was called ‘Acid’ and that was one of the first dance songs I was playing in Slaughtneil at the time.”  The hall’s growing reputation as south Derry’s romantic hotspot had an added benefit for the young DJ, as he was able to use the opportunity to create his own work. “After Slaughtneil I was flat out doing weddings for people who met there,” he said. “It was a spin-off, because when they were getting married, I was doing the disco because that’s where they’d met. “At that time, they might have been , but  years ago, people were getting married a lot younger, so it wasn’t that long that they met in Slaughtneil that they were getting married. “I started doing Walsh’s Hotel in Maghera in about  as well, and you had that Slaughtneil crowd following you then. It worked out alright for me!” Terry was privileged to accommodate a number of special guests on the stage, most notably Neighbours star Guy Pearce in , but not all visitors came by way of an invite. He said: “The Provos landed once – thankfully I wasn’t on that night! “There were a few groups fighting – I think it was the Draperstown boys fighting the Bellaghy boys – and what they did was give you a list of names that you had to read out. “They were toldthey didn’t behave themselves, the boys would be round. Maybe some chap got a bad beating or a car got badly damaged, and it had got out of hand. “That was a way of keeping them in line, but they were in and out and away again in maybe ,  minutes.” Like many who made their way up the the Halgain Road over the twenty years that the disco was running, Terry’s best memories are of the people he met. “I was there until near enough the end. I think I did nearly  years of it – a long pull, but it was enjoyable, you got to know a lot of people,” he said. “You could have been talking to somebody from Dublin that had come up to stay with friends, or Galway. I remember talking to a girl from Tipperary one night. “They might have been staying the summer with relations and that was the reason – to get to the Slaughtneil disco. “That’s my claim to fame, I was the first ever DJ at Slaughtneil disco.” Terry spun the soundtrack to much of County Derry’s adolescence.

It has now grown into one of the most vibrant clubs around. Michael McMullan asked Club PRO PC Convery about the clubs growth... Michael McMullan: Well PC, when and how did Carn Wheelers come into existence  Was there a club there before that  PC Convery: Initially two local men Tommie McGrath and Sean Kerr would have cycled together as a pastime before the official formation of Carn Wheelers. Both were marathon runners and opted for two wheels in between runs. Sean was inspired to take up cycling following Stephen Roche’s win in The Tour de France, Giro d’Italia and the World Championship in . Sean was a member of East Tyrone Cycling Club at that time and took part in races and time trials and had several podium finishes. googletag.cmd.push  There were a couple of local cycling clubs - Moyola Cycle Club and the South Derry Wheelers which were in existence prior to Carn Wheelers. There were dferences in structure and affiliation and there was an identied need to form a local club. Moyola Cycle Club was formed in the s but the membership waned in the s and cyclists then joined other local clubs like East Tyrone and Bann Valley. Carn Wheelers registered as an official cycling club with Cycling Ireland in  . Sean also designed the first kit which was worn for several years after. In late   the official launch of the new club kit was held in Walsh’s Hotel, Maghera. googletag.cmd.push M McM: How did they know there was an appetite for a club  PC: The founding members were Tommie McGrath, Pat Purvis, Nigel Henry and Sean Kerr. The first official AGM was held in  in the Naiscoil in Maghera with around  members at the meeting and Pat Purvis was elected as first chairman. M McM: Cycling wasnt as nearly as popular back then as it is now. Was it more about exercise and leisure at that time or was there also a racing element  PC: Yes, in the formative years it was about leisure cycles with the group leaving Maghera on a Sunday morning, and coming home together a few hours later tired but having enjoyed plenty of craic. The club was able to break into racing groups at that time as well. It was a couple of years after that before we held our first open races. The first club racing program of Time Trialsand road racing was established in  after an increased number of Carn Wheelers started to race at Bann Valley and East Tyrone.The first inidual to race was Gerry Kelly at Bann Valley and Gerry was also the first Carn Wheeler to win a road race in an East Tyrone club race in May . Barry Russell was the first Carn Wheeler to get a podium place in an open race with second place at Phoenix GP in February  and since then there have been many more wins and podiums. The very first Carn Classic open race was held on Sunday, March ,  in Tobermore.Padraig Douganwas chairman then and it took place on Wood Road course. Carn Wheelers used Tobermore United Football Club as sign on and prize giving. M McM: I remember cycling with the club for a few years around . I noticed the club really starting to grow. What would you put that down to  PC: The popularity of cycling had started to take off all over with Cycling Ireland membership also on the rise. A large number of retired sports people were also looking for some form of exercise that was sociable and also those who liked that bit of competition got involved in racing. With more people out cycling, races started to increase in numbers all over and someone once said cycling was the new golf. The likes of the Giro dItalia, which was held in Ireland for the first time in , promoted cycling and encouraged people to get out on their bikes. In April , Wendy Houvenaghel, linked with the club on their weekly Sunday morning cycle.A native of Upperlands, Wendy ed home following her Olympic success winning the silver medal at the  Beijing Olympic Games. She also won gold in the same year in the  Track Cycling World Championships. The club got a major seal of approval when she joined the club as an honorary member. The aim was to raise money to help her pursue her Olympic dream in  where she was aiming to improve on the silver medal she won in Beijing. An invitation was sent out from Carn Wheelers to cyclists everywhere to join them and have the opportunity to meet with Wendy both before and after the cycle, and to cycle along with her on a planned route from Maghera to Portstewart and . As a result, Wendy gave local cycling a much needed boost and encouraged others to take up the sport. M McM: There was very much a strong leave nobody behind mentality to the cycling. Is that still the same  PC: Yes that was and still is a strong motto in the club, although there are dferent groups within the club out cycling the club still promotes the leaving no one behind. All new cyclists are encouraged, but it is advisable to cycle on your own and gradually increase the miles before joining a group. The group cycles are well-organised and the route is usually agreed and communicated in advance. Over the years there have been many organised cycles and in  Carn Wheelers also organised a charity cycle to Donegal and . M McM: The Tour of South Derry is synonymous with the club. When did it begin  PC: The first Tour of South Derry was held in October  and there were  cyclists who took part in that event. Cyclists came from as far away as Cork to participate in the cycle at that time. In  there was a peak entry of  cyclists and in recent years there are between  and  participants from cycling clubs all over as well as other cyclists who are not affiliated with any club. The Tour of South Derry is usually the last Sportive of the cycling calendar, traditionally held on the second Sunday of October. It is a very well-run sportive which is very well marshalled and there is a choice of two routes to suit all abilities. The refreshments before and after are very well received. The event has always been affiliated with MacMillan Cancer Relief and has been a huge fundraiser and since the tour began. Carn Wheelers raised over pound, over the years for this worthy cause. The club are grateful to Mickey Donnelly, who has been the main organiser and contact with MacMillan since . Unfortunately their Mid-Ulster branch has now folded, so the club will seek a new charity partner for forthcoming events. M McM: There has been a lot of success - the likes of Cathir Doyle and Marc Heaney going to cycle at a high level and also the mountain-biking. Did it come from the early years of the underage cycling  PC: Carn Wheelers always had an ethos on cycling for all ages, gender and abilities. There was a focus on youth development and as some of the parents were actively involved the children developed an interest and this was identied early in the club’s development.The club had a group that were interested in the MTB scene and the parents thought it was a safe environment to introduce youth to biking, it provided the youth with a chance to build their bike handling skills and because there were MTB races they were able to add a bit of competition. Although the numbers involved are small compared to other sports we continue to have some very good young cyclists racing at the minute on the road, MTB, Cyclocross and the track, and some have won national and provincial titles. The first MTB race was held in Davagh Forest in June , long before the trails were built. Carn Wheelers members developed a course after many weeks of hard graft wheeling stones and cutting back branches to have the tracks ready and the competition has continued each year since. M McM: The likes of the Cycle around Ireland trek last year has been a huge mark on the club and there are many sportives. Is the club as vibrant as ever  PC: Yes the Cycle around Ireland last year was very well supported and raised nearly pound, for STEPS mental health charity. It was a brilliant achievement for the eight cyclists who took part and who pushed themselves to the limit cycling over , miles in just over  hours to support this worthy cause in their community. This year we have some members who had organised to attend events which unfortunately were cancelled, we had a number of members booked to complete in the Joe Barr endurance event and we would have had racing up and running at this stage. The race calendar had just been published a couple of weeks before lockdown and the very popular Carn Classic road Race was due to take place on  April  but unfortunately had to be cancelled. We would say the club is as vibrant as ever, our membership unlike some other clubs has remained stable andevents were on we would have members taking part in the sportives all over Ireland. Leisure cycling is on the increase and last year members took part in the Tour de Conamara, Westport Gran Fondo, the Ring of Clare and the Tour de Boyne Valley as well as local club sportives.Following feedback from club members Carn Wheelers launched a new club kit in March . It was a move away from the traditional green and black which had been in existence since the club started. The new colour was introduced by former chairman Ali Gribbon as it more visible on the road to motorists and should make cycling safer for all. M McM: How have you been dealing with the lockdown  Is solo cycling giving people an avenue to manage their mental health - get out, stay fit and healthy  It has a big part to play.PC: Cycling is an excellent pastime for physical and mental health and the social aspect of the group cycles is important especially when the cycle takes in a coffee stop on the route as it gives iniduals an opportunity to socialise.The club has tried to be at the forefront of trying to encourage our members to continue cycling but of course following the rules of social distancing, it has been dficult for many who have had events cancelled or had been training for the racing season. We are no dferent than any other sports and with the recent good weather members are getting lots of solo miles in, each of our groups are also keeping in touch with each other via Facebook and WhatsApp groups which is also very important. This means that we can check in on each other until we can get back out cycling in groups. There have been no group cycles since early March and people are instead encouraged to cycle solo. Thankfully the roads have been relatively quiet as there was less traffic and the good weather in April has encouraged many to build up their miles on the bike.Last year we launched a very successful Couch to K programme which ran on consecutive Monday nights during the summer. It was very popular and over  cyclists participated under the guidance of experienced club cyclists. We had anticipated that it would run again this year but this was not possible due to the current lockdown due to the Covid-. Cyclists have been training over the winter to prepare for the summer season of races, time trials, sportives, endurance events and other competitions. There is a saying within the club which is winter miles  summer smiles so it is unfortunate that all the events have been cancelled for the foreseeable future. Nevertheless cycling is an excellent sport for physical and mental well-being as well as social contact. It is sport which continues to develop and the future of Carn Wheelers is looking very promising.

It has now grown into one of the most vibrant clubs around. Michael McMullan asked Club PRO PC Convery about the clubs growth... Michael McMullan: Well PC, when and how did Carn Wheelers come into existence  Was there a club there before that  PC Convery: Initially two local men Tommie McGrath and Sean Kerr would have cycled together as a pastime before the official formation of Carn Wheelers. Both were marathon runners and opted for two wheels in between runs. Sean was inspired to take up cycling following Stephen Roche’s win in The Tour de France, Giro d’Italia and the World Championship in . Sean was a member of East Tyrone Cycling Club at that time and took part in races and time trials and had several podium finishes. googletag.cmd.push  There were a couple of local cycling clubs - Moyola Cycle Club and the South Derry Wheelers which were in existence prior to Carn Wheelers. There were dferences in structure and affiliation and there was an identied need to form a local club. Moyola Cycle Club was formed in the s but the membership waned in the s and cyclists then joined other local clubs like East Tyrone and Bann Valley. Carn Wheelers registered as an official cycling club with Cycling Ireland in  . Sean also designed the first kit which was worn for several years after. In late   the official launch of the new club kit was held in Walsh’s Hotel, Maghera. googletag.cmd.push M McM: How did they know there was an appetite for a club  PC: The founding members were Tommie McGrath, Pat Purvis, Nigel Henry and Sean Kerr. The first official AGM was held in  in the Naiscoil in Maghera with around  members at the meeting and Pat Purvis was elected as first chairman. M McM: Cycling wasnt as nearly as popular back then as it is now. Was it more about exercise and leisure at that time or was there also a racing element  PC: Yes, in the formative years it was about leisure cycles with the group leaving Maghera on a Sunday morning, and coming home together a few hours later tired but having enjoyed plenty of craic. The club was able to break into racing groups at that time as well. It was a couple of years after that before we held our first open races. The first club racing program of Time Trialsand road racing was established in  after an increased number of Carn Wheelers started to race at Bann Valley and East Tyrone.The first inidual to race was Gerry Kelly at Bann Valley and Gerry was also the first Carn Wheeler to win a road race in an East Tyrone club race in May . Barry Russell was the first Carn Wheeler to get a podium place in an open race with second place at Phoenix GP in February  and since then there have been many more wins and podiums. The very first Carn Classic open race was held on Sunday, March ,  in Tobermore.Padraig Douganwas chairman then and it took place on Wood Road course. Carn Wheelers used Tobermore United Football Club as sign on and prize giving. M McM: I remember cycling with the club for a few years around . I noticed the club really starting to grow. What would you put that down to  PC: The popularity of cycling had started to take off all over with Cycling Ireland membership also on the rise. A large number of retired sports people were also looking for some form of exercise that was sociable and also those who liked that bit of competition got involved in racing. With more people out cycling, races started to increase in numbers all over and someone once said cycling was the new golf. The likes of the Giro dItalia, which was held in Ireland for the first time in , promoted cycling and encouraged people to get out on their bikes. In April , Wendy Houvenaghel, linked with the club on their weekly Sunday morning cycle.A native of Upperlands, Wendy ed home following her Olympic success winning the silver medal at the  Beijing Olympic Games. She also won gold in the same year in the  Track Cycling World Championships. The club got a major seal of approval when she joined the club as an honorary member. The aim was to raise money to help her pursue her Olympic dream in  where she was aiming to improve on the silver medal she won in Beijing. An invitation was sent out from Carn Wheelers to cyclists everywhere to join them and have the opportunity to meet with Wendy both before and after the cycle, and to cycle along with her on a planned route from Maghera to Portstewart and . As a result, Wendy gave local cycling a much needed boost and encouraged others to take up the sport. M McM: There was very much a strong leave nobody behind mentality to the cycling. Is that still the same  PC: Yes that was and still is a strong motto in the club, although there are dferent groups within the club out cycling the club still promotes the leaving no one behind. All new cyclists are encouraged, but it is advisable to cycle on your own and gradually increase the miles before joining a group. The group cycles are well-organised and the route is usually agreed and communicated in advance. Over the years there have been many organised cycles and in  Carn Wheelers also organised a charity cycle to Donegal and . M McM: The Tour of South Derry is synonymous with the club. When did it begin  PC: The first Tour of South Derry was held in October  and there were  cyclists who took part in that event. Cyclists came from as far away as Cork to participate in the cycle at that time. In  there was a peak entry of  cyclists and in recent years there are between  and  participants from cycling clubs all over as well as other cyclists who are not affiliated with any club. The Tour of South Derry is usually the last Sportive of the cycling calendar, traditionally held on the second Sunday of October. It is a very well-run sportive which is very well marshalled and there is a choice of two routes to suit all abilities. The refreshments before and after are very well received. The event has always been affiliated with MacMillan Cancer Relief and has been a huge fundraiser and since the tour began. Carn Wheelers raised over pound, over the years for this worthy cause. The club are grateful to Mickey Donnelly, who has been the main organiser and contact with MacMillan since . Unfortunately their Mid-Ulster branch has now folded, so the club will seek a new charity partner for forthcoming events. M McM: There has been a lot of success - the likes of Cathir Doyle and Marc Heaney going to cycle at a high level and also the mountain-biking. Did it come from the early years of the underage cycling  PC: Carn Wheelers always had an ethos on cycling for all ages, gender and abilities. There was a focus on youth development and as some of the parents were actively involved the children developed an interest and this was identied early in the club’s development.The club had a group that were interested in the MTB scene and the parents thought it was a safe environment to introduce youth to biking, it provided the youth with a chance to build their bike handling skills and because there were MTB races they were able to add a bit of competition. Although the numbers involved are small compared to other sports we continue to have some very good young cyclists racing at the minute on the road, MTB, Cyclocross and the track, and some have won national and provincial titles. The first MTB race was held in Davagh Forest in June , long before the trails were built. Carn Wheelers members developed a course after many weeks of hard graft wheeling stones and cutting back branches to have the tracks ready and the competition has continued each year since. M McM: The likes of the Cycle around Ireland trek last year has been a huge mark on the club and there are many sportives. Is the club as vibrant as ever  PC: Yes the Cycle around Ireland last year was very well supported and raised nearly pound, for STEPS mental health charity. It was a brilliant achievement for the eight cyclists who took part and who pushed themselves to the limit cycling over , miles in just over  hours to support this worthy cause in their community. This year we have some members who had organised to attend events which unfortunately were cancelled, we had a number of members booked to complete in the Joe Barr endurance event and we would have had racing up and running at this stage. The race calendar had just been published a couple of weeks before lockdown and the very popular Carn Classic road Race was due to take place on  April  but unfortunately had to be cancelled. We would say the club is as vibrant as ever, our membership unlike some other clubs has remained stable andevents were on we would have members taking part in the sportives all over Ireland. Leisure cycling is on the increase and last year members took part in the Tour de Conamara, Westport Gran Fondo, the Ring of Clare and the Tour de Boyne Valley as well as local club sportives.Following feedback from club members Carn Wheelers launched a new club kit in March . It was a move away from the traditional green and black which had been in existence since the club started. The new colour was introduced by former chairman Ali Gribbon as it more visible on the road to motorists and should make cycling safer for all. M McM: How have you been dealing with the lockdown  Is solo cycling giving people an avenue to manage their mental health - get out, stay fit and healthy  It has a big part to play.PC: Cycling is an excellent pastime for physical and mental health and the social aspect of the group cycles is important especially when the cycle takes in a coffee stop on the route as it gives iniduals an opportunity to socialise.The club has tried to be at the forefront of trying to encourage our members to continue cycling but of course following the rules of social distancing, it has been dficult for many who have had events cancelled or had been training for the racing season. We are no dferent than any other sports and with the recent good weather members are getting lots of solo miles in, each of our groups are also keeping in touch with each other via Facebook and WhatsApp groups which is also very important. This means that we can check in on each other until we can get back out cycling in groups. There have been no group cycles since early March and people are instead encouraged to cycle solo. Thankfully the roads have been relatively quiet as there was less traffic and the good weather in April has encouraged many to build up their miles on the bike.Last year we launched a very successful Couch to K programme which ran on consecutive Monday nights during the summer. It was very popular and over  cyclists participated under the guidance of experienced club cyclists. We had anticipated that it would run again this year but this was not possible due to the current lockdown due to the Covid-. Cyclists have been training over the winter to prepare for the summer season of races, time trials, sportives, endurance events and other competitions. There is a saying within the club which is winter miles  summer smiles so it is unfortunate that all the events have been cancelled for the foreseeable future. Nevertheless cycling is an excellent sport for physical and mental well-being as well as social contact. It is sport which continues to develop and the future of Carn Wheelers is looking very promising.

Its just after lunch last Friday afternoon and Colm Mulholland rolls back the years. Seated in his Lavey home, he surveys across the South Derry landscape.Theres not a cloud in the sky, as clear as Colms voice coming down the phone.“I can even pick out the Carn and Slaughtneil from here,” utters the  year-old.Its the picturesque landscape his we Mairead, nee OConnell, spent a lot of her childhood in, at her Granny and Granda McKennas in Tirkane and a panorama she can view every day.Maireads late brother Sean lit up the attack in Derrys  All-Ireland final team, while her future husband Colm was the defensive linchpin.Over  years later, Colm is content. Football and golf, the sports he gave much of his le to, are etched consistently through the conversation.“I feel quite good, but I wouldnt just like to be walking too far,” Colm offers.Five years ago, he acquired a golf buggy – complete with flashing neon orange light - to help him navigate his way around the parish.“I can still play a bit of golf, but this coronavirus has put an end to that.” he continues.One afternoon, Fergal Shorty McNally was lining out Lavey bottom pitch. Down the hill came Colms buggy, before he got out and swung his driver. Ping. The ball went  yards up the pitch.Colm would regularly call in at the pitch, to run his eye over whatever game or training session was going on.Sport still figures highly in his thoughts.The upcoming Lavey underage are quite good, he comments before inquisitively enquiring of another opinion on their quality. He listens intently, happy that the clubs latest crop have potential. googletag.cmd.push *** Colms father Daniel married Bellaghy woman Elizabeth Glackin and brought up a family of nine, in the townland of Ballymacpeake.After getting married, Colm moved to Ballinascreen, where Mairead taught. He bought the Burnside Innin the town, farmed nearby in Moneyneana and was getting his own contracting business off the ground.He later ed to the outskirts of Gulladuff, renovated the house where they raised four children – Don, Sinead, Martin and Brid.Colm won a scholarship to attend St Columbs in Derry. However, with a farm in the family, he didnt take up the offer.“I went into the civil engineering business,” Colm outlines. “I had a lot of men employed at that time, I bought machines when I was young. It was the type of work that suited me very well. There was a lot of road jobs with heavy and light machinery, you had to have good machinery.”After that, Colm got into horticulture and harvesting of peat in Gortnahey. His son Don remembers spending summers up there.“I can remember me and a few of the McGurks going up to work there, it was around the time of the  World Cup,” he recalls. “It was like our mid-season training.”Aside from work, football became an important part of Colms le. Lavey beat Newbridge in the  senior final but had the title stripped due to allegations of someone watching a soccer game during the ban on foreign sports.They went one better a year later with a - to - win over Pearses and the clubs championship tradition was up and running. For Colm Mulholland, his football career began in his early teenage years.“I started football when I was very young,” he begins. “The earliest memory I can think of was on a Lavey team, when someone didnt come and they were a man short.“Someone said theres a young boy Mulholland there and they filled out the team. I was about  and I played on the senior team.“Fr Carragher was a big man in the GAA at the time, he came to my house and asked my fatherI could to come and play a game.“I remember the game was played in Lavey and it was a time when a lot of people were going to games on bicycles. My father had one of the first cars in Lavey parish.”Lavey won championships in  and , but by the time Colm had become a regular senior, it was Newbridge who began to take root.“I was a young player coming up through with Lavey and enjoying my football. We werent winning all the time, but we were winning some things.“I had myself all prepared and like a lot of others, I was physically very fit. You werent worried about who you met.“At that time, Newbridge had a great side and were ruling the roost, they were winning everything.”Going into the s, Colm, the  Derry minor captain had established himself on the senior team and, locally, Lavey was beginning to flourish. In , they opened their hall. The following year, Lavey won the league and championship double and just missed out on the treble when Newbridge beat them in the final of the McGlinchey Cup.“I was the captain of the Lavey team that won the  championship,” Colm says proudly.With the lateTommy Doherty at centre-back, Colm was deployed on the  by manager John L Fay, who was ahead of his time as a manager, having taken the Lavey team to watch Banaghers North Derry final win over Dungiven two weeks before the county decider.The final was played in Dungiven and they went into the chapel to light a candle before the game and it had the desired effect. On a windy day, they beat Banagher - to - to secure the clubs fourth title. googletag.cmd.push  Colmcaptained Lavey to the  senior championship “It was a great le,” Colm said of his football career, having played with Lavey until around . “I must say that I enjoyed every bit of it. I played with some very good players in my time and came up against some very good players.”When Lavey became a force at the end of the s, his son Don was on the team. He played up front with Seamus Downey and Collie McGurk on the team that won the  All-Ireland.“That was a very proud moment, there is no doubt about that,” Colm utters.Don can remember the fitting moment when he was reunited with his father after their win over Salthill.“Daddy and uncle Seanwere there on the pitch and I can remember their joy,” he outlines. “It was like the feeling of at last weve won something in Croke Park and something signicant and a monkey off the back.”The irony was the that great friends from their Lavey and Derry days Colm and Short Tommys sons – Don and Damian – played in Laveys finest hour.It was the missing link, giving Derry the extra belief that Sam Maguire was in their grasp. Colm agrees.“It was a fantastic...and Henry Downey was a great player,” he endorsed of the man following in his own footsteps.“Lavey were always to the fore, with players on Derry teams,” added Colm, who was one of the standard bearers. *** When Derry won the first NFL title in , John L Fay was manager and while Colm was too young to play, he remembers that era clearly.Six points from captain Pat Keenan and a goal from Frankie Niblock, who lost three teeth in an earlier challenge, was enough to see off Clare.“Thatwas before my time with Derry but I can remember it very well. There were some of the greatest names to play Gaelic football on that team.”Three years later, Colm had broken into the county junior team who lost an All-Ireland final to Mayo. He lined out at midfield with Mickey McNaught, who was on the league winning team and Jim McKeever was listed at wing-forward. Tommy Doherty was stationed at full-back, in front of goalkeeper Charlie Moran.“I always remember them saying about Daddy being able to use both feet,” Don points out. “Thats why he played in so many dferent positions.”The junior team was for players who had not played in the senior championship during the season or the previous year.“Lesser teams have appeared in All-Ireland senior semi-finals since,” read a line for the  Derry centenary book, highlighting the strength of the  junior team.For Colm Mulholland, he just took all in his stride.“You just played the game and you didnt worry who you were playing against. You worriedyou lost andyou won it, you enjoyed it and that was the kind of le young people enjoyed.”When Derry lost their first Ulster final in , Colm was listed at corner-forward. They lost - to - to Cavan and the final to Tyrone two years later, but were no longer looked on as the soft touch in Ulster.“At that stage we all had great experience of county football. We had not won anything of great importance, but along came victory,” he said, referring to their  Ulster title and a first for the county.Early in the season, Colm was on the Derry team to play at the Wembley tournament before an attendance of , against Galway.Derry won both the Dr McKenna and Dr Lagan cups that season. In the championship, they were three-point winners against Antrim. After defeating Cavan in the semi-final, they were - to - winners against Down in the Ulster final.It took Derry back to Croke Park and a clash with a Kerry team who boasted greats such as Mick ODwyer and Mick OConnell.“That was a very big thing,” Colm states. “I remember it was a wet day and that was a much talked about game.”In dficult conditions, the Kingdom led - to -, but by half-time it was a dferent story and Derry were two points ahead.The Oakleafers went into a four point lead before Kerry grabbed a second goal to leave them holding on to win narrowly, - to -.“Beating Kerry in Croke Park was some achievement, there was over , people there. You were treated like royalty when you played on that Derry team and people wouldve kissed the ground you walked on.”  Colmat a Derry training camp at the airfield in Newbridge. His daughter Brid had it blown up and original hangs on the kitchen wall at home The final was a dferent story. Dublin led - to - at one point in the first half and after Derry found their feet, they trailed by four at half-time.A goal from Owen Gribbin levelled the game at - to -, but the Dubs found the net with a Des Ferguson goal in the next attack, putting them on their way to a - to - victory.“We shouldve won that All-Ireland,” Colm states.As the years have passed, several Derry supporters have felt aggrieved at not getting fair play. On an occasion, Don went to Dublin for a weekend. A conversation with a Dub over breakfast traversed towards football and eventually of his father playing in the  final.“I remember a Dublin man chipping in telling me we robbed you that day and that the refereewas an auctioneer in Dublin and he gave us everything that day...that was a Dublin man saying that. Anyone I have talked to and is old enough to remember, would say the same.”For Colm, when speaking of the final, there is a frustrated tone, but he just wants to forget about it.“It was a good team we had, but we dont want to hear about it again, thats how bad we all took it. I am just drawing a line under it.”He played for another three or four years before calling time on his Derry career, one he enjoyed immensely. It included the  league final defeat to Kerry, a game Colm excelled in.“I played football for Lavey and Derry for at least  years. I played for a long time and then golf took over after the football.”“I just loved it football and the people you would meet, then you went down South and they knew you played Gaelic football, there was always great chat.”Colm also had a prolonged spell in Philadelphia where he stayed with his uncle Dermot Glackin, a relation on his mothers side. He also had his fare paid to travel to play football in New Yorks Gaelic Park. While in the Big Apple he got approached about playing in San Francisco and drove thejourney of nearly , miles along the famed Route .“I was in America a few times. I was well looked after and it was a very interesting time,” he adds.In later le, in , he crossed the Atlantic with his we Mairead on San Francisco, where he also played golf.He would go on to captain Moyola Park in , but it was far from his first impact on the club.  Colm in his Moyola captains jacket *** In the early s, there was an attempt to bring golf to the South Derry area, but it wasnt until  that Lord Moyola made an approach about about constructing a course on the Shanemullagh Estate in Castledawson.On the first committee formed was Colm Mulholland who was contractor for the new course, putting his civil engineering work to good use. By the spring of , the front nine was complete before work moved to completing the rest of the course.“I built the course – the greens and the tees,” outlines Mulholland. Being at the coalface of making the dream into a reality is a source of pride for him. Moyola was his arena and there was even a hole called after him – Colms dillemna.Earlier in the day, before our telephone call, Colm amassed all his golfing trophies. It amounted to  or  from a career he thoroughly enjoyed. He also loves to tell of his part in a fourball that lost just twice over a  year period.“I enjoyed the golf and I played it in America and played a good bit in San Francisco. Later on in le, I had more success in golf than I had on the football field.”“You could write books galore about the acquaintances with people in the world of sport. I have played golf in  of the  counties, it was great to meet friends through it and the football. Sport is something .”The former Derry minor and Lavey senior winning captain is now an honarary club president. He is also an honarary member of Moyola Golf Club – titles not just handed out to anyone. They are earned through years of service.When the lock-down subsides, Colm will be back swinging the clubs again. You cant keep a good man down. RELATED - The foundations for Derrys GAA success.

Its just after lunch last Friday afternoon and Colm Mulholland rolls back the years. Seated in his Lavey home, he surveys across the South Derry landscape.Theres not a cloud in the sky, as clear as Colms voice coming down the phone.“I can even pick out the Carn and Slaughtneil from here,” utters the  year-old.Its the picturesque landscape his we Mairead, nee OConnell, spent a lot of her childhood in, at her Granny and Granda McKennas in Tirkane and a panorama she can view every day.Maireads late brother Sean lit up the attack in Derrys  All-Ireland final team, while her future husband Colm was the defensive linchpin.Over  years later, Colm is content. Football and golf, the sports he gave much of his le to, are etched consistently through the conversation.“I feel quite good, but I wouldnt just like to be walking too far,” Colm offers.Five years ago, he acquired a golf buggy – complete with flashing neon orange light - to help him navigate his way around the parish.“I can still play a bit of golf, but this coronavirus has put an end to that.” he continues.One afternoon, Fergal Shorty McNally was lining out Lavey bottom pitch. Down the hill came Colms buggy, before he got out and swung his driver. Ping. The ball went  yards up the pitch.Colm would regularly call in at the pitch, to run his eye over whatever game or training session was going on.Sport still figures highly in his thoughts.The upcoming Lavey underage are quite good, he comments before inquisitively enquiring of another opinion on their quality. He listens intently, happy that the clubs latest crop have potential. googletag.cmd.push *** Colms father Daniel married Bellaghy woman Elizabeth Glackin and brought up a family of nine, in the townland of Ballymacpeake.After getting married, Colm moved to Ballinascreen, where Mairead taught. He bought the Burnside Innin the town, farmed nearby in Moneyneana and was getting his own contracting business off the ground.He later ed to the outskirts of Gulladuff, renovated the house where they raised four children – Don, Sinead, Martin and Brid.Colm won a scholarship to attend St Columbs in Derry. However, with a farm in the family, he didnt take up the offer.“I went into the civil engineering business,” Colm outlines. “I had a lot of men employed at that time, I bought machines when I was young. It was the type of work that suited me very well. There was a lot of road jobs with heavy and light machinery, you had to have good machinery.”After that, Colm got into horticulture and harvesting of peat in Gortnahey. His son Don remembers spending summers up there.“I can remember me and a few of the McGurks going up to work there, it was around the time of the  World Cup,” he recalls. “It was like our mid-season training.”Aside from work, football became an important part of Colms le. Lavey beat Newbridge in the  senior final but had the title stripped due to allegations of someone watching a soccer game during the ban on foreign sports.They went one better a year later with a - to - win over Pearses and the clubs championship tradition was up and running. For Colm Mulholland, his football career began in his early teenage years.“I started football when I was very young,” he begins. “The earliest memory I can think of was on a Lavey team, when someone didnt come and they were a man short.“Someone said theres a young boy Mulholland there and they filled out the team. I was about  and I played on the senior team.“Fr Carragher was a big man in the GAA at the time, he came to my house and asked my fatherI could to come and play a game.“I remember the game was played in Lavey and it was a time when a lot of people were going to games on bicycles. My father had one of the first cars in Lavey parish.”Lavey won championships in  and , but by the time Colm had become a regular senior, it was Newbridge who began to take root.“I was a young player coming up through with Lavey and enjoying my football. We werent winning all the time, but we were winning some things.“I had myself all prepared and like a lot of others, I was physically very fit. You werent worried about who you met.“At that time, Newbridge had a great side and were ruling the roost, they were winning everything.”Going into the s, Colm, the  Derry minor captain had established himself on the senior team and, locally, Lavey was beginning to flourish. In , they opened their hall. The following year, Lavey won the league and championship double and just missed out on the treble when Newbridge beat them in the final of the McGlinchey Cup.“I was the captain of the Lavey team that won the  championship,” Colm says proudly.With the lateTommy Doherty at centre-back, Colm was deployed on the  by manager John L Fay, who was ahead of his time as a manager, having taken the Lavey team to watch Banaghers North Derry final win over Dungiven two weeks before the county decider.The final was played in Dungiven and they went into the chapel to light a candle before the game and it had the desired effect. On a windy day, they beat Banagher - to - to secure the clubs fourth title. googletag.cmd.push  Colmcaptained Lavey to the  senior championship “It was a great le,” Colm said of his football career, having played with Lavey until around . “I must say that I enjoyed every bit of it. I played with some very good players in my time and came up against some very good players.”When Lavey became a force at the end of the s, his son Don was on the team. He played up front with Seamus Downey and Collie McGurk on the team that won the  All-Ireland.“That was a very proud moment, there is no doubt about that,” Colm utters.Don can remember the fitting moment when he was reunited with his father after their win over Salthill.“Daddy and uncle Seanwere there on the pitch and I can remember their joy,” he outlines. “It was like the feeling of at last weve won something in Croke Park and something signicant and a monkey off the back.”The irony was the that great friends from their Lavey and Derry days Colm and Short Tommys sons – Don and Damian – played in Laveys finest hour.It was the missing link, giving Derry the extra belief that Sam Maguire was in their grasp.

Plans have been put forward to construct the new footbridge as part of a proposal to extend Derrys popular quayside walk and cycle path. Derry City and Strabane District Council has applied for planning permission to build the footbridge across an inlet close to the Fort George site. This would allow the quayside walkway to be extended into the Bay Road area. There are also plans to create a new three-metre wide cycle walking path along Bay Road to link in to the Bay Road Park. Derrys quay has been revitalised in recent years and the latest proposal looks set to continue the regeneration of the riverside area. googletag.cmd.push The plans for the new footbridge and walkway are now being considered by the local councils planning department. Meanwhile, a new cycling champion role has been created to encourage more people to get on their bikes in Derry. Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon this week announced a new walking and cycling champion with a focus on transforming communities and developing creative solutions to support a new way of living during and post COVID-. “Our champion will ensure that we deliver our commitment to increase the percentage of journeys made by walking and cycling. Inspiring our communities, restructuring our spaces, changing forever the way we live – and changing it for the better,” said the Minister. googletag.cmd.push “I want to increase the space available for people who want to walk and cycle by extending pavements, pedestrianising streetsand introducing pop up cycle lanes. I have already identied someparts ofBelfast City Centre and Derry city that can betransformed in this wayand I intend to work with councils to identy more areas across the North as a matter of urgency. Changing how we use our spaces will transform communities right across Northern Ireland – creatively change lives – enable social distancing and encourage health and mental wellbeing. “Thisenvironmental and public healthwork will be done on a collaborative basis, with an action group, formed from both within and outside government. I also want to work in collaboration with communities, including identying and creating ‘Quiet Streets’ where pedestrians, cyclists and play have priority and motor vehicles are guests,” added Ms Mallon. “As the Executive looks this week to review thelockdown – we all need to be looking ahead – out of the darkness of this pandemic and into a better world that we need to build for ourselves. Greener, cleaner, healthier and happier people and places must be our aim as we learn to live with this new normal during and after Covid-.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

At present, there are six people being treated at Altnagelvin Hospital in Derry after testing positive for the disease. Geraldine McKay, the Western Trusts Director of Acute Hospitals, said that the number of COVID- patients at Altnagelvin was very reduced in comparison to what they have been. There have been  deaths from COVID- in recent months in the Western Trusts two acute hospitals at Altnagelvin and the South West hospital in Enniskillen. There have been further deaths in local care homes but a breakdown of deaths in inidual care homes has not been made public. googletag.cmd.push The Western Trust said that there had been COVID- outbreaks in  care homes in the Trust area. An outbreak is defined as two or more cases. Ms McKay said the lower than anticipated number of cases and deaths locally was due to the co-operation of the public and the magnicent work of healthcare staff. As part of the preparations for the expected rise in COVID- cases, the number of intensive care beds at Altnagelvin Hospital had been increased from  to . However, Ms McKay said the intensive care unit never had to work at full capacity over the recent period. googletag.cmd.push She said that the number of people attending Altnagelvins emergency department had decreased by almost % over recent months after people were asked to stay away from the hospital as much as possible to allow staff to cope with the COVID- situation. Ms McKay praised the public for their support for the health service and highlighted how well people locally had taken on board the message to stay at home and maintain social distancing when out in public. She said this had played a vital role in keeping the number of COVID- cases and deaths lower than had been anticipated. People have really done what we asked of them, she said. Ms McKay said the Trust was now looking at how to manage the new normal for hospital services, taking into consideration issues such as social distancing in waiting areas and the use of personal protection equipment for staff.

Robert Fullerton, who is , bought the pound ‘Treasure Bingo’ Scratchcard at his local Vivoxtra store whilst shopping for some essential grocery items on May . Little did Robert know that later the same evening he would discover he’d won an amount , times greater than the price of the scratchcard! The incredible news comes as an amazing boost for Robert and his we Susanas both had been recently furloughed from the company they work for as a result of the COVID- pandemic. googletag.cmd.push Robert works as a spray painter and Susan as a machine operator for a leading local kitchen supplier and, like many across the country, have been furloughed for the past five weeks as part of the Government’s job retention scheme. Robert explained how his le-changing win came about. “I was out doing an essential grocery shop and had a scratchcard in my pocket with a pound win on it. So while I was paying for the groceries, I exchanged it for another similar National Lottery Scratchcard, and bought an extra one for good measure. “I brought the two scratchcards home and played them that night. I didn’t win anything on the first scratchcard and gave it to Susan to check, while I was scratching the second card,” he continued. googletag.cmd.push “Half-way through, it was already showing that I’d won pound, and I started physically shaking. I was thinking to myself, ‘that’s not right’ and had to get up and go outside for some fresh air. “I showed the scratchcard to Susan and took a photo that I sent to my mum and sister – both of whom agreed that I wasn’t seeing things and that, as far as they could see, I’d won three hundred grand! “After a restless night, with little or no sleep, I called The National Lottery the following morning. They asked for some details and then, I’ll never forget, the lady on the phone said… ‘Congratulations, you have won pound,’! “My reply was ‘you what ’ My heart felt like it was going to burst out of my chest. In fact, I still can’t believe it. It’s like a dream come true, especially in these uncertain times when we’re stuck at home and don’t really know how our jobs will be affected by this coronavirus pandemic.” Despite his big win, Robert hopes to get back to work as soon as possible, saying that he loves his job and the ‘banter’ with his workmates. Robert bought the winning National Lottery Treasure Bingo Scratchcard from the Vivoxtra store on Magherafelt Road in Castledawson.

The current circumstances are dficult for everyone, but its only through all of us playing our part that we can move closer to ato normality. googletag.cmd.push I have been very disappointed to learn that some people are trying to arrange events and gatherings locally and I would strongly discourage both the organisation and attendance of these. The advice from government is very clear – we must stay at home and, where it is necessary to go out, we have to take all possible precautions to protect ourselves, our families, our health service and everyone around us. We are in a crucial period of this pandemic and our actions now will have a huge effect on how the coming months will pan out.

At Tuesday night’s online council meeting, the council voted against topping up the extra % for the  employees currently facing furlough. The move has prompted scathing criticism from three trade unions who have called on the council to rethink their plans. Alan Law of NIPSA branded the decision ‘disgraceful’. “Council officers assured the Trade Unions that plans to furlough staff would be at % of normal pay and advised the unions that Councillors agreed with these plans,” he said. googletag.cmd.push “It is absolutely disgraceful that this decision was taken and is utterly opposed by NIPSA.” GMB’s Alan Perry said: “This appalling decision by councillors is another example of how they view the staff of this council. “To force a pay cut on some of the lowest paid workers isn’t acceptable when themselves still receive full pay and expenses.” Unite Regional Officer, Gareth Scott, said the decision was putting the funding at risk. He said: “This approach is not being taken by other councils, is totally unacceptable and the unions will be challenging the decision in every way possible. “Under the Job Retention Scheme the employer requires the agreement of the employees, as such the Councillors are actually threatening the chance to draw down this % funding from central Government.” googletag.cmd.push Sinn Feacutein’s motion proposed that the council top up the furloughed staff’s wages to %, but group leader on the council, Cara McShane, said unionist opposition caused it to fail. She said: “Sinn Feacutein believed that Council making up the remaining % of the employees’ salary was the right thing to do. “There is already an obvious and signicant savings for Council, which can now avail of % of these salaries from the government’s Job Retention Scheme. “Causeway Coast and Glens Council had the opportunity to show it was an organisation who had the workers’ interests at heart, but it failed again. “It is unfortunate, but not surprising, that the DUP and UUP joined forces to reject our proposal.” The DUP’s John McAuley said they opposed the motion ‘in the interests of fairness’. He said: “Unionists last night supported a proposal to Furlough a number of council staff who due to the current Cornovirus Crisis are not required. “This UK Government scheme pays % of normal wages and is designed to safeguard jobs, avoiding a redundancy situation. “SF supported by SDLP, Alliance  Cllr McShanevoted for council to top this up to to % but the amendment failed. “Our stance was nothing to do with financial mismanagement, but in the interests of fairness. Why should public sector furloughed workers get % when private sector are getting %  “Why should council staff get paid the same on Furlough as their colleagues who are still working as normal  “I know that majority of my constituents would not want their money being used to top up public sector wages whilst they are in the same situation on % pay.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Alan Law of NIPSA branded the decision ‘disgraceful’. “Council officers assured the Trade Unions that plans to furlough staff would be at % of normal pay and advised the unions that Councillors agreed with these plans,” he said. googletag.cmd.push “It is absolutely disgraceful that this decision was taken and is utterly opposed by NIPSA.” GMB’s Alan Perry said: “This appalling decision by councillors is another example of how they view the staff of this council. “To force a pay cut on some of the lowest paid workers isn’t acceptable when themselves still receive full pay and expenses.” Unite Regional Officer, Gareth Scott, said the decision was putting the funding at risk. He said: “This approach is not being taken by other councils, is totally unacceptable and the unions will be challenging the decision in every way possible. “Under the Job Retention Scheme the employer requires the agreement of the employees, as such the Councillors are actually threatening the chance to draw down this % funding from central Government.” googletag.cmd.push Sinn Feacutein’s motion proposed that the council top up the furloughed staff’s wages to %, but group leader on the council, Cara McShane, said unionist opposition caused it to fail. She said: “Sinn Feacutein believed that Council making up the remaining % of the employees’ salary was the right thing to do. “There is already an obvious and signicant savings for Council, which can now avail of % of these salaries from the government’s Job Retention Scheme. “Causeway Coast and Glens Council had the opportunity to show it was an organisation who had the workers’ interests at heart, but it failed again. “It is unfortunate, but not surprising, that the DUP and UUP joined forces to reject our proposal.” The DUP’s John McAuley said they opposed the motion ‘in the interests of fairness’. He said: “Unionists last night supported a proposal to Furlough a number of council staff who due to the current Cornovirus Crisis are not required. “This UK Government scheme pays % of normal wages and is designed to safeguard jobs, avoiding a redundancy situation. “SF supported by SDLP, Alliance  Cllr McShanevoted for council to top this up to to % but the amendment failed. “Our stance was nothing to do with financial mismanagement, but in the interests of fairness. Why should public sector furloughed workers get % when private sector are getting %  “Why should council staff get paid the same on Furlough as their colleagues who are still working as normal  “I know that majority of my constituents would not want their money being used to top up public sector wages whilst they are in the same situation on % pay.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

People who havent been to mass in years tuned in to YouTube and Facebook to watch her mass, said Sean Gallagher, who helps run a novenaprayer group in her memory.

In recent weeks Sister Clares sisters, Shauna Gill and Megan Nicell, have travelled around the city delivering hundreds of photographs and novenas to houses and local shops. Sister Clare was a self confessed party girl with a promising show business career in front of her when she joined the ServantSistersof the Home of the Motherat just . Since her death several miracles have been attributed to her and calls have been made for her to be made a saint.The miracles are working all the time, said Mr Gallagher. We should be shouting from the rooftops about her. This is our saint - she was a wee woman from the heart of the Bog. I hope she is made a saint sooner rather than later. It is something that can take hundreds of years but I hope to see it in my letime. I was talking to a young woman recently who had a picture of Sr Clare in her window. I asked her about it and she said she got it from the chip shop in Rosemount. She told me I dont pray but I chat away to that wee nun every day. That is a small miraclein itself. At this time more than ever people are putting their faith in her. She is moving young people because she was so young.

In recent weeks Sister Clares sisters, Shauna Gill and Megan Nicell, have travelled around the city delivering hundreds of photographs and novenas to houses and local shops. Sister Clare was a self confessed party girl with a promising show business career in front of her when she joined the ServantSistersof the Home of the Motherat just . Since her death several miracles have been attributed to her and calls have been made for her to be made a saint.The miracles are working all the time, said Mr Gallagher. We should be shouting from the rooftops about her. This is our saint - she was a wee woman from the heart of the Bog. I hope she is made a saint sooner rather than later. It is something that can take hundreds of years but I hope to see it in my letime. I was talking to a young woman recently who had a picture of Sr Clare in her window. I asked her about it and she said she got it from the chip shop in Rosemount. She told me I dont pray but I chat away to that wee nun every day. That is a small miraclein itself. At this time more than ever people are putting their faith in her. She is moving young people because she was so young.

An organisation called the All-Island League Advocacy Group wants to see a new cross-border football tournament involving teams from the Irish League in Northern Ireland and the League of Ireland in the Republic. The two leagues would remain in existence but the new proposal would be that the top teams in each league would qualy for a knockout tournament which would see the winner crowned the all-Ireland champions. Having studied the new proposals, Derry City today released a statement in which the club said they were impressed by the weight of the financial benefits that would result from the new set-up. googletag.cmd.push This is a seminal moment in the well being and even existence of professional football on this island, said a Derry City spokesperson. Presently, we have two football leagues, both precarious in structure and financial viability. The consequence of the coronavirus has added to the dficulties of maintaining a football club. Continuing financial outgoings with no sustaining incomes makes it very dficult for most clubs to keep their heads above the financial waters. More than likely it will make it disastrous for some. Concentration is momentarily on questions of when and how to get leagues up and running again on who will be declared champions and who will be relegated. googletag.cmd.push There are pressing questions about European competitions. If and how they will take place and, contingent on those decisions, will the clubs, four in the south and three in the north, receive their payment for qualying for the competition. The more successful clubs who most often qualy for European competitions depend, to a great degree, on UEFA money to keep them solvent. The above is a reality known to every professional football club on this island, north and south. The Derry City spokesperson said professional football is a sport, but it is also a business. The pandemic has exposed the underlying fragility of the present model. In pure business terms it is not viable. There is not enough income being generated to sustain the business. Great efforts are made to keep clubs in existence, but those efforts can only be limited as they lack the finances to grow the business. A few clubs are blessed by generous benefactors who enable them to achieve some stability and success but are hindered by the lack of buoyancy and competitiveness of the other clubs. The historical relationships between the two leagues and their governing bodies, the IFA in Northern Ireland and the FAI in the south, have not been as constructive and creative as most clubs might have wished. We understand the natural tensions that often exist between governing bodies and clubs but it is time to acknowledge the tenuous state of both Leagues and to recognise that neither the FAI or the IFA have had the local leagues at the top of their ambitions. It always shocks fans when they discover that the prize money for winning the League in the north is pound, and in the southern league the prize money is €,. Pitted against the reality that it takes over pound,, a year to maintain a medium successful club and the financial dficulties become apparent. We are informed that the IFA and the FAI have agreed to jointly examine the report. We see this as creative and important. That examination will be more authoritativethose two organisations are aware of the extent of the support that exists within the island among the clubs for an expression of professional football that is vibrant and capable of achieving the same support and success of comparable leagues. Derry City, whose history provides it with a unique relationship with both leagues and all the clubs on this island, wishes to affirm and support the sense and the urgency of the findings contained in the report. We would encourage other clubs to acknowledge the fragility of the present arrangements and to join in supporting the possibilities that an All- Island League would release.

The number of parcels being delivered is % more than this time last year, with the districtrsquos other foodbanks reporting an increased demand.In a newsletter issued last week, Mrs Lennon revealed that an application to the Martin Lewis Coronavirus Emergency Fund was successful and that the support the charity will receive will make a ldquosignicant dference to its work in the immediate future.She also said that many of the volunteers have begun to see food and its supply in a dferent way.ldquoThe panic buying, shortages and less opportunities to shop has had an impact on people who have never faced this situation before, continued Mrs Lennon.ldquoPersonally, I hope I understand a little more about the worry that feeding those we love can bringle becomes dficult. I have been so pleased that the foodbank has been able to continue operating in these dficult circumstances, even though it is operating dferently.Mrs Lennon said she is especially grateful to everyone who has helped her with decision making and practical help since the pandemic began.ldquoIt has been humbling and amazing to see God continuing to bless the work and to be able to help those in our community who need the support, she continued.Donations of food can be left at the Asda and SuperValu stores in Downpatrick during their opening hours andanyone would like to make a financial donation they can do so by email.There is also a weekly donation point for people in Saintfield at the townrsquos First Presbyterian Church between pm and pm. Donations can be made on Tuesdays between pm and pm.Partner organisations can still refer people to the foodbank for support either by telephone on   or by emailing fountainfoodbank@gmail, while iniduals who feel they need help can also contact the foodbank directly, providing some basic information. They can also order a food parcel.Mrs Lennon said that due to the very dficult circumstances at present, the foodbank is keen to help as many people as possible, urging them not to be anxious about asking for help.Orders need to be placed by pm on Tuesdays, with parcels delivered on Wednesday afternoons and left outside clientsrsquo homes.Across the district, many groups and iniduals are donating food and money to the foodbank to allow the volunteers to help those in need. They include BM Bargains in Ballynahinch, Crossgar Harriers, Omagh Stockcar Club, Downpatrick FC, Saintfieldrsquos Hollymount Hall and churches in the Saintfield area.Mrs Lennon said: ldquoWe are overwhelmed by the generosity shown by so many at this dficult time. Despite food being dficult to purchase, people are still making donations and many generous financial donations have been made.The foodbank volunteers hope that shoppers will continue to think about the charity when they are shopping and leave items at the dedicated collection points in local stores to help them continue to meet increasing demand.The Fountain Foodbank contact details are  , email fountainfoodbank@gmail or visit www.downpatrickpresbyterianchurch.org..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/13th May 2020 Aughlisnafin.jpg","title":"Aughlisnafin man Chris makes vital PPE equipment  ","story":"AN Aughlisnafin man has taken his new lesaving charity venture to a higher level.Chris Campbell, is putting his passion for technology to good use by making PPE for care workers on the frontline of the coronavirus pandemic.Chris, who began making PPE from his home a little over a month ago, has been inundated with requests, so much so that he and his small team of volunteers have moved their operation to St Maryrsquos Community Hall in Newcastle.The premises were kindly offered to him by Rob Manley, founder of Newcastle Community Cinema, which has had to close due to the lockdown.By using D printers Chrisrsquos venture, PPE NHS Supplies NI, has so far supplied almost , high-quality sets of face shields and ear protectors to hospitals and nursing homes mdash and thatrsquos just the beginning.Chrishas been helped by generous cash donations by members of the public.He said: ldquoAt the beginning I received an anonymous donation of pound, which overwhelmed me and since then the donations have been pouring in. I am so humbled by the kindness of strangers.ldquoI set up a GoFundMe page that allows charity workers like myself to make instant withdrawals which means I can now purchase materials faster and produce the PPE without much delay.The more D printers that Chris can purchase the more lesaving equipment he can produce. However, costs are rising.ldquoThis week a D printer jumped to pound on eBay. The same printer last year cost pound. You could say they have all but tripled in price, he explained.Chris was diagnosed with ADHD when he was eight years old and has been greatly supported by the ADHD Hub in Newcastle.He says that once Covid- and the need for PPE ends, all funds from his venture will be donated to the Hub which is based in Savoy Lane.Chris says the condition is like a double-edged sword. While his le has been greatly impacted by ADHD, it can help him become a high achiever.ldquoSometimes people with the condition possess an exceptional ability to entertain, but there is always another side to it, he said.ldquoWe suffer from poor concentration levels in many areas and we have limited social skills. We miss out on the social subtleties that most other people take for granted and we are notoriously impulsive, which means school is a very hard environment for most of us.ldquoWhile we donrsquot make friends easily, wersquore exceptionally good at thinking outside the box. Nonetheless, it isnrsquot easy having thousands of thoughts running through your mind every moment, he said.Chris, who is happy to be producing high-end lesaving PPE, had this message for readers: ldquoIf you or a friend or family member are working for the NHS or any nursing home without the proper PPE please get in touch with me to arrange delivery or collection of the face shields and ear protectors.Alternatively you can help Chris fund his project by using the following link https:www.gofundme f d-printed-nhs-ppe-supplies-ni..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/13th May 2020 Club.jpg","title":"Ballynahich Youth salutes its young heroes  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH Youthrsquos annual award winners have been announced.

I launched it at the school where I teach and it went down really well, everyone loved it.ldquoBut, sadly with many children loosing members of their family through Covid- the sales of the book have seen a resurgence.The Wizard and I tells the story of a young boy who visited a wizard at the bottom of his garden every time he needed advice.Ciaran added: ldquoThe wizard was always able to answer any questions the boy had, but one day the wizard wasnrsquot there. He then had to start answering questions for himself.ldquoThe boy in the story is myself as I go to visit my grandfather. The girl in the story is my daughter. When she arrives the boy has less time to spend with the wizard, explains Ciaran.ldquoAs a boy I always enjoyed spending time with my grandfather. I was like a sponge and would soak up his answers to my many questions.ldquoSome years later I got married and had a family and didnrsquot have as much time to visit my grandfather until one day he wasnrsquot there any more.Ciaran says the book, which was designed to bring about a conversation about the topic of dying, can benefit adults too.ldquoMy daughter also illustrated the book. When she heard the story she started to draw how she pictured it. When it all came together it was perfect, he remarked.The dad-of-two hopes the book will facilitate big le changes, particularly in the current climate with older generations taking the biggest impact of Covid-.He said: ldquoI think now wersquove been gted more and more time with our families and lots of people are using that time to read to their kids so I think the book is perfect for this current situation.ldquoWhen it was first launched a lot of people asked who was the target audience and who was it geared towards.

The homes are being built at a sprawling site which borders four main roads.The redevelopment of the former hospital site includes a range of housing types including apartments, two and three storey homes and bungalows.It is also understood that the former hospital and canteen building behind it, which are both listed buildings, have been incorporated into the development plan as apartment blocks.The main entrance into the former hospital complex, off Pound Lane, will remain, while itrsquos understood that a new entrance is also proposed on the Ardglass Road side of the old Downe site.Downpatrick councillor Dermot Curran is pleased that contractors are back on site and hopes they are observing social distancing guidelines.He said the redevelopment will go some way towards reducing the number of people on the waiting list for social homes in Downpatrick.Cllr Curran added: ldquoThere are many families on the waiting list for social housing who are classed in the urgent need category which effectively means they are a priority for housing providers.ldquoPeople are watching construction work progress at the former hospital site and perhaps it may be possible for families to move into their new homes before the end of the year.Now that construction work has recommenced comes after Stormont communities minister Deirdre Hargey confirmed that she is to introduce legislation designed to help protect the supply of new and existing social and affordable homes.She described housing as ldquoone of her priorities and said she has great ambitions to deliver more targeted to areas in the most need.ldquoTo do this, we must ensure we have the means to deliver, the minister continued, explaining that many of the changes required to existing legislation are technical in nature.Ms Hargey said the most signicant change will be an end to the compulsory need for registered housing associations to operate a house sales scheme.The minister said there will always be many challenges on the ability to deliver new social homes such as land availability, infrastructure issues and the availability of public finance, but outlined her commitment to doing all she can to deliver for those in need.Ms Hargey continued: ldquoI am committed to working with my Executivecolleagues to deliver more housing and welcome the priority afforded in the lsquoNew Decade, New Approachrsquo document which sets out how the Executivewill enhance investment and agree a new target for social and affordable home starts.ldquoFollowing the current coronavirus crisis, economic and social recovery will be vitally important for everyone. Whilst there are challenges ahead, a technicality should not stand in our way of delivery.

The organisation may also ask the Treasury to underwrite unpaid rates.Mr McCallan added: ldquoRecovery in many cases would be severely haltedthe very facilities and support to get the economy back again are severely restricted or donrsquot exist.Confirmation that Newry, Mourne and Down Council is using the furlough scheme comes after Stormont communities minister Deirdre Hargey said her officials have been working with local authorities to understand the extent to which they can manage the Covid- situation by making use of the job retention scheme. She insisted that her priorities were ensuring that the rights of workers were respected and protecting jobs.The minister added: ldquoThis is a very dficult time for everybody. Our  councils provide very important s and services, continuing to do so during this emergency and looking ahead councils need to be ready to play their part in the economic recovery.A spokesman for Newry, Mourne and Down Council confirmed that the organisation will avail of the coronavirus job retention scheme.He explained that it will apply to employees who work in services where there is loss of income due to the Covid- pandemic and who cannot be redeployed to do other work.The spokesman added: ldquoThis falls in line with guidance from the Department for Communities.

This gaming  is an ever developing technology that makes training a lot more bearable and safer during those cold dark winter nights.With Zwt providing social rides, workouts, structured programmes and competitive racing, it has something for every cyclist mdash and, recently, runners too mdash all from the comfort of your home.So obviously when socialdistancing and lockdown struck, the footfall on Zwt rocketed. I suddenly noticed Shimna Wheelers numbers were increasing, from three or four of us to over a dozen.All were using it for dferent reasons. Alex McMath, Ronan Kelly, Jimmy McVeigh and myself were trying to maintain fitness and, with the aid of other apps, to socialise while riding and basically enabling a virtual club ride during lockdown. To fit in with family le these normally occur early morning or late evening.Along with Kieran Connolly, Brian McLornan and Andrew Porter, we are involved in racing leagues organised by Newry Wheelers and Cycling Ireland. The Cycling Ireland league races are broadcast live on Saturday mornings on YouTube.On the racing side, there has been plenty of banter between club members regarding weight and power. The races are seriously competitive, as they usually run in conjunction with other nationsrsquo leagues, and are pretty punishing on the body.Each of us knows our limits but with some choice words of encouragement via headphones during races, these limits can be surpassed. Jimmy is usually on the receiving end of the stick but generally backs it up in the races. Brian is beginning to settle into this new style of racing and improving with every outing.On our latest outing in the Newry League, only Kieran, Brian and myself made the start line and after a measured effort off the start we all ended up in the same group on the road, which was perfect.With the course being flat it was of utmost importance to stay in the draft of the group to preserve energy. Irsquom first to admit that both Kieran and Brian are much stronger riders than myself but with more experience on Zwt I was able to hang onto the group for longer than I expected.The three of us worked hard within the group, but with only six kilometres left we had slipped off the back of our group. I knew I was nearly done and with one last big effort Kieran and myself managed to close the gap to the group and Kieran and Brian were back in business.I was toast and reduced to riding to the finish alone, while the other lads were still firmly in the mix. They both had learnt their lesson and rode the last six kilometres well up in the group, covering every move.By the time the final sprint came Brian had recovered and shot out of the group to take the honours.Kieran rolled in a few places behind him, having succeeded in putting in a great sht during the whole race. I finished a couple of minutes down, but happy that I was able to help for a change. The next round will hopefully see a bigger Shimna turnout.Danny Carville, Barry Fettes, John Irwin and Marty McIlmail are involved in structured programmes and have found the daily training process very helpful during lockdown.One member, Brian Spence, is even using Zwt to recover from a skiing injury, while Lavelle Grant and Johnny Ward have just joined the ranks.Many other local clubs mdash such as Dromara, Newry, Killinchy, Ards and North Down mdash are experiencing similar interest due to the uncertainty of real cycling events this year.There is a lot of interaction between them and good communication, to the point that I believe it has made the whole Irish cycling community stronger and closer than it has been for a long time, helped mainly by the Zwt Community Team Irelandproviding a national sense of belonging in these dficult times.With riders from every county and of every ability itrsquos a credit to the likes of Alan Campbell, from Dromara, who has become heavily involved with the development of ZCTIrl, that this community is increasing daily.Of course Zwt is a global  and each country has its own community, but I believe that the Irish one is as strong as any in the world.Zwt is also being put to other good uses, with hundreds of people using the  to raise money for frontline services across the globe in this time of need.A few North Down members and myself helped raise more than pound, for the Ulster Hospital by riding the hardest course available on Zwt in around six hours. Painful, but well worth the effort.With the current situation worldwide, the cycling community is enjoying having some sort of sporting normality mdashyou call riding events with some of your heroes normality.The professional teams have followed suit and can be found riding around the same virtual world as us amateurs, training, racing and doing guest rides with their followers.There are not too many sports that can say that..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/13th May 2020 Dundrum.jpg","title":"Dundrum chef cooks his way to final of Great British Menu  ","story":"DUNDRUM chef Alex Greene has booked his place through to the coveted  Great British Menu banquet.The  year-old stunned the judges on Monday nightrsquos finals competition with a potato-based dish starter dish inspired by Belfast-born CS Lewisrsquo The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe childrenrsquosrsquo book.Alex celebrated once more by picking up host, Susan Calman, and swinging her round ndash much to the comediennersquos delight.He first started off his culinary career as a  year-old washing dishes in the Buckrsquos Head restaurant in his home village.Having once worked in Claridgersquos in London and also run his own restaurant, Top Nosh, in Annalong, Alex ed to Deanes EIPIC restaurant in Belfast, where he had worked previously, and helped it retain its Michelin star for the fth year.His dish of onion jelly, pickled onions, five dferent types of potato, a four-cheese custard, and truffle, served in a wardrobe, was described by the judges as ldquoa sophisticated, sexy, sensual masterpiece.

They also claimed the existing plant in Killyleagh is operating well below capacity and can easely accommodate with sewage from Crossgar.But local councillors Sam Osborne and Albert Colmer have been highly critical of the DoErsquos attitude towards people in the Crossgar and Killyleagh areas and say that in a supposed era of open Government and accountability, the Departmentrsquos attitude is nothing short of ldquodeplorable and diabolical.ARDGLASS ndash A former primary school could be developed as a new community facility in Ardglass, it has emerged this week.Education chiefs say they are prepared to hand over the former Ardglass Primary School at the Downpatrick Road to the local Development Association after years of neglect.The school, which closed its doors over  years ago, was to have been developed as a new library facility, and while education chiefs claim this plan is not dead yet, they are prepared to allow the former school to be redeveloped by the local group.In addition, East Down Institute officials are understood to be interested in providing outreach classes in Ardglass and local councillor Dermot Curran says he is ldquodelighted there is now movement on the future of the old building.He has unveiled plans to hold an urgent meeting between the South Eastern Education and Library Board, the Ardglass Development Association, Down Council and the East Down Institute, to discuss a way forward.CLOUGH ndash An elderly woman was the victim of a terrying ordeal last week when masked men tied her up at her Clough home for four hours.The two intruders broke into the pensionerrsquos home at around .am on Sunday morning, tying her feet and hands before demanding money and then ransacking her house.The lady eventually managed to free herself at around am and sought help from a neighbour who reported the incident to police.

Only four of the nine entries went to post with Newcastle ride Tom Newsam setting off in the lead on his own Miss Lennihan, followed by Colin McBratney on Belle Lady, owned and trained at Strangford by Joe Magee.Belle Lady came down and victory went to Midnight Auburn, owned and ridden by Downpatrickrsquos Gerry Lavery, whose son, Declan, is one of todayrsquos top local amateur riders. Miss Lennihan took second as Paddy Fitzsimons had to pull up on Heatherrsquos Braes.The winner was trained by Gerryrsquos brother, Brian, who works for Jeremy Maxwell at Ballee.

This horse took part in the fourth race, the Andi Grand Prix qualier and, with Rathfriland jockey Leo Gracey in the saddle, made all at the running to come home four s clear of Glen Keys, ridden by Paul Larkan, and Bentra Road, ridden by Tom Howley.

There are plans for sustainable transport projects including a park and ride scheme to bring visitors into the centre of the resort with the scheme similar to the one which operates during the resortrsquos international Festival of Flight.Cllr Clarke says the Gateway project encourages people to walk and cycle more and believes that the multi-million pound scheme can provide a signicant boost for the wider district economy.He said while people are rightly preoccupied with coronavirus at the moment, work is continuing to look at the future of tourism development across the region.He added: ldquoNewcastle can play its part and we all hope that the Gateway project will not only put the resort on the map, but wider South Down area.

Itrsquos just so unique and dferent to Northern Ireland.ldquoWe have got the Mournes on our doorstep mdash thatrsquos what really got me into enjoying the outdoors. Growing up here, snow is always a novelty, which only comes every now and again. When it does, you try and make the most of it. Once I moved to university in Scotland, snow was much more regular thing and something I enjoyed.ldquoI definitely prefer the cold to the heat I canrsquot handle the heat at all to be honest. If you are somewhere cold, there is always something you can do about it mdash put on an extra layer mdash but in the heat I just struggle.A former pupil of Newcastle Primary School and Down High School in Downpatrick, Kit had been to the South Pole three times before he applied for the job at Port Lockroy. He made the application due to a recommendation from a friend who had already worked there.Kitrsquos academic background mdash he has a Geography degree from the University of Dundee and a Masters degree in Polar and Alpine Change from the University of Sheffield mdash made him a perfect fit for the job.ldquoGoing to Port Lockroy was such a unique opportunity that I jumped at the chance, he said.ldquoWhen we arrived last November, we couldnrsquot get onto the island as there was some sea ice. When we did get on, it was completely covered in snow. As the days went by, more rock was becoming exposed as the snow with the ice was melting. At the end of the season, there really wasnrsquot any snow left on the island.Despite being in what of the great expanses of ice and water on the planet, Kitrsquos world on the island suddenly became very small.ldquoThe island is really only the size of a football pitch and half of that is not accessible, he said.There is a Nissan hut where all the resident staff, and any visiting staff, live and work, a boat shed, which is a historic building, and Bransfield House, named after the Irish Antarctic sailor and explorer, Edward Bransfield. This houses the islandrsquos only shop, post office and museum.Kit explained: ldquoItrsquos quite a simplistic lestyle. There was no social media, no great phone connectivity, basic work emails, no running water or mains electricity, but it was nice to get away from wi-fi and it a quite peaceful le in many ways.ldquoYou are with the rest of the team [resident team of five], day in, day out,   on a tiny island and you need to be able to work and live in this small space with the same people every day. We had no means of getting off the island and had to do all our cooking, cleaning, etc. Therersquos quite a lot of work and maintenance to do and yoursquore always busy so you didnrsquot really have a lot of downtime. We got one day off in every .The high point for Kit was the stunning environment and being surrounded by all kinds of wildle.ldquoThere was loads of wildle, several penguin species such as the Gentoo, Chinstrap and Aediles, he said.ldquoYou can really see the penguins transition throughout the season. At the start they are gathering stones and building nests, by the end of the season, their new chicks are learning to swim. There are all sorts of flying birds like skuas, gulls, Southern Giant petrels, and cormorants. Sometimes you would see all kinds of fish, jelly fish, and ious types of seals and whales.ldquoYou could be washing the dishes and see a humpback whales outside. It was just ridiculous but absolutely wonderful at the same time.Spending Christmas at Port Lockroy was also special to Kit and the team as they had the pleasure of a day off and a chance of seeing the tiny island from a dferent perspective.Kit said: ldquoThere was a cruise ship nearby who kindly offered us a couple of kayaks. We manged to kayak around the island on Christmas day which was a great experience.While hersquos happy to be home with his family mdash dad Colin, mum Janette and brother Nick , who is also back home having left his former job in the Swiss Alps mdash Antarctica still has its hold over Kit.ldquoSimply being there is something that I do miss but the people I was there with were truly wonderful and I got on fantastically well with them, he says. ldquoItrsquos a bit strange being with them for so long and then everyone just goes their separate ways.ldquoEverything is up in the air at the moment but I really would love to go back..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/13th May 2020 Soccer.jpg","title":"Soccer over  ","story":"THE local soccer season has come to an end with unfinished business left on the books.Amateur League and Newcastle League officials have brought their seasons to a juddering halt without promotion and relegation issues being decided.Both leagues made their decisions after consulting with their clubs and although no one goes up and no one goes down, there are clear winners and losers.In the Amateur League the biggest losers are Ballynahinch Olympic, who were bidding to become champions of the Premier Division for the first time.They had an eight-point lead at the top of the table when football was suspended two months ago, although nearest rivals Crumlin Star and East Belfast had plenty of games in hand.Also on the losersrsquo list are Dromara Village, who were lying third in Division A and vying for promotion to the top flight.The biggest winners are Drumaness Mills, who have been spared relegation from the Premier Division, despite being rock bottom without a point to their name.Also saved are Downpatrick FC, who were eight points adrt at the bottom of Division A, and Ballynahinch United, who were at the foot of Division A and odds-on to make the .The only section to have an outcome is in Division C where top of the table Rosemount have been promoted.

Whatever measures the government have put in place ndash and they were very quick to take action and order a lockdown and introduce testing ndash they seem to have worked.Gareth said they were concerned like everyone  about the outbreak, but reckoned that they would put themselves at more risk taking a flight home.He said: ldquoOnce all this happened, we did have the conversation with our families about whether or not we should go home, but to be honest, regarding all the news headlines that we have been reading about home and the rest of the UK, we weighed everything up and it seemed that the situation was much worse in the UK and Ireland.ldquoAs we were able to still continue with our jobs, it seemed staying was the best and safest solution for us.The Australian government, along with the Northern Ireland Assembly and Prime Minister Boris Johnston, this week announced plans to phase down current lockdown restrictions over the coming weeks and months.

He occupied the role of secretary for the first season. Anyone that knew John would say he was first and foremost a football man.Having moved to Newcastle with his we, Josie, John soon became involved in the local football scene and went on to manage Newcastle FC.Many of us remember John playing in the old Summer League in the s for the Castlemac team and his team mates calling him Dixie after the great Everton striker Dixie Dean.A le-long Tottenham Hotspur supporter you would have thought John had a big enough cross to bear before he got involved in starting a new football club in his adopted town.A chance discussion in the summer of  led to John calling a meeting and from it Tollymore United was formed. Very soon the club appointed a manager, Clarence Robinson, and within a matter of weeks club had signed a host of players and started training.With Clarence and Sean Lavery looking after the playing side of things, John and his committee started planning off the field. The clubrsquos first presentations dinner was held in May , in the Central Park, with Northern Ireland legend Derek Dougan the guest of honour. Some of the clubs older members still talk about that night.Another first was the clubrsquos annual Christmas party for children, with John acting as Santa, and such was its popularity that committee members frequently had to rush down to the shops for more selection boxes.The club was now starting to establish itself more off the pitch than on it and the big name guests continued to arrive at the clubrsquos annual awards nights. Manchester United legend Tommy Docherty came in , Denis Law in , Liverpool legend Tommy Smith and Everton and Forest star Duncan Mackenzie in , and so it went on with John in his absolute element with Josie at his side.As the playing side of things began to improve there was nobody prouder than John when, in May , the club beat Ballycam Celtic in a play-off to win the Mourne Observer Cup and gain promotion to the Newcastle leaguersquos Premier Division.The merry-go-round of legends continued with Billy Bremner in  and the biggest name of all, Jack Charlton, arriving in  with John, proud as punch, appearing in the Belfast .In  the club had a fantastic season reaching the final of the Co Antrim Junior Shield only to lose - after conceding a golden goal. John, along with everyone , was gutted, but anyone who had been in Quinnrsquos that night would never have believed the Bears had lost.The following year the club lted the Rathmourne Cup with the second team winning the Purdy Cup and players and supporters lting the roof off the Donard Hotel in the company of Liverpoolrsquos Ian St John. What a night that was with John filling the Rathmourne Cup several times and rumours that Pete Law was required to repair the cup after a raucous night have never been confirmed or denied.Christmas  saw the Bears lting the Bobby Dalzell cup and another crazy awards night took place in the company of Emlyn Hughes.While football played a huge part in Johnrsquos le, he was very much a family man. Josie was a constant by his side at every club dinner and to everyone that knew them they were like a double act mdash terric company and great craic.John suffered a loss when his beloved Josie died, but his love of his grandchildren helped him through that dficult period. He was immensely proud of his daughter, Joanne, and loved nothing better than bringing his grandson, Callum, down to Friday night football.It was fitting that the club was able to hold its th anniversary dinner last year in the Slieve Donard Hotel where John previously worked as bar manager. John took his seat with son-in-law Mark alongside Liverpool legend Bruce Grobbelaar and it was like the good old days with John once more in his element welcoming guests and posing for pictures.It most have taken a huge effort on his part to attend but he would certainly not have missed it for anythingThe Tollymore United club, committee, players, coaches and supporters would like to offer their sincere condolences to Johnrsquos daughter Joanne, son-in-law Mark, grandchildren Callum, Clara, Alana and Harry, his sister Anne, nieces and nephews. John will be sorely missed.

However, over the past few weeks clarityhas been provided by Ministers through a set of guidelines which it is suggested, should be address prior to any formal decision to reopen being made.As such council officers have proposed an initialoperating model to see the borough’s four main sitesreopen.The report states that services at these premises would be availableto the general public on weekdays from am to pm.A Saturday morning slot would,these recommendation are approved by Council, be available only for health care and associated workers.It is also suggested that initiallywaste is limited to black bag and potentially green waste and that only cars are to be permitted.The need to limit the reopening to the four main recycling initially, is, the report claims, “based on a mix of waste product capacity and maximising the use of key staff ”.The report concludes by stating that the implementation of this model is dependant on Council’s abilityto redeploy staff and on the speed at which waste operators could get their service operational, ensuring that the vehicles are road worthy.Given these considerations the report suggests it may take up to five working days from a decision being made to the actual reopening of the four sites.This issue is due to be debated at tonight’s virtual council meeting.The meeting is set to get underway at .pm and members of the public can watch the debate by clicking hereA message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.
