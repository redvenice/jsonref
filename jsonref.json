Attorney General Geoffrey Cox argued that the customs union might be needed to get out – claiming the UK could leave at a later point and a customs union would not be a ‘permanent straitjacket’.Employment rightsUnder Mrs May’s deal, the UK agrees not to row back on existing EU rules on workers’ rights – such as the Working Time Directive which limits working hours – after we leave.But Mr Corbyn wants to go further and is demanding ‘dynamic alignment’ – meaning any future government would agree to accept any employment laws and trade union rules passed by the EU in future, regardless of Parliament’s wishes. So what if the EU agreed to a four-day working week, or passed other regulations which would erode competitiveness?Mrs May claims to be a champion of workers’ rights, so this is an area she could argue is consistent with her approach, even if it limits the UK’s ability to set its own course in future because we are tied to Brussels diktats.Free movementIn theory, the parties are not far apart on free movement – one of the central issues of the referendum campaign.Vast numbers of Labour voters backed Leave because they oppose uncontrolled immigration. This was reflected in Labour’s manifesto which said free movement will end after we leave.For Mrs May, ending free movement is her reddest of red lines.

The renovation of a period house on the University College Dublin (UCD) campus, to be used as new offices for the university president, is set to cost more than €7 million, confidential internal documents show.Renovation of Ardmore House, a historic 19th century villa-style property near the centre of the south Dublin campus, has been in train for the last two years.The refurbished historic building will house new offices for the university president Prof Andrew Deeks, his staff and the UCD Foundation, the university’s fundraising arm.The full cost of the work will come to €7.5 million, the university’s governing authority was told last December, according to confidential meeting minutes seen by The .Prior to the renovation works the building was in use as offices for the university’s commercial services staff, and had several conference rooms for meetings.The university had allocated €900,000 to the project, to allow for initial enabling works. The funding was approved by Prof Deeks directly, and not the university’s finance committee as would usually be the case for capital spending.A note to the governing authority said the budget increase was approved by Prof Deeks “between meetings” of the finance committee, under “delegated authority”.At a December 12th governing authority meeting, approval was sought to increase the project’s budget by €6.4 million to €7.5 million.The university bursar David Kelly “clarified the initial spend” which had been approved was “simply to enable the works,” and the increase to more than €7 million represented the project’s full budget, according to the minutes.Financial reservesFunding for the project is to come out of the university financial reserves, the meeting heard. Concerns were raised over “whether a financial strategy exists for the use of university reserves,” which stood at between €20 million and €25 million.The university was “currently funding a lot of investment that may reduce options” into the future, the minutes detailed. The governing authority agreed that a “lower limit not to be breached except in exceptional circumstances should be considered” for the university’s reserve funding.Ardmore House was originally purchased by UCD in 1957, and had previously been used to house laboratories.“The building requires significant work to preserve and restore it and to bring it into compliance with building regulations,” a UCD spokeswoman said.The works include a “new modern return to replace the current substandard return,” and improvements to the accessibility of the building, she said."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3848395.1554308003!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"nta s liffey cycle plan similar to one dismissed years ago","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tCyclists pass the Four Courts on the Dublin quays. A route for a long-awaited Liffey cycle path has been announced by the National Transport Authority. Photograph: Nick Bradshaw The  A little more than 18 months after the National Transport Authority (NTA) wrested control of the Liffey cycle project from Dublin City Council, with the promise it would be back “shortly” with a preferred route, it has come up with a solution largely the same as the one discounted four years ago.In March 2015, after three years of planning, the council released four potential routes for the 5km cycle path for public consultation. Three of these involved a two-way cycle path on the north of the river, while the fourth proposed paths on the north and south quays. The last option, while it would have been the easiest to implement, lagged far behind the winner in popularity stakes – one in six of the 1,200 respondents chose this option, while the most popular one secured almost half the public vote.For the following two years, until the NTA stepped in and called a halt in September 2017, the council fixated solely on the option that came out on top in the public consultation process, despite repeated indications it was unworkable.The option the public picked in 2015 involved keeping a continuous cycle path along the river and erting traffic to Benburb Street beside the Luas line. The two other northside options involved a boardwalk over the Liffey at Ellis Quay, from the James Joyce Bridge, a narrow part of the route, or a frankly bizarre plan to relocate Croppies Acre Park in front of the National Museum at Collins Barracks, to the riverside.The first problem with the preferred route emerged in August 2015 when the council admitted the ersion would send buses through an apartment block already under construction in Smithfield. Permission for the block had been granted in 2014.Seven months after that, in May 2016, the council put forward an option of putting cyclists on the erted section instead of the traffic, but the following October, the council’s traffic department said it had changed its mind because cyclists did not like the plan.Diverting carsThe next notion involved erting cars from the quays for about 1.5km. They decided to have more public consultation. This found that a new group, the people living in the area through which cars would be erted, did not like the plan. Business organisations were not keen either, because motorists would take longer to get into the city centre.The council’s last option, proposed in May 2017, involved the construction of a boardwalk over the river on Ellis and Arran Quay, which its head of traffic, Brendan O’Brien, admitted at the time was a poor compromise.The NTA has reassessed all the options, and has reverted to the north and south quays route.This, they said, “recognises the need to maintain private car access to the core city centre”, but car parking would be “reassigned” in favour of pedestrians, cyclists and buses. This route will also involve the construction of a new boardwalk for pedestrians on the southside, it will be expensive, and will be subject to assessment of its impact on historic buildings, bridges and mature trees.The NTA’s plan will not please everyone, but the council tried to do that for years, and ended up pleasing no one."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Irish Universities Association warns of intolerable strain on university systemSpeaker of House of Representatives to visit Border and meet Taoiseach later in monthDiscussion of frontier will be on agenda when Angela Merkel visits DublinMultimillion-euro plans approved to renovate 19th-century villa-style property\u0026lsquoInaccurate claims\u0026rsquo about patronage creating fear and uncertainty, says MinisterDecision aimed at driving recruitment of ethnic minoritiesStudy shows students receive \u0026euro100,000 more over lifetime than if they had forgone degreeSome lawyers encouraging false claims, says business bodyUnion\u0026rsquos 40,000 members to be balloted on Labour Court recommendation from MondaySuspect in his 20s being questioned over incident which has been linked to drug feudGovernment says Lebanese authorities failed to grant plane clearance to land in BeirutNew research shows how a child born today could be affected by highly polluted airOfficer was filmed engaging in a sexual act on the bonnet of a Garda car while off dutyRichard Boyd Barrett said whistleblowers approached him about the age of the fleetDepartment of Finance outlines options to reform tax to deal with rises in property pricesJack Lowry (19) tells murder trial accused \u0026lsquoin control most of the time, grumpy some of the time\u0026rsquo"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3848603.1554324916!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"pelosi to lead us delegation to ireland amid push for visa deal","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tUS speaker Nancy Pelosi: renewed efforts to seal a landmark American visa deal for Irish citizens. Photograph: Carlos BarriaReuters A high-powered US congressional delegation is to visit Ireland this month amid renewed efforts to seal a landmark American visa deal for Irish citizens and ongoing Brexit uncertainty. Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the US House of Representatives, Richard Neal, the chairman of the powerful Ways and Means Committee, and others are expected to visit the Border.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar will meet the group in Government Buildings during their visit and will also host a dinner, his spokesman said. The Ways and Means Committee will oversee any future, post-Brexit trade deal between the US and UK and Mr Neal was one of a number of congressional figures who wrote to prime minister Theresa May last month warning about the potential consequences of a hard Border in Ireland.He was also one of the sponsors of a Bill which last year sought to secure access for Irish citizens to the E3 visa scheme, a two-year renewable programme currently only available to Australians. The Bill did not garner sufficient support in the US Senate and is expected to be tabled again in the House of Representatives in the coming weeks.John Deasy, the Government’s envoy to the US Congress, said it was made clear to Mr Varadkar and the Irish delegation during the St Patrick’s Day programme in Washington that work will continue on the E3 plan. ‘St Patrick’s Day meeting’“It was clear from our meetings around St Patrick’s Day that both the Republican and Democratic leadership offices want to continue to pursue the E3 Bill,” the Waterford TD said. The delegation will spend a number of days in Ireland from April 15th and is also expected to visit Northern Ireland. Mr Neal, the co-chairman of the congressional Friends of Ireland caucus, has said he supports a future US-UK trade deal, but warned the British ambassador to Washington and the US trade representative Robert Lighthizer that there could be no return to a hard Border. ‘Good Friday’ agreement“America is a guarantor of the Good Friday agreement, and we don’t want to see any fractures. The idea that there would be any sort of tactical retreat on the border is unacceptable here.”The congressional delegation, or CODEL, will also meet members of the Oireachtas. A recently planned CODEL trip led by Ms Pelosi to Afghanistan, Egypt and Brussels was stopped by Mr Trump during a dispute with congressional Democrats earlier this year.He vetoed the use of military aircraft by Ms Pelosi during a row over funding for a wall on the US-Mexican border. The dispute led to a government shutdown in the US.“CODEL visits occur on an occasional basis, and are an important opportunity to deepen Ireland-US political relations,” Mr Varadkar’s spokesman said.

Photograph: Toby MelvilleReutersMany Border checks and procedures after a no-deal Brexit could be done remotely, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has said, but animal checks can only be done physically by vets.Mr Varadkar said the Government will propose that these checks take place at Northern ports on animals arriving from the UK but that would require the British government to co-operate. He said the collection of tariffs and customs duties could be administered either online or through tax offices.“Animal checks are much more difficult,” Mr Varadkar told the Dáil. “They can only possibly be done physically by vets. It is our view that those checks should take place at ports and that the island of Ireland should be treated as a whole when it comes to sanitary and phytosanitary standards, SPS. That would, however, require the co-operation of the UK. “All we can do at this stage, without knowing what is going to happen, is explore options. We are doing that and it is happening at official rather than Government level.” Remaining evasiveSenior sources hinted that discussions with the European Commission on no-deal preparations were more advanced than the Government has indicated, though the Government is remaining evasive in public.Two sources stressed the need to keep the Border discussions behind closed doors as any suggestion that checks could be avoided entirely would allow Brexiteers to claim that there was no need for the backstop, even though the EU remains completely committed to its retention.However, Mr Varadkar said there were “reasonable questions” about how Ireland would protect the single market.A senior Government source said that if there is a no-deal Brexit there will be “factory checks, port checks, checks as far away from border as possible”. The source also said the European Commission is likely to want to know “within a week” of no-deal what the Irish plan is.Preparations for dealing with the EU frontier on the island of Ireland will be one of the main items on the agenda when German chancellor Angela Merkel visits Dublin today for talks with the Taoiseach. Farmleigh HouseThe meeting will take place at Farmleigh House in the Phoenix Park this afternoon and will be dominated by talks on Brexit.Amid the continuing uncertainty in London, EU leaders must decide whether to grant the UK a second extension to the article 50 process, and if so, on what terms.Mr Varadkar said yesterday that his “general sense across the European Council” is that it is open to granting an extension . “However, we do not want that further extension to be merely a licence for further indecision . . . We need a clear plan.”Dr Merkel is thought to favour granting the British another extension, though EU leaders made clear at the last summit that an extension beyond May 22nd would require the UK to hold elections to the European parliament, something Mrs May is opposed to. Government Buildings stressed that the meeting with Dr Merkel would see other issues discussed apart from the Border. However, she will hear from a panel of people from Border areas who will take part in a round table with the German leader.Government Buildings said the panel would include about 15 people from erse backgrounds, including unionists living in the Republic, business people from both sides of the Border, victims of the Troubles and others.Dublin also expects to brief Dr Merkel on its contacts with the UK government, with which it maintains a constant stream of informal contacts, though these tend to be at ministerial level rather than with Number 10.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

It’s almost like he was ordered to sit there, say nothing and take his medicine, which was surely coming.He didn’t look his chirpy self – more skulk than customary swagger. Like the dog who cocked his leg against the sideboard, trying to feign nonchalance but waiting for the wrath to descend.The Minister of State for Disability Issues (with special responsibility for buoying up Shane Ross at the cabinet table) shot his mouth off in an interview with the Sunday Independent at the weekend, claiming that gardaí are persecuting innocent drivers with breathalysers at the most ridiculous times of the day in a brazen effort to undermine his mentor Ross, the minister who recently updated the driving laws.Apparently the hangover police are deliberately targeting people dropping their children off at school and worshipers on their way to 10am Mass. When the irritated drivers complain, the guards say “don’t blame us, missus, this is all Shane Ross’s fault”.Don’t just take Finian’s word for it. He said TDs from all parties have been telling him about constituents who are up in arms over this form of political policing. In the interview, the Independent Alliance deputy for Dublin Bay North went so far as to suggest that Drew Harris, the Garda Commissioner, should “de-politicise” the force.Winston ChurchtownIt must be very distressing for the Independent Alliance to hear that An Garda Síochána is actively briefing against their leader Ross, aka Winston Churchtown, particularly as Winston is the patron saint of Stepaside Garda Station and when a general election is in the offing. This might explain Finian’s outburst in the Sindo.It was rather baffling. From this column’s embedded position in Dublin Bay North, the bagging of squiffy citizens on the mid-morning grocery run to SuperValu isn’t one of the burning issues of the day. But if –and some rural TDs are very annoyed about aspects of Ross’s legislation – a cohort of voters is not happy, Finian is the man who will step up to the plate and selflessly throw himself in the path of oncoming headlines to support their cause.The suspicion is that his injudicious comments were a clumsy effort to deflect the blowback from Winston’s blow-in-the-bag controversy onto An Garda Síochána, which follows the rules he set out for them in legislation. And also a publicity effort for Finian.At least his remarks provided further proof that the urban-rural ide isn’t all it’s cracked up to be by indignant deputies on the Independent benches cooking up yarns for local papers.It seems what goes for the sozzled daily communicants of South Kerry also applies to the footless school-run moms of Dublin Bay North, all of them besieged by breathalyser-toting guards hell bent on proving it isn’t just the seat belts that are buckled.‘Bizarre’But junior minister McGrath overstepped the swagger with his political policing soundbite. His Government colleagues cried foul. The Minister for Justice expressed outrage. “Bizarre” and “dangerous” was how Charlie Flanagan described the remarks. Jim O’Callaghan, his Fianna Fáil opposite number, called for an apology.Before the day was out, Finian was backtracking faster than a squad car in reverse and apologising to everyone. But he said what\u0026nbsphe said.The affair was building up a nice head of steam. Garda representative bodies went on parade. Victim support groups protested. By Monday, there were mutterings in the media about McGrath being “under pressure”.The return of Dáil business on Tuesday was awaited with interest.In a slow week, Finian’s hide would have been roasted over the coals. In a slow week, the legs of his high chair at the Cabinet table would have been sawn down by now.Thank heavens for Brexit. Filling all the gaps between inadequate public housing policy, the latest hospital trolley crisis and the Government selflessly ignoring the incoming election season by bravely dodging an increase in property tax.Brexit, when the big wigs are too busy to be bothered by a normal Government “crisis”.Brexit saved the day for Finian, sitting for two days in the front row, waiting for someone to stand and call for his high chair on a plate. Sadly, a traumatised Winston Churchtown was too upset on both days to enter the chamber and sit with him for moral support.Nobody said a thing about Finian and the politics of chancing your arm with outrageous statements which you can immediately withdraw like a Westminster Brexiteer after the latest indicative vote.Nothing. On Wednesday, after enduring Leaders’ Questions and the opening questions from main Opposition players in the follow-up session, he scuttled away.So he missed Charlie McConalogue’s intervention. Charlie is Fianna Fáil’s agriculture spokesman.“I thought I might be falling over in anticipation today when I would be asking this question because Minister Finian McGrath was actually in the Chamber. But as usual, he absconded before we could actually get to promised legislation and avoided answering any questions,” he began in an inelegant preamble to a short question about HSE funding for two care centres in Donegal.“Of course, Taoiseach, if any of us, when we look back to our schooldays had been able to turn up and shoot the breeze and fist-pump and high-five our friends and shoot the breeze about a summer trip to North Korea or about a grant to get Granny more money we would all have enjoyed ourselves.”Leo Varadkar furrowed his brow.We all did.“And I think it’s high time that you as Taoiseach actually talk to Minister McGrath and his Independent Alliance colleagues to ensure that they come to the chamber here to account for their actions. Minister McGrath in his interview in the Sunday Independent at the weekend created a fine mess for himself and, indeed, the Government and even he wasn’t brazen enough not to appear in the chamber today but I’ll bet removed himself. But Taoiseach, you might be willing to tolerate this as long as he doesn’t raise any heckles about you using the office of Taoiseach to write fan mail to Kylie Minogue, let alone raise any heckles about the performance of the Government in health or housing.”Charlie then pointed out that the Minister for Disability Issues promised funding to two organisations but it hasn’t materialised.“Can you, since he’s not here Taoiseach, take him up and actually ask that he would follow up on that and also maybe ask if he and his Independent Alliance colleagues would actually attend this chamber to be actually held to account for their performances?”Willie O’Dea piped up from across the floor.“But it was very entertaining.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3848421.1554308706!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"eu s budget liabilities increase and show no signs of stopping","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tIn 2010, a fifth of the EU’s commitments were outstanding – now, a quarter. Photograph: iStockThis week, gentle readers, my pedagogical instincts got the better of me, and I am taking you on a ersion from the usual perils and complexities of Brexit into the arcane world of the EU budget process.And one particularly obscure but important and under-reported aspect of it. \u0026nbspBy the end of 2018, Annemie Turtelboom – a member of the European Court of Auditors – explained, the outstanding liabilities of the European Union amounted to an extraordinary €281 billion.That’s the gap between the commitments or promised payments made by the union in all its programmes, and the amount actually paid out so far.It’s what the EU owes, known here as the reste a liquider (RAL).It’s the equivalent of nearly twice the annual EU budget of €145 billion, or roughly two per cent of everything the EU produces in a year.And its getting bigger. Fast.It doubled from €138.7 billion at the end of 2007 to €281 billion at the end of 2018, and is expected to continue to rise in the future. Up to €314 billion by the end of 2023, according to consistently understated estimates by the European Commission.In 2010, a fifth of the EU’s commitments were outstanding – now, a quarter. And in the time since then member states have on average increased by six months, to 2.7 years, the lag\u0026nbspbetween securing a funding commitment for projects and, after getting them off the ground, securing payment for them.Kicking the canThe EU Court of Auditors is worried.Turtelboom, the Belgian member of the court, predicted at media a briefing in Brussels this week that the RAL will be significantly higher than the commission’s forecasts, and warns that failure to take the issue seriously could soon jeopardise the ability of the EU to fund its programmes.In 2013-15, with cash going out faster than it was coming in because of past commitments needing to be funded, the EU in effect ran out of money and several programmes had their funding put back, with member states having to stump up the shortfall temporarily.Although the budget, which legally must balance each year, got back in kilter the next year, Turtelboom warns that problems could escalate in the next seven-year budget, the 2021-27 Multiannual\u0026nbspFinancial Framework (MFF), which is currently being negotiated by the member states.There is what she describes as a “snowball effect” – commitments and payments from different MFFs overlap. In the early years of an MFF, many payments relate to the commitments of the previous MFF and even to that before it.This overlap ensures that the total RAL can not decrease, as by the time the commitments of an MFF start to be paid, the commitments of the next start to be created.And when, as the commission did recently, it allows member states more time to take up their payments, the overlap simply gets worse and the can is kicked further down the road.The court warns that any further delay in agreement of the new MFF – now certain not to be approved before the European elections and appointment of a new commission – will build up more problems and payment deferrals.Brexit holeThe main challenge lies in the area of structural fund payments, which represent 70 per cent of the RAL (farm payments tend to be settled in the same year they are committed).There are also considerable differences between member states in terms of their ability to plan and use this EU funding, known as absorption rates.If they implement programmes at a roughly comparable rate, their share of the RAL should be proportionate to their share of total commitment appropriations. However, differences arise because member states absorb funding at different rates. For the 2014-2020 MFF, those with the highest absorption rates to the end of 2017 were Finland, Austria and Ireland, double those with the lowest rates, Italy, Croatia, Malta and Spain.These are in part due to differing administrative capabilities, but the court warns that the procedures are too complex and also need to be simplified.Delays in taking up allocated cash can lead to it being withheld by the commission, although “decommitments” represent only some two per cent of payments.In the case of Romania, however, exceptionally, a total of of €1.64 billion was decommitted in the the 2007-2013 period, over a third of all EU-wide decommitments.But the central problem for the EU is that as the RAL soars inexorably, both meeting delayed previous commitments and making new ones will become increasingly difficult.The hole in the budget that Brexit is likely to represent will only make matters worse."},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/02/10/TELEMMGLPICT000051671687_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqO65TkrT7BriBrd3fK6VEg2oOnP5Tf-6BsL77M1adEXU.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"sir philip green staff told wear revealing clothes visited","story":"Sir Philip Green in 2014 with models, left to right, Suki Waterhouse, Kate Moss, Cara Delevingne, Sienna Miller and Naomi Campbell.

Congress for unity amid transatlantic tensions on Wednesday, as he marked 70 years since its founding charter was signed in Washington.Mr Stoltenberg gave a ringing defense of the most successful alliance in history, which has often been derided by Donald Trump, the US president.He used the speech to underscore America’s enduring support for the historic alliance and downplayed disagreements with Mr Trump, saying: Nato has been good for Europe, but Nato has also been good for the United States.He added: We have to be frank. Questions are being asked on both sides of the Atlantic about the strength of our partnership. And, yes, there are differences.The strength of Nato is that despite our differences, we have always been able to unite around our core task: to defend each other, protect each other, and to keep our people safe.Jens Stoltenberg addresses a joint session of Congress on Capitol Hill Members of Congress, who greeted Mr Stoltenberg with repeated cheers and standing ovations, said they viewed his address as a chance to reaffirm the American commitment to the Nato alliance.His address to a joint session of Congress - a rare honour usually reserved for heads of state - is the first by a Nato chief.The invitation from Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic House Speaker, and Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader of the Senate, has been seen as a rebuke of Mr Trump and his repeated bashing of the alliance.An invitation to meet with Mr Trump at the White House was later extended to Mr Stoltenberg.The Trump administration’s relationship with Nato has been fractious, with the president publicly pressuring other partners to pay their fair share in defence spending.During an on-camera meeting in the Oval Office on Tuesday, Mr Stoltenberg appeared at times stony faced as Mr Trump criticised German defence spending and predicted the US would get along with Russia. However he acknowledged that Mr Trump’s demand appeared to be paying off, telling the president: As you just mentioned, after years of cutting defense budgets, Nato allies have now started to invest more. And by the end of next year, they will have added $100 billion more into their defense budgets since you took office.Mr Trump has continued to criticise other allies\u0026#39 spending commitmentsMr Stoltenberg also used his speech Wednesday to warn of the threat a more assertive Russia posed to the alliance, including its violations of the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty.Nato has no intention of deploying land-based nuclear missiles in Europe, Mr Stoltenberg said. But Nato will always take the necessary steps to provide credible and effective deterrence. Mr Stoltenberg’s address is part of a two-day meeting in the US capital for foreign ministers from the 29-member alliance to mark its 70th anniversary.The celebrations are also intended to show a tough, united front on a resurgent Russia but Mr Trump’s rhetoric is not the only chord of disunity among the allies.Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu insisted Wednesday that his country would push ahead with buying Russia’s S-400 missile defense system.The S-400 deal is a done deal and we will not step back from this, he told a think-tank forum in Washington.Mr Cavusoglu went on to say that Turkey still backed Nato on core concerns with Russia and would never recognise Moscow’s 2014 takeover of Crimea from Ukraine.But he said Turkey turned to Russia as it could not buy US Patriot missiles and claimed Mr Trump had said in a phone call that his predecessor Barack Obama had made a mistake not to sell the system to Ankara.It was also announced this week that Nato is to fund a $260 million weapons store at an airbase in central Poland to ward off Kremlin aggression.Mr Stoltenberg said the weapons store, along with improved infrastructure will underpin the increased US presence in Poland.Please review our commenting policyUniversities are overestimating on student recruitment, watchdog warns as bankruptcy fears loomUniversities are failing to protect themselves from cyber-attacks, report warnsAge discrimination is rife in Britain, UCL study finds, as one in four over 50s report being unfairly treatedOne in five teenagers now using \u0026#39Study Tubers\u0026#39 to help them revise for GCSEs, survey showsSeaside towns are being killed off by poor broadband, says Lords reportPoliticians and campaigners should avoid language that could incite disorder over Brexit, says police chiefBrexit latest news: Bill to prevent No-deal passes by one vote after May holds talks with Labour leaderPoor diet causes one in seven deaths in Britain, Lancet finds   Comment: \u0026#39I had no choice but to resign, we are now entrusting the final stages of this negotiation to Jeremy Corbyn\u0026#39Reading FC fan loses SussexRoyal handle after Instagram evict him in favour of Duke and Duchess of SussexComment: By allying with Corbyn, our kamikaze PM has declared war on her own party\u0026#39An unmitigated disaster\u0026#39: The Tory Party at war after Theresa May\u0026#39s Brexit betrayalJeremy Corbyn faces shadow cabinet backlash after resisting calls to push for second Brexit referendumCare home manager defrauded £1m from residents to buy holiday homes in Dubai, Range Rover and Italian spa trip, court hearsHarvey Weinstein’s lawyer facing prosecution for use ofEthiopian air pilots followed Boeing emergency procedures but could not stop plane going down, report saysProtests against Algeria\u0026#39s deposed president continue, with crowds demanding regime changeComment: Like so many Tory members, I can no longer stay in this partyWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/04/03/TELEMMGLPICT000193201290_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"nato chief makes unprecedented pitch us congress need trans","story":"His address to a joint session of Congress is a rare honourNato’s Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg made an unprecedented pitch to Congress for unity amid transatlantic tensions on Wednesday, as he marked 70 years since its founding charter was signed in Washington.Mr Stoltenberg gave a ringing defense of the most successful alliance in history, which has often been derided by Donald Trump, the US president.He used the speech to underscore America’s enduring support for the historic alliance and downplayed disagreements with Mr Trump, saying: Nato has been good for Europe, but Nato has also been good for the United States.He added: We have to be frank.

Mr Stoltenberg’s address is part of a two-day meeting in the US capital for foreign ministers from the 29-member alliance to mark its 70th anniversary.The celebrations are also intended to show a tough, united front on a resurgent Russia but Mr Trump’s rhetoric is not the only chord of disunity among the allies.Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu insisted Wednesday that his country would push ahead with buying Russia’s S-400 missile defense system.The S-400 deal is a done deal and we will not step back from this, he told a think-tank forum in Washington.Mr Cavusoglu went on to say that Turkey still backed Nato on core concerns with Russia and would never recognise Moscow’s 2014 takeover of Crimea from Ukraine.But he said Turkey turned to Russia as it could not buy US Patriot missiles and claimed Mr Trump had said in a phone call that his predecessor Barack Obama had made a mistake not to sell the system to Ankara.It was also announced this week that Nato is to fund a $260 million weapons store at an airbase in central Poland to ward off Kremlin aggression.Mr Stoltenberg said the weapons store, along with improved infrastructure will underpin the increased US presence in Poland.Please review our commenting policyUniversities are overestimating on student recruitment, watchdog warns as bankruptcy fears loomUniversities are failing to protect themselves from cyber-attacks, report warnsAge discrimination is rife in Britain, UCL study finds, as one in four over 50s report being unfairly treatedOne in five teenagers now using \u0026#39Study Tubers\u0026#39 to help them revise for GCSEs, survey showsSeaside towns are being killed off by poor broadband, says Lords reportPoliticians and campaigners should avoid language that could incite disorder over Brexit, says police chiefBrexit latest news: Bill to prevent No-deal passes by one vote after May holds talks with Labour leaderPoor diet causes one in seven deaths in Britain, Lancet finds   Comment: \u0026#39I had no choice but to resign, we are now entrusting the final stages of this negotiation to Jeremy Corbyn\u0026#39Reading FC fan loses SussexRoyal handle after Instagram evict him in favour of Duke and Duchess of SussexComment: By allying with Corbyn, our kamikaze PM has declared war on her own party\u0026#39An unmitigated disaster\u0026#39: The Tory Party at war after Theresa May\u0026#39s Brexit betrayalJeremy Corbyn faces shadow cabinet backlash after resisting calls to push for second Brexit referendumCare home manager defrauded £1m from residents to buy holiday homes in Dubai, Range Rover and Italian spa trip, court hearsHarvey Weinstein’s lawyer facing prosecution for use ofEthiopian air pilots followed Boeing emergency procedures but could not stop plane going down, report saysProtests against Algeria\u0026#39s deposed president continue, with crowds demanding regime changeComment: Like so many Tory members, I can no longer stay in this partyWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/04/03/TELEMMGLPICT000011323598_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq4mvOqcH8RNHsTxP15XLyX1Vse9JsN00kzbUr3IXHaGo.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"neil armstrong buzz aldrin planted british flag moon","story":"Buzz Aldrin poses beside the US flag on July 20 1969Arts and Entertainment EditorA British engineer has claimed that a Union Flag was planted on the moon by an unwitting Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin.Keith Wright was an engineer at the Kennedy Space Centre, working on experiments for the 1969 Apollo mission.Fifty years on, he has disclosed that he secretly ensured a little piece of Britishness made it to the moon, because he “wanted to give Brits a bit of credit”.Speaking to The One Show on BBC One, Mr Wright said: “We were working on the experiments that the astronauts were going to put on the lunar surface. We had Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin come to our facility for a run-through.“There were two brackets on the experiment which held the solar panels folded while travelling to the moon. We got a ball pen and signed our names.. I signed my name and I thought, well, I’ll put ‘UK’. Then I thought, I’ll draw a little Union Flag.“So we had a little Union Flag sketched onto there, installed it on the experiment package and it went to the moon.”Mr Wright said the US flag was planted first, before the astronauts laid down the solar panels.The Nottingham-born engineer worked in the UK for de Havilland before winning a coveted job on the Apollo space missions and moving with his young family to the US.Of his meeting with Armstrong and Aldrin on the eve of the mission, he said: “Neil was very relaxed and quite jokey. We were concentrating so hard on doing our job, and seeing that they could do the job properly, it almost seemed normal. But, thinking about it afterwards, I did get their signatures.”The planting of the US flag was back in the headlines last year when it was omitted from the Ryan Gosling film, First Man. Although the flag was seen at a distance as the men returned to Earth, there were no scenes of it being planted.The omission led to a major row, with Republica senator Marco Rubio branding it “total lunacy” and Aldrin tweeting a picture of himself on the moon alongside the words “proud to be an American”.Universities are overestimating on student recruitment, watchdog warns as bankruptcy fears loomUniversities are failing to protect themselves from cyber-attacks, report warnsAge discrimination is rife in Britain, UCL study finds, as one in four over 50s report being unfairly treatedOne in five teenagers now using \u0026#39Study Tubers\u0026#39 to help them revise for GCSEs, survey showsSeaside towns are being killed off by poor broadband, says Lords reportPoliticians and campaigners should avoid language that could incite disorder over Brexit, says police chiefBrexit latest news: Bill to prevent No-deal passes by one vote after May holds talks with Labour leaderPoor diet causes one in seven deaths in Britain, Lancet finds   Comment: \u0026#39I had no choice but to resign, we are now entrusting the final stages of this negotiation to Jeremy Corbyn\u0026#39Reading FC fan loses SussexRoyal handle after Instagram evict him in favour of Duke and Duchess of SussexComment: By allying with Corbyn, our kamikaze PM has declared war on her own party\u0026#39An unmitigated disaster\u0026#39: The Tory Party at war after Theresa May\u0026#39s Brexit betrayalNato chief makes unprecedented pitch to US Congress on need for trans-Atlantic unityJeremy Corbyn faces shadow cabinet backlash after resisting calls to push for second Brexit referendumCare home manager defrauded £1m from residents to buy holiday homes in Dubai, Range Rover and Italian spa trip, court hearsHarvey Weinstein’s lawyer facing prosecution for use ofEthiopian air pilots followed Boeing emergency procedures but could not stop plane going down, report saysProtests against Algeria\u0026#39s deposed president continue, with crowds demanding regime changeWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/04/03/TELEMMGLPICT000192044750_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqKkzUGe8q7_A35DWV6BPUcb-uLBykIJ5ZRR_c-flrW4M.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"one five teenagers now using study tubers help revise gcses","story":"Almost a third of children say that the videos give them social support and reassuranceOne in five teenagers are now using “Study Tubers” to help them revise for their GCSEs, a survey has found.Almost a third of children (29 per cent) say that the videos give them social support and reassurance while the worked, according to a poll commissioned by the National Citizenship Service (NCS).These increasingly popular YouTube videos - some of which have been watched millions of times - show teenagers studying for hours on end, while sharing tips and advice about how to revise.  Ruby, whose channel is called Ruby Granger named after her hero Hermione Granger from Harry Potter, has had over 30.8 million views.Among her videos are speeded-up clips of herself revising for her A-levels in English, Philosophy and Chemistry for 14 and 15 hours a day. Meanwhile, Jade Bowler’s YouTube channel Unjaded Jade has had more than 25.8 million views - one of her posts shows her crying as she tells how she was rejected from Oxford University - and Eve Bennett from Revision with Eve, has had 13.9 million views.When parents of GCSE students were asked about Study Tubers, 19 per cent said that their children usually revise while watching the videos.But four fifths (84 per cent) of parents said they had never heard of Study Tubers, and just over half said they sounded like an excuse not to revise.Seaside towns are being killed off by poor broadband, says Lords reportUniversities are failing to protect themselves from cyber-attacks, report warnsUniversities are overestimating on student recruitment, watchdog warns as bankruptcy fears loomAge discrimination is rife in Britain, UCL study finds, as one in four over 50s report being unfairly treatedPoliticians and campaigners should avoid language that could incite disorder over Brexit, says police chiefBrexit latest news: Bill to prevent No-deal passes by one vote after May holds talks with Labour leaderPoor diet causes one in seven deaths in Britain, Lancet finds   Comment: \u0026#39I had no choice but to resign, we are now entrusting the final stages of this negotiation to Jeremy Corbyn\u0026#39Reading FC fan loses SussexRoyal handle after Instagram evict him in favour of Duke and Duchess of SussexComment: By allying with Corbyn, our kamikaze PM has declared war on her own party\u0026#39An unmitigated disaster\u0026#39: The Tory Party at war after Theresa May\u0026#39s Brexit betrayalNato chief makes unprecedented pitch to US Congress on need for trans-Atlantic unityJeremy Corbyn faces shadow cabinet backlash after resisting calls to push for second Brexit referendumCare home manager defrauded £1m from residents to buy holiday homes in Dubai, Range Rover and Italian spa trip, court hearsHarvey Weinstein’s lawyer facing prosecution for use ofEthiopian air pilots followed Boeing emergency procedures but could not stop plane going down, report saysProtests against Algeria\u0026#39s deposed president continue, with crowds demanding regime changeComment: Like so many Tory members, I can no longer stay in this partyWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures day 3 april 2019","story":"Chefs attend the theatre Vincenzo Bellini Cibo Nostrum 2019 on day 2 of the great feast of Italian cuisine, celebrating the culture of food and wine in Catania, Italy. Seaside towns are being killed off by poor broadband, says Lords reportUniversities are failing to protect themselves from cyber-attacks, report warnsUniversities are overestimating on student recruitment, watchdog warns as bankruptcy fears loomOne in five teenagers now using \u0026#39Study Tubers\u0026#39 to help them revise for GCSEs, survey showsAge discrimination is rife in Britain, UCL study finds, as one in four over 50s report being unfairly treatedPoliticians and campaigners should avoid language that could incite disorder over Brexit, says police chiefBrexit latest news: Bill to prevent No-deal passes by one vote after May holds talks with Labour leaderPoor diet causes one in seven deaths in Britain, Lancet finds   Comment: \u0026#39I had no choice but to resign, we are now entrusting the final stages of this negotiation to Jeremy Corbyn\u0026#39Reading FC fan loses SussexRoyal handle after Instagram evict him in favour of Duke and Duchess of SussexComment: By allying with Corbyn, our kamikaze PM has declared war on her own party\u0026#39An unmitigated disaster\u0026#39: The Tory Party at war after Theresa May\u0026#39s Brexit betrayalNato chief makes unprecedented pitch to US Congress on need for trans-Atlantic unityJeremy Corbyn faces shadow cabinet backlash after resisting calls to push for second Brexit referendumCare home manager defrauded £1m from residents to buy holiday homes in Dubai, Range Rover and Italian spa trip, court hearsHarvey Weinstein’s lawyer facing prosecution for use ofEthiopian air pilots followed Boeing emergency procedures but could not stop plane going down, report saysProtests against Algeria\u0026#39s deposed president continue, with crowds demanding regime changeWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/04/03/22/gettyimages-951902272.jpg","title":"abba new music release date latest 2019 bjorn ulvaeus","story":"IM Subscribe \u0026nbsp registerIM SubscribeCreated with Sketch.IM Join us?

Yet few are likely to have as much inspiration to draw on as India-born, Zimbabwe-raised and now Peckham-based artist Rina Mushonga.On Deerhunter’s eighth album, frontman Bradford Cox takes on the role of war poet, documenting the things he observes with a cool matter-of-factness, and heart-wrenching detail. Death is everywhere on Why Hasn’t Everything Already Disappeared?, as much as others may refuse to see it.After a period of tumult, Sharon Van Etten’s fifth album is a reinvention. But beneath its hazy synths and electronics are songs of endurance and inner peace, of settling after a flurry of activity. 421 Bring Me the Horizon  – AmoBMTH frontman Oli Sykes wants to assert the fragility of the boundary between love and hate. Amo is a way of exploring that, even down to the title itself.521 Nina Nesbitt – The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will ChangeNesbitt is back with her second LP, switching to a brand of soul and R\u0026ampB-fused pop that feels bang on time, and suits her far better. The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will Change has slick, polished production from Fraser T Smith (Adele), Lostboy (Anne-Marie), Jordan Riley (Zara Larsson), and Nesbitt herself.This self-titled record, a loose but beautifully crafted collection of folk-rock songs, explores the kinds of anxieties intrinsic to the modern age – the longing to be at once noticed and invisible the paralysing effects of limitless information, and the desire to do good versus the desire to be seen doing good.The album is packed with personal confessions for the fans – “Arianators” – to pick over. It lacks a centrepiece to match the arresting depth and space of Sweetener’s “God Is A Woman”, but Grande handles its shifting moods and cast of producers (including pop machines Max Martin and Tommy Brown) with engaging class and momentum. One minute you’re skanking along to the party brass of “Bloodline” the next floating into the semi-detached, heartbreak of “Ghostin’”, which appears to address Grande’s guilt at being with Davidson while pining for Miller. She sings of the late rapper as a “wingless angel” with featherlight high notes that will drop the sternest jaw. (Helen Brown)The perma-brilliant James Blake has flooded his fourth album – Assume Form – with euphoric sepia soul and loved-up doo-wop. His trademark intelligence, honesty and pin-drop production remain intact. But the detached chorister vocals of a decade in which he battled depression have thawed to reveal a millennial Sam Cooke crooning: “Can’t believe the way we flow, way we flow, way we flow...”While he recognises his roots and includes plenty of nods to grime, AJ Tracey\u0027s magpie’s eye for a good melody or hook extends far beyond that. With the help of stellar producers like Cadenza (Kiko Bun), Swifta Beater (Kano, Giggs), and Nyge (Section Boyz, Yxng Bane), Tracey incorporates electronic music, rock, garage and even country on his most cohesive work to date.The album title of the year gives us an image of Brexit Britain trashed by Old Etonians David Cameron, Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg, but the fifth studio work from the punk duo has more than social commentary to offer. There’s some of that, as vocalist Jason Williamson skewers documentary-makers who take advantage of the poor in “Kebab Spider” – “the skint get used in loo roll shoes” – but elsewhere this is a record that expands the idea of what Sleaford Mods could be.“Do you still have that photograph? Would you use it to hurt me?” asks Australian indie rocker Julia Jacklin, against the menacing throb of “Body”. The tension is stormy: imagine a mid-period Fleetwood Mac song, covered by Cat Power. It’s a masterclass in narrative songwriting.With praise from Kendrick Lamar, five EPs released by the time she was 21, tours with Lauryn Hill, collaborations with Gorillaz and two critically praised albums – including 2017’s excellent concept album Stillness in Wonderland – fans and critics alike wondered what else Little Simz could do to find the kind of mainstream success enjoyed by so many of her male peers.1321 Solange – When I Get HomeSolange Knowles has never been coy about the intent behind her music. Beautiful arrangements and seamless production notwithstanding, you get the sense, each time she drop a project, that it serves a distinct, zeitgeist-shifting purpose.1421 Foals – Everything Not Saved Will be Lost (Part 1)FoalsMerging their asymmetrical early math pop with the deep space atmospherics of Total Life Forever and Holy Fire, plus added innovations – ambient rainforest throbs on “Moonlight”, deadpan EDM on “In Degrees”, Afro-glitch Radiohead on “Café D’Athens” – they’ve created an inspired album of scorched earth new music that, in all likelihood, will only really be challenged for album of the year by Part 2. (Mark Beaumont)Tracks are at once astute and deeply personal in how they capture vignettes of everyday life and spin them into important lessons. “Black”, the most recent single from the record, considers what that word means to different people around the world, as well as to Dave. “Voices” has him singing over an old-school garage beat, fighting off personal demons.At her best, Sigrid throws out precision-tooled high notes like icicle javelins into vast, blue Scandi-produced skies. Then she growls like an Icelandic volcano preparing to disrupt western civilisation until we sort ourselves out.1721 Karen O and Danger Mouse – Lux PrimaLux Prima was born just over a decade ago from a drunken phone call from Karen O to Danger Mouse – real name Brian Joseph Burton – during which the pair vowed they would work on something together. It wasn’t until after O had given birth to her son, though, that recording finally began, and there is a beatific sense of contentment on songs like “Drown”, with its Kamasi Washington-like choirs and stately horns.This is an ambitious creation, meticulously crafted and assembled. For a start, the range of guest performers is a cornucopia of contemporary soul and hip-hop collaborators: vocalists Moses Sumney, Roots Manuva, Heidi Vogel, Grey Reverend and Tawiah strings player Miguel Atwood-Ferguson, and keyboardist Dennis Hamm – both of whom have worked with Flying Lotus and Thundercat.Rose – who found fame in the UK’s indie-folk scene as an unofficial member of Bombay Bicycle Club in 2010, only to walk away amid the band’s growing hype – is darkly compelling on No Words Left. Assisted by producer Tim Bidwell, who worked on Rose’s last record Something’s Changing, she sounds braver than she ever has before. There are moments that recall her Communion labelmate Ben Howard, on his latest album, Noonday Dream, and others that nod to the quiet stoicism of Joni Mitchell and Neil Young. (Roisin O\u0027Connor)The record is loosely conceptual insomuch as it’s punctuated with mock adverts for “WWAY HEALTH, our 247 care programme”. But don’t be put off: Miss Universe is a brilliant collection of songs, an expansive melange of indie, jazz, pop and trip-hop that flits between a lo-fi sparseness and something The Strokes would play. Yanya – who is of Turkish-Irish-Bajan heritage – grew up in London on a mix of Pixies, Nina Simone, The Libertines and Amy Winehouse, and this unlikely combination is certainly reflected in the sound. (Patrick Smith)2121 Jenny Lewis – On the LineHere, Lewis does what she does best: adds the glossy sparkle of Hollywood and a sunny Californian sheen to melancholy and nostalgia, with her most luxuriantly orchestrated album yet. Even when she’s singing, “I’ve wasted my youth”, it’s in that sweet voice, with carefree “doo doo doo doo doo doos”, and at a pace that’s so upbeat that it masks the sentiment. It’s a bittersweet mourning of her past. (Elisa Bray)It’s not uncommon for an artist to be influenced by the place they grew up in.

There are even prototype electronic tattoos that can sense our vital signs. But by scaling down this technology, we could go further by implanting or injecting tiny sensors inside our bodies. This would capture much more detailed information with less hassle to the patient, enabling doctors to personalise their treatment.The possibilities are endless, ranging from monitoring inflammation and post-surgery recovery to more exotic applications whereby electronic devices actually interfere with our body\u0027s signals for controlling organ function. Although these technologies might sound like a thing of the far future, multi-billion healthcare firms such as GlaxoSmithKline are already working on ways to develop so-called electroceuticals.These sensors rely on newly-invented nanomaterials and manufacturing techniques to make them smaller, more complex and more energy efficient. For example, sensors with very fine features can now be printed in large quantities on flexible rolls of plastic at low cost. This opens up the possibility of placing sensors at lots of points over critical infrastructure to constantly check that everything is running correctly. Bridges, aircraft and even nuclear power plants could benefit.If cracks do appear then nanotechnology could play a further role. Changing the structure of materials at the nanoscale can give them some amazing properties – by giving them a texture that repels water, for example. In the future, nanotechnology coatings or additives will even have the potential to allow materials to heal when damaged or worn. For example, dispersing nanoparticles throughout a material means that they can migrate to fill in any cracks that appear. This could produce self-healing materials for everything from aircraft cockpits to microelectronics, preventing small fractures from turning into large, more problematic cracks.All these sensors will produce more information than we\u0027ve ever had to deal with before – so we\u0027ll need the technology to process it and spot the patterns that will alert us to problems. The same will be true if we want to use the big data from traffic sensors to help manage congestion and prevent accidents, or prevent crime by using statistics to more effectively allocate police resources.Here, nanotechnology is helping to create ultra-dense memory that will allow us to store this wealth of data. But it\u0027s also providing the inspiration for ultra-efficient algorithms for processing, encrypting and communicating data without compromising its reliability. Nature has several examples of big-data processes efficiently being performed in real-time by tiny structures, such as the parts of the eye and ear that turn external signals into information for the brain.The fight against climate change means we need new ways to generate and use electricity, and nanotechnology is already playing a role. It has helped create batteries that can store more energy for electric cars and has enabled solar panels to convert more sunlight into electricity.The common trick in both applications is to use nanotexturing or nanomaterials (for example nanowires or carbon nanotubes) that turn a flat surface into a three-dimensional one with a much greater surface area. This means that there is more space for the reactions that enable energy storage or generation to take place, so the devices operate more efficiently.In the future, nanotechnology could also enable objects to harvest energy from their environment. New nano-materials and concepts are currently being developed that show potential for producing energy from movement, light, variations in temperature, glucose and other sources with high conversion efficiency.15 Doctors inside your bodyWearable fitness technology means we can monitor our health by strapping gadgets to ourselves.

The underlying picture of demand is even worse than the headline numbers suggest.”Survey respondents noted that corporate clients had opted to delay spending decisions in response to the impasse in Westminster, with MPs unable to break the Brexit deadlock nearly three years after the referendum.There were also reports that Brexit concerns and worries about the economic outlook had held back household spending.New order inflows deteriorated in each of the past three months, the longest sequence of falling sales volumes since the first half of 2009.Mr Williamson added: “Service sector order books have contracted at the steepest rate since the height of the global financial crisis in 2009 so far this year, with companies reporting that Brexit uncertainty has dampened demand and led to cancelled or deferred spending, exacerbating a headwind from slower global economic growth.”The dire data follows an equally poor showing from Britain\u0027s construction sector, which recorded its first back-to-back contraction since 2016 in March as Brexit anxiety continues to weigh on firms as they delay building projects.Figures from the manufacturing sector on Monday also showed that Brexit stockpiling helped fuel a surge in output last month as firms sought to avoid being caught short.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This represented a 1,300 per cent increase from its price at the start of the yearIt marked\u0026nbspits highest point since its value tumbled from above $750m\u0026nbsplast\u0026nbspOctober.\u0026nbspAt its peak in late 2017, Dogecoin was one of the world\u0027s most valuable cryptocurrencies with a market cap close to $2bn.The cryptocurrency was originally conceived as a joke by Australian technologist Jackson Palmer, who revealed in 2014 that he never intended it to be taken seriously as an alternative form of currency.\u0026nbspIt was inspired by the Shiba Inu dog\u0026nbspfrom the doge meme that was popular in the early 2010\u0027s and soon gained a cult following among fans of the meme who helped use it to fund the Jamaican bobsled team at the 2014 Winter Olympics.Mr Musk\u0027s enthusiasm for the cryptocurrency came after the official Twitter account for dogecoin posted an online poll asking who should be the CEO.We have listened to your concerns, the tweet stated. We have decided that dogecoin does need a CEO. Someone who can lead us into the future while maintaining the core values if what we are.Candidates listed in the poll included notable cryptocurrency figures Vitalik Buterin and Charlier Lee but Mr Musk came top with almost half of the votes.In response to the poll, Mr Musk tweeted: Dogecoin might be my fav cryptocurrency. It\u0027s pretty cool.He subsequently changed his Twitter bio to Former CEO of dogecoin.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Whilst most viewers were preoccupied with the ickiness of this revelation being juxtaposed against the image of him rolling around in bed with Daenerys (now revealed to be his aunt), the fact is that he now has the most legitimate claim to the Iron Throne. Certainly he has a better claim than his dad’s sister, to whom he’s just sworn fealty (not to mention done things that would make the Pitcairn Islanders blush). Jon’s biggest issue is that he still doesn’t know how hot his stock is, and the only two characters who do are his pal Sam Tarly and his irritating younger brother Bran. Can such an undynamic duo get this crucial information to Jon before it’s too late?Up until the end of the last series (and provided you hadn’t been reading any fan theories) it seemed like Daenerys was fated to end up ruling the Seven Kingdoms. George R. R. Martin’s series is, after all, called A Song of Ice and Fire, and where the chilly element of that could apply equally to Jon Snow or the horde of frigid zombies, it’s long been apparent that Dany brings the titular heat. She spent a frustrating amount of time in Essos, honing her military and governance skills (both of which seem to rely on oppressive use of dragon fire) and arrived in Westeros on a seemingly unstoppable quest for the crown. Her claim has been weakened by the discovery that her nephew Jon is the true Targaryen heir, but it’s also quite clear that she wears the dragon-riding slacks in their relationship.Cersei is the only villain to survive from episode one to the final season, so credit to her for that. She has already lost her more pragmatic siblings – Tyrion and Jaime – to the anti-apocalypse cause, and her plan for the endgame seems to involve double-crossing the alliance heading to deal with the zombie threat. It simply cannot end well for her, because any damage wrought against the Targaryens will only pave the way for the Night King’s army, and he’s not a man(?) who looks like he’d care much about the Lannisters’ credit rating. Truly the Cnut of the series, she’s already on borrowed time.The survival of the younger Stark children makes you feel all the more sorry for poor Rickon (why oh why didn’t he zigzag?!), who suffered the indignity of never even getting to be a real character before he was dispatched. The reality is that none of the Starks really fancy taking the crown and moving to King’s Landing. They love the North, where you get to wear long fur coats and growl ominous warnings at soft southerners. The best case scenario for Bran is that he gets to live in a castle, not a tree (or the Night King’s body, see fan theories for further details), and, for Sansa, that bizarrely coveted wardenship of the North looks increasingly like it has her name on it. Arya is something of an agent of chaos, and it’s hard to know what, undoubtedly pivotal, role she will yet play, but – and do prove me wrong Arya – it’s hard to see her chatting finance with the Small Council.Could the Night King be the strong leader that Westeros so desperately needs? It would be fitting for a series that has so willingly taken beloved characters and decapitated themstabbed them in the heartslit their throat, to go out with the nihilistic bang of the Night King, astride undead Viserion, perched on the Red Keep. He’s the man to watch if the showrunners decide that they want to go full metaphor.There are some characters – Varys, Jorah, Theon and Yara Greyjoy – who will probably play a significant role in the climactic drama, but without any chance of ending up in the hot seat. A better bet might be Gendry, aka the hot ironmonger from Skins, who has the strongest Baratheon claim to the throne. Other major characters like Brienne, Bronn, Davos and Grey Worm will be knocking about (provided they’re given the screentime in this truncated series) but are subjects, not rulers. Euron Greyjoy has to meet a sticky end at some point, because he’s fully evil and also very misjudged as a character. My outside bet, for the connoisseurs, is Beric Dondarrion, the priest of the Lord of Light, who has seemingly survived the breach of the wall at Eastwatch and whose ability to both conjure fire and come back from the dead might be quite useful against the ice zombies.Unless they pull off in a wild, unexpected direction – and full credit if they do – it’s going to be Jon and Dany ruling together, and the final shot of the series will, mark my words, be a slow track backwards through the throne room, showing the newly married couple, side-by-side, in a slightly less uncomfortable pair of matching thrones.

That collapse, unimpeded by Margaret Thatcher and the Conservative government, was devastating even by the standards of the time because of Birmingham’s over-dependence on the automobile industry.“This city lost more jobs in less than 10 years than any other part of the UK, including the whole of Scotland and Wales combined,” says Sir Albert Bore, a leading figure on Birmingham City Council. No less than 200,000 positions disappeared and unemployment averaged 25 per cent, climbing to 50 per cent in the worst-hit areas.“We realised the government was not going to help,” he adds, recalling that the city did not have at that time a single adequate hotel or restaurant in which to house and feed the potential investors it was hoping to attract.The refusal of the British state to provide funds as a catalyst for revival forced the council to look to Brussels for help in its renaissance.“The EU made it happen because theirs was the first big investment,” Bore says. Over the following years, the city received huge amounts of funding from the EU.Created with Sketch.Both sides of Brexit: Remain and Leave through a lens Show all 29Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Remain protesters with pro-EU banners sit next to a Leave campaigner in Trafalgar square during the People’s Vote march in London.

The city had boasted in the 19th century of being “the city of a thousand trades”, between them supplying the world with whatever merchandise it wanted. But many of these goods were made by a low- or semi-skilled workforce and a technology that\u0026nbspwas becoming obsolete. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspFormer chair of Vote Leave refuses to apologise for breaking lawThe problems the city wrestled with in the 1980s were the same seen in other urban centres in western Europe and the US, except that in Birmingham’s case the difficulties were worse because of its vast and vulnerable vehicle-making sector. The solutions adopted resembled those elsewhere too: reviving the city centre, attracting high-skilled industries and financial services, creating a highly skilled workforce with an emphasis on expanding higher education.The 1.1 million population today is younger than any similar city in Europe, largely because there are 80,000 students from the UK and abroad studying at high-prestige institutions such as Aston University, Birmingham City University and Birmingham University, the latter alone employing 10,000 people.Financial institutions have grown here, such as\u0026nbspDeutsche Bank, which once had only a back office in the city but\u0026nbspnow has a trading floor and employs 1,500 people. New foreign-owned automotive industries like Jaguar Land Rover have moved in or been revived. Against the odds, Birmingham pressed all the right buttons to move towards a high-skilled, high-technology economy operating across the boundaries of many nation states.Over the past year there have been investment decisions taken by a range of industries that we do not know about, but we will see their impact in five or six yearsPeople who masterminded the transition, however, now wonder if they are about to see Birmingham’s economy once again capsized, this time by the UK’s decision to leave the European Union. Among those most affected by Brexit are those enterprises and institutions which have been the wellsprings of Birmingham’s modern prosperity, uneven though the distributed of its benefits have been.Success stories that appeared assured are now in question. Will banks like Deutsche Bank and HSBC still be attracted to the same degree as before to Birmingham, or to any other city in the UK for that matter, if their ability to do business with the rest of the EU is curtailed or in doubt? Why should vehicle manufacturers, originally drawn to Britain as a platform to reach 500 million consumers in the EU, find post-Brexit Britain attractive? Will foreign staff and students at the universities be deterred by difficulties over visas, residency, qualifications and, in the case of researchers, a reduction in EU funding?Bore, credited by many with overseeing the renaissance of the city, believes that the Brexit effect will come in two stages. The short-term one will be (or already is) visible, affecting “just-in-time” deliveries of components, the financial services and all those trading with the EU. But what worries him most is the strategic long-term decisions now being taken by international companies regarding Birmingham that nobody knows about except the decision makers. He warns that “over the past year there have been investment decisions taken by a range of industries that we do not know about, but we will see their impact in five or six years”.Created with Sketch.

Eddy Moreton, a musician who owns a pub with a music venue in the town of Stourbridge west of Birmingham, says that over the past 15\u0026nbspyears he has travelled to cities and towns in Germany, Belgium, Netherlands and Denmark. He believes that leaving the EU will affect small businesses like his much more than big firms“I used to be able to get in the van and drive to Denmark, earn money, drive back – simple, but I won’t be able to do that anymore and that’s a great loss,” he says.Supporters of Remain in Birmingham are outraged by what they see as the misinformation, ignorance and xenophobia that typified the EU referendum campaign everywhere. \u0026nbspBrexit or no Brexit, for many in south Wales life offers few prospectsJon Bloomfield, a historian and urban policy specialist, is the author of Our City: Migrants and the Making of Modern Birmingham, a highly informed and eloquent account of life in a modern British city during a period of globalisation, austerity and mass migration.\u0026nbspAt its core are interviews with 50 migrants, illustrating the ersity of the immigrant communities in Birmingham, but Bloomfield also paints a picture of a city that responded energetically and successfully to the multiple challenges posed by radical economic change.Bloomfield was horrified by the way the Brexit campaign legitimised xenophobia and racism. He relates how he tried and failed to get Gisela Stuart, the Leave-supporting Labour MP for Birmingham Edgbaston, herself born and raised in Germany, to condemn Boris Johnson for demonising EU political leaders as the heirs of Hitler and Napoleon in trying to create a European superstate.I know someone who has moved into Northfield from Brixton and they couldn’t get over how white it was, as they had heard how Birmingham is this erse place -\u0026nbspbut if you go to the outer city it is just not there.“My mind almost explodes with rage,” says Bore when he hears the EU being scapegoated for miseries caused by domestically generated economic policies.“People feel left behind but that’s austerity for you: it drives despair, it drives unemployment. People have to have somebody to blame and they’ve blamed Europe,” he goes on.Local government in Birmingham is hampered in doing anything to alleviate the deprivation caused by austerity because its budget has been slashed by £750m\u0026nbspsince 2010 thanks to central government cuts. \u0026nbspMisinformation and austerity explain much, but they cannot explain everything when it comes to analysing why, despite many signs of economic success, Birmingham voted in the 2016 referendum to leave the EU by the slim margin of 50.4 per cent to 49.6. In the west midlands as a whole, the Leave majority was much higher at 59.3 per cent.Remain voters were aghast and baffled by the outcome, often reacting with derisive cliches about “turkeys voting for Christmas”, given that the economic arguments for staying in the EU seemed to them so overwhelming. The simple answer to this is that the turkeys in question never felt that they had much of a Christmas to celebrate at any time and were never likely to offer endorsement at the ballot box to anybody in charge of the festivities.LGBT+ relationships have put Birmingham in the spotlight (PA)The beneficiaries of Birmingham’s well-advertised economic renaissance included only a proportion of its inhabitants, in sharp contrast to the impression given by its bustling multiethnic city centre. Alex Aitken, a 25-year-old care worker and a Labour councillor representing a ward in the Northfield constituency, says that the city’s reputation for ethnic and social ersity is deceptive.“I know someone who has moved into Northfield from Brixton,” he says, “and they couldn’t get over how white it was, as they had heard how Birmingham is this erse place with multiple backgrounds, but if you go to the outer city it is just not there.”Tory isions deepen over Brexit amid warnings of a ‘national crisis’Aitkin says that districts in these areas are markedly different from inner-city Birmingham and much more like the northeast of England where there are “those old-school Labour seats that voted Leave”.The ision – essentially between those who benefited from globalisation and those who did not – is the same all over England and Wales. A breakdown of the referendum vote ward by ward in Birmingham shows that three decisive factors are educational qualifications, age and ethnicity. These explain more than\u0026nbsp90 per cent of the variation in voting and were a more accurate determinant of voting choice than poverty and social class. The lower the educational level, the higher the number of people voting Leave vote and vice versa. \u0026nbspMartin Rosenbaum, in a study of the ethnic dimension of the Birmingham vote, writes that Shard End ward, which is 82 per cent white, “had the highest Leave vote, at 76 per cent, and the lowest proportion of graduates, at 9 per cent. In contrast, Moseley and King’s Heath ward had the lowest Leave share, at 23 per cent, and consists of 46 percent graduates.” Only in the five wards where migrants are the majority did the less well educated and older voters chose Remain.Leave voters told pollsters that the priority issues for them were “immigration” and “sovereignty”, in contrast to Remainers who plumped for “the economy”.AFPGetty)In Stourbridge, a town which voted Leave by 68 per cent, Eddy Moreton says that many there are “independent-minded people who work for themselves and see the world through a conservative prism of self-reliance”. He describes the town as being a very white place with few immigrants where xenophobia is common and there is an “I’m all right Jack” attitude. \u0026nbspThe DUP has put Northern Ireland’s future in peril over BrexitHow far have isions exposed by the referendum fuelled a real rise in ethnic isions in Birmingham and elsewhere? Some 44 per cent of the city population are first- or second-generation migrants and they will soon be in the majority.One needs to downplay a tendency since the referendum to see all toxic developments as somehow caused by the result. There was a widely reported hammer attack on the windows of five mosques in Birmingham in March but police concluded that they were not carried out by far-right extremists and detained a man under the Mental Health Act who handed himself in at a police station. Recent demonstrations in March by Muslim parents over teaching about LGBT+ relationships in primary schools are best explained by the growing conservatism of Muslim communities in Britain and not as collateral damage related to Brexit.Yet the political atmosphere is definitely becoming hotter and more poisonous. Moreton, who argues for better housing and cost-effective solar energy use in Stourbridge, is worried by a growing intolerance of contrary opinions.The short-term effect of a Brexit might be less significant than people fear, but the long-term impact – political, social and economic – will most likely be much greaterHe and his wife run a pub called the Katie Fitzgerald’s, named after his wife’s mother who came from Cork, though he says that it is not an Irish pub in the traditional sense. They had suspected even before the referendum that Ireland would eventually become an issue in Britain because of the border and this might make them vulnerable because of their Irish sympathies. Sure enough, during the campaign he found himself accused in public of being a supporter of the IRA. Nothing further happened, but he remains anxious because “none of us know how high the political temperature will go” and “many people blame Ireland because they think it stops them having the Brexit they want”.Above all other anxieties, there is the issue of “immigration”, which all polls and surveys say was the prime and determining issue in the referendum. Leading Brexiteers in parliament seldom speak of it, as if embarrassed by their exploitation of the issue, but it has not gone away or ceased to resonate. For decades the populist end of the mass media has drip-fed readers with stories of immigrants who are “spongers” on the welfare state, though figures show that they draw on it less than the non-immigrant population. The perception of migrants as parasites may be ebbing, but is not going to go away.Misperceptions are not all on the right. Bloomfield writes that people broadly supportive of immigration underestimate the impact of raw economic competition between different low-income communities for limited opportunities in jobs and housing. He quotes a successful entrepreneur born in China who gave an unsentimental summary of the forces shaping race relations.“It is much easier to get on if you live in wealthy St John’s Wood or Edgbaston,” he says. “When you have conflict for jobs, for survival, then it’s much harder. It depends what level you are at. If you are facing poverty, good race relations are much harder.”Overall, the big cities of Europe like Birmingham –\u0026nbspBarcelona, Munich and Milan\u0026nbsp– have done better than national governments in responding to the explosive impact of globalisation. The short-term effect of a Brexit might be less significant than people fear, but the long-term impact – political, social and economic – will most likely be much greater.Moreton, for instance, fears a slow slide from Britain as a European welfare state to something closer to the free-market American model. “But it won’t happen overnight so people will say the idea is just fearmongering,” he says.What is undeniable is that Brexit has already produced a crisis that has lasted three years and shows no sign of ending. The rebirth that Birmingham and other British cities once sought pre-Brexit may no longer be attainable in an era of instability and turmoil.We’ll tell you what’s true.

Mick O\u0027Hare examines the dichotomy of his ruleClick to followThe IndependentFidel Castro addresses the crowds at Revolution Square in Havana, in 1965Popular uprising or roughshod revolution? Political insurgencies rarely fail to create paradoxes. The contradictions inherent in the notion that one person’s freedom fighter is another’s terrorist are pretty much irreconcilable. We can be certain the newly emancipated French peasant of 1789 felt differently about recent political developments than the dissident Jesuit staring face down into a basket in front of the Paris mob.“My grandmother danced around the table,” says Maria Gutierrez, speaking of the time when\u0026nbspFidel Castro’s 26th of July Movement seized power in Cuba 60 years ago, in January 1959. What would ultimately morph into the Communist Party of Cuba had ousted corrupt, authoritarian dictator Fulgencio Batista y Zaldívar\u0026nbsp– who had held power for a quarter of a century. Maria also remembers her grandmother, head in hands, sitting at the same table when, 17 years later, Maria’s uncle – her grandmother’s son – was arrested. “He ran a printing press,” says Maria. “Although he was unaware, people opposed to the government had printed leaflets on the night shift which questioned peacefully Cuba’s political direction.” Maria’s uncle would return home, but he was a cowed man. “He never told us what happened, but he never smiled and whenever a door shut he jumped in fear.”End of an era as Raul Castro prepares to step down as Cuba’s leaderWhen Castro resigned as first secretary of the Central Committee, handing power to his brother Raul in 2011, he was the longest-serving\u0026nbspnon-royal\u0026nbspde facto head of state in the world and had ruled for 52 years. When he died in 2016, outwardly a nation mourned, yet inwardly there was introspection.For, according to the Cuban state, not only had Castro been the father of the socialist revolution that overthrew the Batista regime, he led a popular uprising of the downtrodden. The October Revolution of 1917 was as much a Bolshevik military coup d’etat as a people’s rebellion, and the rise of communism in Vietnam or Cambodia, opposed by sections of the population, had led to civil war. But Castro was there by popular mandate. Cubans had been worn down by the corruption, brutality and indifference to their plight shown by Batista. His regime supported itself through links to organised crime in the US, a throwback to the days of rum smuggling during prohibition, and by allowing American companies to dominate Cuba’s traditional industries such as sugar and tobacco. Castro freed his nation and, according to the Cuban state, his legacy was sustained and secured as he stood pluckily against the might of the United States’ political machinery.Batista was forced to flee (Getty)How much of this is true, as ever, depends on which side of the ide one sits, but it’s fair to say the circumstances that brought Castro success owed much to his charisma and his opposition to a government that was not working in the interests of the Cuban people.Castro first attempted to seize power, alongside his brother, on 26 July 1953 – hence his eponymous rebel movement – but was imprisoned and then exiled in Mexico. When he and Raul returned in 1956 declaring “we will be free or we will be martyrs”, alongside charismatic Argentinian revolutionary Ernesto “Che” Guevara, he was again defeated by government forces – The New York Times even reported his death\u0026nbsp – and fled to the Sierra Maestra mountains. From there Castro conducted an insurgency that slowly gained the support of the wider population of Cuba, especially after Batista postponed the 1958 presidential election. Opponents were arrested and tortured, and unemployment and poverty were rising.Even at this early stage though, Castro himself recognised the benefits of sowing fear. He threatened candidates and voters in the rescheduled election and some areas saw negligible turnout. Yet when the results unexpectedly returned Batista’s favoured candidate Andrés Riveroi Agüero, the government had essentially brought about its own demise. People considered the election rigged, and support for Batista collapsed. When 12,000 government troops failed to oust Castro from his strongholds, the insurgency pushed home its advantage. In the early hours of 1 January 1959 Batista fled, ultimately to the Portuguese island of Madeira where he would die.On 8 January, Castro marched into the capital Havana and formed a new government which, initially, was more Cuban nationalist than communist. At that juncture, Castro knew more what he liked than disliked and was still being feted in the US. He travelled there in April 1959, meeting vice president Richard Nixon and the American Society of News Editors, before which he declared that he and his government were “not Communists”.Initially the US had tentatively supported the overthrow of the Batista government and at this stage Castro had not begun nationalising American business interests in Cuba. But it was also clear that the Cuban population had been buoyed by his promises of land reforms for the peasant class and his declaration of equality for all Cubans. He took on organised crime too, closing down casinos, nightclubs and brothels run by the American mafia and frequented by American tourists. It was a popular stance, although not among the criminal classes. Notorious mobster Meyer Lansky, who had to flee Cuba, said Castro “ruined” him.Created with Sketch.Castro revolution lives on in the Cuban Sierra Maestra mountains  Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mountains seen from La Plata, in the Sierra Maestra, CubaWorkers take a break as they build a house at a farm in the village of Santo DomingoMechanic Dayan Nunes, 20, sits on a donkey in the village of La MercedPeople watch the recording of an episode of the popular TV show ‘Palmas y Canas’ in the village of ProvidenciaFarmer Alexander Castillo, 37, talks to a friend at the doorstep of his home in the village of Santo DomingoA horse stands in the mountains near the village of Santo DomingoThe village of Santo Domingo is seen in the Sierra MaestraBananas are being prepared for lunch in the kitchen of a house in the village of Santo DomingoFarmer Luca Castillo, 84, poses for a photograph in front of his home in the village of Santo Domingo, in the Sierra MaestraA chef sits in a food station during the recording of an episode of the popular TV show ‘Palmas y Canas’ in the village of ProvidenciaPeople attend the recording of an episode of the popular TV show ‘Palmas y Canas’ in the village of ProvidenciaHipolito Marrero, 83, smokes a cigar as he commutes on horseback in the mountains near the village of Santo DomingoFarmer Javier Tamayo, 55, rides his horse in the mountains near the village of Santo DomingoLocal official guide Luis Enrique Perez closes a window of the house where the late president Fidel Castro lived in the village of La Plata during the Cuban revolutionA boy raises the Cuban flag during a daily ceremony held at a school in the village of Santo Domingo, in the Sierra Maestra, CubaMountains seen from La Plata, in the Sierra Maestra, CubaWorkers take a break as they build a house at a farm in the village of Santo DomingoMechanic Dayan Nunes, 20, sits on a donkey in the village of La MercedPeople watch the recording of an episode of the popular TV show ‘Palmas y Canas’ in the village of ProvidenciaFarmer Alexander Castillo, 37, talks to a friend at the doorstep of his home in the village of Santo DomingoA horse stands in the mountains near the village of Santo DomingoThe village of Santo Domingo is seen in the Sierra MaestraBananas are being prepared for lunch in the kitchen of a house in the village of Santo DomingoFarmer Luca Castillo, 84, poses for a photograph in front of his home in the village of Santo Domingo, in the Sierra MaestraA chef sits in a food station during the recording of an episode of the popular TV show ‘Palmas y Canas’ in the village of ProvidenciaPeople attend the recording of an episode of the popular TV show ‘Palmas y Canas’ in the village of ProvidenciaHipolito Marrero, 83, smokes a cigar as he commutes on horseback in the mountains near the village of Santo DomingoFarmer Javier Tamayo, 55, rides his horse in the mountains near the village of Santo DomingoLocal official guide Luis Enrique Perez closes a window of the house where the late president Fidel Castro lived in the village of La Plata during the Cuban revolutionA boy raises the Cuban flag during a daily ceremony held at a school in the village of Santo Domingo, in the Sierra Maestra, CubaIn 1960, the Soviet Union’s deputy premier Anastas Mikoyan visited Cuba\u0026nbspto sign a trade agreement, and a programme of nationalisation of American and foreign investments began. Although it wouldn’t be until 1965 that Castro fully declared allegiance to Marxist-Leninism and his 26 July Movement became the Communist Party, the US began to impose diplomatic and economic sanctions. The Soviet Union quickly stepped into the gap. Castro embraced Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev at the United Nations General Assembly in September 1960 and the USSR began supporting the island economically and militarily.The following year, the United States ham-fistedly attempted to overthrow Castro by backing a band of US-based Cuban exiles. The anti-Castro rebels landed at the Bay of Pigs on Cuba’s south coast. The invasion was a huge failure and it cemented Castro in power as the leader who had seen off the imperialist invaders. Believing that the Cuban people would rally behind the Bay of Pigs invaders, the CIA vastly overestimated the desire of Cubans to be “liberated”. Instead, Castro proclaimed Cuba to be a socialist state. The people were more unified than ever behind him and the botched invasion would also precipitate one of the most dangerous crises the world has witnessed.In October 1962, a US spy plane spotted silos being built on Cuba, awaiting the deployment of Soviet nuclear missiles. Florida was only 90 miles away. The Soviet Union said they were a response to both the Bay of Pigs and American missiles based in western Europe. Despite members of his inner circle advocating an air raid, US president John F\u0026nbspKennedy was more measured and imposed a naval blockade of the island even as Soviet ships sailed towards Cuba carrying more missiles. A confrontation between the two nuclear superpowers seemed inevitable. “I thought it was the last Saturday I’d ever see,” said US defence secretary Robert McNamara, of 27 October. But wise heads prevailed. In return for the US agreeing never to invade Cuba again (and, we later learnt, to remove US missiles from Turkey), Khrushchev withdrew the warheads. Once again Castro was seen as the champion of his people as he stood with his Soviet allies against US aggression.Already, though, the contradictions were apparent. Even as reforms were being made to better the lot of the Cuban working class, those people identified as being linked to the Batista regime, including prisoners-of-war in contravention of the Geneva convention, were being tried, imprisoned and executed. Many may have been guilty of crimes against humanity but their trials lacked legal credibility.On the other hand, throughout the 1960s, Castro’s government introduced socially progressive reforms. There was equality for black Cubans (making Castro something of a totem for the US civil rights movement) and women’s rights were enhanced. The entitlement to education, medicine and housing was enshrined in law. By the end of the decade all Cuban children attended school, unheard of before 1959. Illiteracy was virtually eliminated and access to arts and sport opened up to the wider public.These contradictions have led to a dichotomy in how Castro and the revolution are viewed around the world. In the US, opinion is widely unfavourable, but elsewhere Castro has been praised for improving the lives of ordinary Cubans. Prior to embracing communism, his aim was to bring sovereignty back to Cuba and to eliminate poverty and inequality. Born into a Havana slum in 1954, Eva Perez-Sainz says: “I was the first in my family to go to proper school. When my father broke his leg at work, he had it fixed for free by state healthcare. Nobody paid a bribe or risked a backstreet doctor. To us, it was astonishing, wonderful.”Raul\u0026nbspspeak during a session of the National Assembly legislature in Havana, Cuba in 2001 (Getty Images)But these achievements went hand in hand with curtailing the rights of some, a number that grew with the passing years. Suppression of free speech, detention of political opponents and journalists, suppression of religion, prohibition of foreign media and – as time passed – Cubans’ standard of living resolutely failing to rise, meant in some quarters support for the regime waned. And let’s not forget, as historian Andrew Roberts pointed out: “Hijackers and terrorists of all ideologies yelled the phrase ‘take me to Cuba’,” whenever they were about to face justice. The Castro regime seemed determined to offer sanctuary to people of questionable doctrine.Foreign travel was generally outlawed but when, in 1980, hoping to flush out dissidents, Castro briefly allowed emigration for anybody who no longer wished to stay, 125,000 were so desperate they risked their lives in ramshackle boats. From popular insurgent to losing his people in just two decades? “Castro seems to provide proof of Lord Acton’s dictum: ‘Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely’,” wrote Mark White, professor of history at Queen Mary University of London.But Castro clung on even after the 1991 demise of the Soviet Union and the end of its economic support led to famine. During what became known as Cuba’s “special period in time of peace” food was severely rationed as fuel and medicine shortages took their toll. Death rates increased and protesters took to the streets. Only the rise of fellow socialist Hugo Chavez in Venezuela, who became a key economic partner, and the reintroduction of trade with Vladimir Putin’s Russia saved the regime.Felipe Garrido worked in the Cuban civil service until retiring to live with family in Venezuela, inadvertently, it seems, swapping one political maelstrom for another. “Like Chavez here,” says Garrido of his adopted home, “Castro was hugely popular, especially among the old, even during the special period. Both stood up for people who had nothing. I don’t deny Castro’s regime could be merciless, but he had a superpower 150 kilometres away which wanted to blow our island out of the water. He had to be watchful.”But even an old supporter like Garrido realised Castro changed as he aged. “He wanted to cling to power,” he admits. “So he played up this image of the defiant ruler in military fatigues, chomping on cigars and haranguing the US who wanted to steal his revolution. Like your man Churchill, cometh the hour, cometh the man. They served their nation in crises but were both flawed.”So the paradoxes remain. Although she is long dead, and despite what happened to her son, Maria Gutierrez believes her grandmother still had vestigial faith in Castro’s Cuba – she could remember Batista. Gutierrez is more ambivalent. “I’m no apologist for capitalism,” she insists. “But show me a socialist state that doesn’t end up locking up its people to make it work.”Raul Castro raises the arm of newly elected president Miguel Diaz-Canel. Castro stepped down after 12 years in power in 2018 (Getty)Yet there are people in Russia today who lived through the Second World War, the collapse of the Soviet Union and the appearance of the free market economy in its multifarious forms, who still yearn for the certainties of the Stalin era. In 1980, Zimbabwe rejoiced at the election of Robert Mugabe, instrumental in overthrowing white rule. Yet hindsight has offered a different perspective. But hindsight wouldn’t be so named were it available in the first place. Freeing one part of the population may have the corollary of oppressing another. Can any political system not be accused of something similar?Which is where the legacy of the “popular uprising” starts to become murky. Is there, in fact, such a thing? If a majority of people support it, and continue to do so, then it is arguably so. However, if sustaining that majority necessitates imprisonment, torture and worse, the legacy is undermined if not totally dismantled.But what nation wouldn’t take steps to defend itself? The Cuban state estimates, although it’s impossible to verify, that Castro survived more than 600 plots to overthrow or assassinate him, some backed by Cuban exiles in the US, or the CIA, but many carried out by his own people. Yet even prior to these, the regime had introduced Committees for the Defence of the Revolution, local organisations that kept records of neighbours’ “suspicious” behaviour and watched for “counter-revolutionary activity”. Not the mark of a society dedicated to freedom of expression or association. Why free your people only to imprison those who disagree with how that freedom is being applied?Endangered forest originally planted by ancient South AmericansThe orphans born in Romania, born again in BritainThe story of a man who survived 40 hours in a capsized ferryPages from history: The secret suffering of Ceausescu’s babiesAnd the lessons for today? We are still living with the consequences of 1959, the Bay of Pigs and the missile crisis. After years of détente during the Barack Obama presidency, in which the US leader became the first sitting president to visit communist Cuba, the stand-off has ramped up again. The current incumbent of the White House lacks the diplomatic abilities of Jack Kennedy (or, indeed, Nikita Khrushchev) and is himself a populist leader, with an apparent mandate from the people, known too for his nationalism and indelicacy. Unlike Cuba in 1959, America is a mature democracy but one thing is certain, intransigence is only a vote winner for so long.It is fair to argue that at the outset, Castro’s overthrow of an authoritarian dictator had popular support among Cubans that continued while life for most improved. But as US sanctions bit and relative poverty returned, what sustained the revolution even more was state oppression. “Simultaneously, he was an advocate for the world’s poor, and a petty and compulsive tyrant,” wrote Julie Bunck, professor of political science at the University of Louisville, Kentucky.\u0026nbspPerez-Sainz concurs: “In the US, Castro is often placed alongside the names of Hitler, Stalin and Pol Pot. That’s ridiculous, at the outset he was different, I wouldn’t have been educated without the revolution. But – and I hate saying this – as time passed things changed.”So 60 years on: popular uprising or uncompromising totalitarianism? It’s impossible to answer and depends on who is doing the answering. Castro embraced Nelson Mandela and Ernest Hemingway, but embodied the better traits of neither. He overthrew an oppressive dictator and saw off a bullying neighbour, then adopted the worst traits of both. It seems Felipe Garrido was right. There are two sides to every coin – bad penny and shiny peso.* Some names have been changed in this pieceWe’ll tell you what’s true.

Also waiting there are bags of human faeces, dumped\u0026nbspwaste generated as astronauts carried out their mission.That led journalist Brian Resnick to suggest that humanity needs to go back and pick up those bags, and bring them back down to Earth. His suggestion came as the US government told Nasa it needs to send people back to the Moon within five years.He argued the bags\u0026nbsprepresent an unparallelled look at how life might be able to survive in space. Human faeces is full of life, including the bacteria that makes up roughly 50 per cent of that mass.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s most stunning pictures of space Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Nasa celebrated Black Friday by looking into space instead — sharing pictures of black holes230 Nasa Celebrates 50 Years of SpacewalkingFor 50 years, NASA has been suiting up for spacewalking.

There are even prototype electronic tattoos that can sense our vital signs. But by scaling down this technology, we could go further by implanting or injecting tiny sensors inside our bodies. This would capture much more detailed information with less hassle to the patient, enabling doctors to personalise their treatment.The possibilities are endless, ranging from monitoring inflammation and post-surgery recovery to more exotic applications whereby electronic devices actually interfere with our body\u0027s signals for controlling organ function. Although these technologies might sound like a thing of the far future, multi-billion healthcare firms such as GlaxoSmithKline are already working on ways to develop so-called electroceuticals.These sensors rely on newly-invented nanomaterials and manufacturing techniques to make them smaller, more complex and more energy efficient. For example, sensors with very fine features can now be printed in large quantities on flexible rolls of plastic at low cost. This opens up the possibility of placing sensors at lots of points over critical infrastructure to constantly check that everything is running correctly. Bridges, aircraft and even nuclear power plants could benefit.If cracks do appear then nanotechnology could play a further role. Changing the structure of materials at the nanoscale can give them some amazing properties – by giving them a texture that repels water, for example. In the future, nanotechnology coatings or additives will even have the potential to allow materials to heal when damaged or worn. For example, dispersing nanoparticles throughout a material means that they can migrate to fill in any cracks that appear. This could produce self-healing materials for everything from aircraft cockpits to microelectronics, preventing small fractures from turning into large, more problematic cracks.All these sensors will produce more information than we\u0027ve ever had to deal with before – so we\u0027ll need the technology to process it and spot the patterns that will alert us to problems. The same will be true if we want to use the big data from traffic sensors to help manage congestion and prevent accidents, or prevent crime by using statistics to more effectively allocate police resources.Here, nanotechnology is helping to create ultra-dense memory that will allow us to store this wealth of data. But it\u0027s also providing the inspiration for ultra-efficient algorithms for processing, encrypting and communicating data without compromising its reliability. Nature has several examples of big-data processes efficiently being performed in real-time by tiny structures, such as the parts of the eye and ear that turn external signals into information for the brain.The fight against climate change means we need new ways to generate and use electricity, and nanotechnology is already playing a role. It has helped create batteries that can store more energy for electric cars and has enabled solar panels to convert more sunlight into electricity.The common trick in both applications is to use nanotexturing or nanomaterials (for example nanowires or carbon nanotubes) that turn a flat surface into a three-dimensional one with a much greater surface area. This means that there is more space for the reactions that enable energy storage or generation to take place, so the devices operate more efficiently.In the future, nanotechnology could also enable objects to harvest energy from their environment. New nano-materials and concepts are currently being developed that show potential for producing energy from movement, light, variations in temperature, glucose and other sources with high conversion efficiency.15 Doctors inside your bodyWearable fitness technology means we can monitor our health by strapping gadgets to ourselves.

He told BBC Two’s Newsnight: “One of my concerns has been that there are people within the House of Commons who want to frustrate that referendum mandate - there are people who want to do everything possible to prevent us leaving - and I wanted to ensure that minds are concentrated so that we do leave.”Here’s what we know about the move by\u0026nbspSir Oliver Letwin and\u0026nbspYvette Cooper\u0026nbspto\u0026nbsppass a Bill through the Commons on Wednesday to stop the UK crashing out of the EU.\u0026nbspInstead of initiating a third round of indicative votes on Wednesday, when Parliament once more has control over the Commons timetable, Sir Oliver will table a paving motion to allow debate and votes on Ms Cooper\u0027s Bill. An amendment to his motion would set aside April 8 for indicative votes.\u0026nbspThe single-clause Cooper Bill requires the Prime Minister to table her own motion seeking MPs’ approval for an extension to the Article 50 process of\u0026nbspBrexit\u0026nbsptalks to a date of her choosing.\u0026nbspThe group behind the Bill, which also includes former Tory chair Dame Caroline Spelman, Commons\u0026nbspBrexit\u0026nbspCommittee chair Hilary Benn, former attorney general Dominic Grieve and Liberal Democrat Norman Lamb, hopes once it has passed the Commons it could be approved by the House of Lords and granted Royal Assent in time for the emergency EU summit on April 10.Tory grandee\u0026nbspSir Oliver Letwin has spoken very positively about Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn on the Today programme this morning.\u0026nbspHe said: “I think he is somebody we can do business with. We’re all part of one country and, yes, we have some pretty profound political differences.\u0026nbsp“But the fact is ... on the Labour benches, on the Conservative benches and on other benches, there are many, many sensible people all of whom in their different ways are devoted to the best interests of this country.”More cabinet support for the prime minister this morning. Culture secretary Jeremy Wright said: “The public wants parliament to resolve this and so far it’s not been possible.\u0026nbsp“I support the PM in speaking to the leader of the opposition to see what we can collectively do to deliver\u0026nbspBrexit\u0026nbspas the people instructed us to.\u0026nbsp“Given where we are, a short extension is necessary for us to work together on a deal that Parliament will accept. I want the UK to leave the EU with a deal, but no deal remains possible and we must continue to prepare for it.”Shadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey said Labour was entering\u0026nbspBrexit\u0026nbspnegotiations with the prime minister with an open mind.\u0026nbsp“We’re not setting any red lines for these discussion with the prime minister. Certainly a customs union is part of our sensible plan and indeed it’s interesting to note that one of the indicative votes this week was on a customs union and that was one that lost by the fewest votes so we hope the prime minister will be looking at that very, very closely.”\u0026nbspShe added Labour’s support for another referendum in the latest indicative votes was “just to move matters ahead”.\u0026nbsp“Certainly the People’s Vote didn’t satisfy all elements of our conference policy but we wanted to have that on the table so members could have the opportunity to look at that if they wanted to.”Some cabinet ministers giving their support to the prime minister this morning, but what about those thought to be in favour of a no deal Brexit?\u0026nbspAsked if any were set to resign over her offer to Labour, the BBC’s political editor\u0026nbspLaura Kuenssberg says “not yet” and suggests “nothing has been agreed” in the cabinet. “There are some very, very cross people around this morning.”Brexit\u0026nbspsecretary Stephen Barclay has said the “remorseless logic” of the Commons meant the UK was heading for a softer\u0026nbspBrexit.\u0026nbsp“It’s undesirable but it’s the remorseless logic of the numbers of the House of Commons. The prime minister’s deal won’t go through and no deal in law is taken off the table, then the consequence of that is either a soft\u0026nbspBrexit\u0026nbspor no\u0026nbspBrexit\u0026nbspat all.”\u0026nbspMr Barclay blamed hard\u0026nbspBrexiteers in the ERG who refused to support Ms May’s deal. “It’s regrettable that what we have been saying for several months now is coming to pass but that is the remorseless logic of not backing the prime minister’s deal.\u0026nbsp“Because the alternative then is to have to seek votes from the opposition benches because 35 of my own colleagues would not support the prime minister’s deal.”\u0026nbspOf the offer to Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, Mr Barclay said: “We’re not setting pre-conditions, but nor is it a blank check.”ERG spokesman\u0026nbspJacob Rees-Mogg has said the Brexit process “has now been taken control of entirely by people who backed Remain … We should leave on 12 April without a deal.”\u0026nbspIn a feisty exchange on the Today programme, he also defended his retweet of a speech made by a leader in the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party.\u0026nbsp“I think this is typical of the BBC’s obsession, dare I say it the Today programme’s obsession about this. (James) Naughtie said quite shamefully the other week that the ERG was like the National Front in France.”\u0026nbspWhen told Mr Naughtie, a Today programme presenter, had been quoting someone else on the ERG, Mr Rees-Mogg said: “No he wasn’t, he said it himself – it was his view. And he’s a BBC person … What Mr Naughtie said was an outrageous slur.\u0026nbsp“So when Mr Naughtie quotes somebody and it’s not his view that’s fine, but when I quote somebody and it’s not my view that’s a great shock, and that seems to me typical of the Today programme’s lefty approach.”A sign the DUP could yet still change its mind on Theresa May’s deal? Asked if the prime minister’s decision to hold talks with Labour had frozen it out, DUP MP Jeffrey Donaldson said the party was “still in a very strong and influential position” and that events could change quickly.\u0026nbspMr Donaldson said the DUP’s 10 MPs continued to demand changes to her EU withdrawal deal and would need “at the very least a time limit on that backstop” before they would consider supporting it.\u0026nbspMore cabinet backing for Theresa May. Speaking outside her home this morning, international development secretary Penny Mordaunt said people were “fed-up of the limbo”.\u0026nbsp“The only way to leave is with the withdrawal agreement. The prime minister is trying to get it through on Conservative votes and has not been able to, she’s now trying to do it with Labour votes.\u0026nbsp“I would say to colleagues who want a truer\u0026nbspBrexit, I still hope we can do this with Conservative and DUP votes. But above all else, the public are fed-up of the limbo and business needs certainty.”Steve secretary Steve Barclay is speaking at the Brexit committee in parliament this morning. He has made clear the government still wants to leave the EU by 22 May, but he is now answering questions from committee chair Hilary Benn about the kinds of delay that might be possible.\u0026nbspMr Barclay says that if “your legislation” – referring to the Cooper bill being drawn up to stop a no deal crash out scenario – passes in the Commons, then we are headed for a softer kind of Brexit or even no Brexit at all.\u0026nbspHe again uses the phrase “remorseless logic” – one he used on the BBC this morning – when talking about\u0026nbspnumbers in the Commons for a softer Brexit.The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Two, the UK will have to continue to honour its financial commitments taken as a member state.\u0026nbspAnd three, a solution will have to be found for the island of Ireland, preserving peace and the single market.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Opposing protesters flock to parliament on would be date of Brexit Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Pro-Brexit leave the European Union supporters attend a rally in Parliament Square after the final leg of the March to Leave in LondonThe protest march which started on March 16 in Sunderland, north east England, finished on what was the original date for Brexit to happen before the recent extensionA Brexit supporter sips a can of Stella in protests outside of the Houses of ParliamentDedicated anti-Brexit campaigner Steve Bray and likewise pro-Brexit campaigner Joseph Afrane go head to head near the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit marching band in Parliament SquareRemain supporters wave EU flags from a bus in Parliament SquareA Brexit supporter protests outside of the Houses of ParliamentBrexit supporters protest outside of the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit flag is waved in Parliament SquareThe March to Leave nears the Houses of ParliamentBrexit supporters carry the coffin of democracyBrexit supporters take part in the March to Leave protest in LondonA Brexit supporter holds a sign outside the Houses of ParliamentA man holds satirical paintings of politiciansAn pro-Brexit float on the March to Leave march in LondonFar-right activist Tommy Robinson addresses protesters outside the Houses of ParliamentA Brexit supporter outside the Houses of ParliamentA Tommy Robinson supporter arrives at the Houses of Parliament A jogger gestures rudely at a Brexit supporter outside of the Houses of ParliamentA Brexit supporter outside the Houses of ParliamentPro-Brexit leave the European Union supporters attend a rally in Parliament Square after the final leg of the March to Leave in LondonThe protest march which started on March 16 in Sunderland, north east England, finished on what was the original date for Brexit to happen before the recent extensionA Brexit supporter sips a can of Stella in protests outside of the Houses of ParliamentDedicated anti-Brexit campaigner Steve Bray and likewise pro-Brexit campaigner Joseph Afrane go head to head near the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit marching band in Parliament SquareRemain supporters wave EU flags from a bus in Parliament SquareA Brexit supporter protests outside of the Houses of ParliamentBrexit supporters protest outside of the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit flag is waved in Parliament SquareThe March to Leave nears the Houses of ParliamentBrexit supporters carry the coffin of democracyBrexit supporters take part in the March to Leave protest in LondonA Brexit supporter holds a sign outside the Houses of ParliamentA man holds satirical paintings of politiciansAn pro-Brexit float on the March to Leave march in LondonFar-right activist Tommy Robinson addresses protesters outside the Houses of ParliamentA Brexit supporter outside the Houses of ParliamentA Tommy Robinson supporter arrives at the Houses of Parliament A jogger gestures rudely at a Brexit supporter outside of the Houses of ParliamentA Brexit supporter outside the Houses of Parliament“The UK must respect the spirit and the letter of the Good Friday Agreement. No withdrawal agreement does not mean no commitment and the three questions that I have just mentioned will not disappear overnight: they will constitute strict conditions for rebuilding trust and launching discussions on the future.”But in a small boost for Theresa May, the European Commission president also said member states should approve her request for a short extension until 22 May, but only “if the United Kingdom is in a position to approve the withdrawal agreement with a sustainable majority” before a planned summit next week.Leaders had previously said the withdrawal agreement would have to be formally approved by 29 March to get the 22 May extension, but Mr Juncker said the prime minister’s statement to the commons on Tuesday night had bought “a few more days”.But he stuck to the EU’s guns and warned:\u0026nbsp“If it has not done so by then, no further short extension will be possible. After 12 April, we risk jeopardising the European parliament elections\u0026nbspand so threaten the functioning of the European Union.”Mr Juncker, who heads up the EU’s executive,\u0026nbspsaid Brussels would do “everything possible” to prevent a disorderly Brexit, but that one was increasingly likely.Europe welcomes May-Corbyn talks but warns on short extension“The only ones that would benefit from a no-deal are those that are against a world order based on rules, the only ones that would be strengthened would be the populists and nationalists,” he said.“The only ones who will be delighted will be those who wish to weaken the European Union and of course, the UK.”Mr Juncker’s comments on Wednesday echo a similar warning by his chief negotiator Michel Barnier on Tuesday. EU officials worry that a no-deal Brexit is more likely than ever because of political deadlock in Westminster.The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It was approved by MPs by just one vote.The bill is designed to ensure that Britain does not crash out of the EU on 12 April – the date it is currently due to leave.However, it will now need\u0026nbspto be passed by the House of Lords, and any extension would have to be approved by the EU next week.Ms Cooper’s European Union\u0026nbspWithdrawal Bill (No 5)\u0026nbsppassed the Commons by 313 votes to 312 after being rushed through in the space of one day, with MPs sitting until almost midnight to complete a process that\u0026nbspwould usually take place over several months. Fourteen\u0026nbspConservative MPs broke ranks to vote for it.May-Corbyn Brexit deal would ‘make country poorer’, Sturgeon saysIt means that, providing the bill is passed by the Lords, Ms May will be forced to give MPs a vote -\u0026nbspprobably early next week – on the proposed length of the extension she will seek from the EU.The prime minister will then travel to Brussels for an emergency meeting of the European Council, where EU leaders will decide whether or not to accept the government’s request.Ms Cooper told the Commons it was\u0026nbsp”really important for people to come together” adding: “The challenges that we face from the threat of no deal are very significant.”She said: “Three years on from the referendum the biggest problem for all of us is that so little has been done to heal the national Brexit ide or to bring people together and this is major constitutional change and if there isn’t that effort made to bring people together, then to be honest whatever we conclude either today, tomorrow, next week, it won’t last because there won’t have been that work to build the consensus.“We all know that there is no consensus on the best way forward at the moment – we hope we can reach it, but at the moment there is no agreement – but let us at least sustain our agreement on ruling out the worst way forward.”Created with Sketch.The front pages on what would have been Brexit Day Show all 12Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.March 29 2019 - The original date for Britain\u0027s departure from the EU, what do the newspapers have to say about it?The  focuses on the fact that today was the original day for Britain\u0027s departure from the EUThe Daily Mail warns MPs that they have one last chance to back the Prime Minister\u0027s Brexit dealThe Independent Daily Edition reports that the Prime Minister is gambling as she holds a vote today on the withdrawal agreementThe Sun reports that the Prime Minister last night sought to convince DUP leader Arlene Foster to back her deal reports that some ministers want the Prime Minister to step down now, while Michael Gove becomes the favourite at the bookies to replace herThe i reports that Boris Johnson is preparing his leadership bid for when the Prime Minister resignsThe Times reports that Brexit may be delayed for a further yearThe Daily  reports that the Prime Minister is making a desperate final plea to pass her Brexit deal through the house of commonsThe Financial Times reports on the Brexit Betrayal march that will reach London today after setting off from Sunderland with the intention of reaching London on Brexit dayThe Daily Mirror reports on the Prime Minister\u0027s difficulty passing her deal through the commonsThe Daily Star calls on its readers to shut up about BrexitMarch 29 2019 - The original date for Britain\u0027s departure from the EU, what do the newspapers have to say about it?The  focuses on the fact that today was the original day for Britain\u0027s departure from the EUThe Daily Mail warns MPs that they have one last chance to back the Prime Minister\u0027s Brexit dealThe Independent Daily Edition reports that the Prime Minister is gambling as she holds a vote today on the withdrawal agreementThe Sun reports that the Prime Minister last night sought to convince DUP leader Arlene Foster to back her deal reports that some ministers want the Prime Minister to step down now, while Michael Gove becomes the favourite at the bookies to replace herThe i reports that Boris Johnson is preparing his leadership bid for when the Prime Minister resignsThe Times reports that Brexit may be delayed for a further yearThe Daily  reports that the Prime Minister is making a desperate final plea to pass her Brexit deal through the house of commonsThe Financial Times reports on the Brexit Betrayal march that will reach London today after setting off from Sunderland with the intention of reaching London on Brexit dayThe Daily Mirror reports on the Prime Minister\u0027s difficulty passing her deal through the commonsThe Daily Star calls on its readers to shut up about BrexitMs Cooper’s bill was given emergency time in the Commons after MPs\u0026nbspapproved a timetable for it by just one vote, iding by 312 votes to 311 in favour.

again – as MPs\u0026nbspthrow out all rivals to Theresa May\u0027s defeated Brexit agreementClick to followIndy PoliticsMPs have failed again to agree on an alternative Brexit plan, increasing the risk of the UK crashing out of the EU without a deal next week.\u0026nbspIn a second series of “indicative votes”, two options were only narrowly rejected: to keep the UK in the EU customs union – or in both the single market and a customs arrangement.The Commons also turned down putting any agreed deal to a Final Say referendum – and rejected revoking Article 50 if the UK is close to the no-deal Brexit cliff-edge.The results were followed by Nick Boles, the Conservative MP behind the “Common market 2.0” plan for the single market and customs arrangement, dramatically quitting the Tory whip on the Commons floor.Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, said the cabinet would discuss the impasse tomorrow – but pointed out the UK was due to leave the EU in just 11 days’ time, with no deal in sight.May calls cabinet talks as UK heads towards election \u0027nobody wants\u0027However, Final Say supporters were cheered that their option won more votes than a week ago, securing 280 and losing by just 12 – the narrowest defeat.Peter Kyle, one of the Labour sponsors of the motion, urged colleagues to “see how minorities can be brought together” to still achieve a Commons consensus.Created

because my party refuses to compromise. I regret, therefore, to announce that I can no longer sit for this party.”MPs voted on the four options, whittled down from the eight potential alternatives to the prime minister’s thrice-defeated plan, none of which secured a majority a week ago.Nude protesters storm Commons public gallery as MPs debate Brexit2,000 people complain about Jon Snow \u0027white people\u0027 remark on C4 NewsIs this really the most ill-disciplined cabinet in British history?Will the Brexit crisis push us towards a government of national unity?Tory MP says he could vote against government in no confidence motion* A “permanent and comprehensive” customs union, put forward by Ken Clarke, the former Conservative chancellor with Labour support – defeated by 276-273 votes.* “Common market 2.0”, a cross-party bid to keep the UK in the single market and a “customs arrangement”, with support from both Labour and the Scottish Nationalists – defeated by 282-261.* A confirmatory public vote, requiring a Final Say referendum on any Brexit deal before its ratification – defeated by 292-280.* Parliamentary supremacy, put forward by the SNP’s Joanna Cherry and calling for Article 50 to be revoked if a crash-out Brexit looms and a no-deal has been rejected – defeated by 292-191.Conservative MPs were given a free vote on all the options, although cabinet ministers had again been told to abstain.In a letter to Labour MPs, Jeremy Corbyn acknowledged “vastly different and passionately held views”, but had urged support for common market 2.0 “to break the deadlock”.He stressed that Labour was still pushing its plan for alignment with the single market and would “keep all options on the table, including campaigning for a public vote”.We’ll tell you what’s true.

including four frontbenchers have said it is ‘untenable’\u0026nbspthat Labour does not make a public vote a fixed demand from the prime ministerClick to followIndy PoliticsLabour is on the brink of a major bust-up if Jeremy Corbyn fails to demand a second referendum as the price for any Brexit deal struck with Theresa May.A string of senior figures – including shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry – believe securing a public vote is an absolute must, while 11\u0026nbspMPs, including four frontbenchers, have written an open letter to Mr Corbyn in The Independent saying “it would be untenable for Labour not to insist” on one.As Mr Corbyn was in the prime minister’s office holding the talks, one of his party’s biggest trade union backers also endorsed a motion calling for a confirmatory referendum on any deal.But key iniduals on the Labour side of the talks indicated a new vote may not be one of his asks, with one shadow cabinet member attending having stated hours earlier that a deal endorsed by the party would not need a referendum.It comes despite Labour, and indeed Mr Corbyn himself, backing a motion in the House of Commons days ago which called for a referendum on any Brexit plan passed by parliament.The Independent has been pushing for a new referendum through its Final Say campaign, and has backed both major marches through central London demanding one.On Wednesday Mr Corbyn was accompanied by his chief whip Nick Brown, Brexit spokesman Sir Keir Starmer and shadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey to the talks, to which Ms May invited him on Tuesday night in a major strategic shift.Neither side had been prepared to set out a specific position in advance of the talks in an effort to be constructive, but as news of the meeting sank in on Wednesday, Labour backers of a new referendum were clear that it should be a fixed demand.Created with Sketch.Opposing protesters flock to parliament on would be date of Brexit Show

outside the Houses of ParliamentIn a letter published in The Independent the 11\u0026nbspMPs who describe themselves as Mr Corbyn’s supporters and are now organising into a parliamentary “Love Socialism, Hate Brexit”\u0026nbspgroup, saying: “It is our job to find a find a way to break the deadlock. In our view, the only way to do that is with a public vote.”Among its signatories are frontbenchers Clive Lewis, Marsha de Cordova, Rachael Maskell and Anneliese Dodds, along with other well-known MPs on the left like Kate Osamor and Lloyd Russell-Moyle.The views of members are clear. Labour’s democratically established policy, passed at party conference in September 2018, is to oppose a Brexit deal which does not meet Labour’s six tests and put any deal that does to a public vote. It would be untenable for Labour not to insist on a public vote on a deal which did not meet these testsThey argue that Ms May has come to Labour for talks to “bail her out” after she failed to pass her own deal through the Commons, but they claim any guarantees she gives will not be watertight and could be overturned by a future leader.The MPs say the only way to guarantee Labour’s reputation with its membership and the electorate is by giving the public a Final Say on any Brexit deal agreed by parliament.It adds: “The views of members are clear. Labour’s democratically established policy, passed at party conference in September 2018, is to oppose a Brexit deal which does not meet Labour’s six tests and put any deal that does to a public vote.“It would be untenable for Labour not to insist on a public vote on a deal which did not meet these tests.”In the final line the MPs say: “We – your supporters – urge you to make a confirmatory public vote your bottom line in negotiations with Theresa May and to fight to bring this government down.”On 27 March when the Commons voted on a series of different Brexit outcomes, the plan for a confirmatory referendum won the largest amount of support – with 198 Labour MPs backing it.One senior Labour figure told The Independent: “It was only a few days ago that 80 per cent of the parliamentary party backed that motion calling for a vote on any deal.“How can we possibly now agree to helping Theresa May deliver Brexit without one? Party members would go spare.”In a letter received by MPs on Wednesday , Ms Thornberry, who was meant to attend the meeting with Ms May, said: “What I would have said is that if we look like reaching any other decision than confirmatory vote, that would be in breach of the decision made unanimously by conference.”Unison, which handed Labour £1.1m last year, also piled on the pressure by backing a call to put any plan agreed by parliament back to the British public.Earlier in the day party grandee Margaret Beckett, who spearheaded the 27 March motion, said Mr Corbyn should abandon negotiations if Ms May refuses to discuss a referendum.Appearing at a press conference organised by the People’s Vote campaign for a fresh referendum, Dame Margaret said Mr Corbyn was now in “a very powerful position”.Asked if the Labour leader should walk out of talks if the PM failed\u0026nbspto offer a second vote, Dame Margaret told The Independent: “If she says that this is a condition that we don’t even discuss it, then yes, I think he should.“Maybe she has got more sense than that, you just never know.”On Saturday, the demand for a public vote on any deal was echoed by the party’s deputy leader Tom Watson, who said: “Whenever a final deal is reached, and whatever that deal eventually looks like, I think this question can only be truly settled by giving the decision to the people.“Our plan to put any final Brexit deal back to the people has already begun to unite the Labour Party. And, if the last referendum ided our country, I believe a new one might help heal it.”It was also only 10 days ago that Sir Keir said that “no one should doubt” his commitment to Labour’s policy, adopted at party conference, that a referendum would remain an option should the party fail to force a general election.“What the party has said is there must be a public vote and we said we’d either put down an amendment ourselves or support an amendment, and that needs to be between a credible leave option and remain,” he said.Speaking after prime minister’s questions on Wednesday, Mr Corbyn’s spokesman was asked whether a new vote would be one of his demands and answered that Labour’s position was to call for a new public vote only to stop a “damaging Tory Brexit” or a no-deal situation.It was put to him that Mr Corbyn would be unlikely to agree to a deal he would describe as damaging, and also that any agreement struck would preclude no deal, meaning that if Labour did come to an understanding with Ms May, the party’s stated position would exclude a referendum – in response the spokesman restated the party’s position.Earlier in the morning Ms Long-Bailey said: “If we get exactly what we want ... then I would struggle to find a reason to put that to a public vote.”At a Commons committee around the same time, Brexit secretary Stephen Barclay said it would take around a year to legislate for a fresh public vote – a timeframe that has previously been disputed. He said: “You have got to pass the primary legislation, you have got to resolve the issues with the Electoral Commission, you have got to have the purdah period in the run-up to any referendum.”Speaking after the discussions between Ms May and Mr Corbyn, a Downing Street spokesperson said: “Today’s talks were constructive, with both sides showing flexibility and a commitment to bring the current Brexit uncertainty to a close. We have agreed a programme of work to ensure we deliver for the British people, protecting jobs and security.”A Labour spokesperson also described the talks as constructive, saying: We have had constructive exploratory discussions about how to break the Brexit deadlock.“We have agreed a programme of work between our teams to explore the scope for agreement.”Mr Corbyn was said to have raised the option of a new public vote, but only “to prevent crashing out or leaving on a bad deal” as opposed to in any case.\u0026nbspThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The underlying picture of demand is even worse than the headline numbers suggest.”Survey respondents noted that corporate clients had opted to delay spending decisions in response to the impasse in Westminster, with MPs unable to break the Brexit deadlock nearly three years after the referendum.There were also reports that Brexit concerns and worries about the economic outlook had held back household spending.New order inflows deteriorated in each of the past three months, the longest sequence of falling sales volumes since the first half of 2009.Mr Williamson added: “Service sector order books have contracted at the steepest rate since the height of the global financial crisis in 2009 so far this year, with companies reporting that Brexit uncertainty has dampened demand and led to cancelled or deferred spending, exacerbating a headwind from slower global economic growth.”The dire data follows an equally poor showing from Britain\u0027s construction sector, which recorded its first back-to-back contraction since 2016 in March as Brexit anxiety continues to weigh on firms as they delay building projects.Figures from the manufacturing sector on Monday also showed that Brexit stockpiling helped fuel a surge in output last month as firms sought to avoid being caught short.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The second day, the authorities came and said we needed to leave. They told us that the water is coming. After another day, a helicopter came to bring some biscuits. When the helicopter came to throw biscuits, men came – and they were strong. If a woman caught the biscuits the men would beat them and take the biscuits. The authorities came with a boat and brought us to Beira. Now I am in a camp. I am happy to have a tent which was given to me by Care. I need a house but not in Buzi – Buzi is not happy.

More than 740 people were killed and almost 3 million were left in need of humanitarian assistance after strong winds and widespread flooding ripped apart roads, houses, schools and health facilities – and submerged vast swathes of agricultural land.Cyclone Idai is possibly the worst weather-related disaster to ever hit the southern hemisphere. It\u0026nbspdevastated massive areas and displaced hundreds of thousands of people across the region. However, the full impact of the disaster has yet to be established and difficulties in reaching some areas continue as many bridges were washed away.As flood levels begin to recede, work to clear debris, reopen roads and reconnect electricity and water supplies has started. Some\u0026nbspwho fled their homes as flood waters rose are returning\u0026nbspand aid is getting through.However, a second emergency is looming as\u0026nbspwaterborne diseases threaten survivors. There have been reports of people drinking stagnant water from street puddles and of one the shelters is home to 3,000 people with just six toilets. Cholera cases have been confirmed and the number of reported incidences has jumped from five to 246 in Mozambique alone.Supplying clean water remains a significant challenge and member charities of the Disasters Emergency Committee\u0026nbsp(DEC)\u0026nbspare rushing to deliver drinking water, toilets and handwashing facilities.\u0026nbspMozambique confirms first cholera death as cases above 500Cyclone Idai is a reminder that we must take climate change seriouslyCyclone Idai: families desperately search for loved ones in aftermath Cyclone Idai reveals injustice at heart of climate changeCyclone Idai one of southern hemisphere\u0027s worst ever weather disastersAt times of very great need, the DEC brings together a unique alliance of 14 of the UK’s leading aid charities and broadcasters to maximise fundraising and quickly deliver effective emergency relief. The DEC’s Cyclone Idai Appeal was launched on 21 March and has now raised over £25m. The UK government matched the £4m donated by the public to the appeal.The immediate and primary focus of the relief effort is to save lives, but the effect of this disaster will be felt for some time. DEC charities are working closely with national partners to support the rescue and relief effort, deliver emergency shelter materials and blankets, food and urgent health assistance and trauma counselling.You can donate hereWe’ll tell you what’s true.

In his apology, Rev Jarosiewicz claimed the gesture had not been aimed at books “as such”.Comments under the original post condemned the act, recalling book-burning during Nazi rule in Germany before the Second World War.One said: “I have not met anyone yet who would rape, murder and steal in the name of Harry Potter. In the name of the Bible, yes. Bad news, gentlemen!”Polish priests burn Harry Potter books in protest against witchcraftHarry Potter fan achieves record for biggest memorabilia collection“Can’t you see how sick this is? What are your plans next, burning witches?” another\u0026nbspcritic wrote. “As a Catholic, I don’t agree with you, burning books is stupid,” another added.The incident was condemned by the Rev Wojciech Parafianowicz, spokesman for the diocese of Koszalin, where the evangelical foundation is based. He said he “did not like this form of priestly activity, which is wrong”.Rev Jarosiewicz was fined following the incident and an anti-smog group has contacted prosecutors about the open fire, according to the Associated Press.The book-burning comes as Poland’s influential Catholic Church is grappling with revelations about the scale of child abuse among its priests.Last month, the Episcopal Conference of Poland\u0026nbspreleased a report revealing that nearly 400 clergy in the country had been accused of sexually abusing\u0026nbspminors over the last three decades.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Its a fantastic opportunity to build understanding across communities and educate ourselves about our erse communities. Lets build bridges not walls.The Muslim Welfare House in London released a statement after the incident, saying it the attacker had shouted and hurled verbal abuse to the utter shock and disgust of all present.Toufik Kacimi, CEO of the organisation, said: We condemn in the strongest terms this outrageous act which has left everyone shocked.This disgraceful act by this inidual is a sign of the hatred and Islamophobia that sadly abound in our community.We will not let this deter us from cooperating with all groups in building a more cohesive society.Other Labour figures who have been also hit with an egg include ex-Labour boss Ed Miliband, as well as John Prescott, who went on to punch the protester.Last week Mr Corbyn confirmed that his party would get behind a second Brexit referendum, much to the fury of his pro-Brexit voters.But MPs in Leave backing seats warned it could cost the party their seats - and the next election."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/NINTCHDBPICT000470489108.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"the independent group conservative mps political party","story":"Ex-Tory Heidi Allen today revealed more of her former colleagues were keen to join the Independent Group.And she hinted that the number was big enough to cost Theresa May her wafer-thin working majority of eight.Ms Allen told ITV: “We have more [potential defectors] than we could take in. We’re having to stem the enthusiasm there.“Two or three more would be as much as we could manage I think [to avoid destabilising the Conservatives].”The comment come as leaders of The Independent Groupprepare for exploratory talks with the Electoral Commission tomorrow to step up plans to become a fully fledged political party.Separately Labour began moves to boot ex-Labour MPs among TIG such as Luciana Berger off their seats in cross-party select cmmittees.TiG leader Chuka Umunna last month said the breakaway group hope to become a registered political party by the end of the year.But this could now be brought forward given the interest from other Tory and Labour MPs and polling which shows a staggering level of support for the new group.Ex-Labour MP Chris Leslie told The Sun: “The public deserve a better choice than Corbyn or an ever more right-wing Tory Party.“With politics this broken, we must urgently explore a new alternative for people at the ballot box.”So far, each of the  TIG MPs have defected from either Labour or the Conservatives and decided to sit as ‘Independents’ in their constituencies.Under Commission rules a new party has to provide information about its finances and constitution and to appoint people to the roles of party leader, treasurer and nominating officer. Crucially it would also be able to accept much larger donations – allowing it to run electoral campaigns."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/NINTCHDBPICT000477600625.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"sun says brexit deal short sighted mps opinion","story":"The very real prospect of a humiliating fourth defeat for Theresa May’s deal in the Commons this week will have devastating consequences.The likely outcome is that the Prime Minister will have to crawl back to Brussels to beg for an extension that could last years — spurring on the Brexit blockers.But the likes of Priti Patel, Owen Paterson, Sir Bernard Jenkin and Suella Braverman seem hell-bent on scuppering her deal whatever the risks.Fellow heavyweight Brexiteers such as Boris Johnson, Iain Duncan Smith and Dominic Raab have weighed up the options and concluded that a flawed Brexit is better than no Brexit.But this hardcore of headbangers is prepared to play Russian roulette with the future of the country rather than ditch their precious ideological purity.They and their equally unbending colleagues in the European Research Group must now swing behind Mrs May and push her deal over the line.This week we have already seen a grassroots uprising among local Tory party members who want to axe their rebellious MPs.Dominic Grieve could be the first high-profile casualty.This is perilous territory for the Conservatives.How long before it costs them a precious seat The crazed dogma of their hardcore minority will turn the voter backlash from a trickle into a raging torrent.THE footballing authorities are still too complacent about racism by fans.Last week’s outrageous monkey chanting at England’s black players may have occurred during their thrashing of Montenegro, sadly proving that prejudice is still re in Europe.But that does not mean it is no longer an issue at home as well.Though many Premier League clubs have done much to eradicate the shameful scourge from their grounds, shocking incidents still occur here.England star Raheem Sterling should be praised for bringing the issue to world attention by warning that racist bile could lead to games being played behind closed doorsIn our pages today Watford star Christian Kabasele calls for referees and white players to be the first to lead the teams offthese attacks continue.The authorities must listen and finally wash this stain out of the beautul game.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They show voters are paying attention.Friday’s good-humoured protest by thousands of Brexit marchers in Westminster — on a working weekday — was in contrast to the otherwise souring mood among voters at large. Across the country, those who voted Leave in  are taking note and,betrayed, will seek revenge.The Black Spot planted on Tory plotter Dominic Grieve by his constituents last week is just for starters.The real blowback will come at the next election whenever it takes place — unless Britain is no longer a member of the EU.Polls yesterday suggested Labour is five points ahead of the Tories and poised to form a minority Government.These figures are meaningless. The next election will be decided not by votes for or against the major parties, but on the candidates’ support for the referendum result.There are .million votes up for grabs. They will either support pro-Brexit candidates or stay home and sit on their hands. Either way, it will transform the poll.Labour votes will be mopped up in Leave seats by Nigel Farage’s new Brexit Party, what’s left of Ukip, or, in Remain seats, by Labour deserters now known as Change UK.The picture is dferent for the Tories, depending upon when any poll is held and what happens in the next few weeks.A snap election, apparently to be announced on Wednesday, would be suicidal. Anything led by Theresa May would be a bloodbath.Under a new pro-Brexit leader, with breathing space to regroup, it could be an opportunity to clear the air once and for all. Meanwhile, we face further Commons chaos, showdowns with Brussels, the possibility of fighting European elections in May — and the outside chance of “crashing out”.No Deal is no big deal, as ex-Bank of England Governor Mervyn King told The Sun last week — at least for Britain. We would swtly overcome a short, bumpy ride.Not so for Europe — and for all their bluster, EU states are beginning to fear it happening by accident.Germany is grimly aware it is about to lose the UK as a long-standing ally in the balance of European power with France and the EU’s hard-up southern states.Without our £billion-a-year contribution — one of the biggest by EU states — Italy, Portugal, Spain and Greece will be queuing in Berlin for German cash.Unless a deal on frictionless trade is reached, German exporters will be hammered and hundreds of thousands of jobs lost in their manufacturing industry.Support for “populist” parties — including in Germany — has mushroomed since the UK voted Leave.Which explains this week’s dash to Dublin by German Chancellor Angela Merkel. She wants preening Irish PM Leo Varadkar to stop playing games and solve the Irish backstop question.Either he bows to technological solutions to avoid a hard border with Northern Ireland or there will be a hard border at Calais with Ireland on the wrong side.Merkel knows a solution to the backstop problem would persuade the DUP to support Mrs May’s Withdrawal Bill, and even push it over the line at the fourth time of asking.That, in turn, would be enough to persuade all but the most stubborn Tories to sign up and, along with a few extra Labour votes, bring this edition of the long-running Brexit soap to a close.As always with these negotiations, nothing is settled until everything is settled, always at the th hour. It is now .pm and ticking.Let’s hope the Irish Taioseach put his clocks forward yesterday.He needs results fast. In yet another bloody incident, four innocent civilians were kned at random in North London, apparently by the same man.

Bodyguard came from the off-cuts of Line Of Duty and it should be eternally grateful for the association.Line Of Duty is a television masterpiece and the opening episode of the fth series was a genuine TV event that, despite a whf of plot familiarity, had me reeled in before the end of the opening credits.That was as long as it took the show to introduce Stephen Graham, who’s giving a mesmerising performance as Detective Sergeant John Corbett, the UCOwho appears to have gone rogue with an OCG .There are lots of other new faces as well, including: A gang of bikers, with no bikes, who appear to have been styled by Vyvyan from The Young Ones.Slippery police spokesman Sindwhani, played by Ace Bhatti. PC Jane Cafferty, whose le was spared in the opening hijack scene by “gangster” Lisa McQueen.And the slightly robotic Detective Superintendent Alison Powell, who’s in charge of Corbett’s “Operation Peartree” and is yet another of those department chiefs who seems strangely drawn to “Ted” .A hell of a trick for a TV show to pull off, introducing them all while still tying up the loose ends of series four and leaving viewers to guess which painkillers managed to get DS Arnott out of that wheelchair and whether Hastings’ faulty hotel toilet cistern is critical to the new plot. Or just a faulty hotel toilet cistern.The fact Line Of Duty did it, however, is entirely down to the constants that have driven this show ever since its first series.It starts, obviously, with a thrilling and complex script from Jed Mercurio, who clearly gives not a stuff for any of the lazy, modern, right-on conventions of TV writing.It’s all about the story that demands the total attention of the viewers and gets the performance of their lives from the actors.Not just the newcomers, like Stephen Graham, but regulars Martin Compston and Vicky McClure, as Arnott and Fleming, who have the hardest job in drama, unravelling the plot for the audience.Without them there would be no room for the show’s crowning glory, Super-intendent Ted Hastings, who is that rarest thing in contemporary TV drama, a strong male lead.There used to be lots of them, obviously. Now we’re generally reduced to murderers, rapists or, at best, jaw-flexing “Yes, ma’am” dogsbodies, like in Bodyguard.The joy of Hastings is that the part gets the performance it deserves from Adrian Dunbar, who’s from Northern Ireland, so he was born sardonic and can give a whole new edge to lines like: “Listen Alison. I didn’t float up the Lagan on a bubble.”Together, show and actor are a dream to watch and should be the agenda-free blueprint every new drama aims to emulate.So enjoy Hastings and Line Of Duty while you can.

Well, let’s see it.It is a crying shame that a clean break was effectively taken off the table years ago by this Government’s, and particularly this Chancellor’s, refusal to properly prepare for No Deal.And those ERG hardliners, who refused to confront reality over not one, not two but three votes, deserve plenty of flak too. They can’t say they weren’t warned.We loathe the idea of a softer Brexit. But at least it would unblock this paralysing stalemate. And we know Parliament will now do anything to avoid No Deal — even revoking Brexit completely.But it is vital — for the public’s faith in democracy — that the Withdrawal Agreement is passed and we aren’t forced to hold European elections.And an optimist must hope that the Tories are able to win a mandate in future to leave whatever customs fudge we end up in.All of this assumes that the Marxist opportunists in charge of the Labour Party don’t use this crisis to win themselves some party political points.The frontbench want the Government to collapse so they can force a General Election on the country.The backbenches, with a vanishingly small number of honourable exceptions, are full of elitist Remainers who are ­desperate to overturn the Brexit vote, come what may.There’s every chance their condition for talks is a confirmatory referendum.

Yet by his actions, he constantly thwarts the will of the people and blocks the road to genuine British independence.In a typical manoeuvre this week during further votes in the Commons, he ordered his MPs to support the so-called Common Market . option, which represents the softest possible EU withdrawal.Effectively, this option would keep Britain under Brussels’ domination by locking our country in the European single market. The bureaucracy of the EU would still be in charge, dishing out its rules and cash demands.But even worse, the plan — also known as Norway Plus — would mean the continuation of uncontrolled immigration from the EU.Our borders would remain open, the very opposite of what voters were promised with Brexit. Indeed, the Labour Party itself gave a solemn pledge in its  manesto that “freedom of movement will end” after Britain leaves the EU. Now those words have proved hollow.Corbyn’s move is a kick in the teeth for Leave supporters. One of the main reasons that .million people voted for Brexit was because of disillusionment with soaring rates of immigration, which have imposed a social revolution on our country without any mandate.Remain voters in the metropolitan chattering classes welcomed the massive influx, both as a source of cheap foreign labour and as a means to display their self-righteous political virtue. But large numbers of Leavers, especially in the working class, were fed up with the experience of seeing their own wages undercut, their public services over-stretched and their solidarity eroded.In part, Brexit was a bitter, justied cry of anger from those who had been left behind by the wealthy elite’s obsession with globalisation. These are the marginalised, hard-working people that the Labour Party was originally created to represent.  But now, in thrall to the fashionable dogma of mass immigration, Corbyn’s gang has badly let them down.Leavers wanted our Government to put a foot on the brakes of upheaval. The Labour leader is seeking to press down the accelerator.  His betrayal on freedom of movement is just the latest stage in Labour’s drive to prevent theof real sovereignty.Only last month their trade spokesman, Barry Gardiner, claimed that “Labour is not a Remain party”.  Yet Corbyn’s mob is certainly acting like one as it keeps inventing new obstacles to an orderly withdrawal.The hardline Brexiteers in the Tory Party rightly get a lot of stick for their stubbornness in their uncompromising pursuit of a clean departure from the EU. But at least they are motivated by principle.In contrast, all Labour seeks is narrow, short-term political advantage. The party cares nothing about the national interest or honouring the referendum result. It simply wants to create as much turmoil as possible in order to force a General Election, which would bring a Corbyn regime to power.Its ruthless opposition to Theresa May’s Withdrawal Agreement is a classic example of this damaging approach. Labour has no real objection to her deal, which fits exactly with Corbyn’s demand for a sensible compromise. Yet, in order to foment Parliamentary anarchy and bring down the Government, Labour refuses to back it.That is no way for a responsible movement to behave. Labour MPs keep telling us that they do not want a No Deal departure. Well, the best way to avoid No Deal is to vote for the only deal on the table. But that is exactly what Labour refuses to do.Typical of this intransigence is Yvette Cooper MP, the anti-Brexit cause’s hand-wringing high priestess, who has created a procedural quagmire in the Commons with her antics. Only yesterday, she called for a special Commission on Brexit. That would be a recipe for yet more delays and navel-gazing, which is exactly what she wants.Ever since the referendum result in , Corbyn has indulged in creative ambiguity about Labour’s stance on Brexit. He has tried to appeal simultaneously to both the army of Leave voters and the pro-EU brigade who make up the bulk of the party’s membership.But now the mask has truly slipped. By his decision this week, Corbyn has shown that he sides with the Remainers. In Labour’s battle for supremacy, the affluent metropolitan progressives have won against the traditional working class of the North and the Midlands. That should hardly be a surprise given how London-centric the top ranks of Labour really are.Every single one of Labour’s big guns on the front bench, including John McDonnell, Sir Keir Starmer, Emily Thornberry and Diane Abbott, represents a London seat. But the victory for the Labour Brexit blockers is a tragedy for our country. Corbyn’s gang is helping to wreck the chance for freedom.Labour thinks the present chaos at Westminster is playing into the party’s hands — reflected in a recent opinion poll that put them five points ahead of the Tories. But their negative strategy could backfire disastrously.If there is a long delay or, indeed, no Brexit at all, Leave voters will not be forgiving. Electoral carnage, not advance, could beckon.There are at least  Labour seats where support for Leave at the referendum was estimated to be more than  per cent — such as the . per cent in Normanton, Pontefract and Castleford where Yvette Copper, who campaigned for Remain, is MP.Many seats could be lost — and it would be no more than Labour deserves for its shallow, Remoaner-led dishonesty.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

If we were dealing with a low value car, would we be in this situation  I think not.Mr OHanlon added: The defendant is a skateboarder and for the most part he is a sensible young man.Where he skates is in a skate park next to the car park where Mr Pendlebury parked his car.The car park provides shelter when the rain comes on and this is what happened on the day in question. The defendant quite simply wanted to get a photo with the car.It was simply a stupid mistake and he is not a malicious inidual.In my submission, the fact the defendant posted the pictures on his public social media account goes to the heart of his credibility. It was simply a stupid mistake.Mr Pendlebury — who is currently on holiday — was not in court and it is not known whether the Bentley has been repaired.His late father James clothed some of the city’s best known footballers, musicians and actors including George Best, Alex Ferguson and Noel Gallagher after setting up James Personal Tailor and Son in ."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/NINTCHDBPICT000480511425.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"prince harry baby dad royal","story":"The -year-old tickled a baby girl under her chin during a visit to a childrens ballet class in West London.The Duke of Sussex joined in with the class as he encouraged the kids to take part in the “balancing challenge”.He told the youngsters to “pick a spot and stare at it” as they all tried to balance on one leg at the centre in Ealing, West London.A laughing Duke of Sussex told one girl: “You were very very good, well done.”He added: “You were all fantastic.”The impromptu ballet session came after Harry discussed mental health during a YMCA visit following his own battle after the death of his mother Diana.He has previously opened up about mental health and revealed how he dealt with coming to terms with the loss of mum.Harry, who admitted he “shut down all his emotions” for two decades before seeking help, said fun and humour are helping him to move on.He said the key to a happy le is to “grow up but also to stay in touch with your childhood side”.Harry was only  when Princess Diana died in a car crash in Paris in .He admitted that he sought counselling, a revelation being viewed as a major prompt for those suffering from mental health to speak out.Reflecting on his own turmoil he said: “I know there’s huge merit in talking about your issues.“Keeping it quiet will only ever make it worse, not just for you but everyone  around you, because you become a problem.“And I, through a lot of my s, was a problem, and I didn’t know how to deal with it.“Once you start talking about it to your mates, two months later those mates were coming back to me and starting to slowly unravel their own issues, because they knew that I could relate to it.”Meanwhile, both Harry and William said the loss of their mother “uniquely bonded them” – despite not discussing her death for years.Harry said: Both of us have always been open to each other saying weve never really talked about losing a mum at such a young age.And when you speak to other peoples families and little kids and stuff, you think, wow, you know, I dont want them to have to go through the same things.With a little bit of experience, you want to help as much as you can and try and empower them to have that conversation, to be brave enough for themselves to talk about it at a young age rather than bottling it up for far too long."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/NINTCHDBPICT000480441635.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"florida mansion cinema star trek starship enterprise for sale","story":"The home in Boca Raton, on the south-eastern coast of Florida, US, covers , square feet and comes with a home cinema modelled on the bridge of the USS Enterprise.Along with the cinema and a space-age looking entrance hall it also has around £, worth of memorabilia from the sci-fi series.Current owner Marc Bell, the former owner of Penthouse and a Tony-winning Broadway producer, originally put the place up for sale in  with a price tag of £.m but it was taken off the market a year later after receiving serious offer because he wanted to stay put.It was then put back on the market in  for £.m but now Marc and his we Jenner have reduced the price.Marc became obsessed with Star Trek when he was aged .He had gone on a week-long trip to Florida with his dad who was speaking at a conference but the hotel where they stayed was overbooked so Marc and his younger sister had beds made up in the conference room which had a big-screen TV.Marc told the New York Post: “I had never seen Star Trek before – I stayed awake for  hours to watch.

We hate to be chained.We want to control our destinies and feel the wind run through our hair.It is an instinct understood by slaves and oppressed peoples from history’s first light.That acclaim earned by Gandhi and Walesa will never belong to Theresa May.Lips will curl at her very name for decades to come.It will be spat to the floor in balls of green-gob spittle, hissed, sworn at with the sort of language we must not print in a popular newspaper.She will be called a traitor, with plenty of adjectives attached. And she will deserve it.This is a terrible thing to say about any person, let alone a church-going diabetic who has been our Prime Minister for two years.I take no pleasure in levelling the charge of treachery at a Tory leader who secured  per cent of the vote in the  General Election.We all want our Prime ­Ministers to be honourable and to improve the lot of our land.But after her surrender this week to Brussels and to Jeremy Corbyn, May’s name will rank alongside those of the worst eels in Western history.In the past, when trying to describe national moral collapse, we have perhaps spoken of Quisling, Nazi Germany’s Norwegian political puppet, or Neville Chamberlain, who also appeased Hitler, or Jimmy Carter, whose inertia and incompetence on Iran was a low-point for the US ­presidency.Theresa May’s leadership of our country will be placed alongside those shameful ­episodes.She has wriggled. She has lied. She has concealed and dithered and caved. She is a freaking disaster.The tragedy is that it need not have been like this.Even on Tuesday afternoon, while she was having that ­seven-hour meeting with her Cabinet, she could have saved herself and our country.“No Deal is better than a bad deal,” May used to say about Brexit.It was meant to make the European Commission offer us decent orce terms.But Brussels did not believe her because they sensed, from her clunkiness and from sly Philip Hammond’s refusal to fund No Deal preparations, that she did not mean it. She was a useless bluffer.On Tuesday night, when May effectively ruled out a No Deal Brexit, we saw that the ­Eurocrats had her measure as accurately as a tailor has your inside leg.All that “No Deal is better than a bad deal” stuff had merely been an inept lie.And yet No Deal could have been brilliant.It could have secured us our independence from a European Union that now is sucking us back into its prison.No Deal would have served our children’s interests because we would not have had to pay £billion to Europe and because we would have been able to forge our own way in the world.The ensuing instability might only have lasted a few weeks,that.Mrs May would not consider it. She collapsed like over- watered jelly, listening to dodgy Whitehall chief Sir Mark Sedwill and hisalarmist tales about what No Deal might do to our economy.Now Mrs May is hopping into bed — it’s a horrible image, sorry — with Anglophobe, terrorist-supporting, Russia-loving commie Corbyn.She has asked the Labour leader to give her some ideas about how she can get her withdrawal agreement through the Commons.The deal is already a feeble compromise but Corbyn’s pals will make it even more pathetic. Yes, lean-fingered Corbyn will have his wicked way with May much as he once did with Diane Abbott.Any Brexit will now likely be so weak that we will not even have control of our own trade policy.We will have to do what we are told and send our money to Brussels. We will be ­shackled ­captives.Remember the TV slave drama Roots  Well, Theresa May has made a right Kunta Kinte of herself — and, damn it, the rest of us.Few in public le have come out of this disgusting saga with credit.The broadcast media, and, sadly, some newspapers have been blinkered cheerleaders for our European gang- masters.Those who spoke up for our kingdom’s independence were attacked as “extremists”.Is it really “extreme” to want to have a say over how you are taxed and governed Senior figures in the law, the arts, charities and big business have spouted EU ­propaganda.Worst of all has been our parliament, where Remainer MPs and peers and a blatantly biased Speaker have actively sought to block the ­referendum verdict of .million voters — a verdict they had repeatedly promised to respect.As for the most ardent Brexiteers at Westminster, they became so doped up on publicity, so daftly entrenched in their enmity to common sense, that they failed to grab our best chance of escaping the EU.What morons.

Yes, indeed.But that was never, ever going to happen. How could they not see this There’s a good case for arguing that any deal cooked up by May and Gramps would be worse than staying in the European Union.It would be, at best, a purely nominal Brexit, which would leave us all worse off — and the EU rather better off.So at every stage, and by every part of the House of Commons, we have been let down, betrayed.Whatever happens in the next few weeks, we need a new kind of politics.One that represents the majority of the British people.And for this shower to be washed away.JON Snow is the white, elderly, public school-educated presenter of Channel  News.He is famous for his unrelenting left-wing bias and wearing ties.He attended the Brexit march in Westminster on March .

A day which has seen . . . I have never seen so many white people in one place . . . ”Needless to say, this drew more than , complaints from viewers.Some, I hope, will have pointed out that the anti-Brexit march the previous Saturday was even more resolutely white.Or perhaps simply alerted this pompous ass to the fact that  per cent of the country is white.Snow was channelling the anti-Brexit line that all leavers are white and probably racist scumbags.It is an idiotic assertion and always was. C News has apologised, kind of.

Meanwhile, Lucy Allan, Tory MP for Telford, posted on her Facebook page: “My constituents voted  per cent to leave and leave we must.“I have a duty to deliver that, whatever I think personally about the deal.”If all MPs honoured the supposedly “direct democracy” decision of their ­voters, we’d now be out of the EU.IN a band of septuagenarians, it’s perhaps inevitable there are going to be a few health scares.But it’s still surprising to learn that Rolling Stones frontman Sir Mick Jagger, whose health and fitness regime makes Joe Wicks look sloppy, has a heart valve problem.Particularly as his co-writer, the legendary caner Keith ­Richards, is still going strong.Keith, , survived bombing raids in the Second World War, was electrocuted on stage in the Sixties, set his bed alight with a fag in the Seventies, unwittingly took strychnine-laced cocaine a few years later and fell out of a ­coconut tree in Fiji in , which necessitated a blood clot being removed from his brain.Meanwhile, he still smokes like a ­chimney and, despite saying he had given up alcohol, continues to enjoy the ­occasional wine and beer.As “Keef” himself said in : “Some doctor told me I had six months to live and I went to his funeral. I’ll write all your ­epitaphs!”When he eventually does slip this mortal coil, let’s hope he donates his seemingly indestructible body to medical science.HOLLYWOOD actress Kate Beckinsale says she misses two things about home – British men and Loose Women.She says: “If I had to go on a mini break, I’d probably go away with Jane Moore or Nadia Sawalha.”The Bloke is suddenly flicking through holiday brochures with renewed gusto.PATSY KENSIT was photographed looking the worse for wear after a four-hour lunch with friends at the weekend.We’ve all been there, haven’t we  It’s the first glimpse of spring, the kids are where and one of your mates suggests having “just a quick drink” in the sunshine while watching the world go by.The next thing you know, people are arriving for dinner bookings, the world is hazier, the legs wobblier, there’s not a taxi to be had this side of Christmas and next day’s pounding headache is already setting in.It feels sooo good at the time, though . . .Could it be connected to the news that the number of orce cases reaching court – many of those involving couples with children – has shown the biggest increase in  years AT the weekend, Theresa May was pictured in a new, £ designer puffer jacket with “three-quarter sleeves”.Sorry. Don’t get it.If it’s cold, you want a puffer jacket that completely covers your arms.Andyou’re not that cold, then you don’t need a puffer jacket, do you Those sleeveless “gilet” things are equally pointless. Along with knitted tank tops, sleeveless polo necks, fingerless gloves, woolly ear warmersand, most ludicrously of all, socks with sandals.Either your feet are cold and you need to warm them in socks and boots.

The Shadow Foreign Secretary wrote to all Labour MPs after the Leader of the Opposition met with the Prime Minister. Jeremy Corbyn has faced mounting pressure from within his own party - and from the SNP - not to agree a deal with Mrs May unless it also includes a confirmatory public vote. Speaking after the meeting, Labouraposs leader said there should be a public vote -it was to prevent crashing out or to prevent leaving with a bad deal. But Ms Thornberry today warned that any agreement that did not include a public vote would be in breach of the decision made unanimously by Conference in Liverpool and overwhelmingly supported by our members. The Labour MP, who had to miss a vote today on holding indicative Brexit votes because her daughter was ill in hospital, said in the letter: Any deal agreed by Parliament must be subject to a confirmatory public vote, and yes, the other option on the ballot must be Remain.    She also insisted any agreement made between Mr Corbyn and Mrs May needs to be put to a vote‎ by the Shadow Cabinet. Mr Corbyn spent more than an hour in discussions with the Prime Minister in an attempt to find a way through the Brexit logjam. The Labour leaderaposs spokeswoman described the discussions as constructive. Asked about whether a referendum on the deal should be on the table Mr Corbyn said: There was no deal offered.    There was no deal offered by us either. We just discussed where we are at. She reiterated where she is at at the present time. So red lines in the future didnapost come up. Mr Corbyn said he raised the issue of a public vote with Mrs May. I said this is the policy of our party, that we would want to pursue the option of a public vote to prevent crashing out or to prevent leaving with a bad deal. There was no agreement reached on that, we just put it there as one of the issues that the Labour Party conference voted on last year. Emily Thornberryaposs letter in full Dear All, I won’t be able to be at the Emergency Shadow Cabinet later. But assuming one of the main topics of discussion will be whether to insist that any proposed compromise deal we agree to support will be subject to a confirmatory public vote, with “Remain” as the other alternative. What I would have said is thatwe look like reaching any other decision than confirmatory vote that would be in breach of the decision made unanimously by Conference in Liverpool and overwhelmingly supported by our members and it needs to be put to a vote‎ by the Shadow Cabinet.  The reason I think that is fundamental is that –that is the outcome – those of us who oppose it can only take collective responsibility for the decision – and defend it in public and on the media –we are having to go along with what was democratically agreed between us, whether we personally agreed or not, especially given the breach of our commitments to our members at conference.  The Tory Cabinet had that kind of vote yesterday after their eight-hour discussion yesterday so I think it is the least we should be doing after the one-hour discussion this evening.  And assuming all colleagues will agree with that principle, and given my absence, can I – in writing – confirm that my votes are that yes, any deal agreed by Parliament must be subject to a confirmatory public vote, and yes, the other option on the ballot must be Remain.  I hope the meeting goes well,  Emily"},{"url":null,"title":"brexit tory hardliners declare open","story":"NewsBrexit: Tory hardliners declare open season with fresh bid to oust Theresa MayShe has angered her backbench MPs by entering into Brexit negotiations with Labour leader Jeremy CorbynShareCommentsByMikey SmithPolitical Correspondent:,  APR Updated:,  APR NewsMPs are still deeply frustrated with Theresa May \"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailTory hardliners have declared open season as they launched fresh bid to oust Theresa May . Angry MPs gathered at the backbench  Committee to vent their anger at the Prime Minister. One MP claimed up to two-thirds of the partyaposs Parliamentarians were ready to vote no-confidence in the PMaposs leadership of a vote was possible. Party rules state MPs must wait  months between attempts to oust the leader in a no confidence vote. But some hard Brexiteers want to hold an indicative vote - a secret ballot to test the temperature of the party.   It comes even though she has promised to leave once her Withdrawal Agreement, in one form or another, is agreed.    Leaving a meeting of the  committee of Tory backbencher, Brexiteer James Duddridge said calls for such a vote had been dismissed for now. But he said MPs were being encouraged to write letters of no-confidence to committee chairman Sir Graham Brady. Sir Graham reportedly told the meeting he wouldnapost give a running commentary on the number of letters he had received. But he reportedly said he would keep the PM informed. Mr Duddridge said: The indication is that it’s open season - put your letters in and Graham Brady will go and see the PM when it’s %+. He added that his guess was that two thirds of Tories would vote infavour of sacking the PM.   But a number of Tory MPs played down the suggestion, with Simon Hoare saying: It was raised as an idea and dismissed as an option. Mark Francois said he would be sending his letter of no confidence in the PMaposs leadership tomorrow.He said the meeting, at which Trade Secretary Liam Fox had spoken and answered questions, had been uninspiring.On the idea of an indicative no-confidence vortex he said: We were told by the chairman of the  executive that they had discussed I think for some time now whether or not they should organise some kind of indicative votes.And they had decided not to organise any such vote, in his words, aposat this timeapos. It came after Tory Brexiteers lined up today to savage their own leader to her face after she opened the door to a softer Brexit . Hardliners accused the Prime Minister of ushering in a Marxist, anti-Semite led government as she prepared to sit down for talks with Jeremy Corbyn - which could open the door to a customs union or even a second referendum. Tory MPs expressed fury over Mrs Mayaposs decision to involve the Labour leader - with Jacob Rees-Mogg claiming it would make him deputy Prime Minister. And they showed their anger in person in a frosty session of Prime Ministeraposs Questions PMQs .  Tory Caroline Johnson asked Mrs May: If it comes to the point when we have to balance the risk of a no-deal Brexit versus the risk of letting down the country and ushering in a Marxist, anti-Semite led government, what does she think at the point is the lowest risk  Tory Brexiteer David Jones demanded: Does it remain the position of the Prime Minister that the leader of the opposition is not fit to govern  Squirming Mrs May replied: I do not think the Labour Party should be in Government. It is the Conservatives that are delivering for people, and the leader of the opposition and I have dferent opinions on a number of issues.    Tory Lee Rowley told the PM she said only last week that the biggest threat to our standing in the world, to our defence, and to our economy was Mr Corbyn. He asked: In her judgment what now qualies him for involvement in Brexit  The PM insisted every member of this House is involved in Brexit.

The ground-breaking fashion designer, now a Dame, is now the focus of her first international retrospective exhibition for half a century at London’s Victoria and Albert Museum.    With more than  outfits, accessories and photographs of her iconic clothing, the designer’s impact on fashion and the culture of the time is undeniable. That’s not to say it was an easy ride and from the start Quant needed an ally who wasn’t afraid of printing photographs of a few pairs of bare legs. And daring Felicity was that ally. A trailblazer herself – she was once sent out of the newsroom for wearing trousers, and was to become this paper’s associate editor, and eventually director - the first woman on the board of any national newspaper in a totally male-dominated Fleet Street – Felicity completely ‘got’ Mary’s fashion forward designs. And most importantly, the sense of freedom and fun they gave female readers. The OBE championed them, while other papers wouldn’t – even though then chairman, Cecil King threatened her job when he flicked through the fashion pages appalled at the pound of flesh on show. Felicity, , and as outspoken as ever, recalls: “He said: ‘How long are we going to use that vulgar fashion ’ And I said: ‘As long as it’s news – that’s what a paper is for’.    “And he glared at me and I said: ‘What will you do with meI keep offending you ’ And he said: ‘I’ll fire you’.” Thankfully, Felicity got the backing of the editor, Hugh Cudlipp, and that didn’t happen – just as well, as she wasn’t prepared to stop. “They knew they didn’t understand what was happening with the ‘youthquake’ but they recognised I did, and I kept doing what I was doing,” she says. “Mary and her team wanted to break all the rules, and I got some readers who objected, inevitably men who disapproved. But it was fun fashion, sexy, but innocent, and not offensive. “Women wanted freedom to wear what they wanted and I understood what Mary was doing. “I’m proud to have worked at that time. If the swinging sixties had a symbolic image it was certainly Mary’s mini skirt. She changed the way women worldwide chose to look.” And many of those women have contributed to the new exhibition after the curators launched a national search for people to lend any Quant clothes lingering in their wardrobes - or still being worn, of course. Thousands got in touch and  items were included in the final show, along with the photographs and stories of the women who donated them.    Quant, now , was one of the trailblazers of mass-market fashion and by the mid sixties she was working with  manufacturers. It was a long way from her humble beginnings as the daughter of Welsh teachers from mining families. She had trained in illustration then moved into fashion, and opened her first shop, Bazaar, in . The designer even began printing patterns for her clothes so women - including Mirror readers - could make them at home themselves.    Felicity quickly became friends with Mary - who she describes as boasting “the longest legs in London” - and her husband Alexander Plunkett-Green, helping the designer soar to worldwide fame. But their private chats sometimes landed her in hot water, too. In one conversation, Mary confided in the journalist her husband had shaved her pubic hair into a heart shape. “I wrote about it in the Mirror and circulation soared,” remembers Felicity. “The next day I was sent for by the editor and told I had been reported to the press council! But it got Mary in the paper two days running.” "},{"url":null,"title":"new consent condoms require two","story":"NewsNew consent condoms which require two people to open packaging on saleConsent Pack condoms have been designed by Tulipan in Argentina after some alarming research about sex was releasedShareCommentsByBradley Jolly:,  APR Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news world-news video new-consent-condoms-require-two-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News ,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News ,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true\"\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email New packaging for condoms which can only be opened by two people at once has been created to help promote consent.The consent condoms can only be used when four hands simultaneously press special pressure points on the side of the packet. Tulipan, which has created the bizarre design, will first give them out for free at bars and nightclubs in Argentina and then hope to market them in shops. And the response has so far been hugely positive. Tulipan has always spoken of safe pleasure but for this campaign we understood that we had to talk about the most important thing in every sexual relationship - pleasure is possible onlyyou both give your consent first, Joaquin Campins, a campaigner said. Health professionals have also welcomed the packets.    Walter Ghedin, a psychiatrist and sexologist in the country, said: The agreement in sexual relations should be a guideline that begins before, during and after any relationship, it implies respect, mutual pleasure and confidentiality. The use of contraceptive methods is one of the issues that should be agreed upon, and the use of the prophylactic appears as a necessary question in both fleeting and stable relationships. The independent aposMedicos del Mundoaposorganisation has recently stressed the value of condoms in the fight against HIV and AIDS.  Their plea came after a survey found only .% of Argentinian men said they regularly used condoms during sex. Some % said they occasionally used condoms while an alarming .% said they had never used a condom. AHF Argentina, an organisation which campaigns for the rights of people who are HIV positive, condemned the results at the time.

Mt Pike is now facing a fitness to practise committee hearing by the Education Workforce Councilafter making the alleged inappropriate comments, reports Wales Online. Mr Pike faces  allegations regarding comments he allegedly made to pupils, which the EWC say were inappropriate - nine of which the regulatory body say were sexually motivated. They include allegedly calling a student who had a parent who was gay an experiment and saying a pupil who was conscious about her weight, that she would break a stoolshe sat on it.    Another student claims that she was referred to as a -year-old virgin that would never get married. The EWC say that the allegations constitute unacceptable professional conduct. Mr Pike admitted to three of the allegations, including telling a pupil they would break a stoolthey sat on it - but denied the rest. Science teacher Mr Pike has taught at the school in Llanelli from . He was made Head of Chemistry in  and also a form teacher, the hearing on Tuesday in Cardf was told. But in March , two pupils in Year  made allegations against Mr Pike that he had made inappropriate comments. Overall,  students were interviewed by the school over alleged comments made by Mr Pike that were of a racial, homophobic or sexual nature. Presenting officer for the EWC, Cadi Dewi, said that allegations included Mr Pike suggesting an overweight pupil may break a chairshe sat on it, calling an Asian student aposStanapos or aposSteveapos as he could not pronounce his name and telling a student whose mother was gay that he was aposan experimentapos.    Another student claims that she was referred to as a -year-old virgin that would never get married and when she went to retrieve a phone that had been confiscated, was told thatshe went into her teacheraposs pocket, where she thought it was, she would have a surprise at what she found in there. One other pupil, who had tally markings on a periodic table worksheet she was handed in a chemistry class by Mr Pike, alleges she was asked by him: Is that how many boys you are on . Pupil L, who the allegation refers to, said the comment made her feel incredibly embarrassed. He said that comment in front of other pupils, she said. Some of them laughed, some of them appeared shocked. I was incredibly embarrassed and the fact it was said in front in a way that meant other people heard it, made me feel more embarrassed. I did feel incredibly uncomfortable in his class, she added. I felt as thought he was deliberately embarrassing me. It was not an appropriate comment to make in front of other people. Itaposs stuck in my mind since it happened.    Mr Pike said that he had no specic knowledge of the incident, but there were sometimes I needed to tell pupils to stop talking about boyfriends or girlfriends. Mr Pike is also to have allegedly said to another pupil who asked where the smell of burning was coming from, that it must be your thighs rubbing together. Following the initial investigation in March, Mr Pike remained at the school and continued to teach science lessons. But in December , further allegations were made, by another pupil - Pupil A. Pupil A, a Year  pupil at the time, was taught Chemistry by Mr Pike and had him as a form teacher, the hearing heard on Tuesday. She alleges that he took off her coat numerous times, touched or held her hand when she was passed items such as pens and folders numerous times and claims on December ,  that Mr Pike said to her: [Pupil A], why are you lunging towards me  There is no mistletoe here. During her evidence she said similar incidents happened more than three times.    She said it made her feel uncomfortable and creeped out. She also alleges that Mr Pike would try to hold her hand when passing her pens, folders and work for more than five seconds. It made me feel strange and quite sick, she said. It washe was holding my hand. It was unnecessary. In regards to the comment, Pupil A said that she felt uncomfortable and scared. At the time, I was leaving the classroom to go to my next lesson. I was just passing by. I was not the first person to leave the classroom. Mr Pike accepted he made the comment but as a tongue in cheek joke that was misplaced and made in the heat of the moment, Mr Adkins, representing Mr Pike, said. He denies the two other allegations in regards to Pupil A. An investigation, headed by retired former policeman Mr Steven Mears, was started by the school after the latter allegations were made. The schoolaposs disciplinary procedure was followed and Mr Pike was referred to the EWC. Mr Pike was suspended in December . No police action was taken.    Mr Colin Adkins, representing Mr Pike, said he denies nine of the allegations, saying they were taken out of context. On Tuesday, the current head teacher of the school, Mrs Tracy Senchal, said that pupils told her there was a climate of feeling uncomfortable around Mr Pike in lessons. Mr Adkins, however, argued the school are trying to find allegations against Mr Pike. Mr Pike accepts three of the allegations - the statement to Pupil A, asking a pupilthey were humming or singing a tribal or traditional song, and telling a pupil they would break a stoolthey sat on it.

To mark National Ramen Day Japanese food expert Bonnie Chung has explained the correct way to eat them - and highlighted the mistakes lots of us make. Only seven per cent of Brits will slurp their noodles, and many believe itaposs rude so - but itaposs actually the correct traditional method. Japanese food expert Bonnie Chung explains that to eat ramen, diners should pick the bowl up with their hands and start by smelling the broth. Then using chopsticks, put up your a bunch of noodles and pull them fully out of the liquid.    Bring your mouth right forward to avoid it splashing and purse your lips. The put the noodles in your mouth and start slurping - the nosier the better! Other mistakes people make is not using chopsticks with just  per cent of people using them correctly, while  per cent try and eat them using western cutlery According to Bonnie, founder of Japanese home cooking brand Miso Tasty, there are also a few mistakes lots of people make when cooking noodles at home. Bonnie says: Sticky, mushy, slimy noodles is exactly what we want to avoid when cooking a dish like ramen.    Like pasta, noodles should always have that al dente bite - or aposshikoshikoapos as it’s known in Japan. But unlike pasta, instead of going straight from the pan to your bowl, you should immediately rinse them in water to remove any starch, which is what creates that sticky texture. From there, rest your noodles in ice cold water while you prep your other ingredients. While it might sound crazy to put your noodles on ice, it immediately stops them from continuing to cook and turning mushy. Then just before you’re ready to serve, simply reheat for  seconds in simmering water. Apparently  per cent of Brits snap their noodles before they pop them in the pan - which is a big no-no as they are the symbol of le in Japanese culture.    Bonnie said: Noodles are a symbol of le in Japanese culture and eating them is considered a very special experience that should be savoured and enjoyed. But a lot of Brits associate them with quick, cheap convenience food and the rise of instant noodles means many people have never actually learnt how to cook them well. Itaposs also such a shame that nearly half the population say they never cook Japanese food from scratch. It doesnapost have to be a scary or complicated process - so long as you get your hacks nailed and your routine mastered, amazing Japanese food can be created in your own kitchen.

For me it’s something we can’t dwell on.“We’ve got to look at it, but we can’t dwell on it because the games are coming thick and fast.“We will have another three or four home games between now and the end of the season so it’s important we have the confidence to deal with it.”The Dons take on the Steelmen following Saturday’s - defeat to Hearts at Tynecastle.McInnes was disappointed his men couldn’t triumph having led -.It was the second game in a row Aberdeen failed to capitalise on a winning position, having led Livingston prior to the international break before drawing -.McInnes added: “We left the game with nothing and when you see a strong performance in the first half and we still got into some strong positions in the second half, it was disappointing to lose, particularly the manner of goals we lose where we are looking to score a second and then concede a needless penalty .“Then there are a couple of mistakes for the second goal.“What you always expect away from home is that the home team is going to have a spell in the game. We dominated the first half, but it is naive to think that at some point the home team aren’t going to rally and put some sort of pressure on you.“But we’re disappointed that from a winning position we couldn’t capitalise on that. We were very strong in the first half andwe can get something close to that over  minutes in this game we’ll have a good chance of winning the game.“Even the last game before the international break against Livingston we were coming into that from two games against the Old Firm where a lot of energy was expanded.“We spoke about the importance of a good start and got in front but then conceded just before half-time.“We’ve had loads of games in my time here where we haven’t necessarily been brilliant in games but - was enough.“We’d take that tonight so it’s important we get our clean sheet and make sure we have some sort of control to the game.“We want to make sure we have a consistency over the  minutes. If we can get that, we don’t need to be brilliant for  minutes, butwe can get the consistency and make sure we don’t gt opportunities to the opposition it can go a long way to getting the result.“At times we have been guilty of gting cheap goals uncharacteriscally for us and this season more than in the past that could be aimed at us.”This evening’s opponents Motherwell have won seven of their last  games and still have a chance of finishing in the top six, although the Lanarkshire men trail sixth-placed Hibs by five points with only two games left before the split.McInnes said: “Regardless of whether they make top six or not, their form in the last - weeks has been very good.“They have still got a physical element to their team, but they have got a bit more than that.“Stephenhas changed the system and the personnel to allow them to be a good counter-attacking team and allow them to play in dferent ways. They can play through the lines and they can play direct into Curtis Main, so they still have that element to the team.“They have picked up a lot of good results at home and on the road they have still produced some big results.“We have our work cut out, but I think regardless of who we are playing it’s important we focus on ourselves.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/03/5c9e3170e57655.65257708-e1553874169592.jpg ","title":"adopt a pet midnight josie and donald are looking for a new home can you help","story":"Are you looking to get a new pet  Why not adopt one of these adorable pets from Mrs Murray’s Cat and Dog Home.Midnight and his wonderful moustache are both five years old.This dapper boy likes to keep himself to himself, but he does enjoy cuddlesthey’re offered.

This area of Argyll is the most fragile in the region. The people of Argyll, businesses and visitors deserve no less.Forget the squandering of £m on unreliable, mitigation measures trying to justy a flawed decision made many years ago to use the Old Military Road as a ersion which has failed on many occasions and now has a landslip between the two roads. Forget the expensive excavation of pits by the A rather use the cuttings into the hillside to form a two lane road protected with a flow over canopy with closed outer edges at the four problems gullies. If the contractors on the present scheme can work without any road closures then the flow over canopy option would not lead to closures as many officials and some politicians claim.This is a red herring postponing #a proper solution#. When this is option is completed it will save on the expense of manning the ersion route involving - personnel and - vehicles, replacing expensive nettings, delays whilst the farmer clears his animals and collect his fees. A scandalous waste of public money. Solve The Rest Landslides and stop wasting on mitigating measures.Like Brendan O#Hara I#m neither an engineer or geologist but both of us are blessed with plain common sense. If the Faroese can build a tunnel at £.m per kilometre surely a simple open sided m canopy would cost considerably less. In  at Dawlish .km of double tracked railway and .km of sturdy seawall was built at a cost of £m in eight weeks. Why have we in Argyll after nine years, four dferent Transport Ministers and £m spent and still have no guaranteed safe passage   on The Rest and Be Thankful Follow the Argyll Advertiser#s campaign #Invest in the Rest#. Transport Minister Michael Matheson, Transport Scotland and our Government must abandon their obsession with mitigation measures and fund a permanent solution. We demand no less.Sir,Calls for assurances that the Rest and Be Thankful section of the A will be improved to resist future landslides were made during a session of Transport, Infrastructure and Connectivity questions in the Scottish Parliament.I quizzed transport secretary Michael Matheson, about what was discussed at the last meeting of the A Taskforce in November , and asked what assurances the Cabinet Secretary could give to local residents and businesses who rely on the A being open at all times.The Rest and Be Thankful was closed off for nine days in October  following the largest landslide in a decade, forcing road users to either take a major ersion, or to use the Old Military Road during certain hours of the day.A number of petitions were created during the period of the incident, including one by myself, calling for a permanent solution to the Rest and Be Thankful.The transport secretary said that the meeting was #full and frank#, and that there would be a #review of the potential for additional landslide mitigation measures at the Rest and Be Thankful#, and that this would be discussed at the next A Taskforce meeting in March .There was also a commitment that Argyll and Bute would be #prioritised# in the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.I welcome the assurances by the transport secretary that there will be a review of any additional measures for the Rest and Be Thankful, and that Argyll and Bute will receive priority at the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.Donald Cameron, MSPReserve forcesSir,Last issue#sletter raising concerns about the UK government’s proposed use of the army’s reserve force in the event of a no-deal Brexit is timely.In case anyone out there still thinks a no-deal Brexit is a good idea it’s worth noting that the legal authorityof Reserve Forces Act  allowing the Secretary of State to take this step requires him to establish that it is necessary #for the alleviation of distress or the preservation of le or property in time of disaster or apprehended disaster#.Enough said.Frances Roberts, Ardrishaig"},{"url":null,"title":"honours even for red star in argyll derby","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Ropework played host to this keenly contested local derby which was watched by a healthy crowd on Saturday February .And for the second time this season, Red Star and Campbeltown Pupils shared the points in a match both sides will feel they could have won.Both sides were struggling for fluency in the opening stages but Red Star settled first and grabbed the opening goal after  minutes. A long ball to the right hand side was met by Ryan Caskie who cut the ball back to Stuart McLean. The youngster took a touch before slotting past the Pupils# goalkeeper to give Star a - lead.Star continued to press and doubled their lead when Coll McCallum robbed the Pupils# defender on the edge of the box before cutting the ball across goal. The unfortunate Pupils# defender could only ert the ball into the empty net, with McLean waiting on a tap in. The game continued at a frantic pace, however, there was no further scoring in the first half and Star went in with a - advantage.Pupils came out with purpose in the second half as they looked to force themselves back into the game, however, it was a howler from Red Star which allowed them back into the match.A square ball across the back resulted in a mix-up between Star keeper Luke Kalache and defender Ben Forbes which allowed Donald McCallum to prod the ball home from just inside the box and Pupils were back in the game at - with eight second half minutes gone.The home side didn’t recover from this and you could sense a nervousness that gave the visitors plenty encouragement. The equaliser arrived with  minutes remaining when good play from Pupils down the right by Soudan saw him get a low cross in which was met by the on-rushing run of Ryan Deans and he finished well to level the score at -.This set up a frantic finish and both sides could have nicked it towards the end. Pupils went close with a headed effort which was clawed to safety while at the other end there was a goalmouth scramble which Star couldn’t convert and both sides had to settle for a draw in the end as referee Jimmy Litster blew for full time.Red Star were dealt a blow as it emerged that captain Aaron Moore suffered a dislocated shoulder. Hopefully this will not keep him out for too long.On Saturday February , Star have another important home game as they look to move off the bottom of the table when they take on Claremont AFC.

What a lovely morning.To all who sent cards for my th, including the community council, the Wednesday Club, the Inveraray Highland Games , my warmest thanks. And many thanks to those who helped me up after my fall and in particular Stuart Campbell of Brambles who took me to the surgery, whose very kind people cleaned me up and sent me on my way to my party half an hour later.And a mention to Take the Floor too on Radio Scotland on Saturday night. Thank you Inveraray and District Accordion and Fiddle Club and Margaret Mather our secretary for this request.So I won#t forget my th in a hurry, but such kindness and friendliness cannot be forgotten ever.My thanks to you all,Niall Iain MacLean, InveraraySir,I read with great interest the letter in the March  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser from C Rees, Lochgilphead.In addition to all that was mentioned I wonderyour readers are acquainted with the McCrone Report which was written in the s As I’m sure your readers are aware this was when oil had just started flowing from the North Sea. Mr Gavin McCrone was, at that time, a civil servant instructed to write a report on the possible effects of North Sea Oil on the argument for Scotland’s devolution.This quote comes from a letter written, by Mr McCrone, in April : #The Paper was written over a year ago in the weeks immediately before the February  election. This will be particularly apparent on page  where, of course, the ministerial pronouncements referred to relate to the Conservative Government.#So he was instructed to write this report by a Conservative Government but was reporting to a Labour Government.This quote comes from the end of the letter: #When my paper was written it was classied “secret” and given only a most restricted circulation in the Scottish Office because of the extreme sensitivity of the subject.#The report discussed the possibility of Scottish Independence and came to the conclusion: #What is quite clear is that the balance of payments gain from North Sea oil would easily swamp the existing deficit whatever its size and transform Scotland into a country with a substantial and chronic surplus.#Now, this is a very tiny segment from a document that could have changed our history but that’s in the past and we must now look to the future.What is upsetting is thatthis wealth had been invested in an oil fund or more fairly distributed by the  British Government # either Conservative or Labour # there might not, now, be an upsurge in support for separation from Westminster.Wilma Watts, TarbertSir,With Theresa May’s Brexit deal yet again failing to get through the House of Commons and a delay to the date the UK is due to leave the EU, it is clear that we are simply lurching from crisis to crisis.One wonders what good an extension will actually do given the negotiating position of both the EU and the UK. The UK is deadlocked, in terms of its people, Parliament and Cabinet and the likelihood of any semblance of a deal that command the majority of the House of Commons is unlikely. This is especially true given the deep isions within the Tories, both Remainers and Leavers, as well as opposition from the DUP.Given this situation those like myself have long argued that a UK-wide referendum on the deal, a so-called ‘People’s Vote’, with the option to remain in the EU, is the only credible way to break this deadlock. For those who argue that this would damage our democratic process, I am not sure we can slump any lower than the situation we are currently in.As David Davis, the former Brexit Secretary and an ardent Leaver, pointed out before the EU referendum: #If a democracy cannot change its mind, it ceases to be a democracy.#There are few I know who voted for Brexit in the belief it would make them poorer, and it is up to the public to give its view on whether the deal, and more importantly its implications, are what it wants.For once I agree with Jacob Rees-Mogg who previously supported a vote on the renegotiated settlement. A statement he now curiously seems to have forgotten.The Scottish Parliament has led the way in backing a People’s Vote and now that we know the precise nature of the deal, it is up to the public to have its say.Alex Orr, Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures week 12","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowPIC:This beautul sunset across Loch Etive at Connel was taken with a mobile phone by Fiona McCuish from Ardrishaig."},{"url":null,"title":"athletes tackle the crinan puffer","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowOver  pairs of running shoes were strapped on for this year#s Scottish Sea Farms Crinan Puffer on Sunday March .Athletes from as far as Dunoon, Campbeltown, Mid Argyll and beyond came to join the race # billed as one of Scotland#s friendliest and most inclusive running events.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a £, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":null,"title":"bob shields need future plan","story":"NewsBob Shields: We need future plan for Ayr town centreRetail on our High Street is deadShareByAyrshire Post:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR News\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAt least five years ago – and certainly a whole elected council ago – I wrote on this page that Ayr town centre would have to change . . . or die. So please, allow me to confess that I actually got this the wrong way round. What I should have said was - Ayr town centre is going to have to die . . . and then change. And for better or for worse, that’s exactly where we are today. Our retail sector’s passing away was slow and painful. The ‘For Sale’ signs on our shop fronts began as a malady that grew into an illness - and finally became a virulent pandemic that was completely out of anybody’s control. The boarding up of a whole section of the “bottom of the town” was a warning symptom that our town centre was seriously ill. By the time BHS brought down their shutters for the final time – we were on le support. And our financial heart finally stopped beating when the leviathan that was once Hourstons was declared deceased on February . A post mortem in last week’s Ayrshire Post showed a record  shops in Ayr now lie empty. And alongside the report, a quote from council leader Douglas Campbell that . . “we have to ensure that our town centres become much more erse and about more than just shops”. I couldn’t have put it better myself, Mr Campbell. In fact, it’s almost exactly how I did put it . . . five years ago! To be fair to Mr Campbell and his Nationalist cohorts, five years ago they were languishing in opposition to a bullying Tory regime. While Big Chief Sitting Bill McIntosh ruled the class of  with  Tory councillors and some Labour nodding donkeys – the nine elected Nats sat in the naughty corner with as much power as my electric cigarette charger. After the  elections, it was role reversal. Labour jumped ship to prop up the Nats and now it’s the Tories who sit powerless – with a self-inflicted lurch from hapless to helpless. And following decades of Tory droning and dithering, the Nats of  looked like they might actually deliver something. Two years into their administration, we’ve witnessed everything from diddyness to dizziness. After last year’s budget farce and the great “Riverside Carbuncle” – the council tax paying public were right to wonderthis mob could run a tap - never mind a local authority! But in announcing their ambitious plans for a park, leisure complex, sports centre and the demolition of Burns House – we have to askour council has finally turned a corner that isn’t a blind alley  Have we reached that “rain in Spain moment” in My Fair Lady where the potty Professor Higgins finally says, “I think she’s got it!” Has SAC finally “got it”  Let’s hope so. If not – the “unprecedented funding” of £ million they’re ploughing into this will be the greatest waste of money in SAC history.The elephant in the room, of course, is the “building next to the Ayr Station”.How SAC can have a “vision” for Ayr town centre – without first resolving this nightmare – doesn’t make sense.Just in case they hadn’t noticed, the big sandstone thing draped in white IS the centre of Ayr!

That was for £ - and was made over a year ago, Ayr Sherf Court heard. Yet social media pages during that time show Annabel Laurenson on days out all over south-west Scotland. They also show a new family car and pay-to-view sports channels in her family home. Laurenson was lucky to escape jail when sentenced at Ayr Sherf Court in February . She admitted stealing from the Nicola Jayne Flowers business in Girvan on dates between January ,  and December , . Laurenson was ordered to complete  hours of unpaid work, and to pay back £ in compensation to her former bosses. The total value of cash and goods she stole was estimated at much more than this figure.    And the hurt and distress caused to her former employers, who were also her friends, can’t be quantied. Defence lawyer John Gallagher last week told Ayr Sherf Court that Laurenson, , had completed her unpaid work. But he admitted the only repayment she has made was the £ she turned up at court with - on the day of her sentence in February last year. Mr Gallagher claimed Laurenson, of Girvan’s Maxwell Street, had hoped to secure a loan from her father. But he died in November, and the costs of his care and his funeral made this impossible. “She is unemployed, but her husband is in work, and she is well aware this has to be repaid,” said Mr Gallagher. The lawyer said the remainder of Laurenson’s father’s estate would have to be shared with her mother and siblings. “How much is she likely to inherit ” asked Sherf John Montgomery. “I’m not sure,” said Mr Gallagher. “But not enough to pay this back.”    “The time for repayment has lapsed,” said Sherf Montgomery bluntly. Mr Gallagher insisted that Laurenson was anxious to pay the outstanding £. He asked the sherf to revoke the original payback order, and instruct a new compensation order. Mr Gallagher said Laurenson could pay £ per month, and Sherf Montgomery agreed to the request. Laurenson had worked at the popular Dalyrmple Street business for many years, and was a trusted member of staff. Shop owner Nicola Jayne Purdie said she was ‘devastated’ to find out her colleague and friend was ripping her off. She said at the time of last year’s sentence: “She stole a substantial amount of money and stock. There has been absolutely no remorse. She hasn’t said sorry. I feel betrayed. This is a family business and we were working together for  years.”Nicola Jayne said the theft came to light after she noticed discrepancies within the business. Laurenson who shared family occasions with the Purdies, including parties, weddings and funerals, offered no explanation for her behaviour.

May she be of faith, of modestyhellip But she is stopped in her tracks by the voice of a brash American Deloris.Mother Superior continues: ldquoPerhaps the choir of angels drowned me out and you didnrsquot hear me Lord.Pam plays the exasperated Mother Superior prissy and clipped, with subtle comedy delivered in perfect tone.Of course things donrsquot run smoothly for the ghetto-fabulous a-turned-nun as you probably can imagine. It isnrsquot long before Deloris ruffles Mother Superiorrsquos habit and puts the nuns in danger, which leads to Deloris being given just one simple activity, joining the choir.Can she really unleash the songbirds trapped inside these nuns  This is when the show steps up a notch, and, although all dressed in habits, the audience can start to identy with the lead characters.In steps jolly Sister Mary Patrick, played by the enigmatic Claire Bell, along with Sister Mary Robertas the timid church mouse, and deadpan choir director Sister Mary Lazaruswho fully captured the gravelly voiced cantankerous nun. Her reprisal of the screen character is uncanny and garners lots of laughs from the audience.When the large ensemble of nuns gathered together, I did feel a sense of sisterhood and that they were each playing dferent characters despite having a minor role or no dialogue. Their pitch perfect delivery of lsquoRaise Your Voicersquo and lsquoTake Me To Heavenrsquo would draw the crowds into any church Irsquom sure.Playing the leading lady is no easy task, but in scene after scene Nicola embraces Deloris and puts her own sass and ghetto style into the character, belting out powerful tunes. To sum up her performance, what better words to use than those of Deloris Van Cartier herself ndash shersquos lsquoFabulous Babyrsquo!The last time I saw Lizzie Bell she was stumbling about drunk and shouting at a group of young kids, so I was shocked to see her convert to a Catholic nun. Of course, Lizzie was in character then as the vile orphanage boss Miss Hannigan, for Annie, performed by the Kids Innerleithen Theatre in November last year. The young actress shows true ersity, by portraying the meek Sister Mary Roberts with an enchanting solo performance.Although the female performances were powerful, they did not overshadow the male cast. Roger Brydon, Stewart Wilson and Colin Tweedie had me in tears as bumbling henchmen Joey, TJ and Pablo. Their comical performance of lsquoLady In The Long Black Dressrsquo didnrsquot leave females in the audience weak at the knees, but it did conjure up a few belly laughs!David Paterson was cast as Curtis who played the mob boss brilliantly, dominating the stage fiercely. And mild mannered officer Eddie Souterwho gave a cracking solo, proves he lsquoCould Be That Guyrsquo going from lsquoSweaty Eddiersquo to lsquoCool Copper, saving Deloris and winning her heart. A special mention to Jamie McCubbin, as the Irish Monsignor OrsquoHara ndashI closed my eyes Irsquod swear it was Father Ted!Needless to say the cast were at the top of their game, but anyone going to the show will no doubt be dazzled by the glitzy backdrop and detailed stained glass art of the fictional Catholic church. And the sensational costumes had more sparkle than a disco ballhellipand for habits, thatrsquos no mean feat.Sister Act had the congregation of the Memorial Hall hailing Hallelujah and taking us all to heaven, with what I can only sum up as a musical godsend."},{"url":null,"title":"asdas-arrival-drove-wilderhaugh-to-become-best-in-scotland","story":"A GALASHIELS petrol station is officially the best in Scotland.And the boss of Shells Wilderhaugh Filling Station admits it was the arrival of supermarket competition which drove his company to success.Wilderhaughs retail manager Richard Garrie collected the Scottish Large Forecourt of the Year trophy during the Forecourt Trader Awards in London.Richard described his firms fightback following the arrival of a local supermarket four years ago, which knocked fuel volumes by  percent overnight.He said: \"We thought long and hard about how to tackle this.\"We realised that one thing we can offer our customers that a local supermarket cant, is good old-fashioned service.\"Even before Shell did it we put our own local attendants back on the forecourt and customers really appreciated it.\"We also launched a ppl-off fuel promotion for six months, which meant we were ppl cheaper than the local Asda.\"The promotion is linked to buying a car wash, and has been so successful we still run it occasionally.

be launched in the Borders in a bid to meet recycling targets and reduce waste contamination.Scottish Borders Councilhas defended its recycling performance, following concerns.At a meeting of the council on Thursday, March , the authorityrsquos executive member for roads and infrastructure councillor Gordon Edgar fielded questions from concerned opposition councillors.Hawick and Hermitage councillor David Patersonasked: ldquoIs it true that more and more recycling waste is put into landfill by the company we use due to the amount of contamination in the recycling ldquoI am informed that this has increased quite dramatically from previous years and would like to know how much extra this is costing Scottish Borders Council.ldquoDo you not think that this is a real let down for the vast majority of people in the Borders who faithfully recycle Selkirkshire councillor Edgar pointed out that the local authority performs very well against its contamination targets: ldquoThe quantity of contaminated material collected, in terms of the councilrsquos kerbside recycling service, has remained fairly static in recent years at around  per cent.ldquoIn the last  months, the council has only once exceeded the target contamination level outlined in its recycling contract.ldquoContamination is an important factor, and officers are currently developing a communications campaign to increase awareness, reduce contamination and increase recycling rates.ldquoI would like to take this opportunity to thank the public for their continued support for the councilrsquos waste and recycling service, and ask them to continue to play their part.A Scottish Border Council spokesperson said: ldquoIn  the Scottish Environment Protection Agency indicated that the average contamination of material accepted at material recover facilities is around  per cent but in some cases is as high as  per cent.ldquoBased on this, Scottish Borders Council continues to perform well but as ever there is room for improvement.The councilrsquos failure to meet national recycling targets was also brought up by Leaderdale and Melrose councillor Kevin Drum .He asked: ldquoHow does the council plan to ensure it meets the Scottish Governmentrsquos targets for recycling, which is  per cent of household waste recycled or prepared for re-use by  Councillor Edgar admitted that the council has fallen well short of the governmentrsquos targets, but added that compared to areas such as the Orkney Islands and Dumfries and Galloway, the council is performing well.He told the chamber: ldquoThe Scottish Governmentrsquos recycling targets are aspirational and targeted as a whole, and therefore the council currently has no statutory obligation to meet these targets.ldquoScottish Borders Council is achieving a recycling rate of . per cent and performing extremely well when compared against its rural family group of Scottish authorities, which achieved a recycling rate of . per cent over the same period.,params: .pushldquoOver the last four years the council has taken a number of steps towards improving its recycling performance, including the introduction of a footways collection service, upgrades to community recycling centres, as well as introducing reuse schemes at a number of facilities, and working with local community groups and the third sector.ldquoGoing forward, the council is in the process of developing a new waste transfer station, which will enable the council to close its landfill site, and ert waste for treatment, while also capturing potentially recyclable waste.ldquoIn addition, the council is also looking at an education and awareness campaign.ldquoAchieving the Scottish Governmentrsquos aspirational target of  per cent is likely to be extremely challenging, requiring signicant change and investment nationally.The average rate of recycling household waste for Scottish authorities is  per cent, but East Renfrewshire, West Lothian and Clackmannanshire have all hit the  per cent mark."},{"url":null,"title":"local-msp-investigated-over-non-disclosure-in-holyrood-debate","story":"A LOCAL MSP is facing a standards investigation amid

The wood surrounds a lake of the same name, which is actually a reservoir created  years ago.Pressmennan Lake is nearly km long and meanders through the wood, giving the appearance of a river rather than a loch. In summer, the lush canopy of trees which surround the lake can engulf the senses, and for a moment you can be fooled into thinking you are in the middle of an ancient forest.And in a sense, you are. The wood is a fragmentary remnant of the ancient oak wood which once covered most of our county. Records show it existed in medieval times, and Irsquom sure well before that.Much of it was felled, so tradition tells us, when the warship The Great Michael was built on the order of James IV around . This ship was famously constructed using the oak woods of Fe, but such was the size of the vessel that wood from where was also needed, including Pressmennan.Yet the wood seems to have survived, and in  the felling of trees here is said to have been stopped due to its importance as a habitat for the kingrsquos deer.It remains a place rich in wildle. Roe deer still roam free amidst the trees here. They are creatures of woodland magic, and native to these isles. They are small and nimble-footed, and will dart into the undergrowth at the sight or sound of approaching danger. They have short antlers and a tailless rear, which usually has a white patch. This is the part of the animal you most likely see, as it quickly bounds away from you.The wood is full of other wildle: owls and bats, hares and foxes, stoats and weasels, and, according to the Woodland Trust Scotland, who own and care for the wood, otters have also been seen in the lake. The birdle here is likewise rich, and there is a crescendo of song in the spring. The trust acquired the wood in  and is slowly restoring it to its natural character, planting oak and other native trees.We arrived at the wood last weekend, on a day of changeable weather, but laden with the promise of spring. There is a childrenrsquos map provided by the Woodland Trust and it proved a great hit for my kids, who followed the loch-side path looking for the features identied.These are wood carvings and sculptures made by artist Robin Wood. Part of the trail includes doors and windows in the trees which are said to be the homes of magical creatures called the Tootflits and Glingbobs.My children, well-versed in the folklore traditions of our county, know all about faeries, brownies, selkies, kelpies, witches and wizards. But Tootflits and Glingbobs were new to them, and to be honest myself as well.They are mythical creatures created by the artist and trust to provide a sense of wonder and adventure for children as they explore the wood. You can search for their homes and the wood sculptures along the way.And so we set off on our adventure of discovery. The path by the riverbank needs care with wee ones when wet, but it whispers magic. Ancient oak trees line the banks of the lake, their branches dipping into the water.These old trees were still leafless, biding their time for the arrival of spring proper. But they were a spine-tingling sight, a reminder of what once was here in abundance. But then, as we ventured deeper into the wood, we made a less pleasant discovery.Some people had decided it was a good idea to hammer coins into the sculptures, and even into the living trees. We found the homes of the Tootflits, and at their door was a pile of rusting coins which had clearly been left as a gt or good luck charm. Rusting coins also lay all around the base of the tree.I understand the desire to leave a gt or charm for a magical creature, but polluting and damaging nature with the ultimate symbol of materialism was, for me, horribly ironic.We removed what we could, and my daughter Skye searched for a more suitable gt. She found a small lsquofaerie cuprsquo, which was the cupule of an acorn, and placed it on the doorstep.ldquoThere, she said, with a sense of satisfaction.We continued our search but we found every sculpture defaced in the same way. One had actually collapsed due to the splintering and rot caused by the coins being hammered into it.The final sculpture was a frog on a log. It too was peppered with coins hammered into its body. In the universal measure of things, this damage was insignicant and perhaps even well-meaning, for I assume it was done by people who came to enjoy the wood and merely wanted to leave their charm here.But eventhere was no malice, it was a desecration. Then my heart tore as I watched my children scrape their fingers as they tried to pull the coins from the poor creature. But they were mostly rusted and too well-embedded.As we left the wood, I was reminded of a famous quote, attributed to the Native American chief Seattle: ldquoTake only memories and leave only footprints.The word lsquophotosrsquo is often used instead of memories but the message is the same, and now more powerful than ever. Itrsquos a worldwide issue ndash the desecration of natural sites by people who unthinkingly want to leave their mark. The coins that werenrsquot rusted we put in a charity box.The experience affected my daughter.ldquoCan you write about what we found, dad, and ask people not to do that  said Skye at bedtime. ldquoAsk them to find presents in nature, like faerie cups or stones or fallen branches or pine cones or berries, or even make a love heart shape in the ground. Faeries donrsquot like metal anyway or need money.And I promised her I would. As she slept, I kept my promise."},{"url":null,"title":"musselburgh-racecourse-business-continuing-to-be-conducted-in-private","story":"Musselburgh Racing Associated Committeewas established by East Lothian Council last February after the British Horseracing Authority threatened to pull the coursersquos licence to race over concerns about its governance.Relations between members of predecessor body Musselburgh Joint Racing Committee were described as ldquofestering.It was made up of four East Lothian councillors and three members of Lothians Racing Syndicate , the latter representing racing interests.But the two factions were described in an independent report as having ldquoconsiderable mistrust, weariness, resentment and bitterness.Staff under the previous committee threatened to strike and there were claims of a lack of transparency surrounding their meetings and decisions.The independent report by Pinsent Mason was branded commercially sensitive by East Lothian Council, which refused to publish it until an investigation by the Information Commissioner led to a redacted version being made public.In February last year, the council replaced the old management committee with MRAC, giving the council a - majority over LRS.However, MRAC has held only four public meetings in council chambers in Haddington Town Hall since it was set up, with  of the  items of business on the agenda heard in private.On each occasion, the council has cited Local GovernmentAct , paragraph six, which allows it to exclude the public for ldquoinformation relating to the business affairs of particular persons other than the authority.East Lothian Council said that it ldquolooks to ensure that, as far as possible, committee matters are progressed in public.A spokesperson added: ldquoThe MRAC often considers matters in public session.ldquoAs with other committees, some reports may require to be held in private should they contain exempt information.Reports which have been withheld from the public include the current yearrsquos budget, financial reviews and racecourse general managerrsquos report.East Lothian Council is currently looking for a third-party operator to take over the running of the racecourse, which is on Common Good land.The hunt for a new operator is currently out to tender with hopes an appointment will be made before the end of this year."},{"url":null,"title":"prestonpans-shop-could-feature-on-bbc-show","story":"Corner Shop Cook Off is coming to screens across the country to show off the importance of local convenience stores in Scotland.The new show is presented by actress and musician Clare Grogan, with winner of MasterChef The Professionals Gary Maclean as the resident chef.Each week, a prominent Scottish chef will guest star, going head to head with Gary, only using ingredients from a selected local convenience store from around the country.The Day-Today on Redburn Road in Prestonpans has been selected as a possible store to feature on the show and,it is picked, the BBC portable kitchen will be set up in Prestonpans Town Hall for the event next month.The BBC said that it wanted the local shop owner and the customers to be the judges, adding: ldquoThis means we can really get into the heart of towns all over Scotland and show how essential the local convenience store really isIf confirmed, Corner Shop Cook Off will be filmed on April  and  in Prestonpans Town Hall."},{"url":null,"title":"celebrations-as-prestonpans-charity-elcap-marks-its-30th-birthday","story":"The Lighthouse Hub hosted the event with a buffet, guest speakers and local musicians.Even microphone problems and a broken slideshow couldnrsquot dampen the mood as the birthday bash opened with two pipers from Preston Lodge High School Pipe Band.Bette Francis, member of the ELCAP board, hosted the event, introducing the speakers: chief executive Paul White, ward councillor Fiona OrsquoDonnell, and lastly a moving testimony from fellow board member Kirstin Doherty.Paul White, who was appointed chief executive five months ago, started the talks by outlining the importance that ELCAP played within communities, a point that was reiterated by guest speaker Councillor Fiona OrsquoDonnell.The final speaker, Kirstin Doherty, a member of the ELCAP board, has been supported by the charity since .

There is a big waiting list in the county and we hope to open a base here.But planning officers urged councillors to reject LARrsquos proposals, regardless of their own efforts to build housing there two years ago.Iain McFarlane, head of planning, said that two years ago the council did not have its Local Development Plan approved and faced a shortage of land for affordable housing.Now the plan had been adopted, he said there was sufficient land supply for the next five years.He said allowing housing on the site would set an ldquoundesirable precedent, adding it would be ldquoselling our employment plans down the river.Councillor Kenny McLeod, committee member, said he was ldquodeeply uncomfortable about refusing planning permission on a site the council had tried to develop in the same way two years ago.At the time, council officers said the landowner rejected their pound, offer as too low.Robin Holder, representing LAR at the meeting, said the council had given written reassurance it would consider the site, which has lain empty since , for housing.He rejected claims that approving the plans would set a precedent, saying: ldquoThis is a small area, this site is a quarter of one per cent of land identied for industrial use in East Lothian. The site has been vacant for many years and the evidence suggests it will remain so.But Councillor Norman Hampshire said: ldquoI cannot support the application: it would send a message to other owners of land designated for business use.The committee rejected the planning application by six votes to three.Following the meeting, Ms Leslie said: ldquoNaturally we are disappointed at the decision and are considering whether to appeal against it.ldquoWe have worked very closely with East Lothian Council over the last three years on a number of projects to enhance the provision of good-quality affordable homes in the area and have enjoyed a very positive working relationship with them.ldquoOur proposal for Prestonpans was a design and build project for  homes, very similar to our recently completed development at the disused site of the former boatyard in Cockenzie. This proved to be extremely popular and was vastly oversubscribed, so there is an urgent need for homes like ours.ldquoWe understand that this site in Prestonpans had been earmarked for commercial use but, in the absence of any confirmed interest, we had hoped that our plans, which would enhance the local environment and provide much-needed affordable housing, would have been supported."},{"url":null,"title":"woman-was-five-and-a-half-times-over-drink-drive-limit-in-prestonpans","story":"Gayle Duffy has been banned for  months after she was caught with mcg of alcohol in ml

are being cared for in Musselburgh are in the process of being made.Early evaluation of the way services were being delivered since the launch of the Collaborative Working for Immediate Care service

seeing the right clinician at the right time for their specic needs.The new service, developed in partnership by Riverside, NHS  and ELHSCP, ensured that urgent care was dealt with on the same day and patients should have ldquono anxieties about being seen by the right professional at the right time.Through this new way of delivering patient care, it not only provided an increase in the number of patient appointments with practice GPs and other healthcare professionals, but also provided an increase in appointmentfor patients with complex needs.A recent survey conducted within the practice demonstrated that more than half of patients agreed that they did not always need to see a GP.Work is also under way by ELHSCP to implement a new telephone and IT system that will support call demand into the practice.The importance of patient involvement in getting services right is ldquovery much recognised by the practice, which is encouraging residents to get involved with the Patient Participation Group.Speaking after meeting with the Cabinet Secretary, Mr Beattie said: ldquoI would like to assure all of my constituents that patient care is of paramount importance and that all agencies involved in the new way services are being delivered within Musselburgh Primary Care Centre are focused on delivering the best care possible.ldquoRiverside Medical Practice is working with other organisations to ensure that improvements are made and I would encourage anyone with any issues regarding the practice to get in touch with them and become involved with the patient participation group.ldquoI am hopeful that the improvements being made by the organisations will be seen by patients and a vastly improved service will be delivered.ldquoI will continue to closely monitor the future performance of the practice and ask patients to keep me advised on whether the improvements are

Thankfully no one heard me asking for it but the embarrassment of having to ask was enough to spur me on.ldquoAt this point, on what should have been an exciting time, I was left feeling down, and it was then that I decided that it was time to lose weight.ldquoNever again did I want to be in that position of asking for an extension. The next time I was flying I wanted to be able to buckle up like any other person.ldquoWhen I ed, I decided to join Weight Watchers at Musselburgh Hope Church, and it was the best decision I have ever made.ldquoI have now lost more than four-and-a-half stones and feel fantastic. I find the Weight Watchers app amazing as its so easy to use and being able to track is really simple and motivating.ldquoI am a very fussy eater, and, on the plan, I can still have a treatI want. This makes le easy and no one really knows you are on a healthy eating plan as I can eat just like everyone .ldquoEverything about the Freestyle plan just suits me, and, even though I donrsquot eat meat or fish, I can still eat a lot of what I like.ldquoThe weekly workshops are very motivational and I love going. My wellness coach, Lisa Stewart, is so supportive, as well as all the other members.ldquoNow I can make the right choices, walk more and shop for clothes that I would never have been able to buy before. Clothes shopping has also become really enjoyable and less expensive as I no longer need to buy a size  but a rather smaller size .ldquoWalking has now become easier as I used to get breathless but this does not happen now.

Irsquom so glad I joined with Carole as I find it easy to follow.ldquoI can still eat my favourite snacks ndash crisps ndash which is something I was not prepared to give up. Thankfully I can enjoy these and still lose weight.ldquoDoing the Freestyle plan with Carole is really good although we do not always eat the same foods. The choice of foods that we can enjoy and eat means both us can enjoy what we want.ldquoThe support from the coach Lisa is fantastic and sometimes Irsquom the only male who stays for the weekly talk. This does not phase me as my weight loss is too important and everyone is really friendly. Even when my we canrsquot make it, I go on my own. Men should not be afraid of joining as Irsquove had a fantastic weight loss.ldquoMy food choices are now better and I pay more attention to what I eat. We both used to eat things like large bars of chocolate, deep-pan pizzas, lots of bread and cheese.

She called it Big Baby.She decided it was a girl and it became her favourite doll. It was soft and easy to cuddle, and Manja would take it with her everywhere.After years of being carried, played with and subjected to all manner of pampering with nail polish and make-up, the condition of the doll began to deteriorate.Then one day, Big Babyrsquos right leg came off! The seam holding the leg had torn and repeated repairs failed.At that time, I suggested we could replace her. But my daughter looked at me in horror: ldquoJust because she has one leg doesnrsquot mean I love her less.I remember being stung by my own insensitivity. Big Baby was not just an old doll, and I should have known that.Manja was six then. She is near  now. She has obviously grown in her games and play, yet Big Baby remains an important part of the family. But the loss of her dollrsquos leg led Manja into talking about disability. Over the years, it was a topic she wouldto when she was playing with her. She adapted clothes for Big Baby and refused to treat her as broken, or any less a doll.Then, recently, during one our story-making sessions together, she suddenly came up with this tale. We then wrote it down. I helped her with spelling and some phrases, but otherwise this is all her work and idea.I agree that children need to be taught empathy, but they often soon get it in ways adults forget, as I did. The discrimination and prejudice we encounter is taught by adults to children. Butwe listen to our children, they can often be the best teachers of understanding and empathy for us all.So here is Manjarsquos tale, which she titled The Magic Bracelet:Once there was an old man who had a foot which wouldnrsquot work and so he had dficulty walking.He had to use crutches and people said he was disabled, and because of this nobody would give him a job.So to get some money he would sit by the roadside and make porridge. Hersquod sell bowls of it to people who were walking by on their way to work. He told them that porridge was healthy and the best breakfast, which is true of course.So people would give him a penny for a bowl of his delicious porridge. That way he made some money.One day, while he was making his porridge, a young girl came and told him she would love to have a bowl of porridge but she had no money. The porridge maker gave the girl a kind smile.ldquoNever mind, he said, ldquoI always make extra just in case itrsquos needed.He handed her a bowl of porridge and she sat down and ate it. She was very hungry.As she gave the porridge-maker the bowl back, she noticed his crutches leaning against the wall.ldquoWhy do you have crutches  asked the girl.The porridge-maker looked sad and told her that he couldnrsquot walk very well because of his foot that wonrsquot work. He explained he needed his crutches to walk.The girl thought for a moment and smiled at the porridge-maker.ldquoI have a friend who can help you so you wonrsquot be disabled anymore, she said. The old man smiled at her, but this time it was a sad smile.ldquoThat is very kind of you, he said to the girl, ldquobut the doctors have told me that there is nothing that can be done to fix my foot, so I will be disabled for the rest of my le.ldquoPlease meet my friend, asked the girl. So the porridge-maker agreed.The girl helped him up and he walked slowly with his crutches with her. She took him to a beach.ldquoWait here, Irsquoll go get my friend, said the girl. The old man sat on the sand and waited for a long time. Eventually the girl ed.ldquoHere, she said, ldquotake my hand and Irsquoll take you to my friend. But first you must wear this shell bracelet.It was a beautul bracelet, made from dferent shells. He put it around his wrist.The porridge-maker went to pick up the crutches but the girl said: ldquoNo, leave them there, you will not need them.ldquoBut I canrsquot walk without them, he said. The girl just smiled and said: ldquoTrust me. So he did.She held his hand and slowly led him into the sea.He was hobbling at first, but the sea rose over his legs and his body got lighter in the water. Soon he was up to his waist in water.ldquoI cannot swim, said the porridge-maker, now feeling worried.ldquoTrust me, said the girl, ldquoI am wearing a bracelet as well, so we will e in together.So he trusted her and he ed into the water. Suddenly, he realised that there was some magic happening because he could breathe under the water. And he wasnrsquot cold or afraid.Then he saw the girlrsquos friend. She was a mermaid. ldquoWelcome, said the mermaid.ldquoYou see, said the girl, ldquoI told you my friend could help. The bracelet is magic, it gives you the ability to be like a mermaid and swim under the sea.The porridge-maker swam perfectly under the sea. He was not disabled under the sea. He could swim fast and he did circles and back flips. He smiled at the girl, this time a happy smile.ldquoThank you, he said. She smiled a happy smile back: ldquoMy friend said you can keep the bracelet and use it as often as you want.And so he did. And he realised it wasnrsquot his foot which made him feel disabled, but other people being unkind and making fun of him or treating him as useless.He still couldnrsquot walk well, but he knew he could breathe and swim under the water like a mermaid, while those who made fun of him couldnrsquot. And he could make the most delicious porridge ever. He understood now that although he had a disability, he was not disabled."},{"url":null,"title":"wallyfords-new-public-library-based-in-school-to-open","story":"The facility has been provided as part of the new Wallyford Primary School project at Futures Way to meet the demands of major new house building in the area.The library bears the name of Margaret Oliphant, a th-century writer from Wallyford.Born on April , , she died on June , .Alister Hadden, chairman of Wallyford Community Council, has given support about local historical events which are reflected in the new building.A spokesperson for East Lothian Council said: \"The community library has been named the Margaret Oliphant Library.\"The graphics on the internal windows, the old ship wheel from the former school badge and the external brickwork reflect aspects of Wallyfordrsquos history.\"This will be further developed in partnership with the community council and library over time.\"The library, which replaces the former library at Faside Buildings, has a separate entrance and exit when open for the public on: Monday and Tuesday, pm to pm Thursday, pm to pm Friday, am to pm and pm to pm Saturday, am to pm.

memberships.She said: ldquoBasically, the people I have spoken to, each and every one of us, will have to withdraw our membership.\"We have not got any other option.Over the past  years, since enjoyleisurersquos creation, the cregraveche service has been retained for the benefit of customers, despite operating at a shortfall.However, as user numbers continued to decline year upon year, the subsequent financial deficit increased the strain on the rest of the organisation.A spokeswoman for the group said ldquostrict adult to child ratios and current charging requirements reduce enjoyleisurersquos capacity of increasing income for this service, and at existing user levels, it is not possible to retain this provision at an affordable cost to customers.With ldquosubstantial increases in business operational costs and a drop in council funding, enjoyleisure took the decision to ldquore-evaluate its current financial and operational position in order to ensure the long-term sustainability and viability of the whole organisation.Mr Axon told the Courier: ldquoI also recognise the efforts of the lsquoChildren and Families of East Lothianrsquo, with whom I have met with personally, to outline our current position and provide further detail to the wider context within which has ultimately forced us into making these decisions.The general manager also described enjoyleisure staff as ldquoa credit to themselves.He added: ldquoWe would additionally like to take this opportunity to thank our customers and staff for their continued support and loyalty.ldquoAs a local charitable organisation, we cannot survive without your backing, and we are incredibly grateful for this.ldquoAs East Lothianrsquos sports and leisure charity, we work closely with East Lothian Council, local sports clubs and the wider community to maintain affordable access to safe and fit for purpose facilities to the best of our ability.ldquoThis, even though the financial environment within which we operate is currently exceptionally dficult, remains a principal objective.ldquoLikewise, to retain sport and leisure facilities in all our major towns, which

Even after the Damascene conversion of arch-Brexiter Jacob Rees-Mogg, who used to described her deal as ldquovassalage, her final attempt to get a stripped-down Withdrawal Agreement through Parliament failed on Friday by a substantial majority. You have to give May full marks for her consistency: everything she touches turns to dust, even her own resignation.But thatrsquos by the by. As everyone has been saying: we are where we are. And where we are is extremely uncomfortable. Brexiters are gearing up to have a belly laugh at the opposition MPs, who will do their best throughout the coming week to find a compromise. Who do they think they are  Playing at being a provisional government  ldquoItrsquos like allowing the whelk stall to be run by the whelks, according to the Tory MP Sir Bill Cash. Butno-one  is able to run the eponymous stall, then all power to the whelks.Last weekrsquos indicative votes suggested that MPs are broadly in favour of a Brexit that keeps Britain in the EUrsquos economic loop while leaving the political institutions. Curiously, the SNP, who have been arguing for soft Brexit in two white papers and an election manesto, decided not to vote for the ious options, even the Norway model that they have long extolled. The SNP did, however, vote for the proposal from the Labour MP Margaret Beckett for a confirmatory ballot, and this option got the largest number of votes, much to everyonersquos surprise. This must be a serious possibility now that Parliament has failed to resolve the Brexit conundrum.However, this is not a Peoplersquos Vote as some have styled it. A confirmatory vote is not a rerun of the  referendum, but strictly a chance for voters to give their views on whatever deal Parliament agrees . The Kyle Wilson Amendment originally envisaged putting the Prime Ministerrsquos deal to a popular vote, assuming it was passed by Parliament. However, this confirmatory referendum might be dficult to schedule because it could collide with three other elections: a Tory leadership election, the European elections and a General Election. Brenda from Bristol will be in despair.EvenMPs fail to come up with a working compromise, they can still block a no-deal Brexit. The majority against leaving the EU without a deal is overwhelming. This means May, or her successor, will have to go cap-in-hand to Brussels in the next few days and request another, longer delay to Article . This would mean Britain participating in the European elections in May, which excites the Independent Group of Tory and Labour rebels, but is looked upon with dread by the main parties. Brussels too is worried about populist contagion spreading to other EU countries like Italy, but they are legally bound to make British participation a condition of any further extension to AVoter wrath, particularly in Labourrsquos leave constituencies, could lead to a dramatic revival of Nigel Faragersquos Ukip, or worse. The Svengali behind the  Vote Leave campaign, Dominic Cummings, is gearing up for the fight and reportedly suggesting a new party to fight for the right to leave. ldquoTell them again is the favoured slogan. The European elections might themselves turn into a kind of second referendum on Brexit.The Tories will presumably have a new leader by then, since Theresa May will surely go now there is to be the long extension she has resolutely opposed. Mind you, it is impossible to guess the Prime Ministerrsquos thought processes. She said she would goher withdrawal deal passed on Friday. But her gambit didnrsquot work. Even the opportunity to dispense with Mayrsquos services was not sufficient inducement for the Democratic Unionist Party to come on board. The joke doing the rounds last week was that she tried to fall on her sword and missed.But these things have a momentum of their own, and the Tory leadership election has already begun. Boris Johnson is the narrow frontrunner, but that could change. He might win the membership, but under Tory rules the parliamentary party has to agree the two candidates put to a postal ballot. The remainers in the Tory benches might use this as an opportunity to foil the hard Brexiters by keeping Boris off the list.Of course, what should happen when a government fails to get its most important legislation through Parliament is not a leadership election, but a General Election. The government cannot govern and, even with the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, this should lead to a General Election via a vote of no confidence. Some Conservatives might prefer to fight a General Election than European elections they had promised would never take place. But events are now out of everyonersquos control.Everyone, that is, except the EU, which now holds Britainrsquos future in the balance. Itrsquos trying not to crow about Britainrsquos abject national humiliation, but the , not the UK Parliament, will now decide the UKrsquos immediate future: deal or no deal. If MPs agree this week to back a soft Brexit involving the customs union and alignment with the single market, Brussels has promised to fast-track it in a matter of days. But the alternative, a long extension, will also suit the European Union.That means more money from Britainrsquos budget contribution, and serves as a warning to other EU countries about the dangers of trying to leave the Union. It also holds out the possibility of Britain remaining in the EU,a referendum is eventually staged.Well, that remains to be seen. What is perhaps more likely is that Britain gets stuck indefinitely in a long extension. It emerged last week that the Democratic Unionist Party, which again voted against Mayrsquos withdrawal deal, could live with a long extension. Indeed, they signalled that they could live with a customs union ndash as long as it ensured no border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. The DUP may be Brexiters, but they are ardent Unionists first.A soft Brexit may now be the best way of keeping the UK together. But it should be put to the people in a confirmatory vote,for no other reason than this was not what most people thought they were voting for in . MPs have the opportunity to decide this tomorrow.How and why Theresa May failed to seek the only kind of Brexit that could get through Parliament will be left for historians to judge. One of her own Cabinet ministers, quoted on BBC Newsnight, gave the provisional verdict: ldquoShersquos the sole architect of this mess because of her inability to engage in the most basic human interaction. Who says personalities donrsquot matter in great historical events "},{"url":null,"title":"dennis-kelly-on-writing-matilda-the-musical","story":"ldquoFor a big musical, the show feels really theatrical, says Kelly, who wrote the show with composer and Edinburgh Festival Fringe favourite Tim Minchin. ldquoIt is polished, but it doesnrsquot always feel like it, which is great. To do the burp, we talked about loads of dferent ideas about how to do it and make it feel as though a burp had just happened, but in the end we went for something really simple, which works in big theatres, but which you could do in tiny spaces as well.The sort of spaces Kelly is talking about are exactly where the London-born writer began his play-writing career after joining a youth theatre while a teenager working in Sainsburyrsquos. His first play of note, Debris, was staged at the tiny Theatre , situated above a Battersea pub, in . He came to further prominence two years later when After The End was seen at the Traverse Theatre in Edinburgh in a production directed by Roxana Silbert for the Paines Plough Company.By , Kellyrsquos BBC Three sit-com, Pulling, co-written with Sharon Horgan, was en route to being nominated for a BAFTA, while his  stage play, Orphans, premiered at the Traverse in a Birmingham Rep production directed by Silbert. The same year saw the National Theatre of Scotland premiere Kellyrsquos play for children, Our Teacherrsquos A Troll. With such a relatively left-field back catalogue, being approached by the Royal Shakespeare Company, then led by former director of Glasgowrsquos Tron Theatre, Michael Boyd, wasnrsquot what Kelly expected to happen next.ldquoWhen the RSC came to me and said they wanted me to do a musical, I said I didnrsquot have a clue about how to do that, Kelly remembers. ldquoI think they knew my work from Debris and Our Teacherrsquos A Troll, and I wrote about three drafts and then Matthew Warchus came on board as director. They looked around exhaustively for a composer, and as soon as I spoke to Matthew about Tim Minchin, I think he knew he was the one.Minchin is the Australian-based performer, whose internationally renowned musical comedy show, Darkside, was an Edinburgh hit in , winning him what was then the Perrier Comedy Award for best newcomer. By the time Kelly and Minchinrsquos take on the story opened in Stratford in , both had been through an extensive development process.ldquoWe did four of these huge two-week workshops, Kelly remembers, ldquoand it was a lot of work. I donrsquot really like workshops, to be honest. I find that stuff hard. The first person I want to hear doing something Irsquove written is the actor playing the part, but with something this big you just have to get on with it and do it.Kelly reckons the entire process took about four years.ldquoSomeone said to me at the time that was ten per cent of my le, he says.Matilda The Musical looks set to last a lot longer than that. Following its West End transfer, the show opened on Broadway, and went on to win seven Olivier Awards ndash the most ever won by a musical ndash and five Tony Awards. It has also toured Canada and Australia prior to its current UK tour. Has such international success changed things for Kelly ldquoIn some ways it changed things, he says, ldquoand in some ways it didnrsquot. Irsquove had a show on for the last eight years, which feels strange. As a playwright you tend to have a show on, then it closes and another one goes on, so it is dferent with Matilda, but after all this time I donrsquot have a lot to do with it anymore. I donrsquot think Irsquom a lot of use to it. I used to go in and maybe give a bit of advice, but at some point yoursquove got to step back and let them get on with it.ldquoHow I wanted to work didnrsquot change. Itrsquos not like this was what I was working towards, meeting famous people and swanning round musical theatre or anything like that. I still write grimy little plays, and always have done, and writing Matilda was no dferent from writing anything  Irsquove done.Such a down to earth approach is part of Matildarsquos appeal. ldquoThere are two things I really like about it, Kelly says. ldquoThe first is Matildarsquos inability to accept the status quo, and secondly, she doesnrsquot whinge about it. A lot of the time in musicals, people say, oh,only this or that happened, I could have done this. Matilda never really does that. She just gets on with it and sorts things out. I think as well itrsquos a bit cheeky and a bit naughty as a musical. The great thing about Roald Dahl is hersquos rude, and Irsquom rude as well, and so is Tim, so it all came together because wersquore all rude. But apart from anything , itrsquos amazing seeing that little girl telling the story, and holding , people or a couple of thousand people, in the palm of their hand.Kellyrsquos forte charting the adventures of unruly small people has continued with his version of Pinocchio, which he wrote for the National Theatre in London in a production that ran in  and  directed by John Tfany, formerly of the Traverse and National Theatre of Scotland. In this way, Kelly seems naturally drawn to such fictional trouble-makers.ldquoBeing able to watch someone who is very small overpower someone who is very big, thatrsquos not a bad message, he says. ldquoI learnt very early on, kids hate things that arenrsquot fair. If you tell a kid off and yoursquore wrong, they hate it. I just love the idea that therersquos a little girl out there who gets up and sorts things out.

However, a ldquokey intervention by Geoffrey Cox, the Attorney General, proved decisive and the Cabinet ldquocollectively agreed the move.At one point, Chancellor Philip Hammond called for a general election or a second referendum to resolve the Brexit issue but this was received badly by colleagues.

This would involve a number of options put before MPs in a series of votes to determine the way forward.ldquoCrucially, explained the PM, ldquothe Government stands ready to abide by the decision of the House. But to make this process work, the Opposition would need to agree to this too.This means that, , say, the Commons backed a customs union option, Mrs May would be duty-bound to take it to the EU.Once an option were agreed to, the Government would then bring forward the Withdrawal Agreement Bill, which it would want to agree a timetable for to ensure it was passed before May , so Britain need not take part in Euro elections.ldquoThis is a dficult time for everyone, declared the PM. ldquoPassions are running high on all sides of the argument.

It is not an option that any rational government should contemplate. But Britain has ceased to be rational, and Parliament has failed in its key role as a means of building national consensus. Remainers shouldnrsquot exaggerate the immediate problems of No Deal Brexit, as they did before the  referendum. It is partly the failure of the forecasts of Project Fear to materialise that has made many voters relaxed about leaving without a deal. At least until their jobs start to go.There wonrsquot be mass redundancies overnight, but rather a slow attrition of businesses and jobs as Britain loses friction-free access to its biggest market. Brussels has made clear that it will impose tarfs,  per cent on cars, up to  per cent on some food products. But many items are already exempt and itrsquos not asthere is going to be a blockade at the ports.There will be the full range of sanitary and phytosanitary checks on food and agricultural products. There will be the gamut of regulatory checks also, but these are not immediately visible. Those lorry parks in Kent will certainly be overflowing and the M will be disrupted for weeks, perhaps months. But eventually things will start to move again.Sir Mark Sedwill forecast, in his No Deal briefing, that another run on the pound would be likely. The prospect of car and pharmaceutical companies departing for Europe, along with the banks and legions of creative industry professionals, would make Britain a poor investment prospect ndash at least in the short term. Britainrsquos financial credibility would be in question, and borrowing costs would probably rise.Ireland will face particular dficulties under No Deal, which is why Emanuel Macron and Angela Merkel are holding emergency talks with the Irish Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar. Efforts will be made in the short term to keep the checks away from border posts, and they may be successful. But in the medium term, there is going to be a hard border.

Sir Mark forecasts Direct Rule ing to Northern Ireland, and that could destabilise the province. But in the immediate aftermath of No Deal, there will probably be a stunned silence, as political parties assess the economic damage.As for the rest of the UK, there will also be a breathless hush next Friday as everyone waits to see what happens. It will probably be an anti-climax. The consequences will be profound, but most will be delayed. And there is an upside for Scottish nationalists.

Laura Kuenssbergs BBC documentary The Brexit Storm was a useful reminder of the long saga of ministerial resignations, of the Conservative Partys bitter civil war, with the European Research Group operating as a party within a party and other Tory MPs quitting in disgust, and of Theresa Mays deal being rejected by Parliament, once, twice, thrice. And the common factor running through the current sorry mess, is of a Prime Minister who stubbornly believed that the only way was her way, and who refused to reach out and include not only her own colleagues, but other parties at Westminster and the devolved administrations in Scotland and Wales.As Ms Kuenssberg presented the story of how Mrs Mays Brexit intentions and negotiations unravelled, it became clear that given her intransigence, the current chaotic mess was always on the cardsthe foundations are rotten, everything is rotten, and as Mrs May built her Brexit house on sand, the tide was against it, and it, like the Conservative Party, lies ruined at her feet.Ruth Marr, Grampian Road, Stirling.YOUR front-page lead story todaycontains a quote from the hard Brexiter Mark Francois referring to the wishes of the . million who voted to leave the EU and how this was still on track following yesterdays votes in the Commons where once again MPs demonstrated their hopelessness,with the SNP at the forefront, by once again saying what they didnt want rather than what they did want.This .m number bandied about, usually with an attachment along the lines of \"the democratic will of the people\" is becoming tedious and repetitive. The electorate was  million so just under  million did not vote to leave and therefore . million is only the will of some of the people.

In other words, formal negotiations on everything it containscannot be discussed until the WA is ratied.Rather than vote for the WA which would guarantee an orderly withdrawal from the EU and give time to negotiate a trade deal, parties like the SNP and Labour have muddied the waters by insisting on voting about the political declaration which has inadvertently pushed Brexit towards the much harsher WTO rules. This is unacceptable, especially as the PM has already agreed that there will be much more cross-party involvement in any future trade negotiations.Consequently the PM has been right to focus like a laser to get the WA through Parliament as to date there is no other show in town currently acceptable to the EU to facilitate the prospect of a future trade deal.

Waste cooking oil, lubricant oil and garden waste would need to be taken to  Bossack.Businesses wishing to do this should note they would need to register as a waste carrier with SEPA . There is currently no charge for this for many businesses.It’s also important businesses understand they need to register with the council ahead of taking waste or recycling to Bossack or Chinglebraes, to avoid delays at the gate — or possibly being turned away.Businesses can set up a trade waste and or recycling collection service with the council.Darren Richardson is the council’s head of infrastructure services. He said: “We’re issuing these reminders now to help businesses avoid falling foul of SEPA and possibly incurring fines.“Equally, we’re keen to spread the word amongst businesses that recycling where possible is not only a legal requirement, but it can also save them money.“It’s far cheaper to separate out recyclates than it is to dispose of these items in general waste. It also contributes to the Zero Waste Plan for Scotland where targets proposed include recycling  per cent of all Scotland’s waste and only  per cent of remaining waste ending up in landfill by .“The situation is slightly dferent on the isles with regards to recycling — so we are writing separately to isles businesses.“We’re here to help all businesses and we’d encourage any local business, no matter the size, to contact usthey’re unsure about what they need to do or wish to establish a recycling or waste collection service with us.”Resources and information for businesses is regularly updated on the council’s website and any business, large or small, who is unsure of whether their waste and or recycling is classed as commercial waste should get in touch with the council’s Waste Team on .copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Interviews will cover veterans’ experiences and their thoughts on remembrance.“It is important that these stories are captured now before they can no longer be shared, ensuring greater understanding for future generations.#What’s more, our research has shown that audiences are keen to understand more about recent conflicts and the experiences of our veterans.”The veterans will be asked the same set of questions giving a unique insight into their experiences and views at dferent times in history. Poppyscotland will also conduct group interviews to allow intergenerational interaction.The completed body of work will be available to view on the charity’s learning website and made available to schools. The short video clips will help the public to develop a better understanding and engage with veterans, and have greater appreciation of more recent and less well-known conflicts.If you are a veteran and would welcome the chance to tell your story, please contact Veterans’ Voices researcher Hannah Uttley on   , or atveteransvoices@poppyscotland.org.uk.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

As the rape and murder of Alesha McPhail has shown, the ruthless self-interest and callousness associated with psychopaths lead to staggering human costs. You don’t become a psychopath on your th birthday. Psychopathic traits start in very early childhood, have predictable pathways and yet we do not assess children for this neurodevelopmental problem. As one of the psychologists involved in the Aaron Campbell case, having assessed psychopaths for  years in Scotland and carried out research on the topic, I feel determined that some good comes from this tragedy for Alesha’s family, in the form of raising awareness of the need for early prevention.It would be tempting to think that the type of sadistic homicide carried out by Campbell is so rare that there is little we need to do about people with psychopathic traits. It is estimated that less than one to three per cent in the population will be diagnosed with these traits over their letime and even among offenders only around eight per cent are psychopathic. However, psychopaths are responsible for overwhelming misery, disproportionate amounts of crime, more ied offending and they are far more likely to be responsible for homicide. They may even be responsible for more than half of all persistent, violent crimes.I assessed one psychopathic man in Scotland who was described by police as a “one-man crime wave” for his region before he was finally stopped. Other researchers also describe how people with psychopathic traits wreak havoc in relationships and organisations, bullying their staff and permeating work culture with manipulation and lying. Researchers are trying to focus on the causes of psychopathic traits and the early pathways children are launched on. To my own professional cost, over years I’ve repeatedly raised the issue of this devastating public health problem, along with the need to screen children referred to child and adolescent mental health servicesand social work, for example. The response to such proposals has been highly negative. I’ve been vilied about labelling children, lectured on issues of mental health stigma, told psychopathic traits don’t exist in children despite the scientic evidence, and even faced dealing with complaints from professionals about using the term ‘callous-unemotional traits’ – a precursor to psychopathy – for a child.: Dani Garavelli: Can justice rise above a lynch mob mentality Such attacks are from professionals who fail to understand the trajectories and devastating le outcomes for society from this group. It’s not only the victims we should consider. Children who end up psychopathic do not choose their atypical-neuro-psychological ing, they often end up hooked on poly-substance abuse, display suicidal behaviour and can have short lives,immersed in a violent sub-culture.Psychopathy is therefore a major public health issue, urgently requiring strategies for early identication and prevention. Two decades of scientic inquiry into developmental problems and causal mechanisms have been critical in growing our understanding of how a range of childhood psychological problems emerge, disproportionately focusing on the role of adverse childhood experiencesin Scotland. There is a culture in children’s services that almost everything we see has to be linked to some past trauma. Childhood trauma is of course important, but it is not the only story of child development. Genetic causal factors leading to certain temperamental or neurodevelopmental problems are rarely acknowledged. Mention of genetic predispositions can be determinantal to careers. I know of senior colleagues who have raised the issues of genetic or neurodevelopmental causal ideas to the cost of their careers, leading to them being side-lined to those following the ‘gods’ of ACES and trauma, as their panacea for all of society’s ills. Aaron Campbell’s case shows how childhood trauma was not a major causal driver. In fact, typical of most children who end up with psychopathic traits of callousness, lack of empathy and unemotionality are seen from a very early age. : Alesha MacPhail: Teenager jailed for at least  years for rape and murder of -year-oldIt’s intuitively appealing to hook such extreme murderous sadism onto some critical trauma but the research evidence is stacking up on the side of genetic predispositions to fearlessness, failure to learn from consequences and then emerging callous-unemotional traits. However, despite a considerable volume of research and popular literature on the topic of psychopathy, causal mechanisms have been less extensively studied. The scientic study of psychopathic traits in childhood is a rapidly developing area which is years ahead of the everyday practice of child services. The downward extension of the adult concept of psychopathy to early childhood has mainly focused on one component of psychopathy – callous-unemotional traits, perhaps only representing one-third of psychopathy. The other two domains are grandiose-manipulative and behavioural factors such as pervasive impulsivity. To complicate matters, psychopathy traits are transdiagnostic, overlapping with other neurodevelopmental disorders such as ADHD. Precursors to childhood psychopathic traits can be observed as early as two to four years of age – a finding that riles many professionals into refusing to consider such possibilities. We like to think of children as blank slates, ready to be written on by parenting but in this case the software comes preloaded. Researchers have shown that having these traits in childhood predicts violent offending later in le. There are facts and ugly facts and social workers, clinicians and practitioners – particularly those of a more authoritarian left-wing bent in my experience – refuse to have any discussions about genetic dispositions. Yet, there is a strong emerging body of research showing that there are strong heritable components to psychopathic traits. This is not the whole story as adults with high levels of psychopathy traits are more likely to report interpersonal trauma before the age of ten but this does not mean trauma has caused their problems, for example parents can become more punitive and harsher because their child has psychopathic traits.A recent co-twin control study demonstrates paradoxically that child maltreatment was not associated with an increased load for neuro-developmental disorders . This is counterintuitive for many professionals who seem to insist children are positive until sullied by bad parenting. The research showed that co-occurrence of child maltreatment with NDDs seems to a large extent to be accounted for by a shared genetic liability, increasing both the risk of being maltreated and having more co-occurring NDDs. More carefully constructed adoption studies have clearly showed genetic factors in psychopathy, but the good news was that warm, consistent parents who build attachments could reduce callous-unemotional traits, but not eliminate them, and only for very young children.A small but growing evidence base is beginning to suggest that warm and rewarding parenting might act to some degree as a buffer to genetic or environmental risk for psychopathic traits. Evenit is generally accepted that there is a moderate-to-strong heritability of childhood psychopathy, interventions focusing on environmental factors such as parenting may be useful in reducing the propensity for psychopathy. What is critical for clinicians to understand is that, where there is genetic risk conferred for psychopathy, this does not mean there will be an inevitable negative outcome, but the evidence suggests some malleability of the underlying genetic disposition for young children. The problem is no-one is assessing for these traits.At the age of , such traits are already entrenched and chronic, so it is time for policy to catch up with research, given the enormous social costs of psychopathy. It is time to focus on early identication and specialist, tailored interventions with the promotion of warm parenting and development of eye contact, which might reduce callousness, improve parent-child attachments, emotional recognition and empathy. Politically correct fears of labelling, stigma and rejection of genetic disposition science are getting in the way of truly tackling this serious problem. We have to deal with psychopathy trajectories in childhood head-on now to ert budding psychopaths and make sure what happened to poor Alesha never happens again.Dr John J Marshall is a consultant clinical and forensic psychologist©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"alexander mccall smith many people don t know corbyn fans sleep under the bed","story":"What more obvious form of entryism is there than going into a room and slipping under the bed, wonders Alexander McCall Smith.When did you last look under your bed  This question may embarrass those who use the space under their bed to store things for which they can’t otherwise find a place. Odd shoes, empty suitcases, the occasional book: such domestic detritus, covered in the dust of years, lurks under the beds of many of those for whom Marie Kondo, the Japanese tidiness guru, is no more than a name, rather than an ideology. People who store things under their beds rarely bring themselves to take too close a look at what is there.But some people really do look under their beds, and may do so fairly often. For many of these, the practice of peering nervously under the bed is a hangover from a childhood fear of the monsters known to inhabit such regions. More realistic children, of course, may prefer to check the space under the bed for lions, or other entirely zoologically plausible possibilities. But whatever the under-bed fauna, in the normal course of events, children grow out of such fears, coming to understand that the likelihood of finding a lion in their particular postcode is slight. Even so, the possibility that there is something there may be sufficient to prolong the period of Unterbettwachsamkeit well into the adult years.Finding something untoward under one’s bed is, of course, a potentially traumatic experience. There are those who say that it simply doesn’t happen, but it does. Many years ago I had a conversation with former neighbours in Botswana who had given a home to my cat when I left the country after living there for a year. When I revisited Gaborone, I called on them to find out how the cat was doing. He was fine, they said, although he – and they – had recently had a somewhat unsettling experience.This is what happened. The couple had gone out for dinner and had ed to find that the front door of their house had been forced. They called the police, who searched the house and concluded that theof the householders had seen off the burglars. My friends then tidied up and in due course retired to their bed. The cat, however, seemed very disturbed and spent some minutes on their bed pacing up and down, extending and retracting his claws. They put this down to feline post-traumatic stress disorder: no cat likes an unannounced intruder.: The Edinburgh of the future will have no residents and an all-year festival – Alexander McCall SmithThey switched out the light and were drting off to sleep when the bed suddenly began to move up and down beneath them. The burglar, who had hidden there when he heard them , was struggling to escape the weight of the mattress pressing down upon him. He eventually managed – and rushed out of the room into the night. The cat had sensed his presence but had been unable to communicate this to his owners. A dog would have managed, of course, but cats are dferent.Having a burglar under one’s bed must be everybody’s perfect nightmare. It is the reason, I suspect, why, when staying in hotels on book tours in the United States, I always look under the bed when I move into a room. In my view that is simple prudence. Ex abundanti cautela more or less sums it up. The Unites States, for all its merits, is not a particularly safe country, and it is perfectly possible that your hotel room may harbour a psychopath. One of these hiding places could well be under the bed, or even one of those walk-in cupboards where they keep the complimentary towelling bathrobe. Violent criminals love those cupboards and the bathrobes they contain. Of course, I feel vaguely foolish when doing this – who wouldn’t  – but I believe that it is better to be safe than sorry, and to locate any intruder before you turn out the lights. Alfred Hitchcock, I believe, would have understood.: Alexander McCall Smith: All this talk about British identity is turning people IrishMcCarthyite America gave us the expression “reds under beds”, used to describe the paranoid view of those who believed that Hollywood’s studios were riddled with Trotskyites. Trotsky, of course, advocated entryism, and what more obvious form of entryism is there than going into a room and slipping under the bed  Reds under beds is clearly a metaphor, but recent reports have suggested that the metaphor bears more relation to widely encountered practice than one might imagine.These reports come from hotels where members of the Momentum Group have taken to staying while on political business. Many people are unaware of the fact that many of those in Mr Corbyn’s circle do not sleep on top of the bed when staying in hotels, but sleep under the bed. This, for some reason, is their preference. It is also very considerate of hotel management and staff, as their beds never need fresh sheets and can be let out again within minutes of their departure.This habit of Momentum members is yet another example of how popular expressions such a reds under beds may in fact be more literal than metaphorical. Metaphor reflects reality as much as it shapes it. But there are limits: those who sleep under the bed as opposed to on top of it, are not necessarily of the left, or, in demotic parlance, red: other reasons may play a part. But one might nonetheless ask: what explains this strange preference of the left for sleeping under the bed  That’s the really interesting question, for an answer to which I suspect we shall have to wait. If you find somebody under your bed, do not engage. Creep out of the room. There are other rooms, other beds – and other metaphors too.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"world seems ambivalent about swift action on climate change ipcc chair","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Reducing the greenhouse gas emissions that are driving climate change will involve answering dficult questions about our lestyles, and the signs are ambivalent about whether the world , write Professor Hoesung Lee, chair of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and Professor Jim Skea, co-chair of IPCC Working Group III.All reasonable doubts about climate change have now been dispelled by both climate science and everyday experience of unusual weather. The world’s attention is now turning to solutions that could reduce and ultimately eliminate emissions of carbon dioxide , the most important greenhouse gas. But CO emissions are deeply embedded in the activities and social practices of a modern economy. Power stations, industry, cars, aeroplanes, heating buildings, food production and land management are all major sources of emissions worldwide.In , a special report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Changeprovided a stark warning about the consequences of allowing the world to warm by more than . degrees Celsius. The report noted that it was possible, within the laws of physics and chemistry, to limit global warming to .C. But it concluded that this would require “rapid and far-reaching transitions in energy, land, urban and infrastructure” that would be “unprecedented in terms of scale”. Emissions of CO would need to fall by roughly  per cent by  from present-day levels to keep us on track towards .C. Are governments, and are citizens, up for that The signs are ambivalent. Under the Paris Agreement, governments set an aim of removing as much CO from the atmosphere as we put in by the second half of the st century – “net zero” or “carbon neutrality” in other words. And some countries have indeed started to set “net zero” targets. The Climate Change Bill, which has just started its journey through the Scottish Parliament, allows for exactly that.But, at the same time, as governments are formulating lofty long-term goals, there has been less progress in terms of immediate actions. Globally, emissions are still rising. And the pledges that governments have made under the Paris Agreement set the world on a path to global warming of C or more. : Climate warming bringing spring earlier eeach year, study confirmsThe recent IPCC report concluded that limiting the rise to .C could be achieved through a range of dferent emission pathways. Policymakers would need to balance the option of very rapid emissions reductions in the short term against a second option of slower emission reductions, followed by the removal of large quantities of CO from the atmosphere in the second half of the st century.Large-scale CO removal is currently assumed to be achieved by combining the use of bioenergy with carbon capture and storage. Growing biomass draws CO from the atmosphere. When the biomass is burned, the resulting CO would be captured and stored geologically, for example in depleted oil and gas fields. At scale, this option is unproven. There are only a few dozen carbon-capture plants operating globally, and only one is linked to biomass. Converting large tracts of land to bioenergy has become an issue of concern because of the implications for food security,land is taken out of food production, and threats to bioersity.But “net zero” cannot be achieved unless some CO is removed from the atmosphere. There are sectors, such as heavy industry or aviation where mitigation options are currently lacking. Emissions from these would need to be balanced by CO removal. There is a growing interest in “nature-based” solutions that can remove CO from the atmosphere at a more modest scale and which may yield wider benefits. These include re-building stocks of carbon in soils through agricultural practices or by re-wetting peatlands.: How Scotland is leading the world in fight against climate changeThere are concerns about the feasibility of the alternative option of making rapid emissions reductions in the short term. Some countries – and Scotland is a leading example – have been able to reduce CO emissions by two to three per cent per year at best. Reducing emissions by  per cent by  and hitting net zero by around  is a major step up in terms of effort. Addressing the electricity sector alone will not be enough. We would need to reduce radically emissions from heating and transport as well. Technical fixes – whether through the energy supply side or through energy efficiency – are unlikely to be enough. The dficult question of how lestyles and consumption patterns influence emissions would need to be addressed.This is not to say the task of moving emissions in the right direction is impossible. There are grounds for cautious optimism. In particular, the cost of renewable energy – wind and solar – has fallen dramatically in recent years. This has been driven by a combination of government policies and economies of scale. Deployment is expanding in many parts of the world. Renewables now meet two thirds of Scottish demand for electricity. Several countries have set target dates for phasing out sales of petrol or diesel cars. Vehicles powered by electricity derived from renewable sources can have a big impact on emissions from private transport. And in many parts of the world, this will also deliver improved air quality and health benefits. These are areas in which the current pace of development matches what might be needed to limit global warming in line with the Paris Agreement.Scientists from the IPCC are meeting in Edinburgh this week to grapple with these issues.

They were discovered by staff in a store at the Museum of Edinburgh, just a few hundred yards away from the Palace of Holyroodhouse, where Mary ruled for six years after ing from France in . The  documents, which are inidually dated, numbered and signed, relate to the rights of deacons and tradesmen in the city, the selling of meat at the Tolbooth and the making of salt in Newhaven.Early conservation work on the documents, which were recently discovered in the Museum of Edinburgh’s own storage facility off the Canongate, has revealed watermarks – one of a goat and another of a flower – which can only been seen when held up to light.It is thought the papers entered the archives of the local authority in the s, but were then “lost” before being rediscovered nearly a century later during conservation work. Intriguingly, some of the documents signed by Mary date from when she was still in France.Experts in the council’s museums and galleries service, which is responsible for the official archives of the city, said the recently unearthed documents revealed an “often overlooked “ aspect of her le.History curator Vicky Garrington said: “Together, the documents shed light on a key part of Scotland’s past. We all know the tragic story of Mary Queen of Scots, her eventful le and eventual execution in , but in these documents we see a dferent side to Mary.“Here, she can be seen carefully managing the everyday affairs of Edinburgh, both from France and Scotland. It’s fascinating to think of her reading through these official papers before carefully applying her signature.“They are staying in storage at the museum for now. But we hope to have them assessed by a conservator and for further research to be done on them by experts on Mary, after which we hope to exhibit them, which will be hugely exciting.”Museums and galleries manager Frank Little said: “We’re constantly reviewing, caring for and researching our collections, and look forward to sharing more of the city’s rich heritage with residents and visitors through our programme of exhibitions and online activities.” Council culture convener Donald Wilson said: “Our museums and galleries hold thousands of historic treasures, many of which are on display in our venues. However, some items such as these documents are too fragile to be on long-term display, so putting them online is a great way to showcase them.”©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"stagecoach puts foot on the gas with earnings","story":"Stagecoach, the Perth-headquartered bus and rail giant, has upped its earnings guidance on the back of strong trading and #positive progress# in its UK rail ision.In a trading update, the group said like-for-like revenue was up . per cent at its UK regional bus operations in the financial year to date as it increased its market share.Revenue growth was limited to . per cent at its London bus ision.

Well done Shetlands!!#The Shetlands# did they have a march there too First of all, I would like to say # I am European #. The Brexit fiasco is nothing more than for this government to have a trade deal with the USA, by sanctioning the EU referendum to distance ourselves from Europe and to be more culturally linked to the USA. Nothing could be further from the truth. The psychological brainwashing of the xenophobic political uprising has brought to the fore the extreme, darker and fascist aspects of our society and how we are slowly but surely destroying the very fabric which makes up our society of every creed, colour, nationality, gender orientation and the iety of many aspects which we regard as the makeup of society. Brexit, by its very nature, erodes these values we hold dear and directs us into a more extremist political way of thinking. This is not what we should be advocating for our society and our future.The last time I looked the UK was still physically attached to the continent of Europe . As well as being English , Welsh , Scottish or Northern Irish we are all European . We # leavers # like Europe a lot, we strongly dislike being part of the dictatorial , undemocratic , unaccountable European Union . OK  The official EU view on independent Scotland EU membership:“The EU is founded on the Treaties which apply only to the Member States who have agreed and ratied them. If part of the territory of a Member State would cease to be part of that state because it were to become a new independent state, the Treaties would no longer apply to that territory. In other words, a new independent state would, by the fact of its independence, become a third country with respect to the EU and the Treaties would no longer apply on its territory.”i.e we shall be automatically out of the EU # with #NO DEAL# # from Independence Day.Have the EU’s treaties changed, meanwhile  No.However, it#sjoining rules have changed.

Voters don’t always get the chance to change the government, but they may want the chance to change their mind.You may be cheering the overturning of the democratic vote now, butthey get away with it we will all be losers. Be careful what you wish for you may just get it.Well, the #Put it to the People# march was in London in that there England, so I#m unsure why Quitters are making an issue of the numbers. The debate afterwards was billed as an open debate, and only one cockney Quitter spoke, so make what you like of that.Why go to the unnecessary effort of changing my mind  Parliament, the commentariat and most of the mainstream media seems perfectly happy to do that for me. And while they’re at it why not move the goal posts, change the game and rewrite the rules as you go along. Quintessentially EUropean modus operandi.Our major export markets are Japan and China. That is unlikely to change either.British markets of old will not be ing to the past and arguments made that this will happen is extreme naiveté.The commonwealth is far bigger than Australia. Much of it developing economies expanding far far faster than Australia is or ever will. You are right though Oz will have to keep selling to China because China owns vast swathes of Ozzy industry and mining. I for one will be delightedwe have a much closer links with Australia, New Zealand but they are hardly super stars of economic growth.I do not know of a single UK made item in any of my families ious homes.Ali says “ theyget away with itwe will all be losers”. Boo-hiss! Really  If Boris, Farage, Rees-Mogg and chums get away with it most folk will be worse off, with the few laughing all the way to their offshore banks. And that’s the point # them taking control to profit from their vision of a backwards looking low-tax-for-the-rich Britain of biddable serfs. Ali should be careful whose bidding he is doing by defending May’s hollow deal.Perhaps my previous point might distress Ali lessI rephrased it. Not all of the electorate who seek a change of government achieve this at election time. That’s parliamentary elections for you, particularly under first last the post. We get one day of enjoying the freedom of maybe changing the government and have to put up with the outcome for some years before the next time. However, in the terms of this referendum # brought on to placate those ideologues who bankrolled lawbreaking in their dishonest campaign, well # some folk might have changed their minds + days on. Unlike an unpopular government, Brexit would be forever. Why not make sure we really want it Peter, you so waffle on! Ignoring your obviously obsessive-compulsive dogma, reference Boris, Farage,biddable serfs and assorted socialist claptrap, I will take issue on one point only here. Your  statement,#Unlike an unpopular government, Brexit would be forever#, that is manest nonsense. After Brexit, Europe will still exist. The EU, on present developments, may well implode at any minute. Spain, Greece, Italy even Franceseem to be moving away from the suffocating mire of Brussels, Junker, Barnier and undemocratic cabals of theEU. Brexit would never be forever It is just the start of an equitable move towards democratic change and true democracy in Europe, not the present cartel of faceless unelected bureaucratic parasites and overpaid freeloaders.You keep harping on about Boris, Nigel and Jacob asthey were the only proponents of brexit. You steadfastly ignore the other . million people because of course you obviously are so much smarter and nicer than them so their votes don#t count. What I wonder is what will the political elites decide to ignore next time we votethey get away with it this time. How about we have a vote about the SCT andwe don#t like the outcome we vote again until we do get the result we want. Or may until they get the result they want which is contrary to what you want. How does democracy work in your fantasist mind Marc Petit, Superstars! I love Aus but economic Superstars, what planet are you on  Australia has a masive land mass, fantastic mineral resources yet is so outperformed financially by India, Canada, and with half the GDP of the UK . As my Aus brother would say, #A few stubbies short of a six-pack. A few sandwiches short of a picnic#. Now get real your comment marc,#we are superstars of growth # it must have been a petit and low starting point  years back.@Mark Petit,Thanks for that, very interesting. Do you think that the Australia-Japan Economic Partnership is helpful by removing tarfs from Japanese goods imported into Australia and vice versa for your agricultural exports to Japan  Whereas having no trade deal with the EU presumably means that goods from both parties are subject to tarfs  The EU is very protective of its agriculture.I#m assuming Australia would find a UK trade deal helpful by removing UK tarfs on your agricultural produce e.g. fruit and wine, and making British goods much cheaper to Australians than they are now What a wonderful attitude and comment from Marc Petit, #These goods Japan et al are cheaper and generally regarded as better .# as our goods are all manufactured under EU protocols and Marc claims are clearly poor quality, just another really good reason to move on. I quote, World Financial Review # Australia has become one of the first countries to finish signing off trade deals with Britain# and The Financial Times, #Australia to fast-track UK trade pact in event of no-deal Brexit# so you see petit comments from Mr Petit,are just that and no more.!!So, Boris Johnson has now changed his mind. Let’s respect his right to do so, but couldn’t the public have done so too And May took her deal twice to the Commons,but she won’t take it once to the commoners. At least you know where you are with the Tories # kind of.Only % of voters think May’s deal is a good deal, but we are meant to shut up and swallow it,her party can back it,she’ll go. How dare anyone speak up against this insulting nonsense Ali’s alt-right guided jibes are remarkably handy. Non-fantasist Ali draws a telling distinction between self-interested Boris Johnson, Nigel Farage and Jacob Rees-Mogg on one hand, the “political elite” on another hand,and the millions who fell for the demonstrablelies of the Brexit campaign cheats on yet another hand still. I am not of course forgetting those voters. I’m pointing out who misled them and why.To adapt Roald Dahl: these laddies from the upper crust. Does he really not see that they are political and elite  It’s troubling.Ali might care to note I am not calling him a member of the alt-right here, buthe continues to unthinkingly parrot their offensive arguments conclusions will be drawn. Non-obsessivecompulsive Ian might similarly do well to dwell on the benefits of avoiding ad hominem arguments. Whilst he has managed at times to play the ball not the man, Ian sadly is more than habitually inclined to foul, and thereby be judged foul in turn. If he repeatedly takes the same self-defeating approach and expects a dferent result# well conclusions may also be drawn. Can’t these lads raise their game Again you only want democracypeople vote the way you tell them. That#s not democracy.Does Ian mean the .m who were lied to by self-serving cheats  Ian might be interested in this from the Chair of The British Medical Association’s Public Health Medicine Committee:The referendum result was NOT #the will of the people# # certainly not following the revelations since.Thank you for asking the people to vote again.Can we also put it to the people in Shetlandthey still want to live inside a windfarm  How many times do we get to vote Past comments on referendums from David Davis MP could soothe or enrage frustrated Leavers. Speaking to parliament in  he said: We should not ask people to vote on a blank sheet of paper and tell them to trust us to fill in the details afterwards. For referendums to be fair and compatible with our parliamentary process, we need the electors to be as well informed as possible and to know exactly what they are voting for.#theyworkforyou says former Brexit Minsiter Davis received £, for  hours work for JCB this year, and that he generally voted against a statutory register of lobbyists. Coincidence  Maybe not. Does Ian still insist rich and powerful Brexit-backers aren#t out for themselves #neo-fascist German AfD party leader# revolting female, but elected to the German Parliament, I repeat elected!!! Now, Peter, can you see the reason we need out. Even you must now see what the E Union is doing with its Proportional Representation and revolting political systems. Neo-Nazi elected into the German Parliament, enough said.Fascism cannot be defeated by nationalist-navel gazing. The far-right are cooperating across Europe, trying to heighten a sense of crisis and undermine confidence in the institutions which they hope to control. Ian#s approach isn#t simply ahistoric. It is dangerously naive. His phrase #revolting female# normalises misogyny.Recognising the threat, not allowing ourselves to be ided and working with our neighbours to the greater good is the only way to keep the far-right at bay internationalism, standing together, kindness, respect. It is less than two years since Farage was speaking at an AfD rally. Ian should be more skeptical about the real motives of the brains behind Brexit. The David Davis#s quote shows they knew what they were about. Rich financiers, newspaper magnates and populist politicians have schemed together to break electoral law, lie to and manipulate the public to bring Britain to this precipice. Meanwhile all some have had to add is jeers. That said, Ian did manage to make his last ill-considered contribution without needless insult. Hopefully, now that he can see who has been pulling his strings, he will be able to accept he has been had. The referendum wasn#t won. It was stolen. Dangerous days are ahead.##and who keeps the far left, or even just the left for that matter, at bay Extreme left, extream right. Two sides of the nastextremist coin There is no dference, the sad thing is what Alice Weidel said was and isperfectly true on this occasion.

They then went on to highlight some of the key tenets underpinning the debate such as trade agreements, law and immigration, before making their concluding statements.In the opening gambit for the pro-Brexit team, S pupil Abbi Morgan argued that leaving the EU #would be a hugely positive thing for the UK# and would allow the country to #take control of borders and create worldwide trade agreements#.She went on to add that it would put the UK in a position to #take back its sovereignty# and make its own decisions on important matters. She stated that as a net contributor to the EU, the UK would be better off by £. billion.In the opening address for the pro-EU team, Lois Langlandssaid that #history and past experience as a member of the EU# gave the UK a more secure position for the future and that, in leaving the European Union, the UK would #enter the unknown# and #walk into the future blindfolded#.She said that outside the EU the UK was a #small fish in a big pond# and asked why any country would be interested in providing a free trade agreement with the UK.#The EU as an organisation is extremely wasteful#, he said. #Every  days the European Parliament moves from Brussels to Strasbourg, where it sits for four days # this is estimated to cost nearly £ million a year.#Touching on the issues of freedom of movement as part of the remain team, Chiara MacLeansaid: #Once the UK leaves the EU, British citizens will become third-party nationals, with no automatic right of admission.# She added that, through the new European travel information and authorisation system, all UK nationals over  years of age #would have to pay money to go somewhere they had a free right to go now#.Seth Bennettook up the reins for the pro-Brexit side, arguing that in terms of laws and immigration the EU could pass any laws they wanted and in by doing so #strip Britain of its sovereignty# # which he described as #one of its driving forces#.He believed that Brexit would offer the UK the chance to #increase its spending in education and housing# which could perhaps lead to a #revival of the nation#s once-thriving industries#.Speaking for the pro-EU team, Gracie Buchan said that leaving the European Union would lead to a trade deficit and result in a shortage of daily supplies such as fruit and vegetables.#Keeping food shop shelves full and prices down will be one of the biggest challenges when Brexit comes around,# she said. #Failure to reach some sort of an agreement could see retailers face an average increase of  per cent, particularly in dairy, meat, veg, and fruit.#Closing for the Brexit side, S pupil Joseph Moller said the EU favoured its own agenda and that in terms of per head of population Maltese citizens had  times more representation than UK nationals.He added that, rather than the , jobs that were cited as potentially being lost due to Brexit, the level of employment had in fact risen by one per cent since the referendum and unemployment was at its lowest level since the s.Summing up for remain, S pupil Innes MacNeil said: #Latest reports suggest that deals have been struck with just seven out of  countries, we have gained a lot more than we have spent on the EU, and multinational companies are threatening to relocate overseas, affecting jobs and investments.#Exiting in less than  days# time without any sound withdrawal agreement and just a few trade relationships will result in uncertainty and chaos.#The judges said they were impressed by how confident and informed the pupils were. They also felt the pupils were cohesive as a team and said that they saw some future MSPs and MPs.In the end, the judges awarded the team speaking against Brexit  points while the side advocating Brexit received  to claim victory.Skye, Lochaber, and Badenoch MSP Kate Forbes and Highland and Islands MSP Edward Mountain both fielded questions on Brexit after the debate and were quick to praise the pupils for their efforts.Ms Forbes said: #I certainly think they could have resolved Brexit faster than some of the politicians today # an absolutely fantastic debate based on fact, evidence, respect for each other, lots of confidence. I think I have left with a few top tips for my next debate in parliament!#Mr Mountain added: #I thought it was quite excellent # there#s obviously a lot of research gone into it.

Mr Gove is the bookies favourite at   and is seen by many to be a good choice to take charge of the next stage of the Brexit process. Conservative MPs would need to forget his betrayal of Boris Johnson in the  leadership race when he ran against Mrs May instead of supporting the former Mayor of London.Boris Johnsons stock is still high in the party, with many seeing him as the obvious hard Brexit choice from outside the cabinet. However, his time as Foreign Secretary and Mayor of London was prone to gaffes, and the Brexit bus still sticks in the memory of many voters.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is third favourite according the bookies, and would need a similar surge at the polls as the party had in  to challenge for a majority.As the longest-serving Health Secretary, Jeremy Hunt is seen as a safe pair of hands for the top role and backs a harder Brexit than other cabinet colleagues. This stance and his reputation could edge him ahead of the likes of Sajid Javid, Amber Rudd, and Matt Hancock.The long shotsMatt Hancock has publicly backed Mrs Mays deal throughout and is considered part of the next generation of Conservative talent and could be a dark horse.

They need tangible changes now, not months down the line.“Teachers are entitled to a safe working environment in which their wellbeing is safeguarded. Their Employer has a legal duty of care for them, which at the moment it is failing to deliver.“We hope that the Employer will agree to engage meaningfully with the union to address members’ concerns fully so that further strike action can be avoided.”The school will remain open this week despite the strike action.The Council for Catholic Maintained Schools called on the NASUWT to continue to engage in attempts to resolve the dispute and said the outstanding issues would not be resolved through strike action."},{"url":null,"title":"survey only third of britons want northern ireland to stay in uk brexit pressure on union","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Full UK-wide participation in the customs union and single market is acceptable to the DUP because it does not leave Northern Ireland aligned to the EU in isolation.It would maintain a soft border, debunking the persistent myth that the DUP wants a hard border.On Wednesday, the DUP opposed harder Brexit options - such as customs union membership alone - because it would not remove the backstop on which the May-EU withdrawal agreement rests.The DUP also rejected Labours fantasy option of membership of a customs union - asthere is an a la carte menu of such unions - in which the UK would miraculously continue to have the right to its own global trade deals and input to those of the EU.Belatedly, the dferences between the European Research Group - obsessed with Brexit - and the DUP - preoccupied only with Northern Irelands equal Brexit alongside the rest of the UK - have begun to be laid bare. Boris bin, ditch and junk the backstop Johnson wont be getting a repeat slot at the next DUP conference.Having used the event to launch his Conservative Party ascendancy, any fidelity to the DUP dissolved the moment Theresa May said \"support my backstop deal and theres a leadership vacancy\".Shameless is too inadequate a word.Et tu, Jacob Ill only changethe DUP moves Rees-Mogg, you changed as the DUP held steadfast. The DUP conference gig could have been yours, Jacob. I was looking forward to the first such gathering to be addressed in Latin.Many continue to criticise the DUP. The extensive support for the backstop across Northern Irelands business and farming communities shows a determination that economic logic ought to trump constitutional politics. Seamless access to EU and UK single markets matters, protecting livelihoods.To those at risk, this matters more than unproven claims that Northern Irelands unique alignment to the EU single market would be a constitutional betrayal, jeopardising the Union.In trying to persuade the DUP onside, the UK Government has made clear that it will not allow regulatory ergence between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.In other words,EU single market regulations change, the Government will adopt them across the UK to protect Northern Irelands EU and UK trading relationships.The problem is that the DUP will not trust successor governments to honour that pledge.A certain mythology has developed over the seamlessness of Northern Irelands place in the UK single market.A reader, Alan Brookes, contacted me wondering how many people recalled that some British people from where in the UK could not work in Northern Ireland from  until  without a work permit.Such permitswere issued only to qualied essential workers, with notable exceptions such as members of the Armed Forces, religious ministers and teachers.Under the old Stormont regime, the Safeguard of Employment Act was designed to create local jobs for local workers. Brookes recalls his final interview with a Northern Ireland engineering firm in . \"When they asked did I need a work permit as I was born in England and I stated I did they immediately cooled and I was informed it would be too dficult\".There have long been checks on certain commodities travelling between Great Britain and Northern Ireland and identication is always required.None of this has threatened the Union, but it has highlighted the distinctiveness of Northern Ireland.If the backstop worked well, it might possibly stem the rising demands of nationalists for constitutional change via a border poll and shore up the Union. After all, Northern Ireland only looks vaguely secure when it is economically prosperous and politically ing.Rarely, in other words.The DUPs intransigence has been matched by the EU steadfastly refusing to change a single word of the withdrawal agreement.There might be something faintly ridiculous about the chancelleries of Europe standing paralysed before Sammy Wilson, Nigel Dodds and Arlene Foster, but its where we are.The DUP will never back the backstop in its current form. Amid all the noise, the party has at least been consistent, wanting a deal, but clear that no backstop removal equals no deal.What more can Theresa May do to sell her agreement given she has laid down her political le for the bargain  Rename it St Andrews perhaps The withdrawal agreement is as unsellable to the DUP as it is unchangeable for the EU. Mays promise to stand downher deal passes could be the longest resignation note in history. It is utterly irrelevant to the DUP. And the DUP do not fear a general election.Charting a way forward,the DUP does believe that UK-wide customs union and single market alignment to the EU solves the backstop conundrum, why not vote for it, rather than abstain,another opportunity arises For the DUP, its all about UKexit, not Brexit.Jon Tonge is Professor of Politics at the University of Liverpool and co-author of books on the Democratic Unionist Party and the Ulster Unionist Party"},{"url":null,"title":"no cancellations expected on thursday says flybe after day of disruption","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

That means travelling to them and it means keeping in touch on a regular basis not just when we have a problem.”She added: “The good news is that all small members states are coming to the same conclusion. They all see what we see – the need to work together permanently to ensure that the voice of the small member states is heard.”"},{"url":null,"title":"sport ireland could halt fai funding over loan controversy","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It was sad, it’s heart-breaking.”“The good thing was, that one victim’s we when somebody asked her what she thought about the guy who killed so many and she said, ‘I feel sorry for him because his heart was fullhate and I feel proud that I can live my le with love in my heart and he will live the rest of his with hate in his heart’.“We wanted to get people together to remember the victims in unity and friendship as a whole community.”Standing togetherSinclair Stockman, New Zealand Consulate in Northern Ireland, attended a short ceremony before putting his own tribute on the wall of condolences at the North West Islamic Association.“Today is about being connected with and assuring, not reassuring, the Muslim community that in New Zealand we seen it as an attack on New Zealanders, the Muslim population is New Zealanders, they’re not apart. Through the leadership of the Prime Minister, she has made it very clear that the people that live in the country – they are of us,\" he told the Derry News.“Sometimes here with our local Troubles, some people think that some people aren’t of us but you may not agree with their politics, but they are from here.“The horror of this incident reminded me of the lunacy of the bomb that was left here in Derry outside the courthouse and those kids walking down the street... who would have been to blame  It’s that moronic evil, it’s fascism – fascism didn’t die after Hitler, Hitler was only one version of it.”Mr Stockman said the gesture of unity from the Muslim people of Derry and Derry natives showed strength in the face of such evil.“It helps have that thread of bonding and show that an attack on any one is an attack on me,” he said.“We should be standing up and standing together without thinking about it. It is important that we say that we stand with people that are under threat, irrespective of where they come from or where they are – as part of our Irishness that’s who we are.”PICTURED ABOVE: New

It is vital our leisure services are made welcoming for our entire community.Council chairman Mark Murnin welcomed the move and said he was delighted that families with children with autism could enjoy the same facilities as families in Newry.Committee chairman Cllr Gareth Sharvin said he had raised the matter with the February meeting.The move was also welcomed by Rowallane councillors Billy Walker and Terry Andrews.The news has been welcomed by Downpatrick Autism Family Support Group which has been working with the council on the proposal.Group chair Aacuteine Sloan welcomed the move, saying ldquoit will now make this first class facility accessible to all.She added: ldquoIt will give local autism families the opportunity to use the pool and feel more relaxed alongside other families that understand the struggles that may arise.

A Rhys OrsquoDonnell box kick was marginally long and carried back with interest before quick hands from Crosbie put his winger in for a superb try.The conversion left the game in the balance at -.The home side continued to dominate possession and territory and a Reaney penalty following a great breakdown turnover from skipper Aaron Cairns gave them a little breathing space.Old Belvedere, despite showing admirable invention, were guilty on occasion of overplaying and a series of errors meant they were pinned back in their own half.The bonus point score went to Cronin who drove over the line when Adair was held up just short and with  minutes to go Hinch looked certain of victory at -.A superb defensive effort then kept their Dublin opponents at bay in relative comfort until the th minute when the pressure eventually led to an overlap to leave the away side in with a chance of a draw as the game reached its final moments.However, in their desperation to run the ball out of defence and keep the game alive, Old Belvedere conceded a penalty which Reaney knocked over to clinch the win.That should have been the end of proceedings, but a penalty from a scrum led to another Belvo charge and they were awarded another penalty which Crosbie slotted with the last kick of the game to take two points back to Dublin.Ballynahinch continue their winning run and stand level with Old Wesley at the top of the table with two games to go.Ballynahinch Old Belvedere AIL DIVISION B.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Best friends laid to rest after accident  ","story":"BEST friends Shane McAnallen and Martin Patterson were buried side by side on Saturday.The two men in their twenties died together in a car crash on the Carlingford to Omeath Road in the early hours of Monday, March .It is believed they died at the scene and that no other vehicle was involved.Mr McAnallen was from the Castlewellan area and Mr Patterson was from Bryansford.Their tragic deaths, and that of missing Newcastle woman Ruth Maguire who also died in Carlingford over the St Patrickrsquos holiday weekend, left the community numb with grief.A community candlelight vigil was held in Carlingford on Sunday night which was attended by representatives from the deceasedrsquos families and rescue and emergency services.All three were connected to Bryansford GAC mdash the young men were former under-age players while mother of three Ms Maguire was the clubrsquos under-age coach.Mr Patterson also played for a time with Ballynahinch RFC U-s.He and Ms Maguire were also connected to St Maryrsquos Primary School in Newcastle.Ms Maguirersquos children attend the school and she was active in the St Maryrsquos Parent Support Group while Mr Patterson was a fondly remembered past pupil of the school.Ms Maguire was also known through her work as a casual leisure attendant at Newcastle Centre and also as a nursing assistant at Daisy Hill Hospital in Newry.The  year-old had been reported missing from a group of friends on a hen night while there were out socialising in Carlingford on Saturday.An extensive land and sea search was carried out on Sunday.On Monday, her body was recovered from the lough around the same time as the deaths of the young men became public.Mr McAnallen and Mr Patterson, also known as Marty Patt to friends, were laid to rest in separate ceremonies with many local people attending both services.A funeral for Mr McAnallen was held in St Malachyrsquos Church in Castlewellan early on Saturday morning.

local councils are being encouraged to provide financial support for the Air Ambulance Northern Ireland.The appeal has been issued by Rowallane councillor Billy Walker, who last month secured across-the-board political support from his Newry, Mourne and Down Council colleagues to provide funding to the service which plays a critical role across the district.It has been revealed that between August  and November last year, the air ambulance responded to  incidents across the council area.ldquoThe air ambulance is vital for people across the district, given its rural nature and attractions like the Mournes and Strangford Lough, Cllr Walke rsaid.The Rowallane politician recently visited the air ambulancersquos base outside Lisburn where he was joined by two of his party colleagues from Mid Ulster and Derry and Strabane Councils, both of which have agreed to provide financial support for the lesaving service.With three local authorities already on board, Cllr Walker hopes that the remaining eight Northern Ireland councils will provide financial support.He said while Stormont funds the air ambulance crew, medicines and medical equipment, it should be picking up the remainder of the servicersquos running costs.He confirmed that Strangford MP Jim Shannon plans to raise this issue with Department of Health Permanent Secretary, Richard Pengelly.ldquoDown District is already a main user of the air ambulance service which has already helped save a number of lives, Cllr Walker continued.ldquoThe service relies heavily upon donations to help meet the servicersquos poundm annual running costs and while this is welcome, I believe local councils and indeed the Department of Health needs to do more.Cllr Walker says while the air ambulance relies heavily upon public support, it also needs a sustainable funding stream to ensure it can continue to save lives and hopes this will be provided by the Department of Health.ldquoThe service is a key component of the emergency services and should not have to rely on charitable donations, he continued.ldquoGiven the costs to keep the service in the air, I believe all of the Provincersquos  councils, supported by the government department, have a role to play.Cllr Walker, who was recently made aware of the excellent work of the air ambulance when the crew responded to an emergency in Killyleagh when a woman was involved in an accident in Plantation Street, confirmed that Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos financial contribution to the service will be agreed at a meeting of its efficiencies working group.He added: ldquoThe air ambulance is an excellent service which all of Northern Ireland is fortunate to have and it is important that we continue to support its

the iconic sweeping beam at St Johnrsquos Point Lighthouse near Killough is seeking a meeting with local politicians.The Lecale Lightkeepers want to meet face-to-face with Newry, Mourne and Down councillors to spell out why the beam must be retained and why the proposed LED replacement suggested by the Dublin-based Commissioner of Irish Lights is totally inadequate and unacceptable.Campaigners have also submitted a Freedom of Information request to the local authority for copies of all correspondence between the councilrsquos Enterprise, Regeneration and Tourism Department and the Commissionerrsquos office on the lighthouse issue.Last month, the local authority was heavily criticised for excluding the press and public from a meeting mdash billed as a workshop mdash involving councillors and representatives from the Commissionerrsquos office, including its most senior official, Captain Robert McCabe.The council subsequently confirmed the workshop, held at the local authorityrsquos headquarters in Downpatrick, was a ldquopreliminary information session for councillors and that prior to any plans being finalised or put in place for the future of the lighthouse, a wide ranging public consultation would take place.The workshop lasted well over one hour but the report from the behind-closed-doors session which has been sent to councillors amounts to a paltry two and a half lines.Signicantly, the paper does not detail the questions put by councillors or, most importantly the response from Commissioner officials, compounding the frustration of those seeking to retain the beam.They are angry that the council report provides no detail whatsoever of what was discussed and simply states the issue of the lighthouse beam will be raised at district electoral forums across the district.Campaigners insist that as the Commissioner of Irish Lights had the opportunity to put its case before councillors, it is only right and proper and in keeping with equality legislation and good old fashioned fairness, that the Lecale Lightkeepers should be afforded the same opportunity.The campaigners have been exchanging correspondence with council officials and described one response confirming the sweeping beam issue will be discussed at ious district electoral forums with a view to having a joint meeting with Captain McCabe, which the public could also attend, as ldquodismissive and derogatory.The Lecale Lightkeepers have also vehemently rejected the councilrsquos view that a joint DEA meeting to put questions directly to representatives of the Commissioners of Irish Lights would be the ldquomost appropriate forum to address the issues they have raised.A spokesperson for the campaign group said councillors were keen to protect the iconic, sweeping beam, describing plans to remove the mercury bearing which rotates the Fresnel lamp due to health concerns as ldquoflimsy and flawed.They have also rejected claims that a new LED light proposed by the Commissioners would be the same, arguing this ldquosimply isnrsquot true.Campaigners say it is their understanding that some councillors are at a complete loss as to why the local authority is denying them a chance to meet all of the councilrsquos  members to state their case.They say Commissioners were in Downpatrick last month because councillors voted unanimously to invite them for a meeting to discuss the controversial plan to replace the sweeping beam with what, in their view, is a much inferior light.ldquoThe irony of what is happening is not lost on us, said the spokesperson for the campaign group.ldquoCouncillors discuss the issue of the sweeping beam and unanimously agree that it should be retained. They propose to meet with the Commissioners which happens but yet when campaigners ask to meet with all the districtrsquos elected representatives at one time, we are denied this opportunity. Why The spokesperson added: ldquoWe hope councillors will demand a detailed account of the recent workshop so the views of the Commissioners can be critically examined and scrutinised by not only campaigners, but elected representatives, to determinethey are accurate.ldquoIf, in our opinion they are not, we should be given an opportunity to refute them in front of councillors who were elected to represent the people of this district and who are accountable to them.ldquoIf changes are made at St Johnrsquos Point Lighthouse, the historic character of the sweeping beam will be lost forever. We must all stand together and ensure this does not happen. What is being offered by the Commissioner is inferior to what we currently have.A council spokesman said officers from the the Commissioner of Irish Lights will be invited to future meetings of the districtrsquos respective DEA Forums.He explained this is to ensure that information can be shared and that local stakeholders and communities are fully consulted upon any proposals for St Johnrsquos Lighthouse in the immediate future before any plans are finalised.The spokesman added: ldquoRequests for details of future public consultations on plans for St Johnrsquos Point Lighthouse would be best addressed by the Commissioner of Irish Lights..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Crossgar food sauce firm in deal with Aldi  ","story":"PREP House Sauces in Crossgar has won its first business with discount retailer Aldi in the Republic of Ireland.Prep House is a family business which has won a string of national awards for its original sauces and dressings.Itrsquos now supplying its pepper sauce to Aldi for its network of  stores across the Republic.Managing director Paul Bell, who took over the management reins of the company in , described the new deal as ldquoa marvellous boost.ldquoThis very important business for us resulted when we swtly followed up a lead from Invest NIrsquos Drew McIvor, he added.ldquoOur approach was well received by the Aldi buyer who was extremely interested and very supportive.

The Down sharp shooters lost their way and tried their luck from distance. The result was aimless, wayward shooting.Louth, who deservedly led - to - at half time, made a decisive burst with eight unanswered points either side of the break.Full forward Sam Mulroy bagged half their tally, all five of his points coming from frees, during that purple patch, with midfielders James Calfand Tommy Durnin also registering.With  minutes to go Louth led - to - and then came the Down revival, led by Darren OrsquoHagan who scored a goal and a point.The goal came after Donal OrsquoHarersquos initial shot was brilliantly kept in by Connaire Harrison. The ball fell to OrsquoHagan, who dummied and then fired his shot into the net.Harrison,who looked impressive,registered a great point and when Paul Devlin and then OrsquoHagan also pointed, the gap was down to a single score.Down, who had mounted a number of successful comebacks during the campaign, looked as though they were going to mount another great escape.But it was not to be.

I am confident that the completed public realm scheme will signicantly enhance the ambitious plans to develop a new retail and commercial centre at this part of Downpatrick.It was confirmed recently that the former police base will not be bulldozed as part of the ambitious multi-million pound plan to regenerate this part of the town.The building mdash which enjoys protected status mdash is to remain a key feature of the proposed redevelopment project which, in addition to new retail and commercial space, could also include an element of housing provision.Council officials insist the former police basersquos listed building status is not an impediment to the development of the site and view preserving the former station as an opportunity and a challenge, insisting it very much remains part of the overall development project and potentially could be utilised as an attractive entrance feature.To date, senior retailers including Marks and Spencer and Home Bargains have expressed an interest in opening new premises at the proposed retail complex which will be built on a huge area of land stretching back as as far as St Patrickrsquos Avenue.A council spokeswoman confirmed yesterday that while the public realm works were scheduled to complete on March , a utilities company was required to undertake work in Irish Street before the public realm contractor was able to get on site.She added: ldquoDue to unforeseen circumstances experienced by the utilities company on site which required their attention, it resulted in a delay to the completion date of the overall public realm scheme.

He said that in addition to the trauma of suddenly losing a young child, they now faced the added pressure of having to have their child flown to England for post-mortem.Mr McGrath said it was his understanding that the issue impacted on around  families a year, highlighting the importance of doing everything possible for families.ldquoThere are a number of considerations here, suggested Mr McGrath. ldquoWe have to consider the period of time to conclude the post-mortem andthe child to their family for burial.ldquoI am very heartened to hear that the present model involving Liverpool is maintaining the turnaround times. What is also of the utmost importance is supporting the childrsquos family and I am glad to hear that there are bereavement support teams here for families.Mr McGrath added: ldquoThis is not going to be an easy process, however what is absolutely vital is that we get the right long term solution and my colleagues and I will be pressing the government department for that.ldquoCllr Trainor and I met departmental officials to ascertain how we can progress matters for the peace of mind of families here.Explaining the background to sending babies to Liverpool for post-mortem, Cllr Trainor said the paediatric pathologist who was involved in carrying out these procedures in Belfast moved from his current post and there was no one available to fill the position.ldquoFrom our meeting, it is apparent that there is a shortage here of paediatric pathologists and this is why the link with Liverpool has been implemented as a short term solution, he said.Cllr Trainor added: ldquoThe Department of Health is also looking at the possibility of an all island approach. However, such a process would take some time to develop as we look at the possibility of a standardised level of care between north and south.Local health campaigners are also seeking a meeting with senior health chiefs to discuss the issue of child post-mortems being held in Liverpool.The Down Community Health Committee believes thatpriority was given to funding and enticement for the training of pathologists, post-mortems could continue to be carried out on a regional basis.At one of its recent meetings, Mrs Anne Trainor, suggested that the possibility of pathologists travelling to Northern Ireland periodically from England, Scotland, Wales and further afield could be considered.She described the decision to perform post-mortems in Liverpool as ldquosickening and immoral and argued health officials should have done more to continue the service.Mrs Trainor added: ldquoFor women who have had a miscarriage or whose baby dies, it is the single worst thing that is ever going to happen in your le.ldquoYou will lose parents, aunts and uncles, husbands and wives, but you will never experience the pain and heartbreak of losing a child. For health officials to suggest that a child is wrapped up like a package and sent across the water for a post mortem is cruel.

More of those who voted Remain in the referendum than of those who voted Leave think Brexit will make a united Ireland more likely.The research was published by market research organisation Ipsos MORI for King’s College London.Roger Mortimore, professor of public opinion and political analysis at King’s College London, said: “When Scotland voted on whether to become independent in , there was a clear majority among the public in the rest of the UK that hoped it would choose to stay. But many fewer Britons, it seems, would mindNorthern Ireland decided to leave the Union.”Conservatives are most likely to hope that Northern Ireland would vote to stay in the UK: % of those who would currently vote Conservative say they would prefer Northern Ireland to vote to stay, compared to % of Labour supporters and % of Liberal Democrats.Those who voted for Britain to Remain in the EU in the  referendum are more likelyto want Northern Ireland to leave the Union and join the Republic than those who voted Leave .Three in four adults who live in GB have never visited Northern Ireland, and a further % have visited only once or twice. Just % have lived or worked there, and % have visited many times.In response to the survey results, DUP MP Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said: “The poll shows clearly that support for Northern Ireland remaining within the Union is twice that expressed for a United Ireland.“Arlene Foster has outlined the need to put forward a positive case for the Union and there is a need for unionists to ensure this case is made right across the UK.”Mr Donaldson added: “The issue facing people at present is not Northern Ireland voting to weaken the Union, but the insistence upon a backstop which would place in internal border inside the United Kingdom. There are many people from all political viewpoints who do not support such a proposal.”Ulster Unionist MLA Steve Aiken said: “The recent Ipsos MORI poll revealed that in GB only % believed Northern Ireland should leave the UK, with roughly a third each saying that NI should stay or didn’t have strong feelings either way.“While in comparison to similar polls around the Scottish referendum there was a more marked response to stay, it is clear that, by this poll, there is no marked call for the end of the Union.”Lesley-Ann McCarragher family ‘devastated’ as hit-and-run driver’s sentence reduced Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Mr Aiken said there is “absolutely no room for complacency” but took issue with how this poll has been “spun” – claiming a closer interpretation of the poll, rather than just reading the press release, “would have resulted in rather less sensationalism”.He added: “A constant barrage of  years of negative media stories has obviously taken its toll on how this place is perceived, but a great deal of good work is being done to attract visitors and I know from experience, that once we get them here, they want to come back.”Mr Aiken also accused the DUP of associating itself with the ‘ultra’ wing of the Tory party which he said “isn’t doing unionism or indeed Northern Ireland any favours”.try catch  TrendingThree year-old missing N.I. boy is foundMulti-vehicle collision closes major NI roadDual carriageway closed after serious road traffic collisionlsquoAwesomersquo, lsquoExcellentrsquo and lsquoWonderfulrsquo -

The event ran from Saturday March  to Tuesday March .The Vale brewery Tomos and Lilford produced a special beer called ldquoCarnival - Penarth Pale Ale.Meanwhile the two Penarth butchers, Thompson Family Butchers and David Lush Butchers, both created their own special Penarth carnival sausages.The organisers estimated that more than  people took part in costume in the walk through town on Saturday, which saw the coronation of the lsquoFirst Foolrsquo at am. The procession marched from Sully Terrace through town.At .am in Penarth Library, there was a presentation of the head of Bendigeidfran, from The Mabinogion. The head was made by children from Cogan and Penygarth schools.The lsquoFirst Foolrsquo was then sent by train to the Tower of London to bring news of the Carnival to the traditional resting place of the head of Bendigeidfran, where he met the Raven Master.Long distance cyclist Dave Hann was due to cycle to Harlech, north Wales to raise money for the RNLI Penarth, and bring news to Harlech that Carnival had broken out in Penarth.Unfortunately Mr Hann only got as far as Cardigan before Storm Freya made it too dangerous to continue. Organisers have one barrel of carnival ale left and will take it to Harlech by train in the next few weeks to share it and the storybook of the carnival.On Sunday, two rugby teams took part in a ldquotug-o-sausage to decide which butcherrsquos sausage was better. Congratulations were extended to the winners, Team Thompson.Congratulations were also extended to the traders Ener-chi and Lilypad by the organisers, for having the best-dressed shop windows. Particular praise was singled out for the carnival flowers at Holm House Hotel created by Lilypad.Further nights of partying, songs and dancing were spotted in the Albion, St Faganrsquos Castle, and other pubs, bars and venues across Penarth. There were also celebrations on the Penarth Pier on Tuesday night following a Pancake Day event, while wandering bands of musicians like Wonderbrass kept spirits high.The festival culminated in a grand Mardis Gras party on Tuesday, which saw crowds of costumed residents dance the night away.Richard Parry, one of the carnival organisers, said: ldquoToday is Ash Wednesday, the beginning of Lent. Carnival finished last night on Mardi Gras.ldquoThanks to everyone who took part, contributed, encouraged, sponsored, smiled and partied, especially those people who took a carnival Bank Holiday Monday.ldquoIt was fabulous to hear your Carnival Bank Holiday stories, and to all those people who have had little private carnival moments of joy over the festival, thatrsquos what it has all been about.ldquoAnd some people have already said, lsquosee you next year!rsquoldquoThere were lots of people laughing and smiling on the sidelines, telling me they wanted to take part next year ndash just with a little more notice next time. But now itrsquos established, wersquoll be back next year and ready for even more people to join in the fun! article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Wersquore creating work which is not really necessary.If we want to improve the gateway there are other ways of doing it.ldquoIt really doesnrsquot begin to tackle the active travel . I do feel this is about spending the money before next February.Councillors were told the widened roundabout was one part of a wider strategy for transport improvements in Penarth.Charlotte Pugh, senior planner for the council, said the new scheme would transform the area.She said: ldquoThis whole are is going to be completely transformed. At the moment it is not very welcoming to pedestrians.ldquoI think it will go some way to transforming this gateway into Penarth and make it a safer environment.Previous plans to make part of Plassey Street one-way to incoming traffic, and removing the roundabout altogether, were dropped following opposition from the public.The committee agreed to endorse the transport scheme but requested regular updates on the wider transport plans for Penarth. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Believe it or not, itrsquos been far too long since wersquove had a debate on this issue in Parliament, and I spoke about the importance of our investments and pensions going into renewable sources, not into fossil fuels.I also pointed out my support for the young people across the UK who went on a climate strike the week before. Itrsquos their futures that wersquore concerned about here and they were absolutely right to do what they did.And then of course the Brexit shambles continues ndash we cannot escape it ndash but we were debating it again last week, with hugely important votes to come next week.But last week was a signicant one. The PM was forced into a corner, forced to concede that she might have to rule out No Deal and extend Article , and the Labour Party came out decisively for putting this issue back to the people.And this week we saw the Government attempt to win over MPs with a fund it claims will boost less well-off towns after Brexit ndash but in another shambolic aspect to this hapless attempt to bribe MPs into voting for Theresa Mayrsquos so-called deal, there is no cash for Welsh towns.Another example of the Tories letting Wales down, and yet further reason to support the push for a final say on Brexit for the public through a Peoplersquos Vote. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Last month I met with constituents over disruption to local rail services. I know that many of you will have experienced delays and cancellations to services in the weeks following the handover of the Wales Rail Franchise. I understand and share the frustration that these delays have caused. There has been a shortage of rolling stock as a result of a large maintenance backlog following the handover of the franchise together with planned changes to rail services. This has led to a signicant reduction in services and replacement bus services. I have been in contact with the Minister for Transport and Transport for Wales to raise the concerns of constituents. I have been assured that service levels are now back to normal and they do not anticipate any restrictions to services in the coming year. I will of course maintain my interest to see that those assurances are kept. I will update residents again on future plans to deliver improved station facilities, trains and more regular services.As many of you are aware Cardf Bus has recently announced changes to bus services across Cardf and the Vale. A number of bus routes are at risk as part of these changes. The removal of bus links for work, social links and public services, including hospital routes, would have a signicant impact on my constituents.Cardf Bus are not acting to deliberately hurt our communities. Far from being an uncaring organisation Cardf Bus are stuck with a legal framework that stops them from operating on the same basis as commercial competitors. Competitors can cherry pick and target single profitable routes that undermine the wider social propose that most of us want from local bus services. Cardf Councilrsquos Labour leadership has committed to supporting at risk bus services for  years. Unless the Conservative leadership of the Vale Council agrees to Labour councillors amendments to the budget and protects local bus services in the Vale then bus routes will go. The Vale Council leadership could and should act. If they donrsquot then my constituents will suffer.In future, the regulation of buses is the answer. London was the only part of the UK that was allowed to keep a regulated bus service. It is no mistake that it has the best and most coherent service. We now have the legislative powers to regulate bus services here in Wales. The Welsh Government is currently consulting on proposals to reform bus and taxi services in Wales. More information on the consultation can be found at: https:beta.gov.wales improving-public-transport. The consultation closes on th March ndash please do get in touch and take part. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Morgan, Stephen Henry and Ryan Kerr as B SquadronScottish  North Irish Yeomanry were granted freedom of the borough of Mid and East Antrim in . Picture by Darren Kidd   Press EyeNot bad for a bunch of part timers.NI Horse – now absorbed into the Scottish  North Irish Yeomanry – was given a military distinction for its role during one of the bloodiest battles of World War II.The battle at Monte Cassino took place on May ,  and saw ‘The Horse’ fight alongside Canadian troops as they assaulted the Hitler Line.Portadown man Bracken Anderson, a former member in his late sixties, and current member John Stewart spoke to the News Letter about the regiment past and present.Bracken said: “I’ve been researching The Horse for  years. I was in it in the seventies when I was at the Art College in Belfast. I wasn’t in it that long, but I’ve always been fascinated by its history. It’s the only cavalry regiment left in the Province, all of the rest of them are infantry.”The North Irish Horse was founded in  after the Boer War in South Africa. It was made up of part time volunteers from what was then the north of Ireland.After World War I NI Horse was kept alive in name by just one combatant officer and became known as the ‘one man regiment’.The Horse was reassembled for World War II when it achieved its greatest distinctions in the North African and Italian campaigns, the latter featuring the Battle of Monte Cassino – one of the bloodiest days for the Allied Forces.Bracken said: “As the German Army started to retreat up through Italy towards Austria they built defensive lines to slow the Allied advance. One of these stop lines was the Hitler Line at Monte Cassino, south of Rome.”The Hitler Line was a , yard front of , crack German troops in sunken shelters and ious armoury including mm anti-tank guns, mines, and dismounted panther tank turrets.The May  assaultwas led by the Canadian Infantry Division supported by Churchill and Sherman tanks of the th Tank Brigade of which NI Horse were the senior regiment. Interestingly the original Churchill tank prototypes were designed and built by Harland  Wolff in .Battle on to save breast cancer services at Craigavon Hospital Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"Bracken said: “The Germans had spent nearly six months constructing the Hitler Line. Defences were well placed, and cleverly camouflaged. The whole line was designed to lure Allied troops and tanks into a tactical killing fields cul-de-sac in which there was no escape. They were so low-set Allied tanks could not see them before they were shot to pieces.”He described one of the unconventional German tactics: “Hitler Youth snipers tied themselves to trees and shot at anything that moved, including stretcher bearers. The entire scene was a nightmare.”He continued: “Tanks and troops had barely advanced  yards when all hell broke loose. Dust whipped up by the tanks combined with smoke and exhaust fumes reduced visibility to  yards.“The battle area was a scene of devastation – burning tanks, dead and wounded infantrymen, shell holes and continual firing.“The tanks of the North Irish Horse has little room to manoeuvre to avoid their own destruction, let alone provide the Canadian infantry with fire support. In one field alone,  Churchill tanks had been disabled. “The assault on the Hitler Line lasted all day and NI Horse tanks stayed throughout that night to support the depleted infantry.“The cost to the three Canadian regiments was heavy, with a total of , casualties, killed, wounded or missing.“The NI Horse had  tanks knocked out – almost half the regiment – with  officers and men killed along with  wounded.“Many of the tanks were burnt out. Next day volunteers went back and collected crews’ ashes from the tanks.”Despite the devastation suffered, the commander of the Canadian infantry askedall ranks of the th tank brigade would wear a maple leaf in future, as a badge of honour and thanks for their support.Bracken said: “The NIH proudly wear a small maple leaf on their unorms to this day. Canadians also asked that NIH dead be buried alongside Canadian Infantry dead, and this was carried out.”John Stewart, who is Lance Corporal with the squadron which carries on the NI Horse name, said: “The North Irish Horse doesn’t actually exist any more. We are the B SquadronScottish and North Irish Yeomanry. We’re the only cavalry unit left in Northern Ireland.”He added: “We were always a reservist or territorial regiment, but at the same time we were always called up. NI Horse were the first territorial regiment to go to the front line in . We were there two weeks after the war started.“There’s a really high level of mobilization even though we’ve always been a territorial or reservist unit. Guys have volunteered for conflicts right up until most recently in Afghanistan and Iraq.”In terms of how operations have changed, John said: “We do reconnaissance. What the guys used to do on the horses in front of the front line we go out in armoured vehicles and recce positions, observe, report back and guide in the air or ground attacks.”A parade will take place in Carrickfergus on Saturday, May  to mark the th anniversary of the Hitler Line battle in which nearly two thirds of the regiment died.Lance Corporal John Stewart said: “It’s the North Irish Horse day, a day that everyone from The Horse, both current serving and former members will attend. The whole regiment from Northern Ireland and Scotland will be parading with the new standard on show. It’s a day that we wouldn’t miss.“Representatives from the Canadian Army come over for that, we parade through the town and have a big event afterwards.“It means a vast amount to the guys. They’re well aware of the history of The Horse. It’s amazing the amount of guys who do their research before they join.“Every couple of years the regiment will run a battlefield tour to Monte Cassino to see where their forefathers fought and the treacherous terrain they fought through with the Canadians.”Of the association with Canadian troops, John said: “We wear the maple leaf on our vehicles and on our dress unorms we have the maple leaf on our shoulders. It’s something that’s still there to this day.”try catch  TrendingConcern for missing N.I. girl - P.S.N.I. issue emergency appeallsquoI was half awake and he was leaning over the bed touching my -year-oldrsquo says mum after attempted abductionCouncillorrsquos family lsquohurt and upsetrsquo after lsquovile, defamatoryrsquo graffiti appearsAll emergency services at scene of N.I. collision -

Which makes it even more impressive that, in that time, he’s also managed to start and scale up one of the great business success stories in Northern Ireland, David Meade Events. Known for his skills as a mentalist and speaker, David also runs the company which delivers cutting-edge corporate events, learning and development workshops, and offers keynote speaking services. It has achieved double figure growth every year since its establishment in  working not only in UK and Irish markets, but also internationally. Asked how he had ersied into events and keynote speaking from being an on-stage mentalist, David says: “I’ve actually been delivering events and keynote speeches very successfully in the UK and Ireland for a number of years, but I suppose most people know me for my tours and the more corporate side of my business was lesser known. “I moved into this space roughly seven years ago because I love inspiring and motivating people and it was a natural move to work with companies who want to inspire their teams to be innovative and the best they can be.” David believes there are even more opportunities outside our region and this year the company is investing over £, to take advantage of them. This includes investing in new video learning services, enabling people to access David’s bespoke training services remotely, from wherever they are in the world. “Over the last number of years, the company has grown at a phenomenal rate and this latest investment was a no-brainer because we simply had to respond to that growth.” David says: “We are still based in Northern Ireland, but there is a huge untapped market that we want to explore further. The world is getting smaller because of technology and we want to meet the challenge and work with people all across the globe. So far in  we have contracts in  countries, including Dubai, Singapore and Switzerland and many more are in the pipeline.” David’s list of international clients reads like a who’s who of the biggest and most impressive organisations in the world including Apple, Hard, Mercedes Benz, Adobe, Bank of America, Coca-Cola, British Airways and Canon. David attributes his company’s success and ability to attract such high-level clients to its ability to adapt and innovate in response to the market. “If the uncertainty of today’s marketplace teaches us anything, it’s that you must evolve and that’s what we’re doing – keeping up with the ever-changing market and meeting the ever-increasing demands, both in Northern Ireland and across the globe.” One of the company’s most exciting innovations has been the development of a bespoke in-house video production studio. This has greatly enhanced its capacity to produce media projects for its clients. Allowing clients to access the bespoke training remotely means the firm can compete all over the globe. This view of the company, as competing on an international stage, is a vital part of David’s approach to business and informs the business decisions he makes, including this recent quarter of a million-pound investment. He explains “The investment in our video learning service means we can deliver training to clients in any corner of the world, at any time. Thinking of ourselves as part of a global economy, rather than just the Northern Ireland economy has been key to shting the company up a gear.” He has grown to a team of  and this year the company is expected to achieve a turnover of £m, an impressive milestone for any company but something David considers not a destination or even a point to slow down, but simply a  to push on to bigger and better things. “As the company continues to thrive and grow every year, I find myself looking at new and innovative ways to keep up with demand. Hitting that £m milestone will be energising and whilst I’m proud of the work my team have done here, I’m already thinking ‘OK, what’s next ’ With this investment, our ability to evolve and the international demand for the services we provide, there’s so much more we can do.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/sto1.jpg","title":"stormont departments compiling emergency no deal brexit contingency list","story":"Posted on Wednesday  March  by John Mulgrew Stormont departments are building a key list of emergency contacts across business and the wider sectors amid contingency planning for a ‘no deal’ Brexit, Ulster Business can reveal. It’s understood departments have begun contacting companies, organisations and business groups as part of “Brexit contingency” ‘no deal’ planning, in order to “locate someone who can assist them in normal working hours and out of hours”. An email seen by Ulster Business, sent by the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs , says in the event of a ‘no deal’ scenario “time will be of the essence and identying the correct people to help solve any problems or issues in a very short space of time will be critical”. It’s understood the Department for the Economy and the Department for Infrastructure have also made contact. A Northern Ireland Civil Service spokesman told Ulster Business: \"Since the UK Referendum, the Northern Ireland Civil Service has engaged in a signicant programme of work which covers a range of issues that arise as a consequence of the UK leaving the EU. \"Over recent months, there has been a greater focus on no deal planning across government, including the contingency plans that would be necessary in the event of a no deal outcome. \"The Northern Ireland Civil Service has been engaged in this process and plans have been developed on a ‘reasonable worst case scenario’ basis. \"These contingency plans are under constant development as we continue to engage with key stakeholder groups and partners in government.

Now, George Lowden has taken the biggest step in his career and paired up with a global superstar to develop an instrument for the masses, writes John Mulgrew If you first began making guitars as a boy in Bangor, it’s perhaps not surprising that after  years your instruments are among the greatest in the world. Now, George Lowden’s journey has taken its biggest step in decades – teaming up with one of the world’s biggest pop stars to produce a range of more affordable instruments George’s guitar-making story has taken many turns in the last few decades, from making small numbers himself, to larger-scale production and outsourcing, before moving to his current Downpatrick home and building some of the most beautul and acoustically rich-sounding instruments. They are regularly in the hands of people like English folk hero Richard Thompson and Pierre Bensusan, but have also graced the stage along arguably one of the greatest players of a six-string instrument, Eric Clapton. In fact, the former Cream and Bluesbreakers man took to the stage at the Grammy’s in  with a Lowden – forgoing the Martins which he had, and has, used throughout his career. But the next step in the Lowden journey came something out of the left field for many in the industry, and players alike. George and managing director Ausdahl took to the NAMM show in Anaheim, Calornia alongside Ed Sheeran – collaborating on a more affordable range of instruments. The most interesting part of that, from a production perspective, is the guitars will still be made in Northern Ireland, while the majority of the big US makers outsource production of cheaper ranges. “It all started about five years ago with Gary Lightbody when he was using my guitars,” George told Ulster Business. “I made one for Ed Sheeran. I thought, he uses small guitars and we don’t have them. “So, I decided to design one. I went up to the north coast and spent about a week there – thinking and drawing, and designed what is now the Wee Lowden.” After that, Ed used the guitar for recording, and it spurred on a relationship with the instruments which led to the new partnership. “I definitely didn’t want to outsource the production, having had experience of that in the s, with licensing there are limitations – particularly when it comes to quality control and design. “I decided,we do this, we are going to do it here. The challenge of course, is salaries and productionare higher than the Far East, for example. I had confidence that because of the tech available – the careful marriage between hi-tech processes, and more traditional hand processes.” “One of the interesting things is,you examine guitar-making worldwide, in the Far East the processes tend to be more hand made, because labour costs are very low. “In the US, the processes are more machine orientated. I wanted to develop some ground-breaking processes, which I think will be taken up by other companies in due course, but also keep some of the very important hand processes, most importantly hand carving the internal bracing system.” For acoustic guitars, the bracing inside the instrument is one of the keys to the overall tone of the instrument, along with the wood selection – and resonance – and the quality of the build, parts and set up. “That’s not a small challenge for us. We have to train young people to use sharp chisels. But I have found in the past, people have reasonable hand-to-eye co-ordination, so can pick it up quickly.” And from the volume perspective, George says he’s already pre-sold three quarters of the first year of production. That’s starting off at around , instruments a year, but growing that “considerably higher” in year two. Speaking about the burgeoning relationship between George and Ed Sheeran, managing director David Ausdahl, says it was a meeting of minds which focused on simplying design while retaining high build quality and tone. “There was a trecta of requirements. Not compromising on quality, doing it here and making it accessible to a whole new market and a whole new price point. George never moved out of that space. “We have had unprecedented demand. People were coming across the standand some hadn’t previously known the company. It gives them an introduction to a new market. “Young people are able to get engaged with the guitar, and make music.” If you aren’t familiar with the existing handmade Lowden range, prices start at around £,, while guitars using more exotic woods and parts can quickly rise to the cost of a small hatchback. But George is kicking off the new Sheeran by Lowden range at less than £. “We realised, for young people, that a price point of say £, is what most young people aspire to. One of our aims, both Ed and I realised, all too often, young people who want to take up guitar and write songs. They buy a guitar which is the best they can afford. But it’s uninspiring, has a hard tone and is dficult to play – far too many of them would just give up. “we could produce a guitar, that doesn’t have the cosmetics, butwe can make one that sounds really good, at an affordable price, something worthwhile.” To keep costs down, Lowden has cherry-picked production priorities, retaining hand made work for areas such as the internal bracing. “We also clearly did not want the two ranges to encroach in others territory.” He says existing players have already taken an interest in getting their hands on the new Sheeran by Lowden instruments. “From a commercial point of view, it’s a large market but obviously it is more competitive than the high end market Lowdens. I personally have to be very proud of what we do, and I feel, as long as I’ve done my job, I feel confident it’ll be a great success.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/gmcg_web.jpg","title":"gmcg on a bright future and its next generation","story":"Posted on Tuesday April  by Ulster Business GMcG is already a well-established and leading independent accountancy and advisory business, and the growing firm tells Ulster Business about planning for a brighter future, carrying out major investment and developing the next generation “Our success is about people, building and growing relationships, innovation and developing the next generation. We have a business that has very much enjoyed its own expansion and we want to shine a light on our next generation of young professionals”.According to Susan Dunlop, that’s a well refined mantra at GMcG Chartered Accountants. Susan is one of seven directors at GMcG, having joined the firm more than  years ago and who now heads up the firm’s Audit and Business Advisory Services department. Part of planning for the future has been the recent appointment of a new director in Audit and Business Advisory Services, together with an associate director who will head up the firm’s Corporate Finance department. Both are signicant investments at management level and a reflection of the firm’s growth and ambition across its three offices.“As a leading independent accountancy firm, many of our key strengths lie in our ability to get things done, through local decision making, management and accessibility of our people” Susan says.Accessibility is regularly acknowledged as being of great value to the firm’s clients and has become a key component of how the firm does business.“Business owners know they can lt the phone and speak to any of our directors, at any time of the day. For us, that’s just part of our client service, but our clients expect it and they know it can make a huge dference to getting an issue resolved quickly and effectively, allowing them to get on with running their business.”As local businesses face uncertainty and challenges across many fronts, Susan and the management team recognise the importance of being positioned as the complete business advisor and having the expertise, understanding and experience to deliver. “Businesses evolve through dferent circumstances and with dferent requirements. We need to be one step ahead, providing the right expertise at the right time. GMcG can offer this expertise through our service lines which include Audit and Business Advisory, Tax, Forensic Accounting and Investigation, Corporate Finance, GMcG Digital and International liaison, through our TIAG membership.” The firm delivers these services though a team of more than  employees across three offices in Belfast, Lisburn and Portadown. Having initially operated as independent firms in each locationthe GMcG evolution was completed in  when the three firms merged completely under a single GMcG brand. This was a signicant investment and transition for the firm.Gill Johnston, director at GMcG Portadown, says: “It was vital that we didn’t lose focus on the profile and client relationships we had developed over many years in each location. “So we are delighted with the success of the transition and how the shared systems and expertise are adding real value to client service delivery across each location”. GMcG services a broad client base from sole traders to large corporates, including a erse range of businesses and private iniduals, public and not-for-profit sector entities, as well as legal and other professional services practices.For Susan and the rest of the team, the firm’s independence and longstanding client relationships are what bolster the firm’s success.“We have a loyal and growing client base and are particularly proud of the fact that many of these relationships go back decades or transcend generations. We advise many of these clients on succession planning, helping them develop their business through the next stage of its journey. “In our experience, all of this is underlined by the importance of investing in client relationships, getting to know the client’s business, their issues, opportunities and the type of expertise they need.“It can be a long term effort and something that often demands dedication beyond a nine to five working day. But we always view it as a rewarding investment, especially when we see our clients thrive and grow.”As part of the firm’s growth and expansion, GMcG has undergone major investment in its overall strategy, its people, IT systems and recruitment.With no shortage of drive and ambition, it’s very much a case of ‘been there, done that’ for GMcG, having themselves undergone restructuring, appointed new directors, undertaken signicant investment, experienced dynamic growth and transitioned seamless succession planning.“We have done it ourselves, and been through it all,” Susan says. “We have grown our firm and understand many of the challenges and opportunities facing SME clients with real aspirations or plans for business development we have that insight and experience that has really proved valuable in advising many of these clients.”Building on these foundations, the firm today has a strong focus on developing the next generation of its service team.
