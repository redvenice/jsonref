Few frustrations, but overall a good performance. Credit to the team around me, there was lots of experience helping me out. The breakdown let us down a bit at times and that’s an area we can improve on.”“We put a big emphasis on this game and we put ourselves back in the competition this week. We were a bit scrappy in parts, credit to Italy, but scoring that many points is good. I loved paying with Harry Randall, we came through age ranks together so we have a connection. We’ll enjoy tonight, but onto the next game after that.” But a penalty advantage was being played and Italy take the scrum on the English five metre line.Well, that’s certainly novel, I’ll give Jones that.Ollie Chessum is on for his debut, replacing Tom CurryJoe Marler replaces Ellis GengeItaly have never been nilled in a competitive match against England and they will want to prevent it happening here.I’m also not sure he let his winger know that’s what he was going to do either.Fecerico Mori is replaced by Leonardo Marin. Giovanni Pettinelli is on for Sebastian Negri who is stretchered off looking in a bad way.Ben Youngs replaces Randall, winning his 114th cap draing him level in appearances with Jason Leonard. Sam Simmons replaces Isiekwe. That should see Itoje move to lock and Simmons into the back row.Italy have another lineout, but on the resulting possession Dombrandt clamps on the ball to win a turnover penalty. The home side may feel a little aggrieved as in the previous possession Curry was hugely off his feet over the ball,Italy have a tricky scrum to navigate deep in their own territory and they are pushed backwards like buttered sled loaded with soiled nappies. England ask for another scrum.England half time sub: Kyle Sinckler is on for Will StuartItaly would not have zero points if they had just a little bit more composure and precision. Much of the errors that led to lost possession were unforced, and while Coach Crowley can’t control the opposition he will be fuming that what his side can control is a mess. The try before half-time was a killer and again it was down to an daft error. If the home side can cut some of that out they could get some points on the board, but England are never far away from scoring at all times as their pace of attack and physicality are causing Italy to infringe all over the shop.Smith converts to end the half. Impressive defensive set from the home side.That’s eight penalties and formal warning from the ref. Smith sends it to the corner.But wait! TMO Brian McNiece has spotted that Isiekwe was in front of the maul from a detached position. Hence offside and so no try!The Harlequins man then dusts himself off and converts his own try. There’s a lot to be said for pure chaos pace on the wing, especially in a game like this, but Jones clearly loves Malins. In doing this it’s vital he bears in mind that it’s wrong to wish on space hardware.Braam Steyn is for Sebastian Negri in the back row, and Pietro Ceccarelli gets nod in the front row ahead of Tiziano Pasquali. Those waiting for Sergio Parrisse’s farewell nostalgia tour appearance must wait a little longer. Eddie Jones has rolled the dice, changing half the team, some through injury and some through choice. Maro Itoje moves to blind-side while the coach awaits Courtney Lawes’s return to fitness. Charlie Ewels takes the vacant lock berth and Alex Dombrandt is in at No. 8. In the front row, there are starts for Jamie George and Will Stuart. Jack Nowell returns to the wing as Joe Marchant moves to outside centre and creates the 10-12-13 with Smith and Slade that looked very promising in the Autumn. Feeding the ball to them will be Harry Randall who has taken the scrum-half shirt from Ben Youngs for this match at least. The track record in this match makes for some very grim reading for Italy. Focusing solely on games played in Rome since the Azzuri joined the tournament in 2000, England have outscored them 48 tries to 9. Yes, you read that correctly, Italy have only scored 9 (nine) tries against England at home in ten games over some twenty years. England remain the only side not to suffer a loss against Italy in the Six Nations and they usually win pretty handily. Even in Rome, England’s average winning margin is 25 points, and dragging that average down are some outlying closer matches during the nadir of Brian Ashton’s and Martin Johnson’s regimes. All that aside, Italy under new coach Kieran Crowley looked better last week in defeat vs France than they have for a while. There were points in the game where the forwards took it to the French powerhouses via the likes of Danilo Fischetti, Toa Halafihi, Federico Ruzza and captain, Michele Lamaro. They look like they could be building something to compare with the relative golden age around a decade ago. The problem is, even in that mini purple patch, England still tonked them.

Photograph: Laura HuttonThe Richard O’Halloran and his wife Tara at their home in Foxrock, Dublin. Photograph: Laura HuttonThe  Richard O’Halloran  at his home in Foxrock, Dublin. Photograph: Laura HuttonThe Even at the end of his ordeal, almost three years after he was first detained in China, Dublin businessman Richard O’Halloran remained nervous and paranoid on his flight home late last month.After years of “always looking over my shoulder” in China, he feared his return flight from Seoul to Paris could still be erted to a Chinese airport as he flew west over China.“In a moment of madness, I thought: ‘Do I ask the pilot to fly north?’” he told The .“Going back over Chinese airspace at the back of my mind was like, will they ground this plane? Had they a change of mind? They might still be going through paperwork and thinking: ‘We have one last chance to stop this guy. We know the flight he is on.’”He tracked the plane icon closely on his in-flight monitor until it left Chinese airspace. After previous failed attempts to leave, he realised finally he was on his way home. He was free.“Relieved” and “epic” is how he described his January 29th return almost three years after he became embroiled in a legal dispute between the Chinese chairman of the Dublin aircraft leasing company he works for and a Shanghai court over tens of millions of euros raised from Chinese investors that was used to buy an Airbus aircraft that is now leased out.Sitting in the kitchen of his Foxrock home, a reflective and emotional O’Halloran is still decompressing from the trauma of his detention and long-held fears sitting in Shanghai hotels, apartments and courts that he might not return to his wife Tara and their four children again.‘A whirlwind’His last, frantic week in China dealing with the judge overseeing the case, his arrival back in Dublin and meeting his family in an airport lounge after years apart were “a whirlwind.”“It was just like a compression of time into one moment,” he said of that emotional reunion with his family.The selfie photo by his ecstatic daughter Bella with a beaming Richard and his family in the background posted by Tara on Twitter “encapsulates three years in one shot,” he said.He is loving the simple things of family life: the school run, the hustle and bustle of the their busy home - “even emptying the dishwasher,” he said.“It is great to be around family, great to be around people and loved ones and not being alone. The isolation is the killer, no companionship,” he said.“Despair is probably the word,” said Tara of his time in China. “It was a horrendous three years, but we kind of feel like we have been given a second chance now that he is back.”The happy home life they are living now is a far cry from O’Halloran’s lowest moments in China. It began when he voluntarily travelled to China in 2019 to meet investors and try to resolve “the whole rigmarole” around a crowdfunding investment that predated his time in the company.When he went to leave China, he was blocked. It was the start of a painful court process for O’Halloran as the Chinese sought the return of the plane or about €30 million of investors’ money.By the second half of 2020, nothing was resolved. He was stuck in endless court hearings, yet never accused of any crime. He felt abandoned by the Irish Government, with the Department of Foreign Affairs telling him it was “a commercial matter and they couldn’t get involved.”Stress and anxietyHe stopped sleeping and eating and, alone in hotels, he started drinking heavily. The stress and anxiety grew and eventually led to pain, back spasms and seizures. He lost 20 kilos.At one point, he was rushed to hospital where he collapsed and woke up two days later.His family had been warned against speaking out publicly to the media for fear of antagonising the Chinese but with her husband’s health deteriorating, Tara could not sit back.“There was nothing being done. There was no urgency. I was crying down the phone to Simon Coveney saying ‘you have to help us, he is going to die’,” she said.Mr O’Halloran cannot pinpoint what led him to turn things around but throughout last year he made every effort to assist the Chinese court in the complicated enforcement process around reaching an agreement on the future of the plane and its planned return to the investors in 2026.“I just came to a realisation that I had Tara, the kids and if something happened to me, it was very serious,” he said.He realised he needed to build trust with the Chinese to pave the way for his release, fulfilling every request for documentation and going well beyond what was requested.Last month, after 50 or 60 visits to court over the years, the judge came to his apartment, asking Mr O’Halloran for a promise he would do “x, y and z” about the plane. They shook hands and the judge gave him the document lifting the exit ban.“Maybe it was a gesture,” he said of the judge’s unusual visit.‘Quiet diplomacy’Looking back, Richard and Tara believe that the importance of the State’s trade with China prevented the Government from being more forceful in its dealings with the Chinese over his case.“Quiet diplomacy is what kept him there three years, not what got him home,” she said.“There was never a statement of protest. There was never any senior person outright saying that we ‘condemn this’, that he is ‘being held against his will’.”Richard is thankful for Mr Coveney’s help on his case but believes the Minister was badly advised initially and that a suggestion that there was “no smoke without fire” around Mr O’Halloran that might deterred more intensive efforts by the department.He believes this that might have cost him a year. He claims that it took businessman Ulick McEvaddy - someone the Minister knew - joining the board of his company to encourage Mr Coveney to become more involved.“It shouldn’t have taken Ulick as a private sector inidual to sway the Minister to get involved,” he said.A source close to the Minister said that Mr Coveney was actively involved in Mr O’Halloran’s case long before Mr Evaddy joined the board.In response to queries on its handling of the case, a spokeswoman for Mr Coveney’s department said the Government was “actively engaged on and remained committed to the matter throughout.”“There was at all stages very extensive engagement on Mr O’Halloran’s case at the most senior political and diplomatic levels - stressing the urgent importance of Mr O’Halloran being allowed to return home as soon as possible,” she said.“This involved multiple channels - with engagement by the Taoiseach, Minister Simon Coveney and the most senior political levels in Dublin as well as by our most senior diplomats in Beijing, Shanghai and elsewhere throughout Ireland’s diplomatic network.”‘Bizarre’Mr O’Halloran said it was “bizarre” that Mr Coveney thanked the Chinese authorities in a public statement released by the department on the day he was allowed to leave China.“Did John O’Grady and his family thank Dessie O’Hare for releasing him minus the tops of his two little fingers?” he said, referring to the 1987 kidnapping and torture of the Dublin dentist.Tara said that the statement was “very upsetting” for his family and his mother.Describing himself as “an eternal optimist”, O’Halloran accepts he “cannot buy back time” lost with family, but he has come back “emotionally much stronger”, having given up alcohol and with a new-found and deep understanding of stress and anxiety, and what it can do to the body.“We are so proud of him that he has turned his life around and he has come away stronger,” said Tara, sitting next to her husband.Mr O’Halloran described the experience as “character-defining” and a “spiritual awakening” making him realise what he values most in life. He also recognises what his “phenomenal” wife Tara did over the past three years and the loyal support of family and friends.“It is very humbling. You understand what love is properly. You understand what companionship is,” he said.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"wholesale cost of red roses doubles due to brexit and rising energy costs","story":"‘The reality is that this year for anything red the value isn’t there,’   says Catherine Dollard. Photograph: Getty Roses are red, violets are blue and this year Valentine’s will be dearer for you.While the price of roses always spikes in the run-up to Valentine’s Day as every link in the supply chain from sub-Saharan Africa to Ireland via the flower powerhouses of Amsterdam stretch to breaking point, this year the increases are even more dramatic. Brexit, supply chain issues as well as spiralling energy costs all over the world has meant that the wholesale cost of red roses is now more double what it normally is at this time of year, according to Laois florist Catherine Dollard. The owner of Cat’s Gifts and Flowers said as well as a huge increase in prices, she also had to contend with Brexit which has meant products which would normally form part of Valentine’s Day bundles, such as cards and balloons, had to be either replaced or dispensed with. “I used to source a lot of stuff from the UK and because of Brexit all that has become a lot more expensive but the real issue is that flower prices are sky rocketing because of higher energy prices and reduced supply,” she said.“I have been trying to steer people away from red roses because they are two-and-a-half times dearer than they have been in the past,” she told The . “The reality is that this year for anything red the value isn’t there. Our wild flowers are so much nicer and we have loads of them,” she continued. However, she said when she pointed people to better value she has got “a better reaction from women but that men are harder to convince.” Ms Dollard said she had decided to absorb the cost rather than pass it on to her customers. “I didn’t want to pass on the costs to my customers who have been so loyal to me and Valentine’s is only one day in the year so I am going to take the hit and after that my profit margins will be back to normal.” The cost of a dozen red roses in the run-up to St Valentine’s Day 2022 can range from less than €30 in some supermarkets to close to €100 in dedicated florists. However, while a rose by any other name may smell as sweet, some of the roses selling at the lower end of the price scale have almost no fragrance at all while the shelf - or vase - life of some bouquets can be little more than a few days with others likely to last in excess of a week. “I’m not sure how the supermarkets can sell some of the roses at the prices they are selling them for,” Ms Dollard said.Ruth Monahan from Appassionata Flowers In Cornelscourt in Dublin said her business was also having to absorb dramatically higher costs for roses and had struggled to get some of the elements of a Valentine’s Day present. “The same volume has not been released by the Dutch as normal and all the prices have gone up this year,” she said. “We couldn’t pass the increases on to our customers because that would not have been fair. The dozen red roses is always popular, particularly amongst men – and almost all our customers over Valentine’s Day are men.”She said that as a result of Brexit as well as supply issues in Amsterdam, the business has had to be “much more organised with orders and placing them much earlier in the day.”She noted that “certain things have got stuck in transit. All our red envelopes for instance were held up in Customs so we have to sort out a different supplier. We thought the original supplier was Irish but they just had an .ie website and were actually based in the UK.”Appassionato is donating 3 per cent of its turnover over the course of the weekend leading up to Valentine’s Day to Aware. “It can be a really isolating time for people,” she noted. Ms Monahan said the business had been flat out since Friday but predicted that by 4pm on Valentine’s Day things would ease off. “That is when we will see the really scared faces saying ‘just give me anything’.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"state","story":"State papers: Perception on the Shankill Road in 1990s was \u0026lsquofear of encroachment\u0026rsquo-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"ghanaians urged to choose chocolate over valentine s day vices","story":"Mabel Sallah, a sales manager for Cobean’z. Photograph: Sally HaydenGhana is celebrating its 18th National Chocolate Day, and its second National Chocolate Week, with the now annual push from cocoa companies for Ghanaians to eat more chocolate.The annual event began in 2005 when then tourism minister Jake Obetsebi-Lamptey announced that St Valentine’s Day would be replaced by a celebration of chocolate, in a bid to encourage citizens of the world’s second largest cocoa producer to consume more of the crop themselves.In 2020 current tourism minister Barbara Oteng Gyasi also said the redesignation of February 14th as National Chocolate Day had helped to “minimise social vices associated with the celebration of Valentine’s Day”.For the past week a temporarily set up “Chocolate City”, beside Accra Mall in the west African nation’s capital, has been operating. An array of companies set up stalls as locals were enticed in by cook-offs, a poetry competition, a “ladies night” and a scheduled rave.The slogan of the week, on banners across the venue, are “eat chocolate, stay healthy, grow Ghana”. Over a loudspeaker the announcer extolled what he said were the health benefits of eating more cocoa, including a reduced risk of stroke. A leaflet for Prime Cocoa Products Ltd promoted cocoa as good for skin, the brain and fertility.“It has been busy,” said Adjontey Ficial Love, the company’s marketing manager. “It is important for us to celebrate this because we produce cocoa and we are meant to consume it, so we are sensitising the public on why they should eat it more,” she said, adding that people living abroad should also come to Ghana to “have a feel” of the “quality” cocoa there.So sweet“Everybody’s loving chocolate week,” said Kobby Owusu, who was worked the event three years in a row as part of the media department for the Chocolate Mall Company, which was selling chocolate-covered peanuts and strawberry-flavoured chocolate spread, among other products. “Everybody should eat cocoa every day in drinks, in spreads. Valentine’s Day is important because it brings families and loved ones together to eat cocoa. Just imagine you have chocolate in your mouth to give to your partner, it tastes so sweet.”“Other people think Valentine’s Day is about sex, sex, sex, but it is a day for love and chocolate,” said Mabel Sallah, a sales manager for Cobean’z, which makes spices with a cocoa base, and Dr Jany, which produces chocolate facial scrub cinnamon, cocoa and shea butter lip balm and a cocoa-based herbal foot treatment. “In Ghana we use cocoa as a symbol of love. It’s important because it helps our economy,” she said.Speaking at the launch of National Chocolate Week, minister of information Kojo Oppong-Nkrumah told journalists that Ghana had a target of 1kg per capita cocoa consumption, but was currently at just over 0.55kg per person.In 2017, Euromonitor International found that the average Irish person ate 7.7kg of chocolate in a year.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Decades of progress overshadowed by Putin crackdowns and confrontation with WestRussia\u0026rsquos land of the midnight sun said to have inspired creator of Chanel No. 5Atomic icebreakers and floating power plants to help Kremlin develop Arctic shipping routeMinority nations feel squeeze as Putin\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquopower vertical\u0026rsquo crushes republics\u0026rsquo autonomyHistory of bloodshed and tragedy haunts stunning region shared by Muslims and ChristiansOil wealth and new mosque and churches help keep Tatarstan on Kremlin\u0027s sideOfficials claim West wants to \u0026lsquoGermanise\u0026rsquo and instil special identity in strategic regionNato monitors heavily armed Kaliningrad as locals long for borders to reopenAttack on renowned Memorial rights group deepens opposition anger and international alarmSaint Petersburg Letter: Russia\u0026rsquos old imperial capital celebrates 200 years since birth of Crime and Punishment creatorEnergy giant hopes vast forests will offset carbon costs and ease green transitionCircassian heritage trampled and property rows continue as Winter Olympics city boomsKremlin criticised as most Russians reject vaccination and hospitals face huge strainKremlin changes tack on global warming and looks to vast forests to offset emissionsRussia and Japan co-operate on Sakhalin despite row over nearby Kuril islandsIndustry and struggling communities fear wildlife support could stifle Far East developmentCity with echoes of San Francisco is thrillingly original, yet tarnished by graft and neglectGrowing energy, security and diplomatic links between Moscow and Beijing worry WestDecembrist rebels and their aristocratic wives embraced \u0026lsquoreal Russia\u0026rsquo in Siberian exileFears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo roleInside Russia: More protests planned as officials reject calls to address e-voting complaintsMoscow Letter: Poet\u0026rsquos statue has been a magnet for generations of Russian dissentersOn the eve of an expected sham election, many of Putin\u0026rsquos political opponents are already jailed or dead"},{"url":null,"title":"maureen dowd washington dc and james joyce both incomprehensible","story":"James Joyce’s Ulysses: Hard because it’s great, or do people assume it’s great because it’s hard? Photograph: Barry CroninAFP via Getty Images I was in an Uber on Broadway in New York City when suddenly the world began violently shaking. A van had rammed the Uber. I was stunned, but I was also determined not to miss this semester’s first day of in-person classes at Columbia University, where I’m studying for a master’s in English literature. I gave the driver my information and ran to class. When I got there, I tried to breathe slowly and assess the damage. Was my brain functioning okay? The words in the book before me were swimming past incomprehensibly. “Ineluctable modality of the visible.” “Limits of the diaphane in. Why in? Diaphane, adiaphane.” “Morose delectation Aquinas tunbelly calls this, frate porcospino. Unfallen Adam rode and not rutted. Call away let him: thy quarrons dainty is. Language no whit worse than his. Monkwords, marybeads jabber on their girdles: roguewords, tough nuggets patter in their pockets.”Did I have a concussion, or was it just that I was reading Ulysses? On this centenary of James Joyce’s colossus, we can borrow a thought from WB Yeats’s poem The Fascination of What’s Difficult: Is Ulysses hard because it’s great, or do people assume it’s great because it’s hard? “It’s hard because Joyce put a lot in there,” Dan Mulhall, the Irish ambassador to the United States, told me. “A lot of people are drawn to the novel because of its complexity and derive a lifelong satisfaction from delving into it more deeply. It’s like Wordle for serious readers.”Mulhall has taken Ulysses as his travelling companion around the world, using it for creative diplomacy. He has blogged all 18 episodes on the embassy website, and he marked the 100th birthday with a new book called Ulysses: A Reader’s Odyssey.The epic is often compared to Seinfeld, because not all that much happens. It certainly doesn’t have the action of The Odyssey, upon which it is patterned. But it does boast, as Merve Emre wrote in the New Yorker, “a cultural literacy presented as godlike in its extent”.Colm Tóibín, the renowned Irish writer who teaches my class, wrote in rhe Financial Times about the book: “For the ordinary reader, it has the same cachet as running a marathon does for the ordinary athlete,” he said. “It is a challenge and then, for those who have read the book, a matter of pride.”“Ulysses,’” he added, “in all its generosity of style, its plenitude, the open sensuality of its characters, its lack of piety and respect for authority, its placing of a freethinking cosmopolitan Jewish man at its centre, can be read as a contribution to the Irish argument, the tone of the book as a blueprint for what Irish life might be like after independence.”Era of gobbledygookSmall moments, Tóibín said, “glitter and shimmer” because of Joyce’s wild flights of language. I bought a copy in Dublin long ago. But I had never mustered the will to read the story of love, desire and disconnectedness played out on Dublin strolls on a single day, June 16th, 1904 – the entwined stream-of-consciousness sagas of Stephen Dedalus and Molly and Leopold Bloom – until now.You’d think I would be accustomed to deciphering the incomprehensible after the past five years in DC. Donald Trump’s upside-down utterances. Kevin McCarthy’s demented backtracking. Marjorie Taylor Greene’s inanity, accusing Nancy Pelosi of siccing her “gazpacho police” on lawmakers. This era of gobbledygook has also featured the Republican National Committee issuing a resolution that the barbaric attack on the Capitol was “legitimate political discourse”. This was so outrageous that Mitt Romney had to brush back the chair of the RNC, his niece Ronna Romney McDaniel. Aside from Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger, most everything the Republicans do is cowardly they are so afraid of the Trumpsters supporting the vandals that they tried to legitimise illegitimate discourse by calling it legitimate discourse. Shameful.And there’s the government’s indecipherable instructions on Covid-19 – crystallised in the ill-advised picture of Stacey Abrams trying to have it both ways, sitting and smiling, without a mask, in front of masked schoolchildren. The only thing that can save President Joe Biden and the Democrats now is Republicans showing how fringy and far out they’ve got. You know when Mitch McConnell is the guy calling out his own party that many top Republicans are freaking out. McConnell needs to get candidates to win in states that Biden won, like New Hampshire and Pennsylvania. That will be hard, given that we’re watching a party go nuts in real time. Their quarrons dainty are not. The latest Trump embarrassment came when Axios reported that the New York Times’s Maggie Haberman writes in her new book, Confidence Man, that White House residence staff members believed that Trump had wadded up papers found in a toilet. So the former president has a bathroom fixation. (HG Wells said Joyce, who could be graphic about bodily functions, had “a cloacal obsession”.)Nixon had the plumbers. Trump’s the one who needed them. Stephen Dedalus, Joyce’s self-portrait, captures our incomprehensible politics in a remark that burns brighter than ever: “History is a nightmare from which I am trying to awake.” This article originally appeared in The New York TimesStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"new orleans prepares for return of mardi gras after hurricane and covid","story":"Masked characters and elaborate floats are a big part  of Mardi GrasThere was plenty of water on Bourbon Street last week as a major storm that hit the southern United States led to widespread rain and unusually cold temperatures. However it didn’t stop the spirit of New Orleans, which is gearing up for the high points of its traditional Mardi Gras carnival after a year which has seen it hit by both Covid and a hurricane.Mardi Gras itself, which takes place on Shrove Tuesday – the day before the start of Lent – is not until the beginning of March. However, the carnival season begins on January 6th, so it runs for longer this year as Easter is late.Already work crews are erecting seating platforms across the city for the hundreds of thousands of people, locals and tourists alike who will flock to New Orleans in the coming weeks.The Mardi Gras festivities still face some problems. A shortage of volunteer police officers has affected the plans and is likely to lead to some parades being altered or shortened. Mardi Gras in February 2020 was considered in some quarters to have acted as a Covid-19 “super-spreader event”in the region, and city authorities in New Orleans remain conscious of the dangers. Vaccination certificates are policed strictly at the entrances to most restaurants and bars as a condition of entry. Mardi Gras last year was cancelled due to Covid. And as one local said while waiting for the start of a parade last weekend, “the spirit of the city is just waiting to explode”. Gulf coastThe Mardi Gras festivities have been going on in New Orleans since the 1850s. The original organisers came from Alabama, where similar events could be dated back to about 1700, when, it is claimed, a French Canadian explorer threw a party after landing on the gulf coast.Initially in New Orleans the social organisations or clubs – known as “krewes”– which hosted the parades tended to be the preserves of the elites in the city.Later on the excluded groups – whether they be Irish, Italian, German, African American or women – started their own similar organisations.Elaborate masks – as well as costumes – have been associated with Mardi Gras since long before they became obligatory with the arrival of Covid. In New Orleans a significant portion of the year would seem to be spent by organisers planning the host of parties and parades to run from just after Christmas to Lent, as well as working on an extraordinary array of floats and outfits.One member of the krewe of Endymion, who spoke to The , said its parade would involve about 3,000 people. And it won’t be without celebrity endorsement.The post-parade “Endymion Extravaganza” in the Caesars Superdome in the city will feature American pop icon Diana Ross and the band Maroon 5.Last weekend it was the turn of the 900-member Intergalactic Krewe of Chewbacchus to take to the streets with their distinctively science fiction and particularly Star Wars-related parade.It was what is known as a walking parade featuring about 100 contraptions and devices which were variously pushed, pulled or pedalled rather than involving motorised floats. Some were elaborate and sophisticated. Others less so. Overall there was a light hearted, tongue-in-cheek element to the proceedings.There were legions of imperial star-troopers and assorted impromptu light sabre duels on the streets.And every hair stylist in Louisiana must have been booked out all day as dozens of lookalike Princess Leias with the trademark double-side buns – a la Carrie Fisher from the original 1977 Star Wars movie – paraded through the French district. Hurricane KatrinaThose who have not been back to New Orleans in several years – particularly since Hurricane Katrina 16 years ago which saw 80 per cent of the city flooded – will notice many changes.There are more tall buildings and, it may be the onset of age, but Bourbon Street sounds and seems louder than before. However, the traditional live jazz clubs can still be found on Frenchman’s Street.Mardi Gras in New Orleans remains one of the great interactive experiences. The parades are not just viewed as a spectacle. Many in the crowds dress in the traditional green, purple and gold costumes, wear face masks and hats and compete for the beads thrown from passing floats.Covid may have changed the world. And New Orleans is still recovering from a hurricane that hit only last August, 16 years to the day after Katrina. Workmen could still be seen fixing some house roofs last weekend. But the focus of the city is on partying.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"young africans","story":"About 2.4 million forced to leave their homes during 13-year-long war with Boko HaramTom Saater has a rags to riches story and a unique insight into Nigeria\u0026rsquos biggest cityIn one of the world\u0026rsquos most dangerous places to attend school, teachers lead lessons and the students comeAfrican country\u0026rsquos tech innovators call for international investment and domestic supportYoung Nigerians dance out onto world stage with pride, confidence and high ambitionWomen-led organisation aims to stop atrocities of dictatorship from reoccurringIn the Gambia, a flourishing comedy scene is used to convey serious messagesStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"older travelers face paying insurance flights wake premium spike","story":"Expensive holiday insurance can now cost older people more than their flights, as the cost of premiums has risen by 50 per cent in a year, research has found.The consumer group Which? said that by shopping around customers could save hundreds of pounds and get more comprehensive cover. Its research also found that the best insurance policy was not always the most expensive.Which? Analysed data from two leading comparison sites, Compare the Market and Confused. It found that the average price of an annual travel insurance policy increased by around 50 per cent between August 2019 and August 2020 for both European and global cover, adding hundreds of pounds to some premiums.In one case, researchers were quoted £451 for a policy covering an older traveller with pre-existing health conditions on a single two-week trip to the US. This is more than the cost of some transatlantic flights.Which? found examples of wildly fluctuating prices with quotes for the same customer ranging by 300 per cent.The consumer group collected quotes from eight major insurers for 11 hypothetical customers, ranging from a young and healthy traveller buying a single-trip policy to an older traveller with health issues buying an annual global insurance policy that includes additional cruise cover. In one case the difference between the cheapest and most expensive quote was £249.Virgin Money quoted £58 to cover a 40-year-old with asthma going to Greece for two weeks, for example, whereas Staysure quoted £126.“Simply put, use the same insurer again and again, as opposed to shopping around each time you take out cover, and sooner or later you risk paying massively over the odds,” Which? said.It found that expensive policies were not necessarily the most comprehensive. In six of the 11 times scenarios it monitored, the most expensive quote was among the least comprehensive, leaving customers paying significantly more for significantly less protection.It said that a 60-year-old with high blood pressure and cholesterol taking out an annual global policy, including cruise cover, was quoted £169 for AA’s Silver policy but £355 for Direct Travel’s Standard cover.Rory Boland, editor of Which? Travel, said: “Our research found the most expensive travel insurance is not always the best, and travellers may be quoted significantly more for a lower level of cover. The wild price differences between insurers mean consumers face paying massively over the odds.“Comprehensive insurance is still available at reasonable prices if you know where to look.

The scale of things that we\u0027re finding is reflective of that complicated story.The discovery of the First World War training round tallies with the Tower of London being a focal point of combat from 1914 to 1918.Soldiers were garrisoned there awaiting deployment at the start of the war and trained to use guns, while weapons were kept in storehouses within the tower.The tower was also used to contain people who posed a serious threat to national security, with 11 spies executed there.The French jetton, inscribed with the fleur-de-lis, is thought to have been made in Paris.While it is not uncommon to find English jettons, French ones are particularly rare. The find demonstrates how the Tower of London was a focal point of international travel.During the Tudor age, the tower was the most important state prison in the country and gained a reputation for being inescapable. The buckle found by excavators may have belonged to one of the guards.In 1977, at the Silver Jubilee, the moat was used for a garden display. In 2014, to mark the centenary of the start of the First World War, it was filled with 800,000 ceramic poppies in a moving commemoration.Visitors will be welcomed to the moat between June and September this year to see the Superbloom. Historic Royal Palaces plans to host smaller floral Jubilee displays across its other sites, including at Hampton Court Palace, Kensington Palace and Hillsborough Castle.Tom O’Leary, public engagement director at Historic Royal Palaces, said: We hope that this thriving new landscape, surrounding London’s formidable fortress, will celebrate the power of nature to unite us all.More from NewsKind-hearted Kate\u0026#39s bedtime tale: A 21st century princess doesn’t need a crown to command attentionRussia-Ukraine crisis: Poland braces for massive influx of refugees, amid fears Britons could have escape route cut offValérie Pécresse tells major rally ‘nothing will stop me’ as support drains in race against MacronOnly one in 1,000 scam and fraud victims receive justiceCarrie Johnson: ‘Regurgitated lies’ in Lord Ashcroft book are ‘spiteful and damaging’More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"should replace cressida dick wrong question","story":"There will be few people shedding any tears at the resignation of Dame Cressida Dick as Commissioner of the politan Police. She has overseen a litany of failures broad enough to alienate the entire political spectrum, and her departure offers a long-overdue opportunity for an overhaul of this country’s largest police force.But the manner of her departure is not without its problems, and they can be summed up with this question: why does the Mayor of London have the power to sack the head of the UK’s counter-terrorism command?No wonder that the news has sparked a bitter row between Sadiq Khan and Priti Patel, with the Home Office claiming that the first they heard of Dick’s departure is when she called to tell them she was going.Not the level of strategic coordination we might hope for from the department in charge of law and order – especially because the Commissioner is actually appointed by the Home Secretary, not the Mayor.Yet it is now established that the Commissioner can’t continue to serve if they lose the confidence of City Hall. Boris Johnson will know this better than most as Mayor of London he engineered the resignation of Sir Ian Blair (the  described this as a “Tory coup”).At first glance, this might be easy to dismiss as merely a turf war between politicians. But the result is blurred lines of accountability. Formally, Londoners have no way of subjecting the leadership of their local police to democratic oversight. Practically, the Mayor can sack someone with UK-wide responsibilities, appointed by a government with a national mandate.What this means is that the question in all the newspapers this week, ‘Who should replace Cressida Dick?’, is the wrong question. We need to do better than just finding someone to do a better job in a fundamentally flawed position. Rather, the Government should seize this opportunity to undertake a root-and-branch reform of the politan Police, with a view to ending the current hybrid arrangements altogether.In its place we should have a normal constabulary for London, on the same basis as those elsewhere in England and Wales, with clear and formal accountability to the Mayor or the London Assembly, alongside one or more national organisations which answer to the Home Office.Obvious candidates for the latter include counter-terrorism, close protection, and aviation policing. But Patel should also look at whether or not the Territorial Support Group, this country’s primary public order unit, would work better as the nucleus of a new stand-alone operation.After all, one of the explanations often given for why the police are slow to get up to speed policing riots effectively is an alleged tension between community policing, which rests in large part on building positive relationships with the policed, and the more confrontational public order role. Formal ision of those responsibilities is the norm in many other countries, including our near-neighbours in Europe, and is worth exploring as part of a broader consultation on far-reaching reform.This brings us back to our question above. If the politan Police is reformed as a purely local police force, then the next commissioner can be selected from a pool of candidates geared towards those responsibilities.They will then be able to focus 100 per cent of their attention on delivering better policing for Londoners, and will have to answer to their elected representatives should they fail to do so. Meanwhile the Government can go about finding people best-suited to discharge the nationalfunctions separately.Given how very different the roles are, it would be no surprise if they ended up being filled by quite different candidates – indeed, it would be more surprising if they were not!But under our current system, the best-case scenario is that one of those people gets the job, and spends part of their time doing each bit as well as they can. Just as likely, someone who isn’t best-suited to either gets the job in an attempt to split the difference.Of course, the Met can’t simply go leaderless whilst this process is carried out. But Patel should make it clear that the upcoming appointment is a provisional one. If not, a vital shot at urgently needed reform will have been wasted.More from NewsKind-hearted Kate\u0026#39s bedtime tale: A 21st century princess doesn’t need a crown to command attentionRussia-Ukraine crisis: Poland braces for massive influx of refugees, amid fears Britons could have escape route cut offValérie Pécresse tells major rally ‘nothing will stop me’ as support drains in race against MacronOnly one in 1,000 scam and fraud victims receive justiceCarrie Johnson: ‘Regurgitated lies’ in Lord Ashcroft book are ‘spiteful and damaging’More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"sweden right covid along","story":"To understand Sweden, you need to understand a word that’s hard to explain, let alone translate: lagom. It means, in effect, “perfect-simple”: not too much, not too little. People who are lagom don’t stand out or make a fuss: they blend right in – and this is seen as a virtue. Essays are written about why lagom sums up a certain Swedish mindset – that it’s bad to stand out, to consider yourself better or be an outlier. That’s why it’s so strange that, during the lockdowns, Sweden became the world’s defiant outlier.Swedes saw it the other way around. They were keeping calm and carrying on: lockdown was an extreme, draconian, untested experiment. Lock up everyone, keep children out of school, suspend civil liberties, send police after people walking their dogs – and call this “caution”? Anders Tegnell, Sweden’s state epidemiologist, never spoke about a Swedish “experiment”. He said all along he could not recommend a public health intervention that had never been proven.Tegnell also made another point: that he didn’t claim to be right. It would take years, he’d argue, to see who had jumped the right way. His calculation was that, on a whole-society basis, the collateral damage of lockdowns would outweigh what good they do. But you’d only know if this was so after a few years. You’d have to look at cancer diagnosis, hospital waiting lists, educational damage and, yes, count the Covid dead. Almost two years on, we can look at the early indications.The problem with lockdowns is that no one looks at whole-society pictures. Professor Neil Ferguson’s team from Imperial College London admitted this, once, as a breezy aside. “We do not consider the wider social and economic costs of suppression,” they wrote in a supposed assessment of lockdown, “which will be high.” But just how high? And were they a price worth paying?As Sweden abolishes all domestic Covid restrictions, it emerges with one of Europe’s lower Covid death tolls: the rate is 1,614 per million people, just over half the amount of Britain (2,335). Given that our death tolls were comparable at first (both among the worst anywhere), it’s hard to argue that there’s some demographic force which meant Covid was never going to spread in Sweden. Nor is it possible to argue that Sweden was some hedonistic party-nation: its people were incredibly cautious. But unlike Brits, they had a government that trusted them.There were some Swedish diktats: a “rule of eight” was set up for a while. Bars, restaurants and cafes were all socially distanced and, at one point, had to close by 8.30pm. For a few weeks, Swedes even had vaccine passports. But that was about it: the rest was guidance, and it was followed.What no statistic can convey is just how careful Swedes were something that struck me whenever I’d visit. It was perfectly legal to meet up in bars and for a fika in a coffee shop, but most didn’t. A friend of mine had a rule that she’d only ever meet friends outside – even in the Stockholm winter (she did this so much that she got frostbite). In summer last year, studies showed Swedes working from home more than in any other European country.This kept Covid low, while the lack of rules allowed for people to use their judgement while minimising economic and social damage. Sweden’s GDP fell by 2.9 per cent in 2020, while Britain’s collapsed by 9.4 per cent. Both have bounded back, but Sweden’s economy is this year expected to be five per cent larger than before the pandemic, versus two per cent for Germany. The UK will be about one per cent, one of the lowest figures in Europe. The cost of the various Covid measures is best summed up by the debt mountain: an extra £8,400 per head in Britain, and £3,000 in Sweden.Swedish schools kept going throughout, with no face masks. Sixth-formers and undergraduates switched to home learning, but the rest of Swedish children went to school as normal. That’s not to say there weren’t absences as the virus spread: it was common to see a third, at times even half of the class absent due to sniffles or suspected Covid. But there were no full-scale closures and, aside from some suspicions about minor grade inflation (the average maths grade sneaked up to 10.1, from 9.3), there is no talk in Sweden about educational devastation.In Britain, there is calamity and cover-up. By doling out more A grades than ever before – and telling universities to make more space – young people could be shovelled through the system with lost ground never recognised or quite made up.Grade inflation was staggering: the number of A-level students marked at A or A* jumped to 45 per cent, up from 26 per cent pre-pandemic, but no one doubts that these students learned far less. By some measures, educational inequality has been set back 10 years. But some problems are too big to admit.Academics suggest the effect of lost education is permanent: less education inevitably means lower salaries and slower career progression. The Institute for Fiscal Studies talks about £40,000 of lost lifetime earnings per pupil in Britain, £350 billion in all. Swedish studies estimate that Covid’s impact (on absenteeism and home-learning) could mean an £800 million overall hit – far smaller than the impact on Britain’s lost school days.The impact on hospital waiting lists is also very different. Fear of a virus keeps people away – at the peak of the first wave, attendance at Swedish A\u0026ampE was 31 per cent lower than normal in Britain, it collapsed by 57 per cent. Routine operations were down by 20 per cent in Sweden and 34 per cent in England, so waiting lists grew in both countries. As they did pretty much world over.But no country, anywhere, has had a waiting list grow as big as Britain’s: from 4.4 million pre-pandemic, it will keep getting worse for two years and peak at about 9.2 million, according to NHS modelling – that’s equivalent to one in five adults. A top-down health service is more easily disrupted if it’s ordered to transform into a Covid service (and people are told to “protect the NHS” by not using it). Sweden’s waiting lists, 130,000 pre-pandemic, hit 170,000 last October. Even adjusting for population, it’s nowhere near the size of Britain’s problem.Sweden will not declare victory. No one was properly prepared for Covid, and The country’s failure to protect care home residents is still seen as a national scandal. Sweden also took a bigger hit than its neighbours: Denmark, which did lock down, has more to shout about when it comes to combining a lower Covid hit with minimal economic disruption. But, as Tegnell would say, it’s still too early to say – with any finality – who got it right and who didn’t.More from NewsKind-hearted Kate\u0026#39s bedtime tale: A 21st century princess doesn’t need a crown to command attentionRussia-Ukraine crisis: Poland braces for massive influx of refugees, amid fears Britons could have escape route cut offValérie Pécresse tells major rally ‘nothing will stop me’ as support drains in race against MacronOnly one in 1,000 scam and fraud victims receive justiceCarrie Johnson: ‘Regurgitated lies’ in Lord Ashcroft book are ‘spiteful and damaging’More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"vet performed needless hip replacements dogs source financial","story":"A pioneering vet has been struck off after performing unnecessary hip replacements on dogs.Dr Marthinus Ryk Botes, an animal orthopaedics specialist at Meet in Kent, carried out total hip replacements on three canines in 2016 and 2017 and recommended the procedure for a fourth when it was not in their best interests. He did so without consulting their owners about alternative treatments.A disciplinary panel held last month said the operations were a source of financial gain and decided that Dr Botes\u0027 behaviour amounted to serious misconduct.He was found culpable of seven charges at a Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons tribunal and has now been banned from practising as a vet.He also failed to keep adequate clinical records in respect of all the dogs he treated.In its decision, the panel said: The committee took into account that the total hip replacements in question were a source of financial gain, that Dr Botes’ conduct was repeated over a considerable period of time and that he was in an increased position of trust and responsibility because of perceived expertise in small animal orthopaedics and its education.It said that suspension was not a severe enough sanction, as there was a real risk of repetition of Dr Botes\u0027 behaviour. The panel also said his failings were wide-ranging and covered the basic and fundamental requirements of any veterinary surgeon.The dogs which were given total hip replacements were Daisy, a Cocker Spaniel Kilo, a Staffordshire Bull Terrier and Sora, a West Highland Terrier Japanese Akita cross.Dr Botes recommended that Penny, a Bichon Frise cross, also have the operation.Dr Botes is known for his pioneering surgeries on small animals.In 2019, he was praised for his work to fix the crooked jaw of a Shih Tzu called Poppet.The dog had struggled to eat or clean itself because its tongue permanently hung out of its mouth. Dr Botes used a 3D printer to construct a new jaw made of titanium.However, he was suspended from practice for six months in 2008 due to his care of a dog involved in a traffic accident, which was found to amount to serious professional misconduct.More from NewsKind-hearted Kate\u0026#39s bedtime tale: A 21st century princess doesn’t need a crown to command attentionRussia-Ukraine crisis: Poland braces for massive influx of refugees, amid fears Britons could have escape route cut offValérie Pécresse tells major rally ‘nothing will stop me’ as support drains in race against MacronOnly one in 1,000 scam and fraud victims receive justiceCarrie Johnson: ‘Regurgitated lies’ in Lord Ashcroft book are ‘spiteful and damaging’More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"vladimir putin taking big gamble","story":"The arrival in Moscow of a team of top British defence envoys bearing an assortment of gifts for their Russian counterparts will not have gone unnoticed by Vladimir Putin, the country’s autocratic leader. Ever since Putin began stoking tensions over the fate of Ukraine last year, one of Mr Putin’s key objectives has been to make himself the centre of global attention.Irrespective of his ultimate designs towards Russia’s southern neighbour, one of the Russian leader’s less appealing characteristics is his deep-seated inferiority complex. With an excess of 130,000 battle ready Russian troops camped on the Ukrainian border, Mr Putin has certainly made himself a hard man to ignore.So the Russian despot will have been flattered to see both Defence Secretary Ben Wallace and Admiral Sir Tony Radakin, the newly-appointed Chief of the Defence Staff, arriving in Moscow laden with gifts that harked back to an altogether happier era in Anglo-Russian relations.Sir Tony presented General Valery Gerasimov, the man responsible for assembling Russia’s massive invasion force on the Ukrainian border, with a piece of iron from the mast of HMS Belfast, a veteran of the Artic convoys that helped to sustain the Russian people when London and Moscow were allies during the Second World War. For his part, Mr Wallace, a former officer in the Scots Guards, presented his opposite number, General Sergey Shoygu, with a regimental sword and a bottle of Scottish whisky. The gestures of friendship offered by Mr Wallace and Sir Tony arguably made far more of an impression on the Russians than Foreign Secretary Liz Truss’s fleeting appearance earlier in the week, when she seemed far more interested in performing a pale imitation of Margaret Thatcher visiting Moscow at the height of the Cold War than engaging in the serious business of crisis management.Even so, Britain’s efforts to cool tensions between Russia and the West will depend, as US President Joe Biden will have discovered during his telephone summit with Putin yesterday, to a large extent on just how serious the Russian leader is about provoking arguably the greatest global stand-off since the Cuban missile crisis by launching military action against Ukraine.The ambiguity surrounding Putin’s ultimate intentions concerning Ukraine certainly suits the Russian leader’s overall objectives which, so far as the West is concerned, is to generate an air of menacing uncertainty.As one veteran Foreign Office Putin-watcher explains, the Kremlin’s deft manipulation of the Ukraine crisis comes straight out of the Putin playbook, where the key objective is to keep his adversaries guessing about his goals.“The key to understanding how he conducts himself in a crisis is to remember his background as an intelligence officer,” says the diplomat. “His approach to any situation, whether it is threatening Ukraine or dealing with political opponents, is to keep his cards close to his chest so that it is difficult to anticipate his next move. This approach not only puts his opponents on the defensive, but it also raises the possibility that it will lead them to make mistakes that he can later exploit.”If Putin, then, is engaged in an elaborate game of chess with the West over the future of Ukraine, it is clearly one from which he is deriving enormous enjoyment, to judge by his dealings with numerous world leaders in recent days.Given the recent tensions between Moscow and London on issues such as the 2006 murder of Russian dissident Alexander Litvinenko and, more recently, the Salisbury poisonings in 2018, it was almost inevitable that Truss, making the first visit to Moscow by a British foreign secretary in four years, would receive a lukewarm reception.The United Kingdom has been at the forefront of Western attempts to call out the disruptive activities of Russia’s global spy network, and the mass expulsion of so-called Russian diplomats that was orchestrated by Britain’s Secret Intelligence Service in the wake of the Salisbury attacks inflicted a deep and abiding wound on the operational effectiveness of the Kremlin’s espionage activities.In addition, Britain has been at the forefront of calls to tighten up on the activities of Putin’s money men, the fabulously wealthy network of oligarchs who help to sustain the Russian regime – even if some of the measures proposed, such as tightening the oligarchs’ access to the City, admittedly lack rigour.Boris Johnson’s government has also adopted an uncompromising tone when it comes to upholding Ukraine’s territorial integrity – much to the surprise of the legions of critics who assumed Britain’s voice on the global stage would be much diminished post-Brexit.Against this backdrop, therefore, it was almost inevitable that Truss would encounter a hostile reception, with Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov, one of the Kremlin’s most accomplished bully boys, taking the lead in seeking to humiliate the British envoy.Lavrov has previous when it comes to insulting British foreign secretaries. In 2008, he famously subjected then-foreign secretary David Miliband to a foul-mouthed rant after the two men clashed over Moscow’s military intervention in Georgia, with Lavrov at one point barking: “Who the f--- are you to lecture me?”While Truss was treated with considerably more decorum, Lavrov, assisted by the Kremlin’s propaganda machine, nevertheless did his best to belittle her efforts. After dismissing the Foreign Secretary’s efforts to seek a diplomatic solution to the Ukraine crisis as being like a conversation of “the mute with the deaf”, Russia’s flagship television news show, 60 Minutes, chided her for her attire, which channelled Margaret Thatcher’s fur-lined outfits during her 1987 Kremlin visit.If Truss was considered fair game by the Kremlin because of Britain’s robust attitude on the Ukraine crisis, the delight that Putin appears to be deriving from his constant embarrassment of Western dignitaries was equally reflected in his treatment earlier this week of French President Emmanuel Macron.Even though Macron had arrived in Moscow bearing peace proposals that were very much to Moscow’s advantage, he was still obliged to sit at the opposite end of a massive table, a move designed to highlight the French leader’s ambivalence about Russian Covid restrictions.On arrival in Moscow, Macron was asked to take a Covid test, but declined, over fears that this would enable the Russians to obtain his DNA – a not unreasonable concern, given the recent activities of Russia’s intelligence agencies.When Macron refused, Putin responded by arranging for their summit to take place with both men sitting at opposite ends of a 13ft table, to protect Mr Putin from potentially catching the virus.It is hard not to form the opinion that Putin is enjoying himself immensely as he subjects his Western adversaries to various forms of public humiliation.In what might be termed “Putin’s Revenge”, the Russian leader, who yearns to recreate the glory days of the Soviet Union when Moscow held the world in thrall, appears to be taking any and every opportunity to discomfort his Western rivals as they seek to defuse tensions over Ukraine. His insecurity is born, in part, from his experience as a young KGB officer in East Germany in the late Eighties witnessing the collapse of the Iron Curtain, and with it the destruction of Moscow’s status as a global player.Even though no one in the West has a proper understanding as to Putin’s true intentions with regard to Ukraine, the fact they feel obliged to use all the diplomatic tools at their disposal means that they have little alternative than to play along with Putin’s whims – whether that means sitting at a preposterously long conference table or being subjected to state-sanctioned rude remarks.Judging by the proposals made by Macron, there is every possibility that Putin will soon achieve his desired outcome in Ukraine without a single shot being fired in anger – despite increased tensions at the end of last week that culminated in “crunch calls” between Johnson, Joe Biden, the new German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Macron and the Italian and Canadian prime ministers.Macron’s suggestion that Russia scale down its threatening military posture towards Ukraine in return for Kyiv implementing the Minsk agreements would go a long way to achieving the Kremlin’s ambition of exerting control over its troublesome southern neighbour.Under the terms of the agreements negotiated in 2014 and 2015, Moscow wants Kyiv to accept the principle that the Russian-backed territories of Donetsk and Luhansk in the east of the country be granted full recognition under the Ukrainian constitution. Such a move would, in effect, totally compromise Ukraine’s independence, as it would provide Moscow with a direct say in how it conducts its affairs – a proposal that, unsurprisingly, attracts little support among ordinary Ukrainians.But with Macron desperate to demonstrate his statesmanlike skills ahead of the forthcoming French presidential election, Germany increasingly dependent on Moscow to supply its energy needs, and an American president resolved to avoid conflict at all costs, the prospects of the West abandoning Ukraine in its hour of need are very real – a fact that Putin knows only too well.Nor should the crisis Putin has deliberately orchestrated over Ukraine be seen as a one-off in terms of the Russian leader’s bid to reassert Moscow’s presence at the heart of world affairs.One of the most frequently aired complaints of Russian policymakers is what they call the “unipolar” nature of world politics that has taken shape since the collapse of the Iron Curtain – one in which US hegemony dictates the shape and direction of global policy.To this end, Putin, the former KGB officer who is on record as describing the collapse of the Soviet Union as a “genuine tragedy”, has embarked on a sustained campaign to restore Russia’s status around the globe so that, like it or not, other world powers are obliged to take her concerns into account when considering key global issues.This motivation explains Moscow’s highly effective intervention in the Syrian conflict, where Moscow’s military role played a significant role in saving the Assad regime from defeat. Russia has also been active in Libya, where Moscow is keen to establish a controlling interest over the country’s oil wealth.Indeed, the Mediterranean as a whole is a major area of interest for the Kremlin. These days Russia is so well-established in Cyprus that the island has become known as “Moscow in the Med”, while, further to the west, Malta has become the latest target of Russian activity – to the consternation of both the US and the EU.Washington has expressed concern in recent months that the Kremlin is attempting to use Malta as a soft-entry point for access to the European Union and international financial markets. Recent figures show that a quarter of all applicants for Malta’s “golden passport” scheme, which allows high-income iniduals to acquire a Maltese passport within one to three years, are Russian citizens.The island is also a useful launch pad for Moscow’s activities in Libya, as well as other parts of North Africa, and the Pentagon is worried that Moscow might be trying to use Malta as a naval base for its malign activities in the Mediterranean region.

This proves, the new man said, “The Prime Minister is not a complete clown”. His job is to be positive about Johnson and the most positive he can be is he’s only part-clown. We’re in the final days of madness. No one would be surprisedBoris Johnson was found naked on the roof of  Downing Street with a jar of Heinz Thousand Island Dressing up his backside, blaming Joan of Arc for not prosecuting Jimmy Savile. Then Nadine Dorries will be asked: “Do you think this image will damage Mr Johnson”  And she’ll reply: “Shut your mouth! I bet Keir Starmer shoves posh French mustard up his backside ’cos he’s not a man of the people like our Boris.” Before being sick in a flowerpot. Next week, coverage of Prime Minister’s Questions will begin with Priti Patel sliding down a pole in a mist of dry ice lip-syncing to “I Want To Break Free” by Queen. Then we’ll see that Liz Truss has flooded the House of Commons and filled it with jellyfish, and Rishi Sunak is spearing them with a trident. The speaker will yell “Order, order, we can NOT use biblical weapons of death in the house” and it will barely be on the news. Now, to remind everyone of Brexit, Johnson has appointed Jacob Rees-Mogg as Minister of Brexit Opportunities, despite Mogg being unaware the th century has ended.  Mogg will announce: “Having parted from the European Union, we are finally at liberty to permit jousting in shopping centres. Furthermore, shorn of European red tape, we can reintroduce the rule whereby one is permitted to use a Frenchman as an ironing board.” After he replaced the staff who resigned, Boris Johnson said: “At last we have grown-ups running the office.” So who has he had in there before  How were they more childish than this lot  During the lockdown, they must have been telling Prof Chris Whitty: “I don’t WANT to say ‘Hands – face – space’ at today’s TV conference.

During a meeting on how to react to Vladimir Putin’s threats to Ukraine, Johnson’s communications chief would go red in the face and make a ‘hnnnnnnnn’ noise, and Michael Gove would say: “Oh dear – SOMEONE’S done a stink-a-poo”. In a meeting with the Bank of England about inflation, Johnson’s team would start banging a wooden spoon on the table and screaming, “ HATE the Balance of Trade I HATE it” until they had to be put down for a nap. And the only way Boris Johnson could calm them down was by wearing a red nose and silly big shoes and falling over to make them laugh, which luckily is the one thing he’s good at, .

The meeting came just months after the Prime Minister promised to look into the project - in the same text message as he begged for more cash to revamp his Downing Street apartment. Police are now considering whether Mr Johnson had broken anti-bribery laws with the text messages. Now it’s been revealed Mr Dowden accepted free tickets to the Royal Albert Hall a few months after the meeting. The then-Culture Secretary accepted two tickets to a th Birthday Concert featuring new music by Bond composer David Arnold at the London concert venue, last July. Lord Brownlow is a trustee of the Royal Albert Hall Trust and an ambassador of the hallaposs th anniversary.  Lib Dem Chief Whip Wendy Chamberlain has written to Mr Dowden to demand the government reveal what was discussed in the January meeting. She said: “Not only did Lord Brownlow help the Prime Minister magic up the cash to redo his flat, he also seemingly bought himself a key meeting with a cabinet minister to discuss his own pet project.” She added: “We deserve the truth and need to know exactly what was discussed in these meetings. Oliver Dowden must come clean and release the full details of this meeting. If he refuses then it begs the question, what does he not want us to know about the nature of his relationship with Lord Brownlow  The Sunday Mirror has been seeking the release of documents relating to the ‘Great Exhibition’ meeting under the Freedom of Information Act. But the Government has failed to acknowledge the request - and it is now more than a week over the legal deadline for disclosure.Solicitors for the Labour Party wrote to Scotland Yard last week, suggesting the force was “duty-bound” to begin a formal investigation, because there was a “reasonable suspicion” that the law had been broken.The Met confirmed they had received the letter which was being considered by officers from its Central Specialist Crime Command. There’s no suggestion of any wrongdoing by Lord Brownlow.Labouraposs lawyers said the PM may have acted improperly by having “linked” the request for funds to cover the refurb with a promise to “promote a project” backed by the benefactor. In response to the solicitors’ letter, a Met spokesman said: A letter was received and acknowledged on Friday February . It is being considered by officers from the Metaposs Central Specialist Crime Command. No investigation has been opened. But Number  dismissed the accusations as “categorically untrue and a clear misrepresentation of the facts.” They added: “Lord Brownlow, separate to his work for the emerging Downing Street Trust, put proposalsfrom the Royal Albert Hall, the national institution and charity, to the Prime Minister. This was passed to the lead department, DCMS . It is a matter of public record that no project was taken forward by the Government. A government spokesperson said last night: “Former Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden met with Lord Brownlow and the Royal Albert Hall on the joint proposal for a Great Exhibition, which was declared in DCMS’ regular transparency s. “It is usual practice for all Prime Ministers and Ministers to have proposals put to them at ious points and Ministers also meet stakeholders regularly as part of their engagement on an array of issues. “In line with normal practice this idea was referred to the relevant department, considered and ultimately not taken forward by the Government.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Cressida DickBoris JohnsonConservative PartyLiberal Democratspolitan PoliceScotland YardText messagesCrimePolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

He told Sky’s Trevor Phillips On Sunday: “He has my absolute %-plus loyalty. I think this a Prime Minister is doing things for our country, he’s got the big decisions right. I think he will fight and he will win as a result of the next general election.” But travelling north of the border will present its own challenges for the PM, with his ally Jacob Rees-Mogg having accused Douglas Ross of being “lightweight” after the Scottish Tory leader called for Mr Johnson’s resignation.Mr Johnson has called in a lawyer to help, as he calls from Tory backbenchers for him to go will only grow louder and more widespreadhe cannot convince police he was not in breach of regulations at up to six events.

Fteen Tory MPs have publicly called for Mr Johnson to quit, while more are thought to have privately written to the  Committee of backbench Tories calling for a no-confidence vote.

After years of promising a slimmed-down monarchy when he finally takes the reins, a streamlined coronation is the only way for Prince Charles to prove he means business.In the modern world, the senior royals are acutely aware of the need to prove they are value for money and the weight of this responsibility has weighed heavily on the Prince of Wales. A shorter, cheaper and less ostentatious ceremony at Westminster Abbey, albeit with the rather flamboyant codename Operation Golden Orb, will be welcomed by a public more concerned with the ever-increasing costs of living rather than what insignia will be used on postboxes. Charles might often seem like a man from a bygone era, who may at face value appear less in tune with the modern world than his son William and daughter in law Kate, but those close to him will tell you he cares deeply about the effect he can have on the world around him. As the UK was struggling with record levels of unemployment and spiralling inflation in the s, Prince Charles used his Navy severance pay – £, – to fund a number of community initiatives.  The Prince’s Trust charity has gone on to transform tens of thousands of young people’s lives who would have otherwise been afforded little chance of success. His -year crusade campaigning on the environment, which was so often ridiculed and derided, has also been proved revolutionary in its inception at a time when the type of conversations so commonplace today simply weren’t happening at all.  And another subtle sign that Charles will be doing things a little dferently will be displayed on his coronation day when as the new Supreme Governor of the Church of England, he will declare how he wants to be aposdefender of faithapos not aposthe faithapos. Charles’s time in the top job may end up being a footnote in history compared to the epic record-breaking reign of his mother, but his legacy will undoubtedly reverberate for decades to come.

An environmental health officer visited the Aberfan Chinese, in Merthyr Tydfil, Wales last August and swtly issued a zero hygiene rating due to the unacceptable conditions. The owners were also taken to court for the breaches and ordered to pay £,, Wales Online reports.Merthyr Tydfil Council, who oversaw the inspection, were alerted after a member of the public spotted rats scurrying around inside. The council has now shared the shocking images from their visit, showing evidence of a rodent infestation and a bag-full of poison dashed on the floor of the storeroom. An unannounced inspection on August ,  identied immediate hygiene concerns within the business and found that food had been exposed to contamination, as well as evidence of a rodent nest.  The statement explains: The Aberfan Chinese takeaway in Merthyr Tydfil was found to be operating in poor hygiene conditions and ordered to close due to a rodent infestation. The council’s environmental health department received a complaint from a concerned member of the public who had spotted rats in the rear yard of the food business. An unannounced inspection carried out by an environmental health officer on August,   identied immediate hygiene concerns within the business. The statement added: The kitchen was dirty, food was being exposed to contamination and there was clear evidence of a rodent nest within the storeroom where food ingredients were being stored. The inspector found serious defects within the structure of the premises which allowed rodents to enter with ease and a bag of poison had been thrown on the floor hoping that this would deal with the problem. It was clear that this issue had been ongoing for a long period of time and the business owner failed to deal with the issue properly.Given the unacceptable conditions, the inspector served a legal notice to formally close the business until improvements were made and the business was issued a food hygiene rating of zero, which is the lowest score that can be given. Merthyr Tydfil council member Geraint Thomas added: This case demonstrates that our Environmental Health Officers will take swt and necessary action to protect public health when there are clear failures within a food business that put customers at risk. It is essential that proprietors of food businesses comply with food hygiene regulations. The Covid pandemic should not be used as an excuse by food business operators to allow their hygiene standards to slip. I would urge all consumers to check the food hygiene rating of a food establishment before they consider eating from there. It is a legal requirement for ratings to be displayed in Wales to help consumers make informed choices.” Owner of The Aberfan Chinese, Mrs Xiu Hui Xiao attended Merthyr Tydfil Magistrates Court on January , , and pleaded guilty to nine charges of breaching food hygiene regulations, the court confirmed on Friday. The council said that Mrs Xiao was fined a total of £, and ordered to pay costs of £. and a victim surcharge of £. It is not known whether environmental health has visited the establishment since its visit last August. As of February,  , Aberfan Chinese has a zero food hygiene rating on the official food hygiene standards website. For the three areas listed on the website, hygienic food handling, cleanliness and condition of facilities and building, and management of food safety, the inspector has remarked major improvement necessary.

Alex Pereira said the politan Police Commissioner’s resignation is “a little justice”  years after the killing of his cousin, Jean Charles de Menezes, . Two cops shot him seven times in the head at Stockwell Tube station, south London, in July . It happened just two weeks after the   bombings and one day after a separate foiled bomb plot when cops mistook the Brazilian electrician for fugitive terrorist Hussain Osman. Ms Dick, then a commander, was cleared of blame in Jean’s death but his family have aways been angered by her rise to the Met’s top job. Alex said Jean’s mum Maria really hated her. He went on: “I think Maria is very happy now. I think Jean’s father feels the same way – maybe even more than his mother.  “It’s a little justice, but it is a justice. They should have sacked her  years ago, shortly after Jean’s death. She went very, very bad in that job but they promoted her.” Alex, , who lived with Jean in London for six months in , remembers a happy childhood growing up near his cousin in the little rural town of Gonzaga in south-eastern Brazil. Sharing a picture of them together as children along with Alex’s sister, he said: “At that time, no one had shoes – we used to go out barefoot. We made all our own toys – we dreamed of owning bikes.  “But it was a good le because it was very peaceful with zero violence.” In the aftermath of Jean’s killing, Alex knew his cousin had been totally innocent. But he says he and his family weren’t believed. He added: “That made me so angry. You don’t think something like this is going to happen to you. It’s likeyou were sent to the moon oryou moved to another planet. It was very, very crazy.” No officers were prosecuted for the killing but the Met was fined for breaking health and safety laws. In  Jean’s family took a case to the European Court of Human Rights as part of a final attempt to see someone prosecuted, but judges ruled against them. Dame Cressida quit on Thursday after a series of scandals.They include a report detailing evidence of misogyny, racism, and homophobia at Charing Cross police station. The Met has also been criticised for its probe into Downing Street parties held during lockdown. Last year the public was outraged by the abduction and murder of Sarah Everard by cop Wayne Couzens – as well as the heavy-handed arrest of women at a vigil. There is no suggestion Jean’s death was a factor in Dame Cressida’s resignation – which came hours after she told radio listeners she had no intention of quitting.She said it had become clear she no longer had the support of the London Mayor Sadiq Khan.Alex said: “I believe thatyou do something, you will pay for it. Doesn’t matter how much money you have or how much power you have – you’re going to pay.”Murder victim’s brother: New boss must do better The brother of a murdered private detective has called for the new Met Commissioner to prosecute or expel “bent, lying cops”. Alastair Morgan, , says chiefs have been keener on saving reputations than tackling corruption. In , Alastair’s brother Daniel, , was found in a pub car park in Sydenham, south London, with an axe in his head. After five police inquiries, the case remains Britain’s most investigated unsolved murder.  Daniel’s family have long blamed police corruption. And last summer, an independent report into the case described the Met as “institutionally corrupt” – and blasted Cressida Dick for obstructing the inquiry. Alastair says he was furious she was allowed to continue in her job after that and now hopes her successor will do more to rid the force of corruption. “Prosecute bent, lying cops – it’s as simple as that,” he says. “Andyou can’t prosecute them, kick them out. “There has to be consequences. I’m sick to death of non-accountability in the police. I’m sick to death of non-accountability in Britain as a whole.” Alastair and his family are now suing the Met for damages, alleging an ongoing cover-up.

The future King is expected to make sure his coronation is more representative of dferent community groups and faiths. What do you make of Prince Charlesapos coronation plans  Have your say in the comment section  This is part of his vision of a modern aposslimmed-downapos monarchy, a royal source told the Mail on Sunday. The Queenaposs ceremony on June   was influenced by Britainaposs global empire at the time. Although the empire was in decline, the UK still had more than  overseas territories when the Queen was crowned. It was only in  that Prince Charles himself declared the aposend of the Empireapos when Hong Kong was transferred to China.  Many of Britainaposs former territories are now part of the Commonwealth, which the future King will lead when he ascends the throne. Some , troops from the Commonwealth and  from the aposcoloniesapos took part in the Queenaposs coronation parade, which involved a total of more than , armed forces personnel.  More than , dignitaries, including representatives from British protectorates overseas, were taken to Westminster Abbey in the procession. The Queen had to change her outfit several times during the ceremony, which was viewed by an estimated  million people across the world and lasted more than three hours.  Charlesapos service will be a more scaled back affair, with a maximum of , guests, the Mail on Sunday reports. A source told the newspaper: It will be a slimmed-down Monarchy on display throughout. I wouldnapost be surprised to see just Charles and Camilla, Kate and William and their children on the Buckingham Palace balcony afterwards. An insider said there are aposbinders and bindersapos of paperwork on the accession and coronation, although Clarence House denied any detailed plans had been drawn up.  Get all the latest news sent to your inbox.for the free Mirror newsletter The Coronation service was rewritten in recent years to modernise the language and shorten the event. Although it will be an Anglican service, there will be a place for other religions and Christian denominations. Charles previously showed his embrace of other religions in Britain by saying he would like to be known as aposDefender of Faithapos - instead of aposDefender of the Faithapos. He also plans to switch the official insignia that appears on postboxes and police officersapos unorms from St Edwardaposs crown to the Tudor Crown.The costs of the ceremony will be met by the taxpayer and Charles is said to be keen that it should be aposgood valueapos.

He gave a statement admitting killing Lin and Megan Russell but now allegedly denies it.The source said the serial killer’s wind-up has caused “heartbreak and anguish”. Bellfield – whose murder victims include teenager Milly Dowler – had given a statement in which he admitted killing Lin, , daughter Megan, six, and attempting to kill her sister Josie, nine. But he has allegedly retracted it and now denies the  murders in Chillenden, Kent, sources say. He has reportedly bragged his four-page confession was a ploy to “mess” with Michael Stone, who is serving le for the murders but has always denied guilt. The source said: “Bellfield is a narcissist who loves the limelight – he’s now saying he just wanted to mess with Stone’s legal team. “He doesn’t appreciate the absolute heartbreak and anguish he heaps on the Russell family every time he publicly speaks about the crime.” Insiders say Bellfield is even claiming to have written a formal letter to Kent Police to distance himself from the crime.Bellfield, , gave a detailed admission to Stone’s solicitor Paul Bacon last month saying that he was behind the countryside killings. Stone, , hoped the unsigned document would prove he had been the victim of a miscarriage of justice. The Criminal Case Review Commission has been looking at the convictions – at Stone’s request. But the supposed U-turn by Bellfield – already serving le for the deaths of Milly, , Amelie Delagrange, , and -year-old Marsha McDonnell – means he may now refuse to help the CCRC.  Ex-Chief Supt Kevin Moore led a review into the hunt for Bellfield after he murdered Milly and fears he may now be hogging the limelight. Mr Moore, , said: “People like him aren’t normal. They love the limelight, the bravado. You have to askthis is an opportunity to be in the headlines. “Yes it’s right and proper that it’s looked into, but I would very much doubt the validity of his admission.”The former Sussex police chief was immediately sceptical about Bellfield’s claim to be the killer.He explained: “You have to look at the circumstances. Bellfield’s other murders featured a sole female victim. The modus operandi for the murders of Lin Russell and her daughter is a whole dferent ball game. The others involved the abduction of young women from the streets in busy areas, in cities, towns. “Chillenden was out in the country. Stone had knowledge of that area, I can’t see how Bellfield had knowledge of that area. I don’t know why Bellfield would confess now – he’s serving a whole le sentence so he’s not going to get a reduction in his sentence.” Bellfield’s supposed confession came in a four-page statement. He said he wore yellow marigold washing up gloves, had taken a hair scrunchie as a souvenir, killed the family dog after it bit him and had to call in Clacket Lane services on the M to wash off blood. The statement said: “My first intention was to just attack Lin... the situation just got out of control.” It went on to detail how he said he killed Lin and Megan and left Josie for dead with appalling injuries.  He said he ed home to Twickenham, South West London – the patch where he would carry out a triple murder spree – went to work as a bouncer and, next day, threw the murder weapon into the Thames. Bellfield, now known as Yusuf Rahim after converting to Islam, wrote: “Something like this has never happened, in the sense I’ve committed a crime and another person has been arrested. “I apologise to Stone and the Russell family for my heinous acts.” The document was sent to the CCRC, which has the power to order retrials. Stone always denied responsibility. He was found guilty in  but the convictions were later quashed before he was found guilty at a retrial in . The CCRC said: “We have received two unsigned documents from Mr Stone’s representatives.

The CCRC has carried out extensive investigations on information and materials supplied by Mr Stone’s representatives. Once the review is complete, the CCRC will determine whether there is a real possibility the Court of Appeal will quash Mr Stone’s conviction.” Det Chief Supt Paul Fotheringham, of Kent Police, said: “Following two trials at which Stone was found guilty by a jury, and an appeal to the High Court, Michael Stone remains convicted of the murders. “The CCRC has had access to all forensic evidence, documentation and exhibits, the review by Hampshire Police, details of the two trials and appeals to the High Court.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Hampshire PoliceKent PoliceLevi BellfieldMichael StoneMurderLe sentenceCrime\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The new guidance would suggest families may like to consider the jab to protect against a ‘potential future wave’. The percentage of people testing positive for Covid decreased but remained “very high” for those aged  years to aged  in the week ending February th, . Officials figures show that . per cent of that age range were positive after a nose and throat test.Currently, , children in this age bracket, who are either most at risk of Covid- or live with someone vulnerable, are now able to get vaccinations against the virus.But in a hint at things to come health bosses at the British overseas territory the Cayman Islands have reportedly been told they will get vaccines for all their  to -year-olds shipped from the UK “in a few weeks”.Families have been complaining that their holiday plans have been thwarted because of the lack of jabs for under-s in the UK. The majority of countries in Europe are now introducing jabs for under-s, and some resorts have banned those who are unvaccinated apart. However, Spain announced that it would relax its rules from Monday, to allow unvaccinated British teenagers to enter the country with a negative test. The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisationhas been ided about the matter for months and last officially updated their advice just before Christmas. Then they changed their guidance to include children aged  to  who are ‘in a clinical risk group or who has household contact with someone who is immunosuppressed’.  They said the decision was made “following extensive assessment of the risks and benefits of vaccinations” for this age and after considering clinical trials and international data.They added: “Further advice regarding COVID- vaccination for other  to -year-olds will be issued in due course following consideration of additional data relevant to this age group, and on the Omicron iant more broadly.”Professor Wei Shen Lim, Chair, COVID- immunisation, JCVI, said at the time: “The majority of children aged  to  are at very low risk of serious illness due to COVID-. However, some  to -year-olds have underlying health conditions that put them at higher risk, and we advise these children to be vaccinated in the first instance.” The committee is now understood to have recommended to ministers that jabs should be offered to all in that age group, but it is not clearformal advice has yet been given to Government health officials.  A statement from the Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said on Sunday: “No decisions have been made by ministers on whether healthy --year-olds should be routinely offered COVID- vaccines.”Currently, the NHS is offering COVID- vaccine to children and young people aged  to  years.Young people at greater risk of serious illnessthey catch COVID- will need  doses of vaccine,  weeks apart.

In September  he had warned Britain was at a “tipping point” as the country lurched towards a second lockdown. But yesterday it was only two pence pieces teetering on the edge of potential danger as Matt played with family.Another visitor to the arcade told North Wales Live the West Suffolk MP was left alone to play the slot machine. He added many people may simply have not recognised him. Last year the Tory angered the Welsh Government when during his former role he suggested Wales’ successful vaccination programme was only possible as England kept a stockpile.Giving evidence to the Science and Technology Committee about coronavirus, the MP said: “I would argue that the vaccination programme demonstrates that the union saves lives and in the case of Wales, the union has helped Wales to have one of the fastest vaccination programmes in the world and I wish them every luck in the delivery of it. The Welsh Government later angrily retorted: The success of our world-leading vaccine programme is a result of excellent planning and the sheer hard work of vaccine teams around Wales. It is wrong to suggest weaposre reliant on an “English buffer” - we have our own – we are simply more efficient at using it.” Matt Hancock resigned from his former role in June  when he admitted he had “no choice” after footage emerged of him kissing Gina Coladangelo at the Department of Healthaposs London HQ in a blatant breach of Covid rules.

The Duke of Sussex’s friends ­predict that the Duchess of Cornwall – unveiled by Her Majesty last week as the future Queen Consort – will come in for particular criticism in the no-holds barred memoir. Harry used his latest public appearance, a video call this week with former Wales rugby captain Gareth Thomas, to pay tribute to his late mother, Diana. But tellingly, he did not say a word about the dramatic news that Camilla, , will in effect become the next Queen when his father Prince Charles, , ascends the throne. His silence “speaks volumes” says one pal, who alleges Harry, , is still not close to Camilla.The friend said: “Although tensions have eased between the two of them over the years, it was more for a show of unity than a close relationship. “There were big problems at the start but as Harry and his brother William aged and matured, things got better and they can now co-exist as adults. “They were never close with her and they still aren’t.”Diana famously referred to Camilla in her  interview for the BBC ’s Panorama when she said there were “three people” in her marriage to Charles.Harry’s potentially explosive book will be published in the run-up to Christmas. His friend added: “He has got lots to say about it. People think he’s keeping a low profile to respect the family but it’s not that.  “He’s writing a book. He’s got a multi-million-pound book deal and he’s keeping a lot of his opinions for that. The memoir deal states that it should include personal details of personal and family arrangements. And it will be a really intimate take on his feelings about his family and what has gone in the breakdown of the relationship. “If they think that he’s gone soft, then they are mistaken.  “Just wait for the book to come out because that will shake the monarchy to the core.” While the future of Camilla has been settled and Prince William, , is said to be supportive and respectful of the proposed change to her status, Harry is said to have snubbed the woman his mother ­allegedly called The Rottweiler.  When teenager Harry was initially introduced to Camilla shortly before the first anniversary of Diana’s  death in a Paris car crash, aged , their encounter was said to be ­awkward and tense. Harry was only , missing his mum terribly and was not in a position to defend her memory. But as time went by, he and William did develop a warmer relationship with Camilla. Harry said in , during an interview to mark his st birthday, that he and William “loved her to bits”. And he also publicly thanked her for making their father “very, very happy”.  But since Harry’s move to America with we Meghan, , he has been keen to ensure that his tragic mother’s memory and legacy are not airbrushed from history. During his heartfelt tribute to his mum this week he said “I could never fill her shoes” – which royal commentators point to as meaning no one  can either. The book is ­expected to be ­published late this year by Random House. Harry, who is now living in Calornia with Meghan and their children Archie, two, and Lilibet, eight months, is working with ghostwriter J. R. Moehringer. The American Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist has penned books with former tennis champion Andre Agassi and Phil Knight, the co-­founder of footwear giant Nike. The memoir is expected to ­explore Harry’s childhood, his time in the military – including in the Afghanistan war – and his marriage to American-born former actress Meghan. In a statement, the prince explained his motivations for putting his story on paper. He said: “I’m writing this not as the prince I was born but as the man I have become. “I’ve worn many hats over the years, both literally and figuratively, and my hope is that in telling my story – the highs and lows, the mistakes, the lessons learned – I can help show that no matter where we come from, we have more in common than we think. “I’m deeply grateful for the opportunity to share what I’ve learned so far and ­excited for people to read a first-hand account of my le that’s accurate and ­wholly truthful.” Our source said that the publishers are keen to grab the Christmas rush and also ensure that the content is timely. They added: “They want to release everything in ­tandem – book, documentary, etc, like a Big Bang all in one go.

Mathew Plumb and Lauren Young met at Glastonbury Festival while he was living in the back of his van.He had always been interested in the outdoors but had arrived at a place where he didn’t know where to turn in his le, he tells Wales Online. And he and his partner chose do something about their passion for sustainable living and embracing nature. The pair now live amongst acres of trees in an idyillic location which looks like itaposs out of a kidsapos story book.Do you live off-grid or have a unique way of living  Email webnews@mirror to tell your story “He needed it I think – the outdoors,” -year-old girlfriend Lauren says of Mathew in the middle of their dense  acres of forestry which is like something out of a children’s fairytale. They live here blissfully with Lauren’s three-year-old cat Baby, four pigs, and  chickens. Lauren moved here originally temporarily after losing her job as an events manager in the first lockdown but the chimes of the birds and the hundreds of “gorgeous” oak trees pulled her back.  Drowned almost secretly in the shadow of the Deri mountain in north Monmouthshire they have no wi, no bath, no television, and no office space. They live on the absolute bare necessities and they love every second of it – almost. Asked how he managed to fall on  acres, woodcutter Mathew said: “Dad bought it for my sister because she was in Brownies then and they wanted a space to take the kids. He could afford it back then – times were dferent.  “I first came here when I was eight or nine. Then I started using a saw to chop the wood when I was . I realised straightaway that I loved it.” After living here for two years alone with his chickens and Kunekune pigs, which hang around him as though they are dogs on a Sunday afternoon walk, he’s now happier than ever with Lauren by his side. You’d be hard pressed to find a more eccentric and artsy pair. When Mathew isn’t chopping wood, hosting campers, or helping children at one of the local schools he is writing poetry – and that is how he met freelance artist Lauren.She joked that Mathew “stalked” her and “lured” her to the forest. “I’m a freelance artist and people often approach me to discuss ideas and Mathew had been following me on social media since we first met so he got in touch about working with him to illustrate his book,” she recalled. “I was in Hackney at the time in a cute little flat I shared with my best mate at the start of the pandemic. “I always like to meet up with clients to gauge exactly what they want. We had some breakfast and he ended up staying the night – on the sofa. Baby was all over him which is strange because she can be nervous with people she’s new to.” “She was sleeping on my head,” Mathew laughed.  Lauren continued: “Mathew then got me here on the pretence of doing an art walk and sculpture trail thing and I came here to stay a couple of weeks for that. In the end I stayed for two months. “When I went back to London I hated it. I had to leave the flat really quickly because I lost my job as an event manager in the pandemic. It was a snap decision really.” Baby is right at home milling between the array of sawn-off timber and makesht wooden huts which make up their home. Is Lauren as accustomed to the surroundings  “It’s cold very often,” she laughed. “But I’m getting used to it. It was really weird – as soon as I came here for the first time I had a feeling I could be here.”Originally from Bedford she’s always been a stickler for the outdoors since growing up on her granddad’s fields where she spent many a weekend. “When I was small my only friends were my cats, dogs, and chickens. I’d have full-on conversations with them and I missed that lestyle. I came here and it reminded me of that. “And there are oak trees. As soon as there are oak trees I know I’m in the right place.”  You’d have to be a seriously closed book not to appreciate the beauty in the tranquillity of their forest but for most living out here would surely be too much to take. The shower is a bucket of water with a hole in its centre hanging on a chain and the toilet is a hole in a wooden bench in a small wooden hut. Itaposs is beautully decorated with Lauren’s creative touch, and the main living area known as the “charcoal shelter” relies on a makesht curtain to block out the wind. Askedshe has ever regretted the leap into the wilderness Lauren said: “I have thought ‘I wish I was back [in London]’ and I miss it all the time. But I prefer it here and I always try to focus on the lovely things that we can have here.”  It is a huge disservice to the pair to only make reference to the loo as an artistic masterpiece. The whole place is brimming with bright colours and beautully carved and woven wood. It is remarkable that a few huts dotted around a woodland can look so homely and warm even on a cold winteraposs morning. “My dad is a carpenter and I’ve always loved it,” Lauren said. “This is all stuff Mathew has built from the trees,” she explains as we pass yet more precisely-chopped trunks which smell every bit as good as they look. “Mike our neighbour is helping us with the roof for one of the huts.” Neighbour is a term used very loosely in this instance.  He’s about  yards down the road but is the closest to them. Mathew says Lauren’s creativity has transformed their woodland. “At the start of Covid it hit home how much we needed to start future-proofing the business and Lauren has brought so many new ideas,” he said. “She does art therapy in the woodland for people who want to come and do that and she does an arts trail. It’s all for the mind – it definitely works. “I can’t just be a tree surgeon. As well as the camping we deliver firewood and charcoal. “The people we tend to attract are wild campers who come with really small tents or just with hammocks and just want to test themselves.  “We don’t take many people at one time. We try to keep it to five pitches so people can’t see each other and so they feel like they’re on their own in secluded woodland. “There is a lot of uncertainty to le at the moment and we want people who come here to be reassured that there are other opportunities and dferent ways to live. “We often get people here who are having a really dficult time and they just need time to be here and to have some space. It’s a form of therapy really.” It’s their own uncertainty in le – particularly for Mathew – which has brought them here. Mathew describes how he was one of the thousands of “hidden homeless” in Britain when he lived in the back of his work van prior to moving to the forest near to where he grew up.  As the cost of living rises what better way to save money than to live in your own woodland  “Before I came here I thought about buying a house,” Mathew said. “I had almost saved enough for a deposit on a small house in Merthyr, which was all I could afford at the time. Then it dawned on me: what am I going to do with a house  I cut trees for a living – that’s what I do and this is who I am. I want to do cool stuff. We couldn’t do everything we do here while trying to pay off a mortgage.” Lauren said: “We would never have afforded to do what we do here and rent because this takes up hours and hours of our time. Mathew always has bookings with work. He does the cutting and I do the labour.” Weekly outgoings for heating, electricity, water, and rent amount to less than £ a month. “It’s mental how much money you can save,” Mathew said.  “I spend nothing on rent, zero on electric as we get all we need from solar , and about £ every six weeks on propane gas. We have four pigs that I breed and  chickens we use for meat and eggs.” The pigs act like gardeners by hoovering up any unwanted vegetation like bramble and ivy, leaving the lush wood-meadow. You can’t walk  yards without nearly stepping on a chicken. “We had a lot more than this,” Mathew laughed. “We had  but a fox got hold of them. It was heartbreaking. I know it sounds silly but you begin to feel a real connection to all the animals.”  They’re in the process of building an eco-friendly chicken hut to keep them as safe as possible. Each small cabin or hut made by the pair has been constructed without concrete and instead rests on wooden planks so as not to disrupt the soil. While he was tempted by “the modern world” Mathew knows he is now in the right place. “I think from my early s I realised I didn’t want to live a conventional le.

More and more people are taking an interest in going off-grid. I think the pandemic has been a wake-up call.” Even for Tarzan-esque Mathew sticking it out in the wilderness through another winter has been a challenge – but they wouldn’t have it any other way.“Mud, weather, cold, the general challenges nature presents to us – it’s all been there,” he said. “But it’s a definite buzz. It’s exhilarating – without a doubt.“It’s all worth it in the spring – our favourite time of the year, watching the world waking up around us.” Lauren added: “We wake up at about am and the cockerels start going and then again at am. I get to sit and listen to the birds while Mathew makes me a cup of tea. What more could you ask for ”You can follow the couple on Instagram @bleu_jean _ and @twometresplumb .

But it turns out there could be a lot your relatives arenapost actually telling you. This was the case for one woman who has recently had her entire le turned upside down after discovering her grandmother had been hiding a major secret.The unnamed woman, who posts on TikTok under the name @thekennedyproj, explained how her family had recently done andMe DNA tests, which uncovered the major lie her gran had been spinning for years - and sheaposd taken the secret to her grave. Get the news you want straight to your inbox. for a Mirror newsletter here.In her video, the woman, whose account says sheaposs aposnot Kennedyapos told how the DNA test showed her family they had many relatives on the grandmotheraposs side - despite the older woman claiming sheaposd been an orphan and only child. They also found out that the grandmother had erased her past, changed her name and pretended to be a dferent race to have a better le. She said: My grandmother took a secret to her grave and we just found out what it was. She passed back in  and at the time we thought she was born in , we knew her name and we knew that she was an orphan and she was an only child and that we had no other family connections to her whatsoever and the family line lived and died with her. So find me confused when our family gets results back from andMe test telling us we are African American, when my grandmother said that we were English and I know, looking at me youaposre going to be very confused because I am too.She went on to say that her family is still figuring out all the details, but that the test matched them up with a family in Virginia, which made sense as her grandparents had met in Maryland and were married there. They got in touch with the other family and they exchanged photos, which was when they discovered their grandmother hadnapost been an only child - she was actually one of  siblings. It turns out that Millicent Vaughn was born Mammy Vaughn back in , not . She was born to a family of  children, all African American living in Virginia, the woman continues. While her parents did die when she was young, she was not an orphan and an only child like she had said. She had decided to run away from her family and completely exorcise herself from her identity. She picked up a new name, she picked up a new race and she completely erased who she was. She added: So now I have a whole new family and itaposs surreal and itaposs strange and thereaposs this part of me that doesnapost really know who I am. And I think what surprises me the most is the fact that her story is not uncommon for the US at that time. Because she was white-passing she chose to completely reinvent herself and go by a completely dferent name and racial identity just to create a better le for herself and Iaposm incredibly grateful for the privilege that her decision provided for me, but Iaposm also incredibly sad and confused. Iaposm also excited because I have a whole new family that I didnapost know existed. The woman claries this is just the beginning of the journey for her family and that she will be sharing more info.More than . million people have watched the womanaposs video, with it garnering over , likes and thousands of comments.One person said: Itaposs sad how common this is for survival.

Get the news you want straight to your inbox. for a Mirror newsletter here.Some people praised the unnamed mum for taking the time to make such a lovely, artistic lunch, with one saying: aposI would seriously wet my pantsI got a butterfly sandwich for school! I love the effort you put into everything.aposapos A second posted: Youaposre a fantastic mamma. A butterfly sandwich. Wow. But despite how impressive the lunch looked, a few still managed to find something to criticise the mum for. Others couldnapost help but point out that it might have been a aposwaste of timeapos making the food look so nice as it would get tossed about in a school bag, while a few thought the mum had made a mistake by packing it in the wrong kind of tub. One person said: Thataposs so gorgeous! Itaposs a shame it wonapost look the same when they open it....it all gets messed up once in the bag. Another wrote: Wonapost the sandwich go very dry by tomorrow  aposapos A third replied: Shouldnapost it be in an airtight container.aposapos This comes after a snap of a dferent lunchbox went viral, as people tried to work out what was wrong with it. The seemingly innocent-looking lunchbox should apparently be ringing alarm bells for parents. The tin contained ham white bread sandwiches, crackers, a fruit roll-up and a chocolate yoghurt and looks pretty similar to what many of us tucked into at break time when we were kids.But according to Australian nutrition experts at the Cancer Council NSW, this meal could actually be doing more harm than good saying it hides an uncomfortable truth parents might not want to face. To highlight their concerns, they also shared a photo of a second lunchbox to seepeople can notice the dference.The second lunch box contains a cheese and tomato sandwich, fruit, vegetable sticks and yoghurt. The images were intended to show parents how much sugar is hidden in their childaposs lunches, as the first box contains twice the sugar and half the second packed lunch.You canabout it here.What do you think of the lunch  Let us know in the comments below.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON ParentingViralFood\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Serve the food you really want to eat by signing up for our tips and recipes and never be bored by your cooking againSign UpInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Western countries have warned of crippling sanctionsRussia invades Ukraine, however, Mr Tatarintsev dismissed these threats. He said: Excuse my language, but we donapost give a s**t about all their sanctions.  We have already had so many sanctions and in that sense, theyaposve had a positive effect on our economy and agriculture. We are more self-sufficient and have been able to increase our exports. We have no Italian or Swiss cheeses, but weaposve learned to make just as good Russian cheeses using Italian and Swiss recipes.Today Northern Ireland secretary Brandon Lewis said a Russian invasion could be imminent. Speaking to Skyaposs Trevor Phillips On Sunday: We have to be realistic about Russia having , troops now roughly on the border that an imminent incursion by Russia is entirely possible.His comments echo Defence Secretary Ben Wallaceaposs warning from last night. He said during an interview with The Sunday Times, that Putin could strike at any time.Mr Wallace said there is a “whf of Munich in the air”, in an apparent reference to the agreement that allowed German annexation of the Sudetenland in  but failed to prevent the Second World War. The Cabinet minister, who this week flew to Moscow as part of the frantic spell of diplomacy, shared his concerns as US President Joe Biden warned his Russian counterpart an attack would cause “widespread human suffering”.During an hour-long phone call, Mr Biden told the Russian president an attack would “diminish Russia’s standing” as heightened fears of an attack caused western nations including Britain to urge citizens to flee Ukraine.  During the interview, Mr Wallace said that Moscow could “launch an offensive at any time”, with an estimated , Russian troops and heavy firepower amassed along Ukraine’s border. “It may be that hejust switches off his tanks and we all go home but there is a whf of Munich in the air from some in the West,” he added. A source explained that Mr Wallace’s concerns thatMr Putin strikes “come what may, then all the diplomacy would have been a straw man”. US officials have discussed receiving intelligence that Russia is considering Wednesday as a target date to strike, but it was unclear how definitive the intelligence was. Today, Mr Wallace revealed on Twitter on Sunday afternoon that he would end a planned half-term break with his we and three children. He said: Having ed from Moscow early on Saturday morning and because we are concerned about the worsening situation in Ukraine I have cancelled a planned long weekend abroad with my family and will be ing. Mr Wallace only arrived in the undisclosed country on Saturday, having travelled there following diplomatic talks in Moscow. It is understood Mr Wallace had accepted he would be leaving the trip early before heading there, rather than the decision coming in light of new information. A senior defence source said: “As events worsen, the Secretary of State has cut short a planned long weekend with his children for half-term.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Vladimir Putin\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Russia could withdraw its , troops massing on three sides of Ukraine’s border as the West demands. And bingo! Crisis solved. Or NATO could agree that Ukraine should not join it, withdraw combat forces from Poland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, and take its missiles out of Romania, as Vladamir Putin says it should. Sorted! Peace in our time. The squaring-up over Ukraine could all be part of a massive international gamble by Russia and the West to see who blinks first. After all, Mr Putin assures us he has no intention of invading his neighbour.  Joe Biden and Boris Johnson tell us that no matter what happens, we will not fight the Russians. Yet the US President ordered another , American troops to Poland on Friday. And Mr Putin is galvanising his soldiers for action. Britain, Germany, Denmark, Japan and the Netherlands have ordered their citizens to leave Ukraine immediately. For leaders who say they are seeking a peaceful solution, these are remarkably warlike preparations. History tells us how quickly these things can get out of hand. Within  days of a relatively minor terrorist incident in Sarajevo in , the world was at war and  million people perished. But it is not too late to pull back. It will require delicate diplomacy, but more importantly, understanding on both sides. Mr Putin will need to accept that NATO is not going to retreat to pre- borders. And we, in turn, must tone down the aggressive rhetoric to convince him NATO really is only a defensive alliance. The alternative is too horrible to contemplate. We urge all leaders to redouble their efforts to find a compromise. Honour Sir Sean Sir Sean Connery was the first and, many say, the greatest . His descent into dementia was heartbreaking.

Every pound raised will add up to help keep children safe.It is free for any school to sign up and once a school has registered, the NSPCC will send it everything it needs to make its Number Day a success.Schools will be sent tips and ideas on how to fundraise, including games and activities resources to help promote Number Day information on keeping children safe from harm and online safety quizzes that can be used with pupils of all ages. After the challenges of the past  months and the disruption that children have faced, we hope it will be a day of fun to look forward to.To sign up to take part in Number Day, all you need to do is visit the NSPCC’s website and search for Number Day and fill in your school’s details using the registration form.Head of Fundraising for NSPCC Scotland Paul CockramSirThere is a real emergency for colleges coming after years of underinvestment. Regarding the sector, the debate on funding should focus on the perilous choices some colleges will now have to make, and on the signicant challenge this Draft Budget poses for the next academic year.The total funding loss of £. million means, for example, freezing recruitment, outsourcing support activities, possible changes to temporary contracts, increasing class sizes and consolidating classes.All of these would be a last resort, however, after years of under investment this Budget leaves no more space to manoeuvre in. Unless there are improvements to the Budget, noticeable changes to colleges are inevitable.We believe this risks Scotland sliding into a skills emergency. Even in the midst of a pandemic colleges have provided world class education and training to hundreds of thousands of students.But in order to continue there has to be investment based in reality. Scotland’s recovery depends on creating year after year a workforce that is qualied and able – but with the proposed Budget settlement, colleges will be challenged in ways not seen for many years.Chair of Colleges Scotland Ken Milroy MBEThe Poverty and Inequality Commissionhas published advice to the Scottish Government on its Child Poverty Delivery Plan -SirOur advice shows that, quite simply, too many children are still experiencing poverty in Scotland. As a society we believe it’s wrong for children’s lives to be restricted by poverty. That’s why the child poverty targets were set.While we know work is ongoing, progress is not enough to meet the targets, and for some measures the position is worsening. Despite a clear commitment, the action taken by the Scottish Government so far is inadequate We need to see Holyrood using all the levers available to end the scourge of child poverty.We need to see action across all areas of Government in order to release families from the constraints of poverty. Providing parents with support to apply for a job, for example, won’t have the impact we wantthe parent can’t get suitable childcare or doesn’t have a reliable bus service to get them to work.Targets to reduce child poverty can be met, however the Scottish Government will have to utilise every opportunity and deliver action faster, coupled with a signicant increase in fundingWe are committed to working with the Scottish Government to eradicate child poverty and ensure it remains one of its top priorities. It will take a concerted joint effort from PIC, the Scottish Government and its partners to resolve these issues and ensure our children have the very best start in le.Chair of the Poverty and Inequality Commission Bill Scott "},{"url":null,"title":"help elaine conquer the world","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowMid Argyll#s very own racing star Elaine MacEachern is aiming for the top # but she needs help.Just four months after breaking her leg at the Women#s Motocross World Championships in Madrid, talented Elaine is hungry to test herself once more against the very best.After a three-year break from the sport, Ormsary girl Elaine stormed to the  British Women#s Motocross title.Moving on to the world championship Spanish round, there was disappointment as the rigours of practise left her with a broken tibia and fibula.Now fit again and excited for , Elaine is looking for new sponsors.She explained: #The support I receive is incredibly kind and a huge factor in me being able to achieve the British championship in .#This year my plans are to defend the women#s British title, to race as many women#s world championship rounds as possible and also in the MX class in the ScotMX championship alongside the men.#For the women#s British they have moved from three rounds to six.

The lighting looked to be sufficient but there was one broken lamp post which will be fixed by SBC. It is also a very lonely path to walk. Therefore, I would also say that some areas would require CCTV as a deterrent and to know that there are eyes watching.”The path is a busy and popular walkway which starts opposite Asda and continues to Tweedbank and beyond. Most of the path is not overlooked by houses which makes it potentially vulnerable and there have been a number of incidents over the years.Community Councillor Bill White said: “The walk we did was well worthwhile. It pointed out a few points and identied a few areas of concern to look at and hopefully we can take this forward.“I’ve already said that I think we should change the name of it from the Black Path. There needs to be some landscaping done and there are some areas where a little more lighting could help. CCTV would certainly put people off and maybe make people feel a bit safer.

He said: : “Fortunately such incidents fairly rare in the Borders, but we can’t become complacent. My advice would be to be aware of your own surroundings, keep your phone about you and let your family knowyou’re walking along here late at night. If you are walking on the path and you are concerned about anyone you see, oryou think you’re being followed, then just contact the police straight away on .\".removeCommunity council chairperson Judith Cleghorn said: “It could be such a beautul walk.

It was the Pupils who would concede it.In another move tinged with disappointment # the match referee failing to spot another offside in the build-up # a ball from the right flank was swung in to a player in an offside position, who held the ball up and worked it back to a central area where Finnart’s captain unleashed a strong strike high into the Pupils’ net.And while the Feathers Inn-sponsored Pupils continued to work hard to claw their way back into the match they were undone with only a few minutes remaining by a smart counter-attack at the other end, which allowed Finnart’s number  to score from close range with a low, side-footed effort.On reflection, the Pupils were undone by moments of business-like quality – certainly for goals two and four from their hosts # and perhaps their own naivety against a canny and disciplined side who are challenging to win the WoSFL’s Division Four.Nevertheless, the Pupils can reflect on a decent, determined performance for much of this match.

What his example has meant for all of us we can only dimly comprehend.#Our respectful and affectionate sympathy in these days is constantly with our Royal Family.#To a new queen, so young, and yet so well equipped for the high duty to which she has been called, we pledge our loyal service in all the days to come.#My most memorable experience in a public le, extending to more than  years, was when I had the honour and privilege of a private conversation with his late Majesty King George VI.The occasion was when the Conveners of Counties and the Provosts of Burghs in the West of Scotland were presented to their Majesties in the Town Hall, Greenock, on July  .Princess Elizabeth, as she then was, Princess Margaret and the Duke of Edinburgh accompanied the King and Queen.After being presented to His Grace, the Duke of Montrose, I, in turn, introduced the Provosts and their wives of the six burghs in the County of Argyll.Shortly afterwards, I was summoned to His Majesty#s presence.The King immediately put me at ease by asking me to sit down and join him in a cup of tea. He then spoke to me of affairs of the county.To my delight, he displayed a wide and intimate knowledge of Argyll, a county for which he said he had a deep affection.He was keenly interested in all I told him.After about  minutes# conversation, I asked permission to withdraw but His Majesty said, #Do wait a little longer, please.#I came away with the feeling that I had left a gracious King, a great gentleman and, above all, a good and sincere man.

He was protected well by right back Conner Brown, left back Burns and central defensive pairing Ross Souden and captain Keith Mitchell.With less than  minutes remaining, McCallum – who had shted into central midfield with the introduction of second sub and debutant Cameron Wylie at right midfield – intercepted a ball from a Glenvale player, his tackle putting Lang one on one with the hosts# keeper.Lang showed excellent composure for his tender years to slot the ball low into the net with his right foot, just inside the box, his teammates joining him in celebration.After seeing out the final five minutes of regulation time, four nervy minutes of added time were played as Glenvale pushed for an equaliser.In the st minute, Ferguson was called upon to make the save of the day, stopping a powerful Glenvale drive from  yards out, before a Pupils defender cleared the danger.The final whistle sounded soon after and the Pupils# squad and management could cheer a hard-earned, much-needed win, especially impressive considering the inexperience of much of the squad, who are still learning at this level, but judging by this showing, are certainly contributing.Tomorrow , the Pupils host high-flying Harmony Row from Govan, at Kintyre Park.Kick-off pm.

held two online sessions recently to highlight the project, amid concern by Musselburgh and District Angling Clubabout the issue of mine water discharge, fearing it was having “a negative effect on the fish and invertebrate communities in the South Esk”.These concerns predate the recent pollution incident in the River Esk last month.Residents who attended the Coal Authority sessions heard more details about the plans for the treatment scheme at Dalkeith, which will remove iron and manganese from water flowing from a historical drainage tunnel adjacent to Newmills Road, known locally as Junkies Adit.The tunnel is linked tothe extensive underground coal mine workings in the Midlothian area.In recent years, the amount of mine water discharging from Junkies Adit has been increasing and the water quality has been deteriorating, the Coal Authority said.The organisation explained that the water affected was visibly orange, which was a result of naturally occurring iron dissolving in the mine water underground, which then became solid as it mixed with air and settled out of the water.In recent years, the discolouration has become more visible further downstream and could affect the river’s ecologyleft untreated, the Coal Authority added.The Coal Authority has been working with the Scottish Environment Protection Agencyand other partners to monitor the problem and develop a solution.Details for planning approval will be submitted shortly, with a view to starting the main construction later this year.More detailed design work will be done in the coming months to develop the scheme, and residents and stakeholders will have the chance to provide feedback as the designs progress.John Batty, Coal Authority project manager, said: “I think a lot of residents are keen to see this project progress as the river is so visibly orange as a result of the mine water, and the negative impact on the wildle and ecology is widely known.“The mine workings are complex so it has taken many years to get to this point.“We have been working to carry out studies and investigations, evaluate potential solutions and establish water quality by taking water samples on a regular basis through the challenges of the pandemic.“We have undertaken research using a test treatment scheme on site last spring that provided a large amount of information to feed into the designs.”Paul Butler, SEPA mining sector lead, said: “We are pleased that the progress we have made together has enabled the Coal Authority to provide information on the proposals for a new mine water treatment scheme at the site of Junkies Adit.”Colin Beattie, MSP for Midlothian North and Musselburgh, said: “I think it is important that the public are involved with the process and it is vital public engagement continues as the scheme progresses.“I look forward to seeing the next stages of the treatment scheme and working with the Coal Authority, SEPA and the local community on this project.”Steven Dalgleish, of MDAA, said: “No faulting the Coal Authority’s commitment to the cause but the association remains gravely concerned that funding may not appear for this project.“From some of our own research, it seems that this may remain an issue for over  years, leaving the South Esk between Dalkeith and its junction with the North Esk effectively dead and useless as the main salmon and sea trout spawning bed area it once was.”"},{"url":null,"title":"driving-ban-drink-driver-pulled-longniddry","story":"Oliver Moss, of College Way, was pulled over by police officers at Main Street in

demolished and replaced by a passivhaus building containing four three-bedroom flats.In a letter to the local authority, the community council said that while it did not object to the idea of flats on the site, the current proposals were too big and it added that the design appeared to include windows which were just one metre from neighbouring houses, adding: “It is hard to imagine this providing adequate lighting.”The proposals to replace the house, known as Glen Maree, with the flats aims to make it as sustainable as possible, with its design statement describing the residential development as “net zero”.It will include electric car charging points at a private parking area to the rear of the property, solar  and non-fossil fuel heating systems.The roof design has been created to ensure maximum solar exposure to support the flats and the design statement points out that easy access to public transport is also available to new residents of the flats.It adds: “This development makes efficient use of land, buildings and infrastructure by altering a previously developed plot of land in a town centre rather than a greenfield site on the town periphery, for example.“Industry-leading Scottish cross laminated timber is to form the superstructure, whilst Passivhaus principals of airtightness, heat recovery and solar gain are to be employed to create very efficient, low-energy dwellings.“We believe this strategy will result in a very energy-efficient use of the plot, with the four new apartments using less energy than the existing building.“We intend to create an exemplar development that demonstrates sustainability without compromising design quality.”The design statement adds that the site itself is not in the Gullane Conservation Area but “on the periphery” of it.Despite plans to position the new building eight metres back from the Main Street pavement with a large front garden area, the community council said that the design did not fit the site.It said: “We have no issue with the general principle of creating flatted accommodation on the site.“The particular choice of design, creating four substantial flats across three floors rather than the two of the neighbouring houses, does appear to be over-dominant in scale.“Eventhe building were able to be set slightly further back this effect could be diminished, but the site appears not to lend itself to this.”The application is available to view on the council planning portal."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-gift-card-scheme-saw-sales-rocket-first-pandemic-christmas","story":"The East Lothian Gt Card has become the seventh best selling area card produced by its suppliers in the UK.Launched in late , it offers people the chance to buy cards which can be used in local shops and businesses.A new report has revealed that the card has seen more than £, spent for use in local businesses since its launch, with more than £, bought to spend between October and December .Councillor John McMillan, economic development spokesperson for East Lothian Council, said that the success of the card had made it the seventh best performer in the UK for the supplier.He said: “It’s fantastic to see the East Lothian Gt Card proving so popular as it encourages use of our ied local businesses.“It’s more important than ever to support local traders as they recover from the effects of the pandemic.”The report, which has figures for the number of cards bought from October  to March last year, found that the average amount spent on the cards was £..The gt card was launched by East Lothian Investments on behalf of the local authority as a year-round offer following the success of the council’s Christmas shop local campaign, which had run for a decade.Hundreds of cards were sold during its first two years however, the report has revealed that between October and December , , cards were sold, with an average spend of more than £ each.Mr McMillan said: “While we don’t have final quarter figures yet for , we expect these to show very healthy sales again and we are seventh in the UK in terms of area gt card sales operated by our supplier.“We also know from recent research published in the Financial Times that East Lothian people supported their local traders more than any other UK local authority area during the lockdowns, which is testament to the quality of local businesses and the strong community spirit we have in East Lothian.“The gt card is a great way to support and encourage that ethos.”About  local businesses have signed up to accept the gt card in their stores, with no business charges applied to them.Pet shop owner Fiona Veerman said that the card had been a boost for local traders who were battling against online retailers.Fiona, who runs Veerman’s Pets  Co in Tranent, said: “We have always welcomed all customers into the shop with a smile, and we feel that this is especially important today as high streets up and down the country struggle to compete with online giants and out-of-town shopping centres.“We have been involved with the East Lothian Gt Card scheme from the outset, as it was created specically to encourage customers to think locally.“This is very important to us, as we also live in Tranent and know that money spent locally stays in the community.”No figures are available for the current financial year yet however, the report, which goes to the council’s audit and governance committee next week, reveals that East Lothian Investments is now looking into a way to provide the cards digitally in the future."},{"url":null,"title":"get-covid-test-kits-east-lothian","story":"Mobile units are travelling all around East Lothian in the coming days to make testing kits more accessible for locals.No

One evening in  I was sitting in a student flat in Stirling listening to Janice Long on Radio . During her handover to John Peel, she dedicated the last record she played to the veteran DJ. The track in question was Speed Your Love to Me by Simple Minds, I think. Or maybe it was Up on the Catwalk.What I do remember more clearly, though, is John Peel’s response at the start of his ownprogramme. “Thanks, Janice, for that piece of pomp rock,” he saidbefore pressing play on something that was more to his liking .In my head it was a marker of how things were on the turn. Two years previously the reputation of Simple Minds couldn’t have been greater. The release of the New Gold Dream album both propelled them into the charts and into the album of the year lists in the music press. It felt like the culmination of the band’s steady progress from punky wannabes to art rock giants, “a gradual, heady ascent up a huge mountain,” the music critic Dave Simpson once suggested.New Gold Dream was the mountain top. A hypnotic, pulsing, thrilling thing. One of the great Scottish albums.But with its anthemic feel and thunderous percussion, the release of Waterfront in October , the first single off the Sparkle in the Rain album, flagged up the fact that the band were beginning to drop the art and concentrate on the rock. As a result, they began to lose the critical acclaim and cult status and became a global success. Swings and roundabouts.In the years that followed the Minds would rack up hit after hit and bad review after bad review. When it comes down to it, most bands would. quite understandably, prefer the former over the latter.However, success fixed the image of the band in the public consciousness. As the years – decades now – have passed, they are usually remembered as the band who gave us Alive and Kicking and Belfast Child and recorded Keith Forsey and Steve Schf’s Don’t Youfor the film The Breakfast Club . The shimmering electro of early singles such as I Travel or The American, the songs I danced to in a Stirling student disco, are often overlooked.So, one of thepleasures of Graeme Thomson’s new book on the band, Themes for Great Cities, is its desire to be an act of reclamation.Thomson wants to challenge the lazy cliches that have attached to the band’s reputation, to complicate the story, to, as he says in his introduction, “remysty” his subject. To that end he revisits the early years of the band and suggests why they matter.He follows the bands from Toryglen to the charts, concentrating on their earliest records, from ’s Le in a Day to ’s brace, Sons and Fascination and Sister Feelings Call. Records touched by the influence of both krautrock and Giorgio Moroder, post-punk and prog. This was music, Manic Street Preacher James Dean Bradfield once suggested, made by “crystalline gods.”And music made not just by singer Jim Kerr and guitarist Charlie Burchill, the faces of Simple Minds now for over four decades, but by all of the band’s original line-up. The democratic first incarnation of the band was fuelled as much by Derek Forbes’s bass, Mick MacNeill’s keyboards and Brian McGee’s drumming as by Burchill and Kerr. All five members contributed to the sound of Simple Minds.“It was very much a collective,” Thomson tells me when we speak in January. “I like that autodidactic thing of young working-class people stretching themselves, pushing themselves and absorbing all these influences and just how abstract a lot of that music is. It’s very challenging, I think it’s still very fresh. I think it warrants a listen. I like the fact that it’s not canonised.”Thomson, who has written acclaimed books on Kate Bush and John Martyn, is a long-time Simple Minds admirer. Now , he was  or  when he first discovered them around the release of Sparkle in the Rain, when the band were nearing their commercial peak. Like a true fan he then went back to explore their earlier records.One of the reasons for writing the book, he says, was simply to celebrate their nascent achievements. “You want to write about the music you love, and these albums are among the earliest and first records I ever loved,” he points out.“You also look for fresh ground. I don’t think those records have been written about, compared to a lot of the records in the canon. Even post-punk records that at the time were quite marginal, like Unknown Pleasures, are now part of the musical establishment.”The story Thomson tells is of a young band moving fast, constantly changing, looking outwards to the continent In central Europe men are marching …”, growing up, finding their feet.And that explains how they became more and more central to the story of pop by the mid-eighties. They’d found a map to take them from the outskirts to the centre of the city. Next stop, stadium tours.“They get this accusation of selling out,” Thomson suggests, “and I suppose I wanted people to see how they started making that bigger music in the mid-eighties and how it was organic in a way. It kind of makes sense when you see how their story evolved.“I think when a band’s made six or seven records before they have a hit it’s hard to accuse them of being cynical.”Simple Minds at their mid-s peak The story of Simple Minds is the story of the s, a story of experimentalism followed by ato classicism. They were not the only ones who followed a similar trajectory.The Waterboys, led by Mike Scott, sang of their quest to capture “the big music” on their  album A Pagan Place and they weren’t alone in that desire. Big Country, U and even Echo and the Bunnymen were all chasing the same goal at the same time.It was a moment when horizons broadened and, Thomson suggests, old worlds were rediscovered. In the book he paints a picture of a group of young men from Glasgow, perhaps disillusioned with their surroundings, who go and experience Paris and Berlin and thenhome and begin to see that Glasgow is also European.“And you start to reflect more of your own culture,” Thomson suggests. “And I think you can hear that in Simple Minds when it starts to become a bit more Celtic, a bit more elemental.”More than that, though, the band was changing too. Drummer Brian McGee left in  and bassist Derek Forbes left in . Line-ups change and the music being made is transformed as a consequence.“You can argue that Simple Minds have been many dferent bands really,” Thomson suggests. “There are two central figures, but when you lose a drummer and you lose the bass player, then it becomes a dferent band, and you work in a dferent way. The music inevitably is going to change.“Brian McGee the drummer was replaced by Mel Gaynor, who is this huge propulsive rocket launcher of a drummer and I think that changed the sound.”The thunderous drive of Waterfront was the first evidence of that.Simple Minds the band have continued to evolve over the years, have been, as Thomson says, many bands. And yet their image is frozen at the point of maximum visibility, in their mullety, sing-along-chorused commercial peak.“It’s a picture in reverse,” Thomson says. “Simple Minds started complicated and got more accessible. U did the opposite. They wanted to become more experimental, and I think when you start from a point where you are painting pretty crude pictures, as U were, it’s easier to mess with that.“U borrowed a lot from Simple Minds. Simple Minds were ahead chronologically, and I think artistically, for a long time. New Gold Dream certainly had a huge impact on U. You can hear it on The Unforgettable Fire.“And also, like the Tory party, U stuck together. They managed not to lose any members. Keeping the same personnel in place during your whole career is going to enable you to do that.“By the early s Simple Minds were just Jim and Charlie. And then you are working with session musicians, and I think it becomes much more dficult in that scenario to find that spot.Author Graeme Thomson “The band that goes weird is always acclaimed. If you start off quite mainstream and then go weird people see that as a very courageous thing.”Thomson has spoken to most of the original members of Simple Minds in writing his book. Does their reputation matter to them  Do they yearn for the excitement of those early years “Jim is very relaxed now. I think it feels very old to him and he can point to all the success the band has had since then.”“I think they understand why diehard fans love that stuff, but it’s not something they can replicate. It was a very long time ago.” Themes for Great Cities by Graeme Thomson is published by Constable, £"},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/13462568.jpg?type=article-full","title":"traces-tv-drama-starring-laura-fraser-martin-compston-returns","story":"“But that tiny bone doesn’t change from the womb to the tomb. If you analyse that bone, it will tell you where your mother was living when she was pregnant with you.”McDermid, , can rattle off a raft of intriguing details like this from her encyclopaedic knowledge of forensics, gleaned across  years of plotting novels packed with murder, suspense and insidious deeds.As you might imagine, she has no shortage of fascinating anecdotes. Like the time that anatomist and forensic anthropologist Professor Dame Sue Black taught her how to break the hyoid, a small horseshoe-shaped bone in the neck.Or when forensic chemist Professor Niamh Nic Daeid laid bare the damage that can be wreaked by fires in confined spaces, with a gasp-inducing video clip of a synthetic Christmas tree-turned-towering inferno after an electrical spark ignited its branches.The ear bone McDermid mentions is one such nugget that the Fe-born author plans to incorporate into a book at some point: a tool that could help pinpoint the circumstances of a grisly death or provide important clues about an anonymous murder victim.“The things that are still fascinating to me are what the anthropologists dig up,” she says. “The analysis they can do of your biological material to tell you things like where you lived.”Tantalising titbits like these are woven throughout Traces, the TV drama starring Laura Fraser and Martin Compston, which s to our screens for a second series this week.The crime thriller, co-created by McDermid, focuses on the work of the fictional Scottish Institute of Forensic Science and Anatomyin Dundee. Its twisting plot follows three forensic professionals – Fraser, alongside Molly Windsor and Jenner Spence – as they analyse crime scene evidence.Val McDermid on the set of Traces in Dundee. Picture: Alibi UKTV Traces was inspired by the work of the many remarkable women scientists that McDermid has got to know well over the years.They include the aforementioned Professor Dame Sue Black, currently at Lancaster University, who is world-renowned for her pioneering work at the Centre for Anatomy and Human Identication and the Leverhulme Research Centre for Forensic Science, both created during her  years at Dundee University.McDermid has also spent time picking the brains of Professor Niamh Nic Daeid, who continues to oversee the ground-breaking research happening in Dundee, alongside colleague and leading forensic anthropologist Professor Lucina Hackman.Professor Dame Sue Black has become world-renowned for her work as an anatomist and a forensic anthropologist. Picture: Morgan SilkWired The Conde Nast Publications Ltd PA When making Traces there was never any doubt in McDermid’s mind that a trio of female scientists should be at the fore. “Right from the start, that was one of the key elements of putting the production together,” she says. “Forensic science is so often led by women. An awful lot of leading forensic scientists are women.“We wanted to make a drama that put women front and centre. Not just the three scientists, but the producers, the exec producers, the directors and much of the cast are female. It was one of the very first completely female-led productions when we made the first series.“That is now almost becoming something that is not worth commenting on, but when we were making the first series of Traces, there wasn’t anything quite like it in terms of the make-up of the team.”: Five great Scottish thrillers and crime novels headed for our TV screens The debut series of Traces, filmed between Dundee and Manchester, aired on Alibi in  and was then shown on BBC One last year. McDermid worked closely with Scott  Bailey actor and writer Amelia Bullmore in developing its premise. They are both thrilled, she says, that it is back for a second run.“It was pretty much the same as the first series,” says McDermid, describing their collaborative process. “We had some basic ideas and brainstormed them. We came up with the basic storyline we wanted to pursue and then Amelia ran with it.“We spent time with Niamh Nic Daeid and Lucina Hackman, the two professors at Dundee. Then essentially, I stepped back, hands off, and let Amelia get on with it. As the script drafts came through, I looked at them to seethere was anything that didn’t make sense to me.”Martin Compston, Molly Windsor, Jenner Spence, Laura Fraser and Michael Nardone in the new series of Traces. Picture: Alibi UKTV Traces being recommissioned for a second series has given them scope to develop the characters and flesh out the storylines. “That’s what you need, otherwise it becomes a dry recitation of the forensics,” says McDermid.“But, believe me, as we go forward through this series, the forensic detail is front and centre again. And it is surprising stuff. We have been very fortunate in that we are working with forensic scientists who are at the leading edge of research and so we are learning about things that are just coming on stream.“I don’t want to say anything in too much detail because …” McDermid purposely trails off. Spoilers  She is keeping tight-lipped. What we do know is that the plot of the new series will centre around a clutch of improvised explosive devices being set off in and around Dundee.Was any inspiration drawn from real-le cases  “No, absolutely not,” says McDermid. “We drew on the forensic experiences of Niamh and Lucina, but in terms of actual cases, no.“It is dficult to say anything about this without it being a spoiler but when people see it, they may jump to the conclusion it is based on something, a real case, but the scripts were all written and in production before that happened.\"That gave us a sharp intake of breath. When le imitates art, it is eerie, but you also have to then ask questions about the material we have and whether it is exploitative in the light of subsequent events.Laura Fraser as Professor Sarah Gordon and Molly Windsor as Emma Hedges. Picture: Alibi UKTV “We looked at it very carefully and we all agreed that it was OK, that we weren’t being exploitative, not least because we had done the work before the event as it were.”Breaking Bad star Laura Fraser plays Professor Sarah Gordon, a forensic chemist at the fictional University of Tayside and director of SIFA.Jenner Spence, known for her roles in Stargate Universe and Continuum, is forensic anthropologist Professor Kathy Torrance, with Three Girls actor Molly Windsor as intrepid lab technician Emma Hedges.How do the real-le scientists McDermid knows feel seeing their line of work depicted on screen  “They are happy with it because we have taken the time to get the detail right. That is what pleases them. That is why they got involved in the first place because we committed to doing it properly.“They have a giggle when they see who is playing them on screen – they find that quite amusing because they are not very like them in real le.”Behind the scenes during filming of Traces series two. Picture: Alibi UKTV The million-pound question, which McDermid has no doubt been asked countless times throughout her career, is why we as readers and TV viewers have such a fascination with crime and forensics. Is it the puzzle, the macabre, the fear, the titillation – or something  “A lot of it is curiosity. We want to know how things work,” she says. “The great thing with forensic science, particularly as it has developed in recent years, is we get answers, and you can see how we got to the answer. I think people find that really satisfying.“Often le events and the world around us doesn’t produce a logical conclusion and answer. The great thing about forensics and crime fiction in general is you get a resolution.\"Or,you don’t get a resolution or an answer, at least you know where you are. When terrible things are happening all around us, it is good to have something that produces the comfort of resolution.”That is something which feels particularly pertinent in the present day. “We have had two years of living in limbo, most of us, not knowing from one month to the next how our lives were going to be,” says McDermid.“It is a comforting space to be in when you are watching a drama, or indeed a true-le series about forensics, to know there are answers out there. We have also in the last couple of years come to understand the importance of the role of scientists developing new ideas and finding solutions.\"It is hard to think back two years when we didn’t have a vaccine – we didn’t even have a test when Covid arrived. But the scientists put their heads down, dug in and came up with the answers. I think that is something we have all become much more aware of and gratied by.“Before all this happened, Michael Gove was going about saying, ‘we have had enough of experts.’ Sorry Michael, you were wrong on that one.”Laura Fraser as Professor Sarah Gordon filming series two of Traces in Dundee. Picture: Alibi UKTV A  study at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign found that women tend to be drawn towards true crime stories more than men, and that they are typically most interested in those that give insight into the killer’s motives, how victims escaped or that feature female victims.Is that something McDermid, who penned the non-fiction guide Forensics: The Anatomy of Crime in , has found from speaking to her readers  “Yes and I think maybe part of it is we are all wanting to be on the alert for the killers in our lives,” she says.“The acts of violence that are committed against women on a daily basis in this country are still staggering and they are usually committed by people who are very close to us. Maybe part of it is we want to be on the alert.”It is a subject that is always forefront of her mind but arguably even more so over the last fortnight. When we speak the furore over Raith Rovers signing David Goodwillie is sending shockwaves across Scotland.A lelong fan of the Fe club, McDermid first stepped up to be the team’s shirt sponsor in . Her late father Jim, a former scout for Raith Rovers, introduced his daughter to football at an early age.After news of Goodwillie’s signing broke, the author announced she was withdrawing her support and sponsorship of the team. The striker, who previously played for Clyde, was ruled to be a rapist and ordered to pay damages in a civil case in .Writing on Twitter, McDermid said: “The thought of the rapist David Goodwillie running out on the pitch at Starks Park in a @RaithRovers shirt with my name on it makes me feel physically sick.”: Val McDermids anger over Goodwillie signing: How could football get it so wrong Raith Rovers has since admitted it was a mistake to sign Goodwillie and confirmed that he will not be playing in any matches. The club has said it is reviewing his contract.McDermid has stood firm and said she will notwhile the player remains on the payroll and those who authorised his signing are still in charge.Testament to how deep her anger and hurt runs, she tells me: “It has been the first time in  years that I have been glad my dad is not here.”Before becoming an author, McDermid spent  years working as a journalist in the late s and through the s. During that time, she covered big stories including Hillsborough, Lockerbie, the “Yorkshire Ripper” case and the aftermath of the Moors Murders.Her latest novel, , s to that world as told through the eyes of protagonist Allie Burns, an ambitious young reporter on the fictional Glasgow newspaper the Daily Clarion. It marked McDermid’s first new series in almost two decades.Crime author Val McDermid’s latest book, , draws from her former career as a journalist. Picture: Gordon Terris The Herald The book, newly released in paperback, has become her best-selling hardback to date since it was published last August. McDermid is currently working on the next instalment, set a decade later, titled .The adventures of Allie Burns would make a fantastic TV series, I reckon. “Watch this space,” she says, cryptically.Fans of her writing will know  isn’t McDermid’s first book with a journalist at its heart. The six-strong Lindsay Gordon mystery series helped launch her career with debut novel Report for Murder in .There are some interesting rumblings on that one too. “Lindsay Gordon is in development at the moment,” she reveals.: A murky fog of smoke, typewriters and foul deeds: Val McDermids latest novel Early discussions about a potential TV series have given her amusing pause for thought. “The funny thing about Lindsay Gordon is when we first started talking about it, the production company said very seriously, ‘And, of course, it is period drama …’” laughs McDermid, tickled by the notion of the s as ye olde days.Meanwhile, the much-awaited ITV adaptation of her  novel, The Distant Echo, is due to grace our screens later this year. The three-part drama, Karen Pirie, will see Outlander and Vigil star Lauren Lyle play a young police detective investigating a cold case murder in St Andrews.“We have had to make some changes to the storyline because Karen has a very small role in the book originally,” explains McDermid. “But, also, we are concertinaing almost  years of books into a much tighter time frame because the idea is,this goes well, we will make book after book.“So, the timeline has been shted and the story has been adjusted but essentially the heart of it remains the same. I think what we have ended up with is really good television. Lauren does a fantastic job as Karen Pirie.“Quite a lot of people will look at Lauren in the abstract and think, ‘She doesn’t look like the Karen Pirie in my head …’ but when they see her on screen, they will believe her, trust me.”: Outlander star Lauren Lyle on BBC thriller Vigil and ITV crime drama Karen PirieMcDermid has had cameo roles in Traces and an earlier ITV adaptation Wire In The Blood. Will we see her popping up in Karen Pirie  “No, I don’t think so. To be honest, I am getting typecast,” she deadpans. “I keep turning up as a journalist. I just don’t get the chance to show my range …”She may be spinning multiple plates between her books and TV projects, but McDermid never passes up an opportunity to build on her forensics expertise.“I am looking forward to spending a day with Niamh [Nic Daeid] soon because she has a new set up in Dundee which is essentially a constructed crime scene with model ‘bodies’ – they look real,” she says. “I am hoping to spend a day up there with her going through the crime scene bit by bit.”Professor Niamh Nic Daeid is a forensic chemist involved in ground-breaking research at Dundee University Has McDermid had the chance to do anything like that before  “Crime scenes are not places they let people like me wander about and there are not many opportunities to see something like that which has been so meticulously reconstructed.“What I have seen over the years is something by Frances Glessner Lee, an American heiress, who set up the first forensic lab in the US at Hard [in the s]. She did these things that were called ‘nutshell studies’ of crime.“They were basically small-scale dioramas of crime scenes that were used for training detectives. They are like wee doll’s houses of murder.”: Five great Scottish thrillers and crime novels headed for our TV screens Perhaps in another le McDermid might have embarked upon a career in forensics  “I don’t know,” she muses. “I enjoyed chemistry very much when I was at school. But I’m not sure I have the right temperament for a scientist.“You do need to have enormous patience. And be willing to repeat things endlessly to make sure they are replicable. I am not sure I have the right kind of brain for it. I thinkI hadn’t been a writer, I would have wanted to be a musician.”Traces s to Alibi on Tuesday at pm.  by Val McDermid is out now in paperback "},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/13471166.jpg?type=article-full","title":"jack-monroe-praises-asda-lowering-grocery-smart-prices","story":"The cook and author has been urging supermarkets to make value food ranges more widely available after highlighting the inflation in products such as rice and value ranges being removed from shelves in her local Asda in Shoeburyness, Essex, last month.She tweeted that in January  the cheapest pasta was p for g.

Over the past five years, the total cost of repairs was £.m.The revelation has come in the wake of growing anger over a \"waste\" of public money over Scotlands ferry-building fiasco and after state-owned shipyard firm Ferguson Marine admitted there is set to be even more delay and extra cost implications because of cabling concerns on one of two leline ferries being built.MV ArrowThe state-controlled ferry operator CalMac has said it was \"disheartening\" to hear of island communities suffering from the disrupton to services in recent weeks and was doing all it could to reduce the impact.And Comhairle nan Eilean Siar, the council covering the Western Isles has accused senior management of CalMac of deciding to “hunker down” away from the islands and breaking a promise to engage with the local authority.New data seen by the Herald reveals that in , before the pandemic hit, around one in  scheduled sailings were cancelled. Out of , sailings just  were cancelled.But since then the rate of cancellations has shot up to just over one in  as concerns surfaced over the viability of the ageing ferry fleet.In , there were , scheduled sailings with  cancellations and in  there were , planned trips with  cancelled.The collapse in August,  of Ferguson Marine Engineeringled by tycoon Jim McColl, which runs the last remaining shipyard on the lower Clyde, came amid soaring costs and delays to the construction of two leline island ferries and resulted in its nationalisation by the Scottish Government.The cost of both vessels has doubled to around £m while their delivery is nearly five years late.Highlands and Islands MSP Edward Mountain, the former convenor of the rural economy and connectivity committee which branded the ferry procurement management process a \"catastrophic failure\" said the figures lay bare the failings of the ferry service and said there should be a full public inquiry.“It has been a year of woe for our island communities, whose daily lives have been disrupted by an aging ferry fleet which is highly susceptible to breakdowns,\" he said. “This new data is yet more proof that the lack of new vessels is having a serious impact on ferry services. The SNP Government have failed to renew the fleet and build resilience into our ferry network.“Many of these ferries are operating beyond their intended lespan. Older boats require more maintenance, but there’s also longer breakdowns and ier repair times too.“No one would expect the First Minister to travel to work in a  year old car, but the SNP Government are expecting islanders to rely on thirty year old ferries.“Island communities are suffering the consequences of the SNP’s lack of forward planning. This is unacceptable and that again is why we need a full public inquiry to investigate this ferry fiasco.”Comhairle nan Eilean Siar has said islands were at \"crisis point as widespread chaos\" engulfed ferry services throughout the Inner and Outer Hebrides in recent days as a result of over-runs in the CalMac dry docking schedule and the breakdown of MV Hebrides.It called for urgent action from Calmac and Scottish Government to ensure leline service is restored and a community voice is listened to.It comes as it emerged problems with the starboard main engine of the -year-old MV Hebrides has meant that the suspension of services to and from Uig on Skye and Lochmaddy in North Uist will last till Sunday. Engineers were carrying out repairs on the vessel which can carry  passengers and  cars on Thursday and CalMac said they were continuing to investigate \"contengency plans\".On Friday four leline services were suspended by pm partly due to weather and partly due to the MV Hebrides breakdown, after three on Thursday and eight the previous day.A substantial amount of emergent steelwork has also been discovered on another of the fleets elderly statesman, the -year-old MV Clansman in dry dock, and this has delayed herby three weeks.But Comhairle nan Eilean Siar has said even when the weather was not bad, ferry breakdowns and delays to new ferries left island communities vulnerable.CalMac has said unforeseen ferry faults have been partly to blame for disruption to leline services in recent weeks which has resulted in islanders raising concerns about empty food shelves.It said: \"We are now well into the third week of extreme and unprecedented weather conditions - one of the longest periods of very poor weather and high signicant wave height for many years,\" the ferry operator said.\"We are experiencing technical faults with some vessels that require urgent repair. In addition, some of our statutory annual overhauls are delayed, while engineers solve unforeseen issues presented during detailed surveys.\"We will continue to work with local communities to ensure their priorities around the transportation of goods and services are understood and supported. Our dedicated frontline staff are talking every day to our regular customers to make sure that essential goods and services are being moved.\"We understand how much our customers and the communities we serve rely on ferry services. Getting ferries working as they should be is our absolute priority, and we thank you for your patience and understanding at what we know is a really dficult time.\"Transport Scotland said Scottish ministers, and the board of state-controlled David MacBrayne Limited, which owns CalMac were listening to islanders.A Transport Scotland spokesman said: “We recognise the fragility of some supply chains serving island communities and understand the anxiety that disruption to ferry services can cause.“We are aware of the additional staffing pressures faced by operators due to the Covid pandemic impacting on staff availability because of sickness and self-isolation.“Every effort is made to avoid cancellations and breakdowns, but it is impossible to completely remove the risk of this happening in technically complex vessels. During times of disruption, we always seek to work with operators to deliver additional sailings wherever possible.“We acknowledge the ferry fleet is aging and as such we are delivering new tonnage to support our communities by working with CMAL, CalMac, MSPs, community representatives and others to develop investment programmes - at least £ million over the next five years - for major vessels and small vessels.”"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"February ,  at : amOrkney could be set for a record-breaking cruise liner season.

Billed as a potential early title decider, the pulsating contest did not disappoint. Antoine Dupont’s superb try set the tone and French physicality, intensity and speed of ball was, at times, off the scale to the delight of a raucous Stade de France crowd. Fabien Galthie’s formidable hosts are on a steady upward curve and marching relentlessly towards next year’s home World Cup. They are now undoubtedly the team to beat as they attempt to end a -year wait for championship glory. vw,vw,px, px\"Marcus Smith scored the first of England’s tries in Rome Italy Under-s made history on Friday by defeating England for the first time. There was no such joy for their senior counterparts, whose inclusion in the Six Nations continues to be the subject of much scrutiny. The Azzurri have now lost a remarkable  championship matches in a row, dating back to . Eddie Jones’ much-changed England healed some wounds from their opening-day setback against Scotland but, in truth, a routine - win in Rome was entirely predictable. Following Saturday’s gripping drama in Cardf and Paris, too many matches involving the Italians are relative non-events.While France currently have the upper hand, the standings are nicely poised going into a two-week break. Only perennial wooden spoon winners Italy are out of title contention, with Ireland, England, Wales and Scotland each retaining hope of chasing down the pacesetters on the back of a win and defeat apiece. For all of Les Bleus’ early promise, their rivals can perhaps take some comfort from them having had the benefit of two home matches. In-form Ireland, in particular, should move forward full of confidence after continuing their progression under Andy Farrell by impressing in defeat in the French capital.Always great to travel down to Cardf.Thanks for a good, hard game @WelshRugbyUnion. All the best for the rest of the @SixNationsRugby.#AsOne pic gJglCy— Scottish RugbyFebruary , Scotland had everything going for them ahead of their trip to Wales, having claimed a stirring Calcutta Cup victory and facing a team dismantled by Ireland seven days earlier. The Scots had not won in Cardf since , yet they were clear favourites to pile more Six Nations misery on the defending champions. Gregor Townsend’s side, though, failed to nail key moments and fly-half Finn Russell’s yellow card  minutes from time cost them dearly. Two of their last three games are against France and Ireland, so they have now got it all to do in an attempt to stop their campaign from fizzling out.\"This is one of my best victories in a Welsh shirt!\" @WelshRugbyUnion captain Dan Biggar reacts to a huge win over Scotland #GuinnessSixNations #WALvSCO pic hVHXFLQj— Guinness Six NationsFebruary , They might have a combined age of , but Dan Biggar and Jonathan Davies proved once again their unremitting commitment to the cause. Both players celebrated th Test match appearances for Wales and the British and Irish Lions in style, with captain Biggar defying a knee issue to kick  points, including a match-winning drop-goal, and centre Davies making two critical late tackles after going on as a substitute when the Scots were pressing relentlessly. The next World Cup might be  months away, but expect both to be there – and still performing.We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

This falls in with ‘Candlemas’ on nd February as a Christian festival and a traditional end of the Christmas season. Candlemas commemorates the presentation of the infant Jesus at the Temple in Jerusalem as described in St Luke’s Gospel and when some denominations bring candles to their church. Candlemas is also one of the so-called ‘Quarter-days’ marking the changing seasons of winter, spring, summer and autumn. It is followed by Whitsun, Lammas Day and Martinmas as the term-days with their administrative and legal implications for the payment of rents and flittings. Saint Bride or Saint Bridget has been one of the most popular of the saints of the celtic church. Of course, there were many ‘Bridgets’, but the one whose festival date is on st February was ‘Bridget of Kildare’ in Leinster whose death was dated to AD . Bridget was one of the patron saints of Ireland and is remembered in the tradition of plaiting rush crosses around st February to set over doors and windows to protect the home from fire and other danger.   or the endearing ‘Bride’s little fosterling’.’ . ‘Bride’s Day, the birthday of spring’. century, traditions of Saint Bride were collected by Alexander Carmichael among his prayers, hymns, blessings and charms from the Hebrides. He suggests that accounts of Saint Bride were not easily recovered and summarised the tradition: ‘The serpent is supposed to emerge from its hollow among the hills on St Bride’s Day, and a propitiatory hymn was sung to it. Only one verse of this hymn has been obtained, apparently the first. It dfers in dferent localities: [Early on Bride’s mornThe serpent shall come from the hole, I shall not molest the serpent, Nor will the serpent molest me.’ The snake is a powerful element in mythology and religion and a creature to be respected as the ‘hymn’ makes clear. Familiar in the snake coiled round the rod, it is a symbol of medicine and healing, and the appearance of the adder or snake on Saint Bride’s Day offers a feeling of hope and transformation, and of turning the corner with the ening of the days. . century. .!... !"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Donnie-Munro-picture-scaled.jpg","title":"special donnie munro concert to bring skye live back with a","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe island#s premier music festival is set toin style on Thursday th May # following a two-year break due to the pandemic # with an opening night extravaganza # ‘Coming Home: An Evening with Donnie Munro and friends’ and featuring special guests in the form of multi-award-winning Gaelic supergroup Mànran.The show will be Donnie’s first in his hometown since  and will see him perform with a full eight-piece band line-up on the spectacular Skye Live Festival site at Am Meall in Portree. The singer said: #This offers me a fantastic opportunity to bring this amazing line-up, featuring some of Scotland’s top musicians together, for an exclusive performance to open this year’s Skye Live Festival.He added: #It has been fantastic to watch the festival grow in strength, year on year, in what must be one of the most special and unique festival locations anywhere in the world, and to see it become internationally recognised as, ‘one of the best boutique festivals in the country’, is just fantastic for the island, and it is such a great honour for me to be invited to be a part of it all and to be bringing the music back home here to where it all began.#Joining Donnie Munro on the night will be Mànran, internationally recognised as one of the most iconic and respected Scottish bands on the road today.

They would argue it could lead to a greater chance of a Border poll,” said the Whitehall source. The ERG, which has  Conservative Euro-sceptic MPs among its membership and helped to dispose of Theresa May as prime minister in , is now piling on the pressure on the DUP’s behalf.“The ERG was mostly against the Chequers Agreement in  and the DUP was vital in going along with that. The fact is, it did not turn out as was intended,” said a Tory party source.“There is a feeling that there is a bit of a debt to the DUP to sort this out — they helped us and have ended up in a pretty bad situation.”Invoking the Brexit clause would allow the DUP to show unionists — and especially the loyalists who threatened violence over the protocol — that it had pushed the prime minister to act. “Donaldson had no option but to quit the Executive, given the haemorrhaging of support for the Assembly among unionists. Number  promised for months to act, and the cavalry never arrived,” said the source. “Something has got to happen before the Assembly election. Otherwise you are going to end up with a Sinn Féin first minister and power-sharing not ing.”Both the ERG and DUP have also warned Johnson of a perceived threat to power-sharing, saying a Michelle O’Neill-led government “would damage the union and Northern Ireland”.The Conservative source explained ERG members meet Johnson regularly, and added it “would be a mistake to think the prime minister needs persuading on triggering Article ”.He said Northern Ireland Secretary of State Brandon Lewis has spent the last few days in Washington “paving the wave for Article  and negotiation” by “stressing a dferent Good Friday Agreement interpretation”.A UK government spokesperson confirmed Mr Lewis had met with members of the US administration and Congress for discussions “including on the Northern Ireland Protocol”. “Our preference is to find a consensual solution to address the signicant issues on the ground. However, as we have said consistently, we will use the Article  safeguard mechanismsolutions cannot be found,” said the spokesperson. Read MoreBrandon Lewis says there is ‘landing ground’ for solving NI Protocol problemsKill protocol or the Union is finished, TUV chief tells rallyForeign Secretary Liz Truss will talk with Vice President Maros Sefcovic to continue these discussions.It is understood that in the past week, DUP figures have complained to Conservatives that DUP MPs turn up to take part in debates and “get nothing” — while Sinn Féin does not take its seats and “yet the government uses Westminster to give them what they want, like the Irish Language Act”.However, a bone of contention is the DUP’s regular meetings with the Loyalist Communities Council , which represents the Ulster Defence Association , Ulster Volunteer Forceand Red Hand Commando — including one meeting just hours before it decided to quit the Executive. Some loyalist paramilitaries have endorsed violence on the streets of Northern Ireland in the past two years, with a number of incidents causing disruption and harm. That’s why the DUP and ERG believe Article  is key, as it can be triggered in the event the protocol is causing “serious economic, societal or environmental dficulties.”“There is almost an incentive to create disturbances, because it was the threat of disturbances that created it in the first place,” said an ERG source.This assertion has been backed up by a member of the UVF, who believes loyalist violence has “made people realise the threats were serious”.“Everyone thought it was all a bit of a joke, and then loyalists threatened bombs going off in Limerick and burnt a few buses. No one in loyalism has forgotten the role Dublin played in talking up IRA violence. Someone recently remarked that a loud bang in Dublin is perhaps necessary to make them hear,” he said.Johnson’s premiership is hanging by a thread after he broke Covid regulations by attending several lockdown parties, but he knowshe wants to remain in office, he will have to appease those who oppose the protocol.The ERG source says it is now liaising with the DUP as a “force multiplier” at Westminster, with Tory whips indicating they would like to be able to work with its nine MPs because “you never know when they might be needed again and the prime minister knows this”.Last week in a rare move, ERG members attended debates on Northern Ireland in the House of Commons. It was an apparent move to firm up the DUP’s support, but there are claims some of its pro-Brexit Tory backbenchers are simply “weaponising” the Stormont crisis.“In Number , they are keen that the DUP has a good showing in the election. But they need to have some sort of win before the Assembly election,” the source said. “At the momentis scheduling legislation on the Irish Language Act, which is fairly innocuous and would be a win for Sinn Féin. “There has to be something to balance it out — and the protocol is the obvious thing.” Former Brexit Minister David Jones, the deputy chairman of the ERG, said he shares the DUP’s “concerns about the damage the protocol is doing to the Good Friday Agreement”.He said the protocol requires a “permanent resolution” and criticised past comments on the issue by Tánaiste Leo Varadkar and Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney.“The Irish government needs to realise the immense ongoing damage being done to Northern Ireland and UK-Irish relations by the EU’s intransigence. The EU, Ireland and the UK need to sit down and discuss alternative ways to protect the EU’s single market,” Jones said.“If an agreement is not possible, then the UK will invoke Article  and legislate to remove the Irish Sea border, uphold the GFA and restore Northern Ireland’s equal position within the UK.”However, one Whitehall source said the plot by the ERG and the DUP “beggars belief”. “At a time of international crisis and need for a focus on the economic well-being of Northern Ireland’s citizens after the worst pandemic in recent history, it beggars belief that both the ERG and the DUP have been trying to take advantage of the PM’s weakened position, to avoid working on the compromises that are necessary.”Asked to explain the DUP’s relationship with the ERG, MLA Deborah Armstrong did not respond. Instead, she said her party has been “telling London, Dublin and Washington that the protocol is not supported by a single elected unionist”.“Progress is only made when deals have the support of unionists and nationalists.  “We will continue to make our case at Westminster and where — ultimately we will take that case to the people in the election.”Related topicsSir Jeffrey DonaldsonBoris JohnsonNI ProtocolMost ReadSuzanne BreenOpinionWhat a fool Ian Paisley has been… century after Carson and in midst of their Brexit betrayal, the penny finally drops over Tory infidelityGalway firm rides in to save Barry’s Amusements in PortrushLoyalist caught with Belfast bookies massacre gun has Stormont-funded jobIan Paisley ‘took most freebies of all Northern Ireland MPs’… DUP veteran accepted tickets to Open and British Grand PrixNewcastle penthouse on the market for £k takes luxury living to a new levelTop VideosPlayVideo: Surging waves at Benone Strand engulf cars and sweep pet baskets out to sea PlayBelfast man creates positive Covid test with fruit drinkPlayAssisi animal sanctuary ‘blown away’ by support after online dog fostering call following noise complaintLatest Northern IrelandKate reads encouraging tale from childhood for CBeebies Bedtime StoriesUK set to be battered by high winds as Met Office warns of mph gusts next weekWatch: Superbike champ Jonathan Rea pays visit to Hydebank Wood College for bike safety eventMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Covid cases by location and the seven-day rolling averageOisin Smyth explains why it was a ‘no brainer’ to reject Glentoran before move to Oxford UnitedLatestKate reads encouraging tale from childhood for CBeebies Bedtime StoriesCraig Dawson’s late strike salvages a point for West Ham at LeicesterUkraine turmoil could ‘kick off quite quickly’, says British student who fledCeltic see off Raith Rovers to reach Scottish Cup quarter-finalsSherlock co-creator Mark Gatiss hails ‘extraordinary legacy’ of Beryl Vertue,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Motorcycling is fantastic and enjoyed by so many, but it is important to know about the dangers, especially around off-road biking, so that it can be enjoyed safely.“To see such a commitment to motorcycling safety here in Hydebank is commendable. These young people have been provided with a safe environment where they can learn how to ride while being educated in motorcycle safety in a positive way.”Governor Richard Taylor added: “The whole idea of this programme in Hydebank is to ert young men away from crime around motorcycles.

We have to follow the example of St Patrick and bring the light to recallsothers.ldquoWe have to start again, bringing the light of Christ into our hearts, our families and into our homes. We all know these are days of darkness, we have been living through them, days of fear and anxiety. We need the joy of the gospel, the joy of Christ, joy brought to Ireland by St Patrick.Fr Alexander continued: ldquoEach of us has to ask ourselves, what am I going to do to bring the light of faith to others  Generations of our ancestors kept the faith alive. What are you going to do to keep the faith alive  Let us revive our faith and go forward with St Patrick.Archbishop Jude Thaddeus told the congregation that St Patrick was not sent by to Ireland ldquoby God by chance.ldquoHis mission in Ireland was a deliberate intention of God, he continued. ldquoWe can read this in St Patrickrsquos writings and from the example he left behind. When St Patrick wanted to come back to Ireland, there was a lot of opposition. In his time, there were many missionaries, including bishops and priests. We have hardly heard of many of these, but we all know about St Patrick. This is very striking. Why is it so ldquoSt Patrick did not speak much, he didnrsquot write much. Today there are too many words ndash words, words, words ndash written words, spoken words, words on the internet, words on the microphone, words on the streets and the market places. There are too many words, just one word is important ndash the Word of God. If we could just listen to even a single Word of God.Referring to the Gospel readings for the feast of Candlemas, the Papal Nuncio added: ldquoOur Lady did not say anything at the Presentation of Our Lord, she kept everything in her heart. In the entire Gospel. St Joseph speaks only two words. Sometimes we speak too many words and we lose orientation and get confused. Only one word is important ndash the Word of God ndash we should listen to the Word of God. St Patrick listened to the Word of God.Speaking afterwards of his visit, Archbishop Okolo said: ldquoIt was indeed nice and uplting, praying together on that holy ground, on which St Patrick trod.Next week, the All Ireland Novena journeys to Slane where St Patrick lit the Paschal fire.The Novena can be watched online at pm via the parish webcam..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9Feburary2020_Panto.jpg","title":"Children on stage for The Wizard of Oz show  ","story":"THE abundance of musical and dramatic talent at the Patrician Youth Centre in Downpatrick is back on show for the first time in almost two years.A young and enthusiastic cast presented the pantomime, The Wizard of Oz, last week.Performing Arts and live productions at the Patrician paused in March  with the onset of Covid- and ensuing pandemic.Determined to get going again, staff and members worked on Tom Whalleyrsquos new pantomime production of the very popular musical The Wizard of Oz.Despite many ongoing Covid disruptions were delighted to have a performance which was live streamed last week.Unfortunately, in the lead-up to the event some of the principal cast members were Covid isolating.On the day before the performance leading lady Shona Gardiner, who was to play Dorothy, tested positive.In true showbiz tradition, the show had to go on and a telephone call from a former Patrician member saved the day.Mairead OrsquoHare, who played Dorothy in the Patricianrsquos  production of the Wizard of Oz, volunteered to stand in to read the role and sing the ever-popular songs.

At present, we have too many boasts chasing too few fish, he remarked.Ironically, the situation has been partly caused by the fishermen catching too many prawns.Last monthrsquos good weather resulted in better-then-expected landing which further depressed the already-weakened market ndash prawn are currently selling at less than pound a stone, compared to pound a stone a year ago.However, the general recession in the economy has been the main stumbling block. As demand continues to drop, processors are keeping stocks in cold storage and are not in a position to buy additional supplies at the quayside.ldquoWe had good prices until last April. Then the market slumped and prices drop. Unfortunately, fishermanrsquos costs havenrsquot come down accordingly, Mr James said.Mr James said depression in other sectors of the industry has heightened the problem.He also believes the decommission scheme has the support of most trawler owners in Ardglass.ldquoWe are talking about the survival of the fleet as a whole. Decommissioning would help owners who are otherwise unable to get out of the industry.ldquoAnd because most of the boats are undermanned, it would to not lead to large scale redundancies among crewmen, he added.CROSSGAR ndash A Crossgar man who is renowned for his excellent time-keeping was honoured last week.Mr James McCormick, who has been winding the clock on the old Kilmore Parish Church Hall for over  years, has decided to hang up his key and retire from his conscientious job.James took over the job when the clock was repaired in  and has continued his labour of love ever since.Now the hall has been sold to the Ulster Wildle Trust for its new headquarters building, James has decided tocall it a day and has retired from his winding duties.In recognition of his timeless work over the years the development officer of the Wildle Trust, Mr Niall Timmins, presented Mr McCormick with a window box of herbs to remind him of his former winding le.STRANGFORD ndash The creation of a single committee to oversee the management of Strangford Lough has been widely welcomed.The Ulster Unionist MP for Strangford, Mr John Taylor, said the announcement represents a ldquomajor U-turn by the Government, while the Strangford Lough Nature Conservation Association described it as a ldquoserious attempt to ensure the future of the lough.The new committee is to be launched in the spring and will have a membership of around  drawn from special interest groups, such as agriculture, fishing, conservation and recreation.Member will also be appointed from nominations put forward by Down District and Ards Borough Councils, the National Trust and the Council for Nature Conservation and the Countryside.The announcement marks something of a turn-around by the Environment Minister, Mr Richard Needham, who less than six months ago proposed a two-tier management structure for the lough.The proposal was widely criticised by groups who argued that such a structure would be unwieldy and would prevent local people from having a proper influence over decision making.By scrapping that approach, Mr Needham appears to have bowed to local pressure. The Minister says the new initiative has been produced ldquofollowing extensive consultation with organisations and iniduals concerned with the future of Strangford Lough.SAINTFIELD ndash Work is to start next week leading to the provision of new traffic lights in Saintfield.The townrsquos Ulster Unionist councillor, Mr William Biggerstaff, said yesterday that preliminary work will begin on Monday for the provision of the lights at the main crossroads in the town.ldquoI welcome this commitment.

Fortunately for The Blues they had an able replacement in Christopher Magee.This early unsettlement, along with the travelling support, spurred the away side on and soon the league leaders were showing why they are just that.Gareth Keenan was denied a golden opportunity courtesy of a point blank save from Turley as Comber continued to apply pressure in the early stages. Kilmore responded well to this and remained calm on the ball.Following some quick passing from Matthew Stewart to team-mate Anton McGrattan, the Kilmore number ten played in strike partner Joe McKinney, who was adjudged to have been fouled in the danger area and won a penalty kick.Kilmorersquos McGrattan stepped up but his effort was fantastically saved by the outstretching Andrew Topping, who pushed the ball around the post and out for a corner to the frustration of the home fans.The resultant corner was headed over the Comber crossbar by Kilmore defender Jack Larkin as the away side relished in escaping potential punishment.The visitors went back in search of the opening goals immediately after, with Keenan again seeing his efforts thwarted by the Kilmore custodian.The game quickly developed into an end to end contest with chances coming thick and fast at both ends.Kilmorersquos McKinney saw his headed effort go wide with the goal seemingly gaping before his left footed effort blazed over the bar after he was neatly played through by McGrattan.Comberrsquos Brandon Nelson delivered an inviting corner to the head of team-mate Stuart Moore, although he failed to make the most of his chance.Despite the weather, things began heating up on the pitch with numerous crunching tackles on display.Kilmore captain, Niall McCarthy, escaped with just a warning following his high challenge on Comber winger Nelson although the visiting sidersquos Moore wasnrsquot as lucky after he was awarded a yellow for clattering substitute Magee.A new face was on show within the Kilmore ranks in the form of midfielder Barry Walsh. The former Killyleagh YC player impressed throughout his debut and controlled the middle of the park at ious stages throughout the game.With both the tempo and tensions high, the whistle sounded a full two minutes early to signal half-time.Comber kicked off after the interval but it was the hosts who would be awarded the first big chance of the half.Following a piercing run into the opposing defence, Kilmorersquos McKinney was brought down awarding team-mate McGrattan to test lsquokeeper Topping from  yards with the resultant free-kick.However, the Comber custodian wasnrsquot required to spring into action as the ball whisked past the wrong side of the upright.The visitors seemed to be pressed further back into their half and attempted to respond quickly.Dylan Wilson smartly dispatched of the ball on a quick counter-attack to team-mate and captain, Simon Hanna, although the number eight was halted in his tracks unfairly by Magee.For this, the Kilmore defender was the latest name to enter the refereersquos books. The home side had the advantage of the wind and decided to use this repeatedly through long ranged passes in hopes of manufacturing an attack.McKinney came close on a few occasions as he engaged in multiple footraces with Comberrsquos Reece Whittle, although often the home striker would stray onto the bounds of offside.Kilmore hit a purple patch in the opening quarter of the second half, with Comberrsquos first chance of the restart coming on the hour mark.Nelson was left unmarked at the back post after a ball was lofted into his path from skipper Hanna. However, he shanked his left-footed effort and allowed his Kilmore counterparts to remain unscathed.Despite this miss, Nelsonrsquos effort served as a reminder to the opposition that Comber was very much still a threat on the counter.The Kilmore support were up in arms minutes later when they thought a Comber hand was used to prevent a McGrattan strike from hitting its target, although these appeals were quickly shut down.Comber substitute, Ciaran Gillan, picked up a yellow card in his attempts to clear the ball from his half ndash much to the disagreement of his sidersquos management team.The visitors would be soon ruing more than a yellow card as the resultant free-kick proved costly on the  minute mark.A delicately placed McGrattan delivery floated into the path of captain McCarthy for the Kilmore skipper to head with conviction past Topping and finally open the scoring.Anton McGrattan picked up a rather needless yellow soon after for thumping the ball away amongst the celebrations as the atmosphere inside the park reached fever pitch.Comber defender Bradley Porter received a yellow card minutes later for his tackle on McKinney before the Kilmore striker suffered the same fate after he ended up on the ground in what the referee deemed as simulation.The trend of yellow cards continued with Comber captain Hanna, who landed his name in the book for exchanging some ill-advised words with the official ten minutes from full-time.As expected, the final minutes of the contest were a nervous affair for the home side, who werenrsquot committing as many bodies forward in hopes of securing a shutout.Naturally, this invited pressure from Comber, who desperately sought to spoil the Kilmore party.lsquoKeeper Turley kept his concentration for the full duration of the match and thwarted the last two efforts from Comber, with Wilson coming close before his team-mate Tumilson was denied dramatically in injury time.This signied the last piece of action as the referee brought his whistle to his lips to the relief of the Kilmore support.Following the conclusion goal scorer and man of the match, Niall McCarthy, gave his thoughts on his sidersquos impressive victory.ldquoIt was a battle, the pitch was very heavy and I think it just came down to who wanted it more, he said.ldquoWe knew with Comber coming down here that they are a very physical, very fit team, who are well-drilled.ldquoHowever, we firmly believe in our camp that we are the best team in the league.

Maisie McVeighwas taking no chances and after a short tussle, she shrugged off the rest of the field and ran solo to take the P girlsrsquo victory.Fiachna McAleenanalso showed his mettle leading home the P boys. This was raced over m.It was great to see the support for the younger ones, not just from parents but from older siblings and club mates, who ran along side each race yelling at the younger ones to encourage them to work hard right to the finish line.On more than one occasion there were groups breaching the line as an inseparable unit and joint times had to be awarded. This was exciting for spectators and a learning experience for the runners.In time they will develop the ability to pace over the course to keep their position but leave a little in the tank for a sprint finishrequired.The series is about participation as well as competition and all runners get a point for their club provided they finish the race.This helps to engender club spirit and creates a charged atmosphere.The post primary runners were well warmed up from their cheerleading efforts on the sideline so they were primed for racing when it was eventually their turn.In Years Eight, Nine and Ten, the girls outnumbered the boys in each category but by Year  plus, it was the reverse.Still, it was good to see healthy numbers out to take part overall in the post primary end of things.

Finnerty eventually notched the next score for his Galway outfit, before the goal scorer, Conroy, would kick over from distance ndash albeit with some wind assistance.The hosts seemed to fighting an uphill battle as the wind battered around Pairc Esler in favour of the visiting side, with Conroy once again managing to point from long range.This opened up a five point winning margin with the Mourne men desperately needing scores on the board.However, the weather could not be at fault for all of their shortcomings as they struggled with the impressive Galway forward line.Walsh was once again involved when he surged past the Down defence before setting up team-mate Owen Gallagher for an easy score.Cormac McCartan attempted to get the home side back into the contest with what seemed like an easy kick over from  metres, although the wind made sure the ball hung in the air before ping comfortably into the hands of Galway lsquokeeper Conor Flaherty.Downrsquos Andrew Gilmore did convert his point three minutes later but as per the theme of the match, Galway replied quickly through Tomo Culhane, who took the mark and scored at the other end.Galway introduced the ing Damien Comer to the fray and with his first touch of the ball he also took the mark and made no mistake with his chance to secure another point for the visitors.Walsh was relishing the blustery conditions and was firing from will at all angles, with one such effort sailing over the black spot from around  metres before the half-time whistle.This signied the last score of a half that contained very few positives for McCartanrsquos side.Half-time: Down - Galway -.The Mourne men registered the opening score of the second half, courtesy of a Barry OrsquoHagan free.Two minutes later, home supporters were perhaps left a little surprised when a goal opportunity presented itself but Cormac McCartan opted instead to play it safe and fire over the bar.Nevertheless, Down had scored two points answered and soon OrsquoHagan would ensure a third after he took the mark and converted the chance.OrsquoHagan continued his impressive start to the second half when he kicked over once again following a turnover in possession.It was now Galway who was struggling with the wind, with Kieran Molloy witnessing his straightforward point from  metres halted by the breeze.Passionate ranting from Down manager, James McCartan, saw him pick up a yellow after exchanging words with the fourth official but there was no denying his side at their tails up.A wide mark from Galwayrsquos Paul Kelly encouraged the hosts further but Gallagher eventually notched his sidersquos first point after the interval following twenty minutes of action.Despite all of Downrsquos hard work, the scoreboard still favoured the visitors by five points in what was a sobering reminder of the home outfitrsquos poor first half display.It didnrsquot help the hosts when Comer notched the next score before Walsh followed suit with a trio of converted frees.Galway attempted to inflict further damage at the death as Tony Gill barrelled down on goal, although he was dragged down before he could unleash his shot.Continuing his impressive kicking form from frees, Walsh once again converted to complete his sidersquos scoring.However, it would be Downrsquos Gilmore who would register the final score of the contest with the last kick of the game, as he curled his left-footed effort over the bar in added time.Following the final whistle, Down manager James McCartan reflected on his sidersquos performance.ldquoWe are disappointed, the game was closer than the six point margin but we lost it in the first half, he said.ldquoWe let Galway play and we werenrsquot putting bodies on the line. I challenged the guys at half-time and there was a big improvement in the first twenty minutes of the second half.ldquoGalway hit us on the break and they went and got a couple of late scores to put a bit of gloss on it. He added: ldquoIrsquom pleased with the second half performance but certainly not with the first.Looking forward to his sidersquos next match, where they face a tough battle away to Meath, the Down boss said: ldquoWersquoll try to get more men back on the field and we will train hard over the next week to try and improve.ldquoYou canrsquot just sit off for  minutes and expect to still be in games.Down: G McMahon, P Fegan, F McElroy, B McArdle R McCormack, N McParland, D OrsquoHagan A Doherty, O Murdock C Mooney, L Kerr, C McCartanB OrsquoHagan , K McKernan, A Gilmore .Subs: C Poland for D OrsquoHagan, P Havern for K McKernan, J McCartan for C Mooney, C Francis for R McCormick, T Close for N McParland.Yellow Card: J McCartanGalway: C Flaherty K Molloy, S Kelly , S McGrath D McHugh, J Daly, C McDaid P Kelly, M Tierney O Gallagher , R Finnerty , F OrsquoLaoi S Walsh , P Conroy , T Culhane .Subs: D Comerfor R Finnerty, P Kelly for F OrsquoLaoi, T Gill for C McDaid, C Sweeney for T Culhane, D Conneely for P Kelly..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9February2020_Poots.jpg","title":"Ministerial approval for  ambitious park proposal  ","story":"EXCITEMENT is building around the multi-million pound revamp of the stunningly picturesque Castlewellan Forest Park.Work is already underway on an ambitious scheme which will focus on a number of key areas as part of the major investment programme aimed at restoring the sprawling forest parkrsquos key heritage features to help maximise its tourism potential.The Heritage Lottery Fund has provided almost pound.m in assistance with the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairsand the EU weighing in with pound,.Construction work is well underway at the Bothy Yard in the forest park with other planned work including new landscape and drainage within The Grange courtyard, a new pedestrian path from the entrance gates to the main car park an a new vehicular road off Castle Avenue to the existing car park.There will also be a new traffic control barrier at Castle Avenue and caravan spaces will be relocated with the feature entrance gates at the Castle Avenue entrance restored, alongside the restoration of The Grange courtyard buildings and the reconstruction of a derelict building block.Funding from the government department and Newry, Mourne and Down Council is financing the restoration of the iconic th century greenhouse, reconstruction of the propagation house and cold frames.

In the opening  minutes a number of early misdemeanours from the travelling team in the tackle, at the breakdown and at scrum led to Friends dominating territory and possession as the game got up and running.Within this period the home team gathered up an eight-point lead through a well struck penalty following a Down High tackle and a quick tapped free kick on the Down five metre line after the front row had been judged to have pushed early in a scrum, which led to a try for the hosts. As the game moved into its middle stages, Down began to find their way back into the game with some eye catching counter attacks from their back three.Meanwhile half backs, George Thompson at scrum half and Ben Cassidy at out half, kicked well at key moments in spite of the wind, to capitalise on space left by Friends in their back field.Just before half time it was following one of these kicks that Down earned a penalty on the Friends ten metre line.Cassidy kicked to the corner and off the resulting line out Down mauled close to Friends line before Ryan Halpin saw an opportunity to barge over the whitewash for a well worked try.Cassidy then reduced arrears to one point with an accurate conversion.Down entered the second half confident with the strong wind now very much in their favour.Things didnrsquot always go their way with some periods when the green defence was severely tested.However, around ten minutes into the half Halpin found himself back on the scoresheet to give Down High the lead for the first time as he strode clear of the covering defence off a well-timed pass from rumbling front row forward, Mark Jackson. Cassidy added the two points to give Down a six-point margin in their favour.With ten minutes to go, Halpin played a key role Downrsquos crucial third try. Captain, Brett Kelly who had an excellent day both in attack and defence, laid the foundations for this score executing a pre-planned set piece play.Following this, George Thompson spotted an overlap on the blindside with Halpin ending up on the ball in a two versus one scenario with full back Alex Watson outside him space.The pass was timed superbly and Watson ed over in the corner for an unconverted try to take the score to -.To their credit, the home side didnrsquot accept that Downrsquos  point lead was a done deal and for the closing ten minutes, applied plenty of pressure.Indeed Friends crossed the line with one minute remaining on the clock for an unconverted try leaving a nervy finish for Down High as they sought to protect their six point lead.The restart offered some territorial respite and all in the travelling squad and those supporting them leapt high with joy when a Friends knock-on gave the referee the cue to blow the final whistle with time well past the  minute mark.Down High now face Sullivan Upper at home in the semi-finals on Saturday, February .

Many of the myths that were established over the five or six years since the referendum have been repeated.By Owen PolleySaturday, th February , : am  \"       \"  An anti-Brexit mock-up of Theresa May steering the good ship Brexit into an iceberg outside the Palace of Westminster Owen Polley argues that many people have misunderstood the reality of Mrs May’s Brexit dealLet’s look at some of the most popular and persistent.First, many people claimed again that an Irish Sea border became inevitable when the UK decided to leave the EU. They said that the protocol is the fault of Brexit supporters, including unionistswho voted for it. Pro-Union leavers should therefore ‘own’ the consequences of their decision and stop complaining.One problem with this logic is that the Republic’s government, under the then-taoiseach Enda Kenny, did not think that a sea border was inevitable in the months following the referendum.   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.In fact, Dublin officials began exploring how checks could take place on the land frontier between Northern Ireland and the south.They assumed, quite logically, that any hardening of the border would have to reflect an existing international boundary that had been established for over a century. It is the fact that this did not happen that is extraordinary and unprecedented.More importantly, from a political and moral perspective, unionists had every right to campaign for Brexit, without fear that Northern Ireland would subsequently be wrenched out of important aspects of the Union. Their place in the United Kingdom relies on the ‘principle of consent’, which is supposed to be a central tenet of the Belfast Agreement. Andthat principle means anything at all, voters in Northern Ireland would expect to take part in a nationwide referendum and have its outcome applied here on the same terms as voters where in the UK. You can understand why nationalist parties, that have never convincingly accepted that the principle of consent has consequences, would not grasp this argument. It is more disturbing when some self-declared unionists seem to share their outlook.During the EU referendum, pro-Union people took part in both the ‘remain’ and ‘leave’ campaigns. Afterwards, perfectly reasonably, they took dferent views about what kind of Brexit the UK should pursue.The one point of consensus should have been that any outcome must be UK wide and include Northern Ireland fully.Another piece of received wisdom, repeated constantly, is that the DUP insisted on a ‘hard Brexit’ and rejected every proposal that would have resulted in a ‘softer’ outcome.This is connected to the even more inaccurate claim that Theresa May’s ‘backstop’ deal would have prevented economic barriers between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.Admittedly, the DUP’s performance, in the wake of , has been distinctly unimpressive. It spurned the chance to play a constructive role in the UK government after the  election, preferring to boast that it had secured £ billion in funding. It endorsed the ‘joint report’ of December  that entrenched Theresa May’s ‘backstop’, after initially insisting on ineffective changes.And it eventually agreed to a regulatory border in the Irish Sea, before Boris Johnson signed his protocol.However, despite the impression given by MPs like Ian Paisley and Sammy Wilson, the DUP did not insist on a ‘hard Brexit’. The party’s only ‘red line’ was that any deal should treat Northern Ireland the same as the rest of the UK.Its Westminster leader at the time, Nigel Dodds, told the BBC’s Newsnight programme that, given a choice between protecting the Union and delivering Brexit, the DUP would choose the Union.The party rejected Theresa May’s Withdrawal Agreement because it treated Northern Ireland dferently. Yes, the former prime minister’s aim was to keep the whole UK tied closely to the EU’s single market and customs union which, in the short term, may have prevented disruption to GB-NI trade.But the whole point of the ‘backstop’ was thatthe rest of the UK erged from Brussels’ rules, Northern Ireland would remain tied to the single market and customs union. May was committed to a close relationship with the EU, but her government was hanging by a thread.Her agreement was likely to create every problem subsequently entrenched by the Protocol, as soon as a more eurosceptic administration took power in Westminster.In addition, it removed Northern Ireland officially from the UK’s customs regime and tied it to the EU set-up instead. For the casual observer, a lot of this detail was easy to miss. Consistently, the Westminster government played down problems involved in the withdrawal agreements championed first by Theresa May and then by Boris Johnson. It’s understandable that the DUP’s opponents, and particularly its unionist rivals, want to point out the party’s failures.On the pro-Union side, though, they should be careful to ensure that their criticisms are well-aimed and accurate.There is every danger that, otherwise, they might end up strengthening profoundly anti-unionist arguments and bolstering the position of those who are using Brexit as an excuse to weaken the Union.– Ben Lowry s next weekMore from the News Letter: WATCH – Bid to intimidate ‘orange scum’ out of mixed housing estate fails Click here – RUC ‘collusive’ findings: WATCH as DUP man denounces IRA while speaker Alex Maskey tries to rein him in for ‘going off-topic’——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

They say that the beach is a sand and shingle beach and has a reputation for being one of the cleanest in the region. There is a coastal walk, chance to go fishing, surfing and views of Tusker Rock.For those owners who may not yet have ventured to the beach with their pups or are concerned about behaviour while at the beach, Wood Green’s dog behaviour and training specialist, Wendy Kruger, has provided some tips to prepare your dog for the beach.• Ensure your dog’s microchip and collar tag details are up to date – just in case.• Get used to checking ground surface temperatures before you take your dog out, as dry sand can be too hot for dogs’ paws on sunny days. To check the ground temperature, place the back of your hand on the ground. If its too hot to hold comfortably for five seconds, it’s too hot for dogs’ paws..remove• Practise basic, reward-based training when out and about to help your dog to maintain focus and engagement on walks.• Recall is also an area that needs particular attention. Evenyour dog has a great recall at home, its not something that can be guaranteed in unfamiliar environments with exciting new distractions. Games with toys are a fantastic way to help your dog engage with you when there are other distractions around. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityBut, while the overall picture in regards to the potentially deadly virus is improving, a senior Welsh Government minister has issued a stark reminder that the virus remains at large in the community.Speaking at a government press conference instead of first minister Mark Drakeford – who is himself isolating having tested positive for covid - economy minister Vaughan Gething provided the nation with the latest rule changes.However, while he confirmed that the main omicron wave has passed, he also revealed that a sub iant of omicron, the BA. omicron iant, has been found in Wales.The minister revealed that as of today - Friday, February  -  cases of this iant, which is said to be an even more transmissible form of omicron, have been identied across Wales.And it is this particular sub iant which is thought to be the primary reason why Northern Ireland is currently seeing a much higher percentage of positive covid cases relative to its population size, than the other UK nations.Fortunately, while more transmissible, it is thought that omicron is a less severe strain of covid than previous waves, and as such, Wales is continuing with plans to scrap many restrictions which are currently in place – albeit not as drastically as England are slashing their measures at this time.What was said about the sub iant Mr Gething said: “Cases of this even more transmissible form of omicron have been identied in all parts of the UK, and to date, there have been  cases here in Wales.“We will of course continue to keep a very close eye on this emerging development.“The pandemic pressures on our hospitals remain constant.“There are just under , covid- related patients in hospitalat the moment.“And there are  people with covid- in intensive care.“Sickness and absence rates across the NHS have fallen from the peak last month but, workforce issues continue to have an impact on our health services, contributing to wider winter pressures.”.removeWhat are the latest rule changes coming into force From Friday, February , Covid passes will no longer be required to enter venues such as nightclubs, theatres and concert halls  in Wales – although inidual venues and events can continue to ask for themthey wish.What’s more, while face coverings will still be required for now, they will no longer be mandatory in indoor public places – apart from retail, public transport and health and care settings - from Monday, February .From there,the public health conditions continue to improve, the legal requirement to wear face coverings in all remaining settings could be lted by the end of March. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityBute Cottage Nursery is set to merge with Evenlode Primary under Vale of Glamorgan council plans opposed by hundreds.The council’s cabinet was urged to rethink the merger, with some councillors claiming not enough attention was given to a public consultation where most people opposed the plan.Cllr George Carroll, leader of the Conservative group on the Vale council, called in the merger decision to be looked at by the learning and culture scrutiny committee.He said: “That’s a clear and signicant majority of consultees who were opposed to this proposal. Insufficient consideration was made regarding those consultations responses.”The scrutiny committee, which met on Thursday, February , also heard from parents, governors and trade union representatives about their concerns over the merger.Richard Disley, chair of governors at Bute Cottage, said: “It’s been dficult to get our voices heard during this process. Our concerns have always been about the wellbeing of our staff. If the amalgamation happens, the current positions of the majority of nursery staff are only guaranteed for  months.“Long-serving permanent staff members who are in our current budget have job stability, will now only have guaranteed work for  months. Staff haven’t been offered any support from the local authority during this very stressful time.“Bute Cottage should be held up as an example of how things should be done, not merged into a primary school with the sole purpose of fitting into a – year model, for which there is no proof of improved outcomes for children. We have asked for evidence on a number of occasions but none has been forthcoming.”Kate Rees, a parent whose children went to Bute Cottage, said: “It was disappointing that there wasn’t more consideration for the issues we raised. Bute Cottage has its own headteacher, budget, governing body, and specialist staff. Those are the magic ingredients that come together to create the exceptional setting for education..remove“I have three children. All three of them were lucky enough to go to Bute Cottage, and they all attend Evenlode now, and Bute Cottage was just a really wonderful experience for them. I got to know that nursery really well. Because of that I’m absolutely passionate about the provision there.”Concerns over the merger include the possible relocation of the nursery to the Evenlode Primary School site, although this would be several years away and only a potential move and a change in the teaching style. The Vale council has said the merger would help provide continuity and stability for pupils to attend the same school from three to eleven years.Cllr Rhiannon Birch said the concerns were overblown and “disappointing”, and added high teaching standards would be kept after the merger.She said: “They will have the same staff, there will be the same guiding ethos, there will be the same standards of professionalism. To hear some of these speakers, you would think these children are going to be put in a field to poke each other with sticks, rather than having an education.“It’s very disappointing their lack of trust in teaching professionals who will continue to maintain high standards, to provide pastoral care, education and all the dferent aspects of nursery education. It seems to me incredible to believe that all of this should be going out of the window simply because we’re talking about the governing body.”Cllr Lis Burnett, cabinet member for education, said no changes to staff will be made as part of the merger, which would be restricted to how the school and nursery are governed.She said: “A consultation is not a referendum. It’s where we listen to views to see whether there’s any reason why the agreed policy … should not be applied. The nurseries would only be merged at a governance and leadership level, and there would be no change to where they’re operating. Those nurseries are not moving.“There will be no change to staffing or surroundings. There’s no reason to think that anything in terms of teaching and standards of learning in these schools will be altered in any way at all.”Asked about a potential future feasibility study into relocating the nursery next to Evenlode, she said: “Because you would want to see whether you have the best model, and whether it would be betterit were on one site. I’m on record as saying I don’t think it would be feasible.“But there were comments of people who don’t have cars, who live in the Evenlode catchment area, and actually walk from lower Penarth up to the nursery every day and back.“So you have to do a feasibility [study], to see whether or not that would work. But there is such a workload on the st Century Schools team, that unless it was prioritised, it would be a number of years before we could even look at it with the amount of other work.”If approved, the merger of the nursery and the primary school would take effect in September this year. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityCardf International Business Park would be built on farmland east of Cardf Airport in the Vale of Glamorgan.But the plans have attracted heavy criticism from campaigners and politicians fearing the impact on the environment of “concreting over” a working farm.Now Legal and General, the developer behind the scheme, has said the business park would create , jobs and attract £ million investment, boosting the local economy.Andrew McPhillips, Legal and General’s development director of strategic land and major projects, said: “This is a key project for Wales and we know it is important that we continue to communicate our plans to key stakeholders, the community and future partners.“Wales must be open for business for those who want to invest and consider investment in its future global economic development. The land has been allocated for planning within the enterprise zone for a number of years.”As well as building the -hectare business park, the plans involve giving  hectares of farmland to Vale of Glamorgan council, to massively extend the neighbouring Porthkerry Country Park. A corridor of land along Porthkerry Road would also be kept safeguarded, connecting the nearby railway line with Cardf Airport for a potential new train or tram service there.Mr McPhillips said: “We have already agreed the transfer of  hectares of land to the Vale of Glamorgan Council to form an extension to Porthkerry Country Park, for use by the community with added funding for environmental management.“This transfer will provide more public access with connection to the Wales Coastal Path, and access on foot from Porthkerry and Rhoose. From an environmental perspective, this transfer goes beyond mitigation and provides signicant bioersity net gain. There would also be . hectares of green space within the business park.”.removeThe business park would be built on Model Farm, off Port Road, which has been farmed by the Jenkins family for four generations. The family previously said they were “devastated” that they would have to leave the farm, but are hoping to continue their wildflower seed business.Legal and General bought the farm several years ago, and it was earmarked for a major building project in , as part of Vale of Glamorgan council’s local development plan. The site is also in one of eight enterprise zones in Wales, where the Welsh Government is focusing economic development and encouraging businesses to invest.Last summer the Vale council’s planning committee voted to grant permission for the business park at Model Farm. Campaigners then successfully applied for a judicial review, leading to the permission getting quashed. Now, another planning application has been sent to the council, and a public consultation on the plans is running until February .Then in the next few months, councillors on the planning committee will again be asked to vote on whether to approve permission for the business park. The last vote was split along party lines, with nine councillors voting in favour and eight against. With the upcoming local election in May, the political makeup of the committee could change, affecting the next vote.But in the meantime, Legal and General has released new estimates of how Cardf International Business Park could boost the local economy. With overall floorspace of the development covering , square metres, it’s expected the business park could provide space for , full-time employees.Gross value added, which measures local economic output, is expected to be a total of £ million, comprising £ million when the business park is operational and £ million during construction. Building the business park is expected to last a decade, creating  jobs.However, Maxine Levett, a campaigner with Vale Communities Unite, said several questions regarding the plans remain unanswered. She added the business park would be “detrimental” to the community and environment, and was unnecessary with several vacant brownfield sites nearby.She said: “This is a working farm helping feed the community and encouraging bioersity, when the Vale council has declared a climate emergency. The current land available at the Bro St Athans site shows there isn’t a requirement for this type of development, as there are thousands of square metres of brownfield sites waiting to be scooped up.“Who will finance the road works to accommodate the impact of potentially , extra vehicles from this site, on top of additional transport needs from recent residential buildings and the proposed development of Aberthaw power station “Bristol Airport has declared they are increasing their passengers to  million a year. This will greatly impact companies willing to fly out of Cardf Airport. And where is the funding coming from to provide a rail link to a planned transport hub “We will continue to fight this development as we feel it to be detrimental to the community, environment and unnecessary with Aberthaw, St Athan and other locations near to the M corridor better placed to meet employment needs, rather than a working farm.”Contrary to the views of campaigners and some local politicians, Legal and General has claimed it would preserve and enhance the environment. Plans include three kilometres of new hedgerows, and planting five acres of scrub and woodland, as well as extending Porthkerry Country Park.Mr McPhillips said: “Legal and General has been committed to Wales as a progressive investor and substantial employer for many years. This is a project which will increase economic growth and we will continue to pursue the planning viability sensitively with existing stakeholders.“Creating , jobs and investment of £ million must be seen as essential for the future of the Welsh economy, especially next to Cardf Airport. This investment in business infrastructure by Legal and General enhances the Welsh Government’s current major investment in Cardf Airport, a strategic gateway to facilitate international connectivity.” article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Eddie Jones’ much-changed England healed some wounds from their opening-day setback against Scotland but, in truth, a routine - win in Rome was entirely predictable. Following Saturday’s gripping drama in Cardf and Paris, too many matches involving the Italians are relative non-events.Five-horse raceWhile France currently have the upper hand, the standings are nicely poised going into a two-week break. Only perennial wooden spoon winners Italy are out of title contention, with Ireland, England, Wales and Scotland each retaining hope of chasing down the pacesetters on the back of a win and defeat apiece. For all of Les Bleus’ early promise, their rivals can perhaps take some comfort from them having had the benefit of two home matches.
