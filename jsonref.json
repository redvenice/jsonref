Even after her artistic talent was nurtured by Josef Albers following the war, it wasn’t until the 2000s that Asawa’s woven metal structures were acknowledged as masterpieces.

About 63,000 sq km of this land is Wilinggin country of the Ngarinyin people and their connection to country dates back 60,000 years.One of the first stops towards Wilinggin country passes the Queen Victoria Head – a rock formation bearing an uncanny resemblance to the famous monarch. While it’s a blunt reminder of colonialism, it’s also the gateway to an area that until very recently had far more dubious name – the King Leopold Ranges, named after the Belgian king responsible for grievous atrocities, brutal oppression and enslavement of African people.An estimated 10 to 15 million Congolese people died under his brutal regime. Leopold is a figure among many whose inappropriate immortalisation has been brought to the global stage by the Black Lives Matter movement.But after two years of work behind the scenes, traditional owner groups made some new headlines with a historic name change to the Wunaamin Miliwundi Ranges. It’s a hybrid name to represent both the Ngarinyin (Wunaamin) and Bunuba (Miliwundi) traditional names.Since then, another seven places in this conservation park have changed back to their Ngarinyin name.Since the Wanjina Wunggurr Wilinggin native title determination in 2004, the Ngarinyin people have made significant moves to empower their community and return to, and care for, country. One of the first things they set up after determination was an Indigenous ranger program: the Wunggurr Rangers.Ngarinyin man Robin Dann was one of the first rangers employed and is now head ranger, living on country in the Ngallagunda community, with his family. His younger brother Kane Nenowatt is more recent addition to the Wunggurr rangers while his wife, Tanya Spider, sits on the Wilinggin board of directors.Dann’s granddaughters Anastacia and Lizinta Jumburra provide boundless energy and infectious smiles, but they also represent a new generation for the community.“These changes are about time, mate, but we always kept the names when we worked on country anyway – they never went away. But this does give us recognition and that makes us proud,” Dann says.One of locations changed back to its traditional name is (the formerly named) Barker pool, now Dudungarri mindi. The name refers to the dreamtime story of the Wanjina spirit and the Yawarlngarri jirri (blue catfish) which live in this pool. This represents a rich and ancient history that Ngarinyin people hope to share with visitors alongside the staggering beauty of the region.For the Wilinggin Aboriginal Corporation, this moment also highlights the benefits surrounding native title. With it comes a genuine economy: employment and investment brought to the region by the people themselves. With a second ranger group on the way, the determination of the Ngarinyin people to stand on their own is a shining light in an uncertain world."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d0ce9436f5485befd45d0a3317ec0d5bdf7f2007/33_0_4632_2780/master/4632.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=450b6e53440d8391929ea76f6d61eff8","title":"bank of england britain isnt recovering","story":"The UK is performing better than expected. That was the message from the Bank of England’s governor, Andrew Bailey, following its latest review of the economy.It was a message he almost muttered under his breath, as if knowing that almost anyone listening would yell back: “Oh no it isn’t!”There is more tumbleweed blowing through city centre shopping districts than there are people queuing at the tills. And about 7 million people remain on furlough and in fear of losing their job when the £30bn job retention scheme subsidies come to an end in October.To infer from this that the economy is bubbling back to life would be highly misleading. When the public know of so many businesses and households struggling to cope, statements that seem to suggest the country is recovering from a record-breaking decline in GDP are like a bad joke.Officials at the Bank did not so much say the economy was bouncing back as embarrassedly admit that their own forecast back in May had been a little too gloomy about the short-term impact of coronavirus. In their poorly judged assessment three months ago, they sketched out a V-shaped recovery that also included an overly optimistic view of how the economy would recover next year. They admitted they were wrong about that, too.Following the recalibration of its analysis, the Bank now expects what most other forecasters have predicted. In summary, the economy is still heading for one of the worst downturns in the developed world and will take years to claw itself back to anything like the level of activity seen last year.The UK car industry is only crawling back from a disastrous first six months that saw it produce the lowest number of vehicles since 1954.So far, automotive firms have reported only about 11,000 job losses after much of the industry furloughed staff. The next few months are expected to be much uglier for job cuts.Some analysts believe that one in six of the 168,000 workers directly employed in vehicle manufacturing could lose their jobs by next year, and many more from the 823,000 employed across the whole sector as the UK’s largely foreign-owned car industry retrenches to home soil. Brexit will play a part in this too.What does the Bank have to say about the gloomier outlook? Dave Ramsden, a member of the nine-strong monetary policy committee (MPC) that Bailey chairs, said last week he would be prepared to vote for an extra stimulus package. This would be in addition to the £100bn the committee agreed in June, which took the overall level of quantitative easing (QE) to £745bn.Ramsden is the first Bank employee to say he is amenable to further action. Until now, that impetus has come from the external members of the MPC – the former City economist Michael Saunders and the academics Silvana Tenreyro and Jonathan Haskel. Bailey, his deputies Ben Broadbent and Jon Cunliffe, and chief economist Andy Haldane, have proved much more reticent. The fourth external MPC member, Gertjan Vlieghe, another former City economist, has been largely silent on the subject.So far, the central bank’s actions have mirrored the government’s need for extra borrowing. The Treasury has said it will borrow an extra £300bn this year, and, lo and behold, that is the total of extra lending from the Bank of England.This tactic means private-sector banks cannot lend to the government but must lend elsewhere: hopefully to good businesses temporarily damaged by recent events. To some extent, that is the point of QE. However, as if we had learned nothing from previous recoveries, high street banks will spurn requests from businesses for long-term loans, instead competing more intensely for mortgage customers, thereby boosting house prices.It’s not the banks’ fault it is in their DNA to lend to the safest and most profitable customers. They need guidance. If the Bank cannot provide a reliable guide to the economy, it can at least steer its QE funds in the right direction."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a3c1ea3f8cdc3726dbdb3eb48fe1b17646a62d0/0_48_2400_1440/master/2400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9565140ef84578427d96c4fc6262bddf","title":"bhp ethical investor divests bigger hole","story":"At this point in history, time does not appear to have been especially kind to the views of the famed economist Milton Friedman.He may be one of the few recipients of the Nobel memorial prize in economic sciences that non-dismal scientists can actually name (others might be Friedrich Hayek, Joseph Stiglitz, Paul Krugman and, ahem, President Josiah Bartlet from The West Wing) but one of his most famous ideas is looking somewhat dated.In 1970, Friedman memorably wrote in a New York Times article that businesses existed purely to make money for shareholders, and that executives drivelling on about being “socially responsible” were “preaching pure and unadulterated socialism”. It was powerful stuff, which basically set the tone for US capitalism for 50 years.But it seems slightly less powerful now. Almost exactly a year ago, some of the highest-paid executives on the planet appeared to ditch Friedman’s idea of shareholder primacy as they attempted to convince their publics that they thought customers, employees, suppliers and communities might matter a little bit too.And this week will see another small landmark for that resistance, with the full-year results of the major miner BHP.The event will be notable as it showcases the performance of a company that, despite being one of the largest on the London Stock Exchange, can no longer boast of having the UK’s largest pension fund on its shareholder register.The government-backed National Employment Savings Trust (Nest), which, with 9 million members, is the most popular pension fund in the country, is esting from fossil fuels in what climate campaigners have hailed as a landmark move for the industry.The self-imposed ban on holding such shares means that some of the world’s biggest mining companies, such as BHP, cannot be part of Nest’s future holdings, at least as long they derive profits from mining coal. This month, Nest sold its final BHP share.Friedman would have probably been pretty cross about all that, not least because what really got him grinding his teeth were business executives believing that they were “defending free enterprise” while also “promoting desirable ‘social’ ends”. Fifty years on, that is precisely what the promoters seem to be doing.Nest says that it is “looking purely at the investment case” and that “climate change risk is investment risk”, with shareholders possibly finding themselves stranded with assets that turn out to be worthless if they are reliant on burning fossil fuels. The Bank of England has said that as much as $20 trillion (£16tn) of assets could be wiped out by the climate crisis if it is not effectively addressed.Meanwhile, folk who like to study these things will tell you that there is no evidence that buying ethical shares makes any difference to financial performance. They point you to the FTSE4Good – the City’s version of an ethical index – which pretty well matches the returns of the FTSE All Share.And yet the ghost of Friedman might say this reasoning is flawed, and that they would be better to stick with the do-gooder argument. If you compare the performance of FTSE4Good with, say, BHP shares, it would not just be a grizzled old economist who’d prefer to have the miner’s stock in their pension pot.Equally, one might wonder if the FTSE4Good is really so angelic a punt. Its 13th most significant stock just happens to be, er … BHP."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3e0962a91f677c64569f2956e419ebf016cefc8d/0_73_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6535b730bf17c3dae91a13e680d001db","title":"debenhams hires restructuring firm hilco capital for potential liquidation","story":"Thousands of jobs under threat if attempts to sell historic department store failDebenhams’ owners have appointed restructuring experts to draw up plans for its potential liquidation in a move that could threaten thousands of jobs.Company bosses appointed Hilco Capital, a firm that specialises in helping to wind down distressed retail businesses, to work with them should attempts to sell the historic department store end in failure.It is understood Hilco’s appointment is part of a “contingency plan” and does not indicate that the 242-year-old retailer’s liquidation is more likely.The news comes after the business announced on Tuesday that it would cut a further 2,500 jobs, while taking “all necessary steps” to give the chain “every chance of a viable future”.M\u0026ampCo – 400 jobs5 August: M\u0026ampCo., the Renfrewshire-based clothing retailer, formerly known as Mackays, will close 47 of 215 stores.WH Smith – 1,500 jobs5 August: The chain, which sells products ranging from sandwiches to stationery, will cut jobs mainly in UK railway stations and airports.\u0026nbspPizza Express – 1,100 jobs4 August: The restaurant chain plans the closure of 70 restaurants as part of a rescue restructure deal.Dixons Carphone – 800 jobs4 August: Electronics retailer Dixons Carphone is cutting 800 managers in its stores as it continues to reduce costs.DW Sports – 1,700 jobs at risk3 August: DW Sports fell into administration, closing its retail website immediately and risking the closure of its 150 gyms and shops.Marks \u0026amp Spencer – 950 jobs20 July: The high street stalwart cuts management jobs in stores as well as head office roles related to property and store operations.Ted Baker – 500 jobs19 July: About 200 roles to go at the fashion retailer’s London headquarters, the Ugly Brown Building, and the remainder at stores.Azzurri – 1,200 jobs17 July: The owner of the Ask Italian and Zizzi pizza chains closes 75 restaurants and makes its Pod lunch business delivery onlyBurberry – 500 jobs worldwide15 July: Total includes 150 posts in UK head offices as luxury brand tries to slash costs by £55m after a slump in sales during the pandemic.John Lewis – 1,300 jobs9 July: John Lewis announced that it is planning to\u0026nbsppermanently close eight of its 50 stores, including full department stores in Birmingham and Watford, with the likely loss of 1,300 jobs.Celtic Manor – 450 jobs9 July: Bosses at the Celtic Collection in Newport, which staged golf\u0027s Ryder Cup in 2010 and the 2014 Nato Conference, said 450 of its 995 workers will lose their jobs.Pret a Manger – 1,000 jobs6 July: Pret a Manger is to\u0026nbsppermanently close 30 branches and could cut at least 1,000 jobs after suffering “significant operating losses” as a result of the Covid-19 lockdownCasual Dining Group – 1,900 jobs2 July: The owner of the Bella Italia, Café Rouge and Las Iguanas restaurant chains\u0026nbspcollapsed into administration, with the immediate loss of 1,900 jobs.

The streets would usually bustle with shoppers, workers and tourists, looking to spend their cash in the West End’s shops, restaurants and leisure attractions.But not this year. Vast swathes of the capital’s streets that once hummed with traffic and pedestrians lie quiet. On Friday morning just a scattering of shoppers were browsing the heavily discounted summer clothes and shoes inside department stores such as Debenhams, John Lewis and Selfridges on Oxford Street, usually Europe’s busiest shopping street.The picture is repeated in Birmingham, Manchester and other cities, as office workers and international travellers stay home, shoppers stay local and day-trippers escape to the country or the seaside.This is felt nowhere as acutely as in London’s West End, a district with relatively few residents and which the vast majority of people usually commute into on public transport.The Salisbury family from Abingdon, Oxfordshire, had ventured to the capital for a short city break to enjoy the tourist attractions without other tourists.Parents Helen and Warren had taken their daughters Jasmine, 10, and Beth, 13, to the Tower of London and London Zoo. Both, they said, were “very quiet”. Reassured by the presence of hand sanitiser stations they felt their visit was “a risk, but a considered one,” said Helen.“It’s the worst that I have ever seen,” said Jace Tyrrell, chief executive of NWEC, who has worked in the district for two decades.“In every boardroom decisions are being made,” said Tyrrell. “It’s weeks not months away as to which stores they’ll close, how many redundancies they will make and that’s why it is so fragile and precarious right now.”On Regent Street, two dancers performed routines to pop music, in a bid to draw shoppers into toy emporium Hamleys, but just a handful of customers browsed the seven storeys of toys and games.“When we came at Christmas, we couldn’t get in,” said Elisabeth Walmsley, 34, leaving the store with her husband, Craig, and 11-month-old daughter, Darcia, the proud owner of a new dinosaur toy.Stores in prime shopping locations demand high rents, and in normal times high business rates, which current sales levels don’t come close to covering.Waterstones briefly reopened its Covent Garden branch after lockdown, but “if you can’t cover the lighting (costs) you have to close again”, said Daunt, adding that the problems faced by London are replicated in other European capitals and US cities including New York and Los Angeles.“My real concern isn’t for my own business, even though we are working very hard for not a lot,” said Daunt. “Big chains can soak up most things but the little guy is what I worry about, smaller businesses.”Smaller business often depend on serving coffees to and dry cleaning shirts for the nation’s army of office workers.Only a third of UK office workers have gone back to their desks, according to research from US bank Morgan Stanley, a proportion which lags well behind other European nations.On Tottenham Court Road, many of the food outlets which would usually sell salads, soups and sandwiches to a throng of office workers haven’t yet reopened their doors.“Office workers are essential,” said Ros Morgan, chief executive of the Heart of London Business Alliance, which represents 500 retail, cultural and hospitality businesses between Leicester Square and Piccadilly, “I do worry about how long the West End can last without them. We are having conversations about how we can encourage employers to bring their workers back.”The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, who has hitherto encouraged Londoners to work from home and steer clear of public transport wherever possible, now considers continued working from home an “existential threat” to the city.Khan is calling for government support for city centres and has highlighted the importance of an improved test-and-trace system. He also wants an extension to the business rates holiday for the retail, leisure and hospitality sectors.Transport, however, remains a major hurdle for bringing visitors back to city centres. London’s tubes and buses are still relatively quiet, but many people equate public transport with being crammed cheek by jowl with strangers in a way that defies any sort of social distancing.Meanwhile, driving into central London comes at a cost of up to £27.50 a day, not including parking costs: at least £15 per day in congestion charge fees, and an additional £12.50 emissions charge for older, more polluting vehicles.In the meantime, until office workers return, there are very few overseas tourists, who usually account for half of the West End’s £10bn annual turnover, to plug the gap.“There are no customers and this is a big shop,” said Shafiq Ahmad, 26, gesturing out of the window of the Souvenirs \u0026amp Luggage store on Oxford Street, currently staffed by two people instead of the usual 12.“This shop depends on tourists,” said Ahmad. “At the moment we are running with zero to be honest.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b06577785c2d1a86d94db5bb4d4e13cab29ea23/0_286_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7feb51caed758da8cefe185b256e104f","title":"waitrose marks and spencer ocado switch food supermarkets","story":"The social media channels of online grocer Ocado are abuzz. Both Sharon and Natalie are exited about the prospect of being able to order Marks \u0026amp Spencer’s famous Percy Pig sweets from Ocado. Hayley, however, is decamping to waitrose, because she is not a fan of M\u0026ampS food and its “excess packaging”.The debate is raging because, after nearly two decades, Ocado has ditched Waitrose and done a deal to sell M\u0026ampS food instead. Shoppers are therefore weighing up the M\u0026ampS products already offered online as replacements for their Waitrose favourites before the switch on 1 September.And a battle is under way between these upmarket grocers for the weekly shopping of the nation’s most middle-class, foodie customers.These shoppers are voicing disappointment at the loss of Waitrose staples and specials – spinach falafels get special mention. But there is also excitement at the prospect of M\u0026ampS treats at Christmas, concern that its Sparks loyalty card won’t apply to Ocado, and dismay that “gin-in-a-tin” canned cocktails won’t be available online. One shopper has taken out a six-month pass to test out the M\u0026ampS-Ocado service, while Claire sums up the feeling of the sceptics: “I need convincing that it’s not going to be more expensive, to be honest.”Waitrose kicked off a social media marketing campaign last Friday, raising awareness of its exit from Ocado in a bid to persuade shoppers to jump ship to its own website. M\u0026ampS is preparing an ad campaign highlighting its quality and value for money.The stakes are high. M\u0026ampS has spent £750m on a half-share of Ocado’s retail arm, to which it will supply its groceries, in a deal viewed as a ballsy roll of the dice by chairman Archie Norman, who is attempting to turn the ailing retailer around.But after a bruising few months in lockdown, during which the shift to online has accelerated rapidly, attitudes have changed. “Archie has lucked out,” says one retail analyst. “A lot has changed and this now looks like quite a good deal.”M\u0026ampS’s absence from the fast-growing online market has long held it back, but that has never been truer than over the past few months, when there has been little interest in its posh sandwiches at city centre stores – and the group has been mostly excluded from a surge in home deliveries.“M\u0026ampS is getting access to an online platform at time when things have shifted so much,” says Andrew Porteous at HSBC. “It is now in a much better position than it would have been otherwise.”That growth leaves more room for both M\u0026ampS and Waitrose to pick up customers in an online market that’s now worth an additional £650m – and less need for “scorched earth” price cuts in an attempt to win over or keep shoppers.Stuart Machin, boss of M\u0026ampS’s food ision, says: “One thing we are not going to do is have a race to the bottom on price. Our challenge is to be the best we can be, and we have a multi-year transformational plan. M\u0026ampS is focused on delivering the right product at the right price for all our customers, and if we do that, and believe in what we are doing, I don’t need to get overly paranoid about people comparing.”He says the chain’s food prices have already come down by “a considerable amount” in the past two years as part of his plan to improve value and draw in more family shoppers. To avoid seeing shoppers quit as a result of “bill shock”, M\u0026ampS has tried to match or beat the price on the 4,000 Waitrose products currently stocked by Ocado.It is equally keen to stop desertions because favourite products suddenly disappear, so has produced near copies of particularly popular Waitrose items, including organic beef meatballs and a mushroom, feta and spinach pizza.But Machin says the majority of 750 new products developed for the Ocado launch are larger pack sizes – designed for family shoppers – and specialist items such as organics, where M\u0026ampS didn’t previously have the space or demand to build a full range. “Ocado gives M\u0026ampS the opportunity to do the range we wanted to do,” he says.M\u0026ampS will initially provide 6,000 product lines to Ocado, including homewares and some clothing items, such as socks and underwear, as well as its ready meals, groceries and fresh produce. Almost 5,000 lines are already available to order for delivery from 1 September.Porteous suggests that some Ocado waverers may already have jumped ship to other retailers, including Tesco and Sainsbury’s as well as Waitrose, pushed by a lack of available delivery slots during the pandemic. Winning these customers back could prove tricky.The staff-owned Waitrose supermarket, which is part of the struggling John Lewis group, is not taking this lying down. It has invested £100m in its online business in preparation for the switch, bringing in a new executive chef team and stepping up innovation on products. It has also opened a new distribution centre in Enfield, north London, that has helped it double online orders. A big-budget marketing campaign is also planned.Waitrose has brought in 5,000 new or reformulated products, representing nearly a third of the 14,000-17,000 own-label goods its sells under well-known brands including Duchy Organic, Essentials and No. 1, its premium range.So both sides are ready for the big switch on 1 September – shoppers just have to choose their delivery driver.Offering anything from family favourites such as spaghetti bolognese to tofu tagines and Japanese rice bowls, meal kits have enjoyed a sales surge during UK lockdown as wannabe chefs embrace the convenience of recipes and pre-measured ingredients delivered to their door.The subscription-based schemes have helped people struggling for mealtime inspiration when the enforced closure of restaurants and pubs left them trying to rustle up meals from scratch at home. HelloFresh, the first such service to launch in the UK – it’s now the largest in the world, operating in 12 countries – delivers about 6 million meals a month. It had already reported a strong increase in the first two months of this year, pre-Covid, compared with 2019.“Once the pandemic hit, we saw a surge in demand: weekly customer orders more than doubled, and we quickly scaled up our operations,” says a spokeswoman. “This was challenging, especially in the first few weeks, but we were able to control this quickly.”Since March, she adds, customers have been ordering more meals per delivery – many with servings for three or more people – as well as add-ons such as desserts. To cope with demand, the company is opening a second production facility in Nuneaton, creating new jobs and doubling current capacity.Of the other major players Gousto, launched in 2012, is now selling 5 million meals a month and sold more in the first six months of this year than in the whole of last year. It says lockdown has attracted new customers to the service, and that existing customers are buying more meals. It is planning to hire 1,000 new staff by 2022 – mainly in technology roles – to help meet the extra demand.In June it announced a high-profile partnership with influencer and self-styled “PE teacher to the nation” Joe Wicks – who is also an investor in the company – to develop a range of recipes using lean proteins and up to four of the recommended five daily portions of fruit and veg."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/54f652bfb09dbb82a0625eb039058807b14878b1/0_0_4905_3143/master/4905.jpg?width=940\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=e480bf30202560c9c070a55dc1530509 1880w","title":"jane birkin serge gainsbourg was never a boring genius","story":"In her new memoir, the actor and singer delves into decades of diaries addressed to a childhood toyJane Birkin began keeping a diary aged 11, with the entries addressed to her beloved stuffed toy Munkey. She was born in London her mother was an actor and her father a spy during the second world war. Birkin’s concerns, initially, were typically teenage – boarding school, boys – but quickly become more juicy: aged 18, she married the James Bond composer John Barry a year later, she appeared in Michelangelo Antonioni’s Blowup. In her 20s, she became involved (creatively and romantically) with the French musician Serge Gainsbourg and set out on a lifelong path of singing, acting, writing and being one of the most renowned muses of the 20th century and beyond. Now 73, she lives in Paris with her bulldog – regularly seeing her daughters Charlotte Gainsbourg and Lou Doillon, who are both actors and musicians her oldest daughter Kate Barry, a photographer, died in 2013. Munkey Diaries: 1957-1982 is published this month.Can you introduce Munkey?Ahhhh, I think my father’s brother won him in a raffle. It might have been at a pub. He was very jaunty with his beard and jockey cap, a rather gaudy character. And I adored him, so my Munkey became something that was a part of all our lives. My father had his pyjamas. Serge had a pair of his jeans. My daughters had capes that were made by my grandmother, therefore that counted as magical clothing because they were made before I was 14. I left my Munkey with my father or Serge when they had an operation. We never took an aeroplane without Munkey. We never took a train without Munkey.You have kept a diary for most of your life – what do you like about them?My parents gave me a diary, like lots of little girls. And I gave my girls diaries as well. I mean, I gave them secret diaries with padlocks, but in fact, mine were just exercise books. And it’s a rather good thing to keep, because you can have a good laugh later on about the tiny things that made you miserable.You were more inclined to record the bad things that happened?Well, I think that diaries are very unfair. Because one has a tendency of writing when you’re sad when you’re happy, you’ve got lots of better things to do. When I read them, I find myself extremely tiresome. It must have been such a drag for John Barry to come back home and there you’ve got this waif-like 17-year-old who is there running his bath, giving him his newspaper. When I look back at that I think: oh my god... I only saw my side of the story.Was it different with Serge Gainsbourg?I really came into my own with Serge because he did nothing all day long but think of jolly things to do with me. So I was extremely happy. He was as jealous as I was. And although now people consider him as really quite a genius in France, which indeed he was, he was never a boring genius. He never said: “Well, now I’m going to go up to work.” I never saw him work. No, when I did rather bad films, he had a tendency of writing his best stuff because he was pissed off that I was not there. He used to come on to all the film sets, then sit miserably in the hotel bedroom where he wrote The Man With the Cabbage Head or Melody Nelson. In that way it was a rather ideal 13 years.There’s a story in the book about how you threw yourself in the Seine after an argument with Gainsbourg. You describe him as a fan of “grand gestures” – would you say the same thing about yourself?As we were both plastered, the grand gestures came rather easily. Also, not being too stupid, I realised I’d done something so outrageous that I had to do something pretty enormous to win him back again.What did your daughters think of your diaries?Neither of them read them. Lou said in a rather frank interview she gave: “Who’d want to read their mother’s diary?” That said it all. Put me in my place.What book would you recommend for a young person?Well, I’d say they should discover Graham Greene. My favourite book is The Heart of the Matter, or Brighton Rock they should read Brighton Rock immediately.Didn’t you meet Greene?Yes, I did his play Carving a Statue when I was 17 and he was involved in the casting. He had an extraordinary face, his eyes were so blue, it was like looking straight through to a blue sky through a skull.• Munkey Diaries: 1957-1982 by Jane Birken is published by Weidenfeld \u0026amp Nicolson (£20).

They have also been spotted in large numbers along the Cornish coast.“They are very beautiful, with amazing markings, a whiteish jellyfish with black stripes running from the centre to the outside of their umbrella,” said Matt Slater of the Cornwall Wildlife Trust. “And really long tentacles, which can impart a sting. It hurts a bit but the pain dies off in about ten minutes.”At the other end of the country, swimmers off the Isle of Lewis have had to contend with a group of lion’s mane jellyfish, which have a very nasty sting. Arthur Conan Doyle wrote a Sherlock Holmes short story in which one was responsible for a mysterious death. “We would ask people to keep away from this type of jellyfish and not touch them,” the Stornaway coastguard said.Galway city council in Ireland issued a similar warning after the same species was spotted at Silverstrand beach. It advised swimmers to be extremely vigilant and to approach a lifeguard for assistance if stung.The common moon jellyfish has been abundant in Devon, while in north-east England Sunderland city council issued a warning to swimmers and dog walkers after large numbers of blue jellyfish washed up on Seaburn beach.Coral Smith, a marine education officer at Devon Wildlife Trust, said: “This year the compass jellies have been very big, up to their maximum of about 30 centimetres. That’s unusual.” She credits this to plentiful plankton and the warmer weather. “And nice calm waters means they stick around. They are not getting washed out to sea again.”Dr Victoria Hobson, a lecturer in marine ecology at Exeter University and a jellyfish expert, believes it is not an exceptional year for jellyfish blooms, but rather that the creatures are more visible.“The weather’s been really lovely and it’s been quite calm, so better to see them. It’s been gloriously warm, and they like to come up to bask nearer the surface,” she said. With furlough, and staycations, “more people are out on the water, so a lot more eyes looking”.Blooms come and go. One year one species will be abundant, the next another. “Blooms are caused by jelly fish polyps living on the sea bed feeding on plankton,” said Slater. “If there is plentiful food they will get fat and bud off into thousands of tiny baby jellyfish. You get huge swarms travelling and drifting in the ocean currents, and hoping they never end up on a beach.”The advice to swimmers who have been stung is to scrape off any remaining tentacles using something similar to a credit card, and not to rub the area. They should rinse it with warm sea water, but avoid fresh water because it can cause further irritation. They should also be alert to the possibility of anaphylactic shock.They should not urinate on the affected area. “That’s the old wives tale, but it doesn’t work for all jellyfish and it’s very embarrassing,” said Slater. “And if you’ve been stung by a portuguese man o’war it’s the worst thing you can do. It makes the pain ten times worse.”Though not a true jellyfish, the portuguese man o’war is sometimes found in UK waters in late summer and early summer. It has a sting powerful enough to kill fish and occasionally even humans."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cebec942dbc2928c4f5dc91fc7f69cae439112b9/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0a472e50990b597f1523311f37e1139c","title":"the edit kaftans in pictures","story":"Throw on a relaxed and stylish kaftan in a bold print or a classic stripe for a chilled day at the beach – or just for garden cocktails...

And then Sterling lifted high, the ball disappearing into what felt like an abyss and his team’s hopes following into it when Lyon went straight up to the other end to seal their first semi-final appearance in 10 years.Houssem Aouar’s shot was tame but Ederson was about to show that City’s inability to focus at the crucial points was not restricted to Sterling. The goalkeeper merely patted the ball back and Moussa Dembélé, the Lyon substitute, gobbled up the rebound.It was the final act of a helter-skelter finale, which Dembélé had sparked by putting Lyon 2-1 up. Just before that point, with Kevin De Bruyne having cancelled out Maxwel Cornet’s first-half opener, City had looked set fair to progress. Belatedly, they had found momentum.Yet the tie turned sharply on Dembélé’s first goal, which appeared to unfold in slow motion. Aouar played a pass through for Karl Toko Ekambi, who was clearly offside, and everyone seemed to hesitate. Everyone apart from Dembélé, who charged on to the ball from deep to shoot underneath Ederson. There would be a VAR check for a possible foul by Dembélé on Aymeric Laporte in the buildup but he was given the benefit of the doubt.For City, this was a fresh take on a plot-line that is as frustrating as it is established. There was looseness at the back and profligacy up front but the overall feeling that they did not click for enough of a top-level Champions League tie.Guardiola has to take some of the responsibility. He sprang a surprise with his starting 3-4-2-1 formation, which featured Eric García in the centre of the backline and Ilkay Gündogan roaming from a position alongside Rodri in central midfield. It did not work, despite Sterling threatening with his movement, and the service to Jesus was poor. City only looked like rescuing the game when Guardiola introduced Riyad Mahrez for Fernandinho and switched to 4‑2‑3-1, with De Bruyne in the No 10 role.City were hoping to reach only a second Champions League semi-final and, for Guardiola, it was an opportunity to improve on a series of misses with the club, namely one last 16 exit and two in the quarter-finals. The wider narrative took in his quest to lift the trophy for the first time since 2011 with Barcelona.City were red-hot favourites against a Lyon team that finished seventh in Ligue 1 and have endured a season scarred by supporter anger. When they sacked Sylvinho as the manager in October, it is fair to say that Rudi Garcia was an unpopular replacement. His ex-Marseille status saw to that. In February, with some fans depicting him as a clown on social media, the club made headlines by calling them out over it. What a strange episode that was but how Garcia has used the Champions League for succour.The away-goals victory against Juventus in the last 16 was a stunning result and this was from the next level. Lyon can now look forward to a last-four meeting with Bayern Munich and, if they will again start as the underdogs, they will not care.Garcia’s 3-5-2 system is designed to be compact but Lyon showed themselves to be more than capable of intricate movement, of fizzing the ball about with no little slickness. They craved a break, something to hold onto and, when they got it midway through the first half, nobody could say that it had not been advertised.Fernando Marçal had blasted at Ederson from outside the area after a half-cleared corner and Léo Dubois missed a cut-back when well-placed before Marçal played a ball over the top for Ekambi.Ederson raced off his line to address the danger and it was a decision he would regret. García stretched into a tackle on Ekambi but, when the ball broke for Cornet, Ederson was exposed. Cornet knew what he had to do – bend a shot for the near corner from distance, starting it outside the post to take out the back-pedalling Ederson. He executed the skill perfectly and Lyon’s hopes surged.Since first qualifying for the 2011-12 Champions League, Manchester City have played in nine straight editions - reaching just one semi-final and racking up plenty of painful defeats along the wayIn their first two campaigns under Roberto Mancini, City fail to get out of the groups. In 2010-11 they claim 10 points but are pipped by Napoli the following season they fail to win a game against Real Madrid, Dortmund or AjaxCity\u0027s first knockout tie comes against Barcelona, who beat Manuel Pellegrini\u0027s side in both last-16 legs.

Going through as runner-up, they face surprise package Monaco. After winning a thrilling first leg 5-3, they lose 3-1 in the Principality to crash out on away goalsCity are among the favourites in 2017-18 but are blitzed by Liverpool at Anfield, going on to lose the tie 5-1 on aggregate. The following year, Spurs stand in their way. After losing the first leg, they go out on away goals after Raheem Sterling\u0027s last-gasp winner is ruled out by VAR. It is City\u0027s most painful Champions League exit ... for a year, anyway.Niall McVeighCity made inroads up the inside left channel in the first half, with João Cancelo and Sterling prominent, and they worked up something of a head of steam before the break. Sterling cut back for Rodri who worked Anthony Lopes and Sterling himself was denied by a saving Cornet challenge after a lovely De Bruyne pass. City could also point to the moment when Lopes flapped at a Cancelo cross before redeeming himself but they knew they had to do more.City looked more threatening after Guardiola’s change of system, with De Bruyne growing in influence. He made his side-foot finish look easy after Sterling had beaten Jason Denayer to cut back and City were primed for the kill. Jesus cut inside to work Lopes before he fluffed a volley from Sterling’s cross. Then came the unravelling."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f848dbc95429217cd46da5a78a952e1e06a911e4/0_49_3188_1913/master/3188.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d69b94d4ad2142d1a328872494795f54","title":"why did pep guardiola suck the joy and freedom out of manchester city","story":"Bernardo and David Silva, Riyad Mahrez and Phil Foden started on the bench as City’s manager tried to play rope-a-dopeYou failed. No matter. Fail again. Fail in pretty much exactly the same way.How many times, Pep, how many times? The idea that Pep Guardiola over‑complicates knockout games has become such a truism it seems impossible a manager of such clarity of thought could still be following that pattern still finding ways to insert his own anxieties,his maniacal intellectualism into the fine details of elite knockout football.And yet, here we are once again. Hello tactical confusion my old friend. On a thrilling, frantic night in Lisbon Pep Guardiola picked a Manchester City team to play an entirely un-Manchester City game, straight-jacketing this pass-and-move machine into a strangely muted shape, apparently with the aim of mirroring the three-man defence of Olympique Lyonnais, the seventh best team in France.To put this in its simplest form: by the 50th minute in the Estádio José Alvalade, João Cancelo, Kyle Walker, Rodri, Fernandinho and Ilkay Gündogan had touched the ball 288 times. Riyad Mahrez, Bernardo Silva, Phil Foden and David Silva had touched the ball zero times. And City had spent more than half of this eventual 3-1 defeat crouched behind a mannered defensive guard.Kyle Walker as a bespoke man-marking wing-back-cum creative overlapper? Is this really a good idea right now? Certainly Walker gave it a go, haring up and down, whirling into unmapped spaces, a man doing an impressively intense free-running parkour circuit while all around him a Champions League tie was taking place. Elsewhere, the manager who loves midfielders gave us surely one of the drabbest midfields of his entire career.For 60 minutes City shuttled from side to side. Kevin De Bruyne, the great creative talent of the Premier League, struggled to find space. Why do this? Why suck out the joy and the freedom just when it was needed most? For these players it must have felt like being invited to perform your triumphant new No 1 hit single, and deciding en route to the studios to go with the 10-minute jazz odyssey instead. We came in search of that sublime expressive entity of the last two years. Instead we got an hour of nose flute and drum solos.Guardiola was predictably unpredictable from the start, opting for a back three, with his squad’s three main holding midfielders starting either in or in front of the defence. No doubt City were concerned about Lyon’s mobility in midfield and their intelligent forward surges. In the event they forgot to bring their own quiver of arrows, as for 20 minutes the team that always goes forward barely mustered an attack.Then Lyon scored. It came from a knot in that City backline, as Walker lingered in an empty space, playing Karl Toko Ekambi onside. A saving tackle sent the loose ball towards Maxwel Cornet, who finished brilliantly.City’s players worked hard. De Bruyne was prominent, albeit strapped into a stilted system. On his touchline Rudi Garcia looked puzzled, man trying not to make too much noise for fear of breaking the spell. For an hour his team had been asked to do nothing different, to perform only within their comfort zone. When, you wondered, would Garcia be forced into some uncomfortable contortion by the super-brain in the opposite corner? What was this? A rope-a-dope?Eventually Mahrez came on for Fernandinho and an equaliser was a more familiar kind of City moment. Mahrez eased Raheem Sterling in down the left. His fine pullback was struck firmly into the corner by De Bruyne.And yet from there it was Garcia who won the in-game flow of move and counter-move, bringing on Moussa Dembélé and pressing his team forward when they might have been swamped.There were some details that could have changed the narrative. Lyon’s second goal was, arguably, awarded within the rules. But it still stank. First Ekambi received a pass from Houssem Aouar in an offside position. He jumped over the ball, which counts as a non-involvement, a point of view that confounds any kind of good sense. In the meantime Aymeric Laporte was sent sprawling by a collision with Dembélé, who ran on and scored. No foul was given.Then, with four minutes left, Sterling missed an extraordinary open goal from eight yards out with the tie there to be revived. Within a minute it was decisively dead as Dembélé tapped home at the other end.Afterwards Guardiola seemed a little vague, perhaps even a tiny bit relieved to escape this weird, distended season. Either way, defeat makes it three in four quarter-finals for City, and a decade without a Champions League final for the most revered club coach of the age. Perhaps one of these days Guardiola will overthink a European knockout game so hard that he’ll accidentally play his normal team and win it. The great shame is that City exited without having ever quite been themselves, and without ever expressing their finer qualities. And once again Guardiola had blinked with the line in sight."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/22c6778ad29634b4d47d29d96067fd5308be65a4/0_1284_4053_2432/master/4053.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cfd4f2b24a590e35b33458140ee3e38a","title":"mexican wave a brutalist shrine to hand crafted design","story":"This striking concrete house in Mexico City is full of local artists’ furniture and artworkWhat does a house from the future look like? The Mexican sculptor and architect Pedro Reyes thought long and hard about what it means to build a house in the 21st century, away from a canon of modernity, classical styles and fleeting trends. He and his wife, fashion designer Carla Fernández, also wanted to avoid the usual type of architecture you find in Mexico, because “so much of it ends up looking the same”.The result is this “future cave” – an amalgam of modern and ancient, where brutalist architecture is made from concrete in varying degrees of coarseness and yet the human hand, visible in layers of centuries-old, artisanal craft – furniture, artwork – is also evident. Minimal this is not.“We like brutalism, but it is not minimalist,” says Reyes, on a Zoom call. “Some people might think our home appears cold in photos, but it is actually very warm and that warmth comes from the fact that everything is handmade, even if it is concrete,” adds Fernández. The couple share the home with their teenage children, Cristobal and Laima.The use of materials and the choice of the craftspeople was important in trying to recreate the feel of pre-colonial Mexico. “Stone-carving here is a tradition that dates back 5,000 years, but it stopped at the time of the conquest,” explains Reyes. The couple chose to build their home, along with a sculpture garden and Reyes’ studio, on a plot of land in Coyoacán. It’s a neighbourhood south of Mexico City that was once home to Frida Kahlo.Working with artisans was central to the build, once the couple realised that fashionable midcentury furniture – “the sort by Jean Prouvé or Mies van der Rohe – was not a good fit”. Instead, Reyes made his own. “We don’t own many things that are mass-produced. Every object around us tells us a story about the person who made it.”Reyes reels off a list of first-name local artisans. “Alfredo, Abraham, Leonel, Antonio, Humberto… It’s the style of furniture that has been around for centuries. We were very interested in making things that keep trades alive, such as stone carving or weaving, or using natural dyes.”In many ways, this echoes the sustainable clothes Fernández designs – traditional clothes produced in a contemporary way, using an idiosyncratic colour palette.The main part of the house features crazy-paving floors. Cantilevered steps lead up to a narrow gallery that overlooks the sitting room, a double-height living space filled with sculpture and mismatched furniture on a raised platform. The focal point, however, is the library. Made from slabs of concrete, it is filled with books as far as the eye can see. “The use of concrete allows you to have many textures,” says Reyes. “You can polish it to give you a mirror effect or it can be hammered or chiselled, like in the Barbican in London. We wanted a main space that could be a library for us – it’s a tool we use all the time and the projects we get involved in require a lot of research.” The couple have also opened their library up to the public (@tlacuilobiblioteca). During lockdown books are being left by the door or otherwise sent by courier.“The library is very much the heart of our house,” adds Fernández. “It is where we prepare for an exhibition or a party, and what is great is that while it’s a big space, it gets used a lot. It’s even quite chaotic at times. My son does his homework here, and, during lockdown, we’ve used it for yoga when we couldn’t get out to exercise. It’s very much a shared space. I will come back from work and someone is browsing a book or coming in from Pedro’s studio.”The kitchen and dining room are on the ground floor and upstairs are four bedrooms and a bathroom. The bathtub is hewn from stone to resemble a rock pool, and set below a shaft of light. Reyes thinks that the many shades of grey are a good backdrop for highlighting other colours. “We like that feel of being in a cave – the shadow and the light somehow become more dramatic.”The light, he explains, is also their heating system. The skylight collects heat during the day and keeps the house warm at night. “We never need heating, and if it gets too warm during the day we open the windows, which means we don’t need cooling either. So light, heat and temperature work together.”Reyes’ work (mostly large-scale projects) has won international attention for addressing social and political issues and inciting change through sculpture, performance and video.He once observed that music is the highest form of communication, so how does he feel his house translates lyrically? What sort of composer parlays the spirit of his home? Reyes stops and thinks. The answer is a little-known composer of modern music from the 20th century named Conlon Nancarrow. He is best remembered for being one of the first composers to use auto-playing musical instruments, realising their potential to play beyond a human’s ability. It’s something that crops up in Reyes’ compelling Disarm video, where he employs dismantled guns and transforms them into percussion instruments.Fernández prefers silence. “We have birds in the garden and we have crickets, which I love to listen to as they remind me of being in the jungle. And yet, I can also hear the sound of firecrackers, which reminds me I am still living in the middle of a city.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1b1098cd82ffb013c6caa1f64f6d2fc2f7eddaa5/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f65be1220286d97b47943b124bbae363","title":"rutger bregman what if we give children the freedom to play and learn on their own","story":"A school with no classrooms, homework or grades encourages creativity and imagination, rather than an ability to sit still and nod• Time to reset: more brilliant ideas to remake the worldIn many places around the world, education has become something to be endured. A new generation is learning to run a rat race where the main metrics of success are your résumé and your pay cheque – a generation less inclined to colour outside the lines, less inclined to dream or to dare, to fantasise or explore.Can schools operate on a wholly different view of human nature? What if we give children much more freedom to play and learn on their own?The thing that moved me the most while I was researching my latest book was visiting such a school in the Netherlands. This school, Agora, relies on the intrinsic motivation of the children. There are no classes or classrooms, no homework or grades, no tests, no timetables. There is almost no hierarchy within the staff. Often, there is no hierarchy at all – the students are the ones in charge.At Agora, children of all ages, academic levels and socioeconomic backgrounds are mixed together. Difference is perceived as normal, and what I quickly noticed was the lack of bullying. Bullying is often regarded as part and parcel of being a kid. Not so, say sociologists, who have compiled extensive research on the places where it is endemic, such as British boarding schools (the kind that inspired William Golding’s Lord Of The Flies). And little wonder: these schools resemble prisons. You can’t leave, you have to earn a place in a rigid hierarchy, and there’s a strict ision between pupils and staff. At the moment, we spend billions encouraging our biggest talents to rise up the career ladder, but once at the top they often ask themselves what it’s all for. Recent research in 47 developed countries found that a quarter of workers doubt the importance of their work. Most of these “meaningless jobs” are in the private sector – in banks, ad agencies and law firms. Meanwhile, politicians tell us we need to be more educated, earn more money and bring the economy more “growth”.But what do all those degrees really represent? Are they proof of creativity and imagination, or of an ability to sit still and nod? It’s like the philosopher Ivan Illich said decades ago: “School is the advertising agency which makes you believe that you need the society as it is.”Schools like Agora prove there is a different way. The question is not: can our kids handle the freedom? The question is: do we have the courage to give it to them?• Rutger Bregman is the author of Humankind: A Hopeful History (Bloomsbury)"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c3edefcb0d225c27eaca07eacedd10f979a9346a/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c3c9bfe4741e1b259198e7466f81ac8c","title":"sharmaine lovegrove you must spend a year in a bookshop before you get a job in publishing","story":"Seeing unexpected pairings of readers and books quickly dispels the idea of who reads what• Time to reset: more brilliant ideas to remake the worldI have a party trick. If you name three books you like and two you hate, I can write you a reading list of 10 books you will love.I’ve gained this skill from two decades as a bookseller. Many questioned if I could become a publisher and run an imprint, as I hadn’t worked in-house. But I’ve worked in retailers from Foyles to the London Review Bookshop, from a bookstall under Waterloo Bridge in London to Waterstones in Edinburgh. And I’ve run my own bookshop in Berlin for seven years – yet my experience wasn’t valued by the publishing industry.I’ve long been shocked at the disconnect between publishers and bookshops. The industry’s sole aim is to connect authors to readers by producing books from manuscripts. For many years this activity has been carried out by a small section of society for an even smaller subset of our nation.If more people in publishing had worked in bookshops, it would radically change what stories are told. Seeing unexpected pairings of readers and books quickly dispels the idea of who reads what, why, how and when. Once the assumptions are gone, it opens up many different narratives to the widest range of readers.Seeing the transformative experience of reading on customers’ faces is magic. Hearing people relay when they hated a book is fascinating. Advising people to read a book knowing it will take them away from family, friends and their screens teaches you the value of storytelling. The real joy is when they come back and tell you about something you didn’t like, but they loved – that is doing your job.In Germany, you need to do seven years’ apprenticeship to become a bookseller. I believe you must spend a year serving customers and readers by working in a bookshop and a library before you get a job in a publishing house.

Experts share their advice for all agesUncertainty, confusion, fear: we’ve known all these and more, in bucketloads, since March. But how have our children fared? What are the long-term effects of Covid-19 on them, and how can we help them navigate it all, whatever their age?According to the experts, kids are resilient, and while we won’t know for a long time how affected they’ve been by the pandemic, they are wired to cope. However, children who have already experienced difficulties, especially mental health issues, are at particular risk. Just as important is your own mental health, which will have a huge effect on how your child deals with what’s happening, so don’t forget to look after your own needs, and to seek help – from friends, your GP, a therapist – if you’re finding it tough.Be centred on – and guided by – your child. Each one is different, and each child’s reaction to the pandemic is different. Start with them, rather than with what’s happening out there in the big world. Here’s our stage-by-stage guide.The pandemic hasn’t led to a baby boom, but babies are still being born. Covid-19 will probably mean you’ll want to limit your visitors, and some new parents may well be working from home after parental leave. “It all adds up to a lot more time together, just the three of you (or more if you’ve got older kids),” says NHS midwife Alexandra Walker, who co-runs an antenatal education service called The Naked Midwives. “So there’s not the pressure to have the house tidy for guests, or to have to look good yourself. If you like it that way, do what a pair of new parents we know did last week and put a polite notice on your door to say you’re not available just at the moment. You can capitalise on that time together getting to know the new baby, and not having to listen to lots of well-meaning but often conflicting advice.”You may be worried about the impact on your young baby of not being able to socialise but according to consultant clinical psychologist Emma Citron, that’s unlikely to cause problems. “It’s very important for babies to have contact with people, but it doesn’t matter if they don’t have contact with other babies,” she says. “Developmentally and emotionally, it won’t harm them. What is detrimental to their psychological health, though, is their parents being stressed and under pressure, or shouting at one another because they’ve been cooped up in a flat with no garden.”The same goes for toddlers and pre-schoolers, she says. “The vast majority of very young children will be absolutely fine. Under-twos are extremely resilient and are highly unlikely to have any memories of this time when they’re older. Also, the current reality is all they know. They live in the present, so they can adapt easily to change.”“Let’s face it: it’s not the toddler who desperately needs to see a variety of friendly faces, it’s the parents and siblings, many of whom really suffered because of the isolation of lockdown,” says Justine Roberts, founder and CEO of Mumsnet. So take advantage of the growing opportunities to socialise, albeit carefully, with picnics in the park and meet-ups in outdoor spaces.If you’re overly anxious about the pandemic, your child is undoubtedly going to pick up on that and become anxious in turn – so it’s vital, says Citron, to address your own stress if it’s getting out of hand. “If you’re worrying unduly about the impact of Covid, you need to address that so you’re in a better place for your children,” she says. “Talk to people who can help, and your GP.”Children over the age of three know something very strange has been going on – and they may be worried. Be alert for the signs, which can include sleep disturbances, clinginess, bedwetting, nervous twitches and excessive handwashing. If you see these changes in your child’s behaviour, go out of your way to reassure them.Don’t let fear dominate, Citron says – and let your child lead on any worries rather than imposing your own. “So, for example, don’t spend all the time leaping in with warnings – ‘Don’t touch those railings!’ ‘You’re going too close to that man!’ Instead, say something like, ‘Remember, we’re meant to be keeping social distancing.’ Don’t ramp up the drama, and show that you can get across essential messages while remaining calm and unruffled. That way, children will feel safer and that life is more predictable – and you’ll be signalling that they have permission to ask the questions they want to ask without upsetting you.”Laverne Antrobus, child and educational psychologist at the Tavistock and Portman NHS Foundation Trust, says it’s important to meet children’s concerns in an age-appropriate way. “When a child asks something, such as, ‘When is the virus going?’, ask first what they know and what they’re worried about,” she says. “You can then address them in the right tone and language, starting from their knowledge.”Being honest with kids, even when you are feeling unsure yourself, is – the experts agree – best. “Children pick up very quickly on parents’ fears, so it’s better to be open about your own anxieties – maybe it doesn’t seem ideal, but there are dangers in letting children live in a happy but unreal bubble,” says David Messer, developmental psychologist and professor of education at the Open University.Antrobus says the pandemic has brought a new level of honesty into family life. “In the past, parents might have said ‘Don’t worry’ to their kids – but the pandemic means they’ve seen their parents worried, it’s put everything on the table.” As with all traumas, it’s a learning opportunity that, in the long term, will boost resilience. “It’s about managing the setbacks and knocks and showing children how to use them to become stronger – and that doesn’t mean airbrushing them out, or pretending they’re not there, it means being clear about the fact that we’ve all been worried, that the virus is an unknown and in many ways it remains an unknown. But we need to show children that we can survive, even if things go against us in the future. So if there are problems ahead with, for example, a second wave, then, yes, we’ll be disappointed – but we will get through.”You need to say something that conveys that there is a problem, but that it can be overcome and that children aren’t usually at risk. So it could be something like: “I’ve been worried, and lots of other people have been worried. It’s a difficult situation: you might get it, although people of your age often don’t even notice they have it. It’s not a big risk to people of your age or my age the risk is much greater for people of great-grandma’s age. But we will get through it, and that’s why we’re doing all these new things you can see, like people wearing masks.”As things stand, school beckons: in Scotland, pupils are back in mid-August, in Northern Ireland, from the end of August, and in England and Wales from early September. “Schools will have contacted parents with guidance for the great return find time to run through the rules with your child, because some measures will feel strange and may take some getting used to,” says Roberts. “If your child is anxious about change or new situations, try a bit of role play to help them find solutions to scenarios they’re worried about.”It’s a mistake to think all teenagers found our changed lives difficult. “Many of the adolescents I’ve been in touch with have been surprisingly OK with it,” says clinical psychologist and psychotherapist Dave Spellman. “Lockdown gave them the chance to sidestep some of the anxieties and pressures they’re usually up against.”Roberts has noticed the same. “Some older children really enjoyed spending time in a safe bubble at home, and in some cases this interval has revealed just how unhappy they were at school,” she says. If that chimes with what you feel about your kids, Roberts suggests you look at switching schools or even (if your circumstances allow) continuing with home schooling.Most teenagers are relishing the chance to get out and about again – but not all. “Many young people who are anxious about leaving the house have other difficulties – phobias perhaps, or OCD – and the pandemic has brought them to the surface,” Antrobus says. You need to see the world from their point of view, and help them take small steps towards gaining more confidence – and if necessary, consult a professional.Young people who found friendships difficult before Covid-19 may have found lockdown easy – but emerging back into a social life may be tough. Antrobus says the first thing to do is acknowledge that there may be problems by talking it through and then helping them take the first tentative steps towards rekindling links with their classmates.Whenever school restarts, a big message from the experts is that a lot needs to happen before any academic learning is resumed. “This definitely isn’t going to be about just launching straight into the timetable,” Antrobus cautions. “First, pupils need to reconnect with their teachers – emotionally reconnect, with everyone sharing their experiences and being honest about how the pandemic has affected their lives.”Resist the temptation to police how your teens follow the regulations, Citron says. “You’ve got to let them get out and about, and on with normal life, as much as possible,” she says. Better than trying to force them into doing things your way is to say to them: “This is the choice I would make, but I’m not going to tell you what to do. I’m trusting you to follow the guidelines.”Youngsters for whom Covid has coincided with a key crossroads moment have had a lot to deal with: the end of school life for my 18-year-old daughter came when she went out for lunch one day in March and returned to find a teacher at the gate telling her and her friends they couldn’t go back in. Exams, proms, parties, first forays abroad with friends and (for older students) graduation ceremonies and the first step on to the work ladder have all, for the moment anyway, been cancelled. In their place, uncertainty: will they be starting uni in the autumn? Will they ever get a job?“They’re all going to have been affected to some degree – but to what extent may be unclear for some time,” Spellman says. As with the adult population, those who were already up against it with mental or physical health problems are likely to suffer most. “Trust your instincts,” says Roxane Caplan of children’s mental health charity Young Minds. “If you’re worried about how your child is coping, reach out for help to us, your GP, or other NHS services.” Young Minds’ research suggests older teenagers have struggled especially with loneliness, a loss of purpose and a lack of motivation. Caplan’s advice is to keep as much routine as possible in their lives – family mealtimes, for example, can be helpful – and to make space for doing fun things together. “Think of things in the future that you can all look forward to together,” she says. “Point out that the rules won’t be here for ever, and they’re not some kind of punishment, they’re to keep everyone safe.”She recommends encouraging young adults to share what they feel about the current situation. If they don’t seem keen to talk, make sure you’re giving them space to do it on their terms andor try some conversation starters: “Do you have worries about going back to schoolstarting universitytransitioning back to ‘normal life’?” “How do you feel about things changing?” “What makes you feel calm?” “Is there anything you want to talk about?”“Give them space to express what they are feeling,” Caplan says, “and be willing to open up yourself. Remember you don’t need to have answers – no one does. But we all feel calmer, and happier, if we have a chance to talk about our feelings.”Whatever age your kids, model a healthy attitude to self-care. “Lockdown meant parents had to give and give and give, with all sorts of additional pressures,” says Poppy O’Neill, whose new book 101 Tips To Help Your Anxious Child has just been published. “Now it’s time to set a good example and show you’re looking after yourself.” Schedule in times that are about fun, play and connecting – with them, with other adults, and with yourself.Lockdown brought silver linings, and you might want to hang on to some of them. “We had Lego Mondays where everyone stayed in their pyjamas and played with Lego all day, and they were a huge success,” O’Neill says. “And daily walks together are something else we’re going to keep up.” The truth is that parenting in a pandemic isn’t straightforwardly good or bad, easy or tough. For every frustration, there’s a liberation for every challenge, there’s a blessing. Be open to the positives – and remember that better times will come.

When that didn’t work, it became a ‘DIY thing’Names: Susanne and Brett CoulstockYears together: 13Occupations: Downshifters“At the start, we were so naive,” says Susanne Coulstock. “It was like, ‘We’re building a nest together.’”In 2011, she and husband Brett set out to build a self-sufficient, off-grid, passive-solar straw bale eco-farmhouse on a small organic farm in Western Australia. “If you’ve watched Grand Designs, we were typically like that. All starry-eyed at first and then came the reality of the daily grind. Then came the ‘Oh my God. Why did we ever do this? What made us think we could do this?’”The couple have been together for 13 years and have gone through plenty of ups and downs, but have remained strong. They met early in 2007 on an online dating site. Intrigued by her profile, Brett pinged Sue. He didn’t expect to hear back from her because she’d stated that she was only interested in university graduates – and he had a diploma in multimedia. Sue quickly jumps in: “It was pretty snobby to say ‘university educated’ but he’s more educated because he self-educates more than most university people that I ever spend time with. And it was just because I really wanted to date someone who reads.” They laugh and he still teases her about it, but they do share a love of reading, nature and science.At the time, he was in Perth and she was in Albany so they were 400km apart. Finally they agreed to meet: “Sue invited me down for a long weekend, and it was very clear there was a spare room – and a dog,” says Brett. He took a four-hour bus ride down to meet her in a cafe in Albany. Initially it was a bit odd, says Sue. “You’ve got this text entity and this disembodied voice, and suddenly he’s there. But that took about half an hour to get past the weirdness of that and then that was fine, once we’d reconciled that the disembodied voice came with a body.”Their connection was as strong as it had been online. “It was really nice to speak to someone who wasn’t pushing his own barrow. He was as interested in working out who I was as he was in telling me who he was,” she remembers. There was a spark between them, although initially it was more of a “best-friend-I-hadn’t-met-yet spark”, says Sue. She was guarded and Brett was happy to accept that: “If that’s all it was going to be, that would’ve been fine because I like Sue, she’s fun to converse with, and she’s good to have as a friend.”Over the next few months, they’d often spend weekends together, walking and cycling. Gradually their commitment deepened. “We were basically spending a long time in each other’s company, not saying a lot – talking a lot, but not saying a lot. And, after a while, I said, ‘Sue, I think I’ve got feelings for you.’”As happy as they were, there was a shadow hanging over them. Sue had a very dysfunctional childhood and a difficult relationship with her family. There’d also been tension with other family members over the wedding, which led to ongoing conflict between Sue and Brett.They tried counselling with little success, so it came down to doing the hard work themselves. “It became a DIY thing,” says Sue. “I worked on my own stuff, and then I tried using humour to present some situations to Brett – and humour always works.” What kept her going in tough times was remembering that her husband had her best interests at heart. “For me, it was getting really sad about what was going to be lost if we didn’t make our way through, and what we were going to lose. This was my best friend and I didn’t want to lose him.”Brett agrees: “Even at the worst times, I still see Sue as a wonderful person.” Their relationship has layers, he explains. “There was this substrate that was always pretty good. It was just there was complexity and frustrations and things on top of that, and it was dealing with that stuff that was challenging.”These days they both feel calmer, more content and secure in their relationship. “We know each other’s strengths and weaknesses. I support Sue, Sue supports me. I’ll do things she doesn’t like to do she’ll do things I don’t like to do. And we have great fun and adventures, which we always did have,” says Brett. “There’s always stresses and pressures in life but I don’t feel that my relationship with Sue is one of them.Sue agrees: “When you look at the person without the rose-tinted glasses, and you can love them as much and more, then you know that you are on to something.”One of their strengths is the way they challenge each other, says Brett. “I watch things that I never would have watched. I listen to things I never would have listened to. I’ve gone places I never would have been.” It also helps to keep a playful attitude, including having inside jokes. “If I took a little moment of us out of context, nobody would have any idea what we were talking about but that would capture the relationship because it’s playful, it’s knowing, and it’s built on years of trust and shared experiences.”• We want to hear your stories about staying together.

It started with the very big goal of changing the industry from within. It creates scalable projects and aims to motivate the whole industry to take action on social and environmental issues in the electronics supply chain.”“It wants to transform electronics into an industry where taking care of people and the planet is a natural part of doing business.”“There’s also a human cost. From the mines to the factories, the entire electronics supply chain is tainted by unsafe and inhumane working conditions, from long working hours to even child labour.”“By creating a smartphone ourselves, we can open up the supply chain, find out where the materials come from and can use commercial strategies to maximise our social impact at every stage.“Four areas in which we are creating change: long-lasting design, fair materials, good working conditions and recycling. In each area, we are pioneering step-by-step change in our products and our own supply chain.” “For companies to be fair, they must truly want to do it. For Fairphone, it is a natural way of doing business. In 2019 a total of 230 workers in our Chinese factory received a bonus of up to €425 (£384) per person – one-and-a-half times the local monthly salary. This type of bonus was a first for our industry.“Almost 8,000 people directly benefited from Fairphone’s social, environmental and economic interventions in 2019. “We encourage consumers to keep their phones for as long as possible – the most sustainable phone is the one you already have. The longer you keep your phone, the lower the carbon footprint. But if you are looking to buy a new phone, consider the Fairphone.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2cf549668274d09fac3ff008fbb59719e3053730/0_0_3739_2244/master/3739.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=24c34a244281d044b1609927313742f5","title":"the terrible plight of music event staff coronavirus pandemic","story":"The pandemic has shut down concert tours – and with them go thousands of jobs in sound, lighting, catering and more. As the industry lobbies the government, road crews tell their storiesEdd Sedgwick is a sound engineer and tour manager who normally works for the Vaccines, but with that group having long planned to take 2020 off, he was preparing to go on the road with Radiohead’s Ed O’Brien. Then, as the coronavirus crisis worsened, he got a call: “Put everything on hold for the rest of the year.” Sedgwick’s life emptied out. “The weirdest thing is knowing every day by its date or the day of the week – so you call a day ‘Monday’ instead of ‘Barcelona’ or ‘Milan’.”You can apply Sedgwick’s experience across the live music industry: thousands of workers suddenly learned their working year had ended in March. Tre Stead, for example, is Frank Turner’s tour manager. She was in the last week of Turner’s European tour when the world began to fall apart. They plugged on until Donald Trump intervened, with three shows left. “We had three Americans on the crew, and then Trump did his travel ban.” Faced with the prospect of being stranded in Europe indefinitely, the Americans – with Turner’s blessing – flew home. “And that’s when Frank decided it was the end.”The vast majority of road crew – a broad designation that includes tour managers, instrument technicians, sound engineers, lighting engineers, bus drivers, merchandise sellers and even caterers, plus those working in the other ancillary industries on which touring depends – are self-employed. They go out on tour and are paid for that tour by the artist. When there is no work, there is no money. Since March, those who are self-employed have had to rely on grants from the Self-Employment Income Support Scheme (SEISS), savings, universal credit, or on getting other jobs. The luckier ones – who had set themselves up as limited companies, with themselves as directors – have been able to go on furlough, but times are beyond tough: there is an existential crisis in the road crew world.Though the plight of musicians and venues has been widely publicised, the travails of the live industry’s backroom staff have been less noted. Hence last Tuesday’s Red Alert initiative, where venues across the country were floodlit red as part of the #WeMakeEvents campaign. The aim is to pressure the government to offer more support for the live events business, which was the first industry to close when Covid-19 arrived and is one of the last to reopen. In July, Boris Johnson announced gig venues could reopen with social distancing from 1 August, but reversed the decision with one day to go. Culture secretary Oliver Dowden has announced reopening can begin today, but with social distancing in place, it won’t be viable for many venues.Those in the industry say the crisis will get worse without government help. It’s not just iniduals but companies at risk, says Andy Lenthall, general manager of the Production Services Association. “Those are the companies that need to be there to serve the sector – if they fold, they will be left with big warehouses full of lights, or PA systems, owned by a bank.”But it’s the inidual tales that hit hardest. “We basically trawled the internet looking for temporary jobs for our members,” Lenthall says. “Our website has a Covid section with temporary vacancies, and some top technicians have got themselves into Amazon fulfilment centres, or driving for Asda. We had two members bump into each other in the same aisle in Tesco, stacking shelves on a night shift.”Those are the lucky ones. For comparison, try 29-year-old lighting director Chris Yeomans, who was due to spend most of this year on the road with McFly, after finishing a tour with Mabel in March. “I’m back at my parents’ house,” he says. “The only income I have is universal credit, and the government grant for the self-employed.” Or Kirstie Hopper, a tour and merchandise manager, whose last tour was with Halsey. She too is back at home on universal credit. “I’d moved out of home several years ago,” she says. “Now I feel like I’m failing at life. I’m trying to remind myself it’s temporary.”Others have turned their enforced idleness to productive use. Matt Cox, keyboards technician for the Chemical Brothers, has created a website for socially distanced musicians who are having equipment difficulties. Tre Stead has been working at Manchester’s Nightingale Hospital. “I started off doing the night shift in the catering department, from 8pm to 6am, which was pretty brutal. It’s made the time go quickly, but the problem is, being on crew isn’t something you can practise at home. If I go back to work next year – my next booked gig is in May 2021, but it’s not certain that will go ahead – I have to jump on that and know what to do after a year of not doing it.”For American road crews, the situation is even harder, with the benefits system tougher and the need for health insurance to get medical treatment. Tiffany Hendren, for example, found herself caught in a perfect storm by Covid-19. She splits her work – part of the year on staff as a sound engineer for a group of venues in St Louis, Missouri part of the year touring as a freelancer. “In the past I’ve had insurance through the job, but I have to work a certain number of hours for that employer every year to get it. Last year I fell short, so my insurance expired.”That would be bad enough at the best of times, worse in a pandemic, and even worse if, like Hendren, you are asthmatic, suffer from chronic bronchitis and are prone to regular bouts of pneumonia. “That has made me incredibly paranoid about going outside. I’m going slightly mad.”What worries everyone is whether they will have jobs to go back to, and if they do, whether they will be able to afford to return to them. “There are people saying, ‘I’m not up for this any more,’” says Ben Bowers, a guitar tech for Rival Sons. “I’ve spent a lot of time in the studio working on demos for other bands, and I think I’ll find it hard to return.” Every tech person I speak to reports friends who are leaving the business for good, and predicts a crew shortage next year.Those who plan to return to the road know everything will be different, and harder. Major promoters have told me they expect consumer confidence in live music to be so low they will have to cut ticket prices, which will mean lower artist fees and thus either fewer crew or lower crew wages crew members expect the return of live music to be accompanied by freelancers desperate for work undercutting each others’ rates. Edd Sedgwick notes that with supply companies – the ones who provide lights and PA and backline and so on – having had to make redundancies, “they won’t have the stock to set it all back up.” He mentions a tour bus company he uses, which right before Covid had invested in a fleet of brand new coaches. “Now they’re just sitting in a yard.” His conclusion is bleak: “The demand will be there, but I don’t think the resources will be there to support it.”So spare a thought not just for musicians, but the people who make sure they can take to the stage. “This has been 10 years of building a career and making sacrifices,” Chris Yeomans says. “I’ve sacrificed relationships and friendships and now I’m sat at home playing PlayStation wondering what it was all for.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8f349b9f12e4710249c217ef4db36e4ab4ec2fa5/0_436_6617_3968/master/6617.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c2209e187520df1a5d8faf8401d6469e","title":"sir paul nurse the uk has taken a leap several decades into the past","story":"The Nobel prize-winning scientist on Covid-19, the burden of Brexit, his astonishing upbringing and terrible failures at FrenchSir Paul Nurse is a geneticist who won the Nobel prize in 2001 for his work on the cell cycle. He is director of the Francis Crick Institute and was head of Cancer Research UK. He has also been president of the Royal Society. What Is Life? is his first book and it seeks to explain biology in five steps.Your book is a reminder of the fundamental importance of cells. Do you think cells have been overshadowed by genes in the public imagination?I’m a geneticist, so I’ve lived through molecular genetics and molecular biology and that has focused a lot on genes. I do think cells have not caught the attention of the world in perhaps the way they should have done, because it’s the fundamental unit of life. I sometimes use this analogy: it’s like biology’s atom. It’s not the gene, it’s the cell.During the Covid-19 crisis, you’ve been critical of ministers and advisers, comparing them to blancmange. Do you think we need to rethink that relationship between politicians and advisers?Yes, I do. I’m particularly concerned about the attempt to convey communication through one-liners such as “we’re following the science”. It’s a sort of populist tendency and that reduces complex situations to an almost meaningless sentence. I also think we need more clarity about how decisions are made. For example, testing for coronavirus was absolutely critical. What they decided to do was produce very big labs to do it, not thinking that this would take many months to get it to work efficiently. Whereas they could have developed it locally and contributed something immediately. All the testing capacity basically did nothing during the big infection phase. That was very bad policy and implemented badly, but we didn’t see the discussions behind those decisions.Another area of concern for you is the effect of Brexit on the science community. Do you see any cause for optimism there?Not really. There are three major science blocs in the world, which are North America, China and the far east and Europe. Britain is actually good at science and had a lot of influence in European science. And so we have lost power and influence. That’s a political thing. The psychological thing is that I meet scientific colleagues around the world and they just think that the UK has turned away from collaborative science by looking back on an imperial history that no longer exists. It’s just very sentimental. And we’ve taken a leap several decades into the past.You mention an extraordinary personal story in the book: that you found out that your sister was actually your mother. How has it affected your sense of identity?I was in my late 50s when I found out. I was living in New York and I was president of a research university called Rockefeller University. I applied for a green card and was turned down, which was a bit of a surprise because I had a Nobel prize, I was president of a university and I was knighted. It was because they didn’t like my birth certificate, which didn’t name my parents. So I applied for a full birth certificate and discovered the truth. I’m astonished that my parents, who were my grandparents, managed to keep this all quiet. As my actual mother and grandparents were dead, I had no recourse to find out exactly what happened. I would like to know who my father is. I mean, I’m a geneticist. I’m actually quite a good geneticist. And I lived for half a century not knowing my own genetics. I hope I find out before I eventually die.Your main area of research is in yeast, but you became head of Cancer Research UK. How far away do you think science is from gaining some cellular grip on cancer?Our understanding of cancer has really dramatically improved. We understand the cellular basis of it, the genetic origins of it, the ways in which it’s caused, the way in which the regulatory circuits get altered in cancer cell tissue, which is immensely complicated and one reason it’s so difficult to develop therapies. Our treatment of it is still lagging but in my view we will be able to get cancer under significantly more control in a matter of decades, though we’ll never be able to eliminate it.You famously failed your French O-level six times. What are your linguistic skills like these days?They are absolutely appallingly bad. It’s a matter of great distress to me because I travel a great deal. I even got a Légion d’honneur, believe it or not. I had to give the speech in French! You needed a foreign language to get into university, so they let me sit French six times. I didn’t pass so I worked as a technician for a year. And then eventually I was let into Birmingham University.What did it mean to you to win the Nobel prize?The Nobel prize is the prize that everybody knows. I was fortunate that I got it on the 100th anniversary of the Nobel, so it was a great occasion. The fact is that I do talk more to the public and journalists now and it’s mainly because of the Nobel prize. Suddenly you become a public figure. You have to be careful you don’t say anything too stupid. In some countries such as India or China it’s a huge distinction, even in Germany and France. In the UK, we don’t tend to see it like that so much. In some ways, I think that’s a good thing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5825f95f92dcc6dd21d712e8ebfd1afcaf1bf4fb/0_343_6576_3946/master/6576.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2074d19b3cfffb59e0768857e078e202","title":"it hasnt sank in residents win 60 rent reduction in london council flats","story":"Tenants to pay lower social rents after campaign against corporate landlords at Custom House and Canning Town in NewhamThe London borough of Newham announced this week that “following a series of management issues” 250 properties in the borough, which were leased out by the council to the property management company Mears, would be transferred back into council management.The families, who live in Custom House and Canning Town, have previously told the  that the homes they live in are unsafe and unhealthy, with issues such as crumbling asbestos floors, brown water running from taps, and leaky roofs. Those who had struggled to pay their rent, which they described as “sky high”, had fallen into arrears. Some of these issues were compounded during lockdown.Over the past four years, the families have campaigned – under the banner of People’s Empowerment Alliance for Custom House (Peach) – for social rent and to have repairs completed in a timely manner, staging protests and holding street parties while negotiating with the council.As well as charging social rent, the council will now respond to repair works needed in the homes, which have been used as temporary accommodation to house local homeless households. The residents said the exact rent reduction would depend on each property.Fayha Badi, 40, said the rent reduction would be life-changing for most families in the area. The 40-year-old mother of three, who is studying for a masters in biomedical science, said: “I never imagined I could win like this in the end.” Badi, who currently pays £356 a week for a three-bedroom property, will probably pay around £120 when the council takes back control. With the money she saves, she can finally take her children on holiday for the first time in five years.She added: “It’s all through being part of Peach and meeting all these kind people. When I think of them, I feel safe and confident.”Rokhsana Fiaz, Newham’s mayor, said: “This marks a real victory for the residents who have had historical issues with the management of the property by Mears, which I have been committed to address from the time I was a councillor in Custom House.“Since becoming the mayor of Newham in May 2018, officers have worked tremendously hard with residents to address these issues, by challenging Mears to meet their responsibilities and now we’ve come up with an acceptable solution which causes minimum disruption for tenants.”Mears said it had spent £400,000 annually on repairs to the properties, which were condemned for demolition by Newham council. The company said the rent levels in the blocks were set by the council.Alan Long, executive director of Mears, said: “First and foremost, I am deeply saddened that the residents of Customs House have been the victims of political indecision and electoral promises which could not have been delivered. I hope that Newham will now be able to start the much-needed regeneration of the area to develop the homes needed in their borough.“Whilst we are sad to be leaving our relationship with the tenants, I am thankful that this may be an opportunity for Newham to finally create new homes that the residents of Customs House deserve. Mears believes it has met its contractual obligations to residents and the council over the past nine years and have delivered the best service possible in the circumstances.”The properties will eventually be demolished and replaced as part of the regeneration scheme. The council announced plans that will allow current Mears tenants who have lived in the area for five years and were placed into their homes by the council to receive a secure social rent home. These plans are currently subject to cabinet approval.Boglárka Filler, 39, who lives in a two-bedroom property, said she finally felt hopeful about the future following Newham council’s announcement. “Since I’ve been a member of Peach, it’s helped me avoid a mental breakdown. Without them, I wouldn’t be here. If it wasn’t for Peach, I would not have any hope and I wouldn’t be able to participate in the community at all.” Filler, who has two children, hopes to return to her studies.“I’m still lost for words. It’s what we’ve been working for, it’s what we’ve been fighting for,” said Samantha Napa, 31, who works in the financial sector. “There’s been times where I just thought this is never going to happen, but the fact that it is actually happening, it hasn’t sunk in. It’s overwhelming.”Napa, who has lived in her current temporary accommodation in Custom House for seven years, urged others in a similar situation to come together and organise. “By coming together, by showing that we are united as one, they’ve had to listen to us.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1f6951b4dc8f51689de234496772cabefe94a96e/2_0_3020_1814/master/3020.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=db0e1f445222f3bbde83fa1375b82fc4","title":"black cricketers ecb county championship","story":"In 1995 there were 33 black male cricketers on the county circuit and last year there were nine. Three who were tipped for success in the 2000s feel they were stereotyped due to their skin colour A few weeks ago Mark Nelson picked up an old scorecard, a memento from a Test he played for England Under-19s against India back in 2006. It was a good one, worth keeping. He had made 43 in the first innings and 103 in the second, had opened the bowling and taken two for 80. As he showed it to his girlfriend, he ran his finger down the list of his teammates’ names and told her: “It’s weird, but most of these guys are still playing.” Four of them – Moeen Ali, Steven Finn, Adil Rashid and Adam Lyth – became Test cricketers, five more had long county careers, the 10th was forced out of the game by a bad injury. And then there was him. At the age of 33, Nelson is working in consumer affairs for the National House Building Council.Northamptonshire released Nelson in 2009. He still doesn’t really understand why. Just the previous year he had been the 12th man for England’s A team. He remembers a conversation he had with his England Under-19 coach at the time. “It’s unbelievable,” the coach told him, “how can you go from playing for England one year to not having a county team the next?”“I look back on it and I ask: ‘Should I have done more?’” Nelson says. “I think I did everything I could. But I can’t have, because if I had, surely they would have given me a contract? Then you look at some of the players who did get signed, you see their record and you think: ‘What’s the difference between me and him? I’ve got a better record, so why did he get more opportunities than me?’ And then it comes back to this: is there another reason?”Nelson is unsure. “It would be easy to draw the conclusion that it was race. It could have been. I don’t know, I don’t know. But it’s one of those things that to my last day I’ll think: ‘Well, why not?’”Nelson isn’t the only one asking.There are all sorts of reasons why a cricketer might not go on to succeed in county cricket – talent, attitude, work ethic and luck. Talk to county coaches and players, and they will tell you it’s a hit-and-miss business, that just because someone got picked for England Under-19s doesn’t mean they will make it as a professional. But it does mean that, at one time, good judges believed they could. Back in the 2000s, the England setup saw that potential in three black players. There was Nelson, from Milton Keynes, Chris Thompson, from south London, and James Pearson, from Bristol.If you haven’t heard of them, it’s because in the end they played only 16 first-class games between them. That doesn’t make them unique, but it does make them unusual. Look at the men they played with in their last matches for England Under‑19s. The other 10 in Nelson’s team played an average of 98 first-class games each, while he played seven. The other 10 in Thompson’s played an average of 104, while he played one. The other 10 in Pearson’s played an average of 118, while he played eight.Recent research by Leeds Beckett University showed that there were only nine black male cricketers on the county circuit last year. In 1995, there were 33. If we want to begin to understand the barriers that have faced young black players in English cricket, these three stories seem like a good place to start. Only, it is not easy listening.It’s 2005, Gloucestershire are playing a county game, and James Pearson is walking out to bat. “And a well-known batsman says to me: ‘Oh, I didn’t know Michael Carberry plays for Gloucestershire.’” Pearson is black, and left-handed, he thinks to himself: “You would never say that to a white man.” 2006, a game at Trent Bridge, and Nelson has hit three boundaries in a row. “I went for a fourth, missed it, and the bowler said to me: ‘All you lot play the same.’” 2002, Thompson is playing a charity game at the Bunbury festival. “This guy drops the catch and everyone starts laughing, and he turns to me and says: ‘You look like you’ve just come from robbing a car, I better mind my stereo.’”It certainly wasn’t widespread, but it wasn’t rare either. “I was kind of prepared for it,” says Pearson, “as sad as it sounds, my parents prepared me for it, they said: ‘You’re in England, this is how it is, you’re not going to be accepted by everybody because you’re black, but it doesn’t stop you doing what you want to do in life.’ I’ve been getting it since I was at school.” Pearson remembers walking into the Gloucestershire changing room “and it was: ‘Oh JP, what are you doing here, you coming to sell some crack?’ Little comments like that. I’d walk in and it would be all Ali G rhetoric, like: ‘JP, yo, yo, yo.’” Nelson says at Northants: “I used to walk in and people used to talk to me in a Jamaican accent. Or people would talk to me in some kind of London slang, call me ‘bruv’ and all this other nonsense.”Pearson and Thompson both played for black club teams but Nelson never did. “In England, nine times out of 10 you’re going to be the only black person at the ground,” Nelson says. “And it almost just becomes something you come to expect. That’s what’s disappointing looking back, comments like those became normal.” He doesn’t think his teammates were being racist, or even malicious. But he does think some of them didn’t understand “how it feels to have 20 people laughing at a joke made at one person’s expense when that one person is already in the minority”.“I don’t want to make it sound like there are a lot of racists in the game, because there aren’t,” Nelson says, “but there are a lot of people who don’t understand what it feels like to be the only black person in a situation and have someone say: ‘You know how to steal a car,’ or: ‘You can rap, can’t you?’ You can’t react to it, because if you do, people say: ‘Why are you being so sensitive? It’s just a joke.’”He remembers a game where the other team had a player from Barbados. “I didn’t get any runs, but he did. And when I went out to field their team was shouting: ‘Our one is better than yours,’ and you’ve got 20 people laughing, do I laugh? Or do I look like the angry black man?“I look back on it now and I wish I had told people: ‘Look, you might think that’s funny, but it’s not funny, I don’t like it, it makes me feel this big.’”Thompson’s experiences are different. He grew up opposite the Oval. He was a bowler, one of the quickest in the country for his age, and he could bat, too. When he got into the Surrey youth setup they couldn’t keep him away from the place. “I was the annoying kid who wouldn’t move, I would stay and help out the cleaners just because I wanted to be in the ground,” he says. There were times the groundsman had to kick him out because he wanted to lock up, and even then Thompson would beg him for an extra 20 minutes in the nets. When he wasn’t there, he was at the local basketball court, playing, or training, till one or two in the morning, or he was out running along the river, Vauxhall Bridge to Waterloo Bridge and back.When Surrey’s second XI needed an opener in an emergency, Thompson put his hand up. When Surrey needed a 12th man to field at short leg for the first team, Thompson put his hand up. “But the whole time I felt like I was on borrowed time.”One day, one of the coaches took him aside and told him: “‘Basically I think you should go elsewhere and look for a career.’ Only he wasn’t so blunt as that, the way he said it was more like: ‘Look at Carl Greenidge, look at Michael Carberry. They were here, now they’re not here and they’re doing really well …’” Both Carberry and Greenidge had been at Surrey and then moved on to other clubs. Thompson still didn’t get it. “OK,” Thompson replied, “why are you telling me?”In his next game, Thompson got 186 for the second XI against Glamorgan at the Oval, and followed it up, soon after, with back-to-back fifties against Yorkshire. By now he was attracting interest from England Under-19s. He and a few other Surrey players got invited for a trial. Thompson got in, no one else did. “Now, if I don’t have a county contract but I’m playing for England, that would look very odd, so Surrey were like: ‘OK we’ve got to offer you a summer deal.’ It was for three months. One of the players who failed the same trial got three years. “But I didn’t mind because I was so excited. I was living my best life.”Thompson played 19 games for England Under-19s. He shared a room with Moeen , who remembers him as “a very good player, very solid off the front foot, quite attacking, drove the ball nicely, and when he made hundreds they tended to be big ones”.After playing at Surrey over three seasons, from 2004 to 2006, he was let go the same summer he finished playing for England. He played second XI cricket for three counties and one first-class game, for Leicestershire, as a late replacement for a sick batsman. Later he went back to Surrey for 10 second XI games in 2012. In the end he went to play club cricket in Jamaica, and when that didn’t work out, he drifted out of professional cricket. These days he runs a music production business, Broadway Entertainment, and drums for Aswad.“I never looked at it as a racial thing,” Thompson says. “People used to say that to me: ‘Surrey is racist, don’t got to Surrey,’ and I was like: ‘Nah, whatever man, these guys are my friends.’” Later, after he had stopped playing, he went along to a group meeting run by the England and Wales Cricket Board. “And at the end of it a man from the ECB came up to me and said: ‘I’ve been looking for you.’” They spoke about what the board could do to get more black players in the game. “And the man explained: ‘I’ve checked out your stats, I’ve spoken to your coaches, and players you played with. I can tell you the reason you weren’t signed wasn’t that you weren’t good enough, but because of the colour of your skin.’”Thompson isn’t sure what to think. “I know I didn’t have an attitude problem. I know I worked hard. I know I got along with everybody, and I know that I didn’t get a fair crack compared to the others around me,” he says. “I know that others did less but got more.” One of Thompson’s Surrey coaches from the time remembered him as someone who simply didn’t have quite enough talent to make it at such a competitive club. Thompson disagrees.Certainly, Surrey are a very different club these days. The change has been led by their director of women’s cricket, Ebony Rainford-Brent, who recently launched a pioneering African-Caribbean engagement programme. Their chief executive, Richard Gould, says: “It is very important that every organisation listen to these concerns, and I am grateful to Chris for speaking out about his experience. One of our most important roles as a club is to help young men and women to become the very best cricketers they can be. We actively encourage all. Everyone gets our best efforts.”The ECB, too, says it wants to “urgently address” the lack of black cricketers in the English game, although it has yet to spell out how. Gloucestershire did not respond to a request for comment. Ray Payne, the chief executive of Northants, told us: “It was sad to read Mark Nelson’s comments. I can’t speak with first-hand knowledge of the club as it was over a decade ago. There has been an appreciable turnover of personnel since then, in terms of playing, coaching and administrative staff.“What I do know for certain is that the club today is proud of its commitment to ersity and equality, and welcomes cricketers from all ethnic backgrounds and all nationalities to Wantage Road. Any form of racial stereotyping as described by Mark would be wholly unacceptable.”Payne points out that Northants had been a cricketing home since the war for celebrated overseas players including Donald Ramsamooj, Bishan Bedi, Kapil Dev, Sir Curtly Ambrose, Jason Holder and Temba Bavuma, plus Les McFarlane, Devon Malcolm and Monty Panesar among English black, Asian and minority ethnic players.“At Northants there’s no question I was stereotyped,” says Nelson. “I’d make a mistake, play a bad shot, and it wasn’t always that I got dropped for it, but it would definitely be a case of someone saying to me: ‘You can’t do that, you can’t always be that way, I know that’s how West Indians play.’ Bear in mind I was born in Milton Keynes. So you got labelled. Of course it’s not everyone, and I don’t even know if the people who do it realised what they are doing. But I’d say I was tarnished slightly, on the basis of my skin colour rather than my style of play.”Nelson adds: “It does affect you, but because of how regular it was, and how isolated you become. Especially as I got older. It wouldn’t be fair to say it’s the reason why I’m not playing any more, but it definitely had an effect.”It is important to understand exactly what Thompson, Nelson and Pearson are speaking out about. They are not talking about conscious prejudice, but about a climate in which the particular difficulties they faced were unappreciated, and went unaddressed. They are talking about feeling stereotyped by other players and coaches, and about feeling they weren’t allowed to make mistakes, or that they weren’t given the same leeway as some white players.Pearson scored three fifties in his first 11 championship innings for Gloucestershire. When they released him in 2005, they told him it was because he had a bad attitude. He admits he could have worked harder. But he says it was the first time anyone from the club had mentioned it to him. These days, Pearson runs a large sales team for a software firm. He understands something about leadership and he is amazed no one from the club ever discussed it with him. “I definitely felt stereotyped,” he says. “Just an example, I’m someone who is quite sociable, quite talkative, quite jovial, and I find that for me, personally, in cricket that comes across as ‘he doesn’t take the game seriously, he’s a joker’. But if there are white players who are like that, who are maybe not performing, it’s more a case of: ‘Oh yeah, he’s good for the team, he has great banter, and it’s great for the culture.’”When the Black Lives Matter movement started, Nelson says he didn’t really want to get involved. He saw some of the players taking a knee, and remembered things they had said to him in the past. “I wasn’t sure if this was going to be something that’s only lasted for a week or two. I’ve done that before. I did Kick Racism Out, I did Say No to Racism. So I was very reluctant at the time, but it seems that it’s starting to mean something at last.”Thompson is less sure. “I try and put things to the back of my mind,” he says. “What can you do? If people don’t think they need to change, then there’s no point trying to fight.” Thompson’s kid plays, and he still can’t pass a cricket ground in summer without wanting to pick up his bat. He, Pearson, and Nelson all say how grateful they are for the opportunities the game gave them, and how much they still love it. Listening to them, you wonder how much it loved them back."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0c5b20e86d2005215037c3279bab011536f94f9f/0_98_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e97ba9756e28b2135ef407c07118e39f","title":"bristol keep up the pressure on exeter with victory over saracens","story":"This was not the most compelling argument for summer rugby, but Bristol have used the lockdown to inject themselves with pragmatism. Anyone looking for Covid-19 metamorphoses after five months of inactivity would been hard pressed to detect any difference with defences dominating on a damp afternoon, but it was a signal success for the enterprising Bears because it was the ugliest of victories.It was a meeting between the rising and the crestfallen. Bristol are not afraid to voice their ambition and their latest high-profile recruit, Semi Radradra, made his debut in the centre. The Fijian may as well have been sitting in the empty stands during an opening half in which he received a solitary pass, and that was when the referee was playing advantage for yet another breakdown infringement. He did treble his tally after the break.Radradra was used as a decoy a few times, but Bristol struggled to find space with Saracens, led by Maro Itoje, Billy Vunipola and the wing Rotimi Segun, preventing ball-carriers getting into a stride and taking advantage of the belated decision of referees in the Premiership to inspect what players on the attacking side get up to at the breakdown.Bristol were forced to kick hurriedly, inviting the counterattack, and another reason why Radradra was left to wonder why he had swapped the French climate for the British summer rain was that the home side lost four of their lineouts in the first 35 minutes. Saracens should have led comfortably at the interval, but they only had two Alex Goode penalties to show for their territorial advantage. They only looked threatening in possession when the Vunipola brothers were in possession and failed to build on their early six-point lead.One of Saracens’ try scorers eight months ago was the back rower Ben Earl. He was involved again, but in the opposition ranks having joined Bristol on a season’s loan. He came on at the start of the second half for Nathan Hughes and his first touch was to claim a Harry Randall grubber before being tackled five metres from the line.Bristol had more about them after the break, not for the first time this season, as if needing to be told where they were going wrong. They started to exploit their one clear advantage, which lay in the scrum, where Mako Vunipola was warned early to improve his technique or reflect on in the sin-bin. But the obduracy of Saracens, in training for next month’s European Champions Cup quarter-final in Leinster, continued to frustrate them.The home side’s defence was as organised as Saracens’ Callum Sheedy’s third-quarter penalties came after Goode and Callum Hunter-Hill were forced to hold on to the ball having been isolated and his third, after Goode had restored the visitors’ lead, followed another powerful scrum. Saracens had two opportunities to tilt a tight match decisively their way when they kicked two penalties to touch: the first ended with Kyle Sinckler, on his Bristol debut from the bench, infringing at the breakdown and the second was thwarted by aggressive counter-rucking.The match produced 36 penalties and when Max Lahiff entered a ruck from the side, Goode put his side ahead for the third time. There were so many infringements that there was little continuity, only pockets of inidualism: Luke Morahan had a solo try ruled out after Harry Thacker was ruled to have cleared his path by blocking Itoje and after breaking three tackles to get into the Saracens’ 22, Thacker lost control of the ball.It was a lineout that won it for Bristol. Aled Davies’s box-kick had more height than distance. Segun tried to flick it on near halfway, but it went forward and was picked up by Goode in an offside position. Sheedy kicked the penalty to within six yards of the line and Siale Piutau touched down after a drive. A review revealed he had been tackled into touch by Jamie George after he had entered a ruck from the side. The England hooker was sent to the sin-bin and a penalty try awarded. There was still time for Saracens to force three attacking lineouts but Bristol held firm to climb to second in the table.“To get to where we want to be, you have to be able to win like that and we would not have done so last season,” said the Bristol head coach, Pat Lam, who felt Morahan’s try was wrongly ruled out because “Itoje had no chance of tackling him”.

In his strongest comments yet on race, the British actor, playwright and director said the Black Lives Matter protests had prompted him to speak out.“This is no longer the time for shadow-boxing on these issues,” said Kwei-Armah, urging his contemporaries to stop being so diplomatic in their demands for more ersity.“That is no longer my preferred method of persuasion,” he said, suggesting that the enforced period of lockdown should be used to “accelerate representation” rather than plan for a return to the old ways when theatres eventually reopen.“We have to create an environment that does not make people feel like a theatre is not a place for them. There were Egyptian mystery plays 2,000 years before the Greek dramas we know, so I am not an invader, as I used to feel,” said Kwei-Armah, 53, who grew up in Hillingdon, west London.“I was welcomed as a foreigner, but there is a flow through to stage culture from African work too. But we’ve been hoodwinked.”Kwei-Armah, whose award-winning 2003 play Elmina’s Kitchen was only the second by a black playwright to run in London’s West End, said he knew the word “quota” still upsets some people, but that the time to do more than just talk had now come. “I am loathe to be ‘tick box’ about it, but I believe it has finally become common sense,” he said. “I still like the word ‘target’, although it sounds as if you are just being politically sensitive again.“The truth is, I no longer really care what people call it, I just want action. With quotas there is a feeling that getting to a particular number can be the overriding concern. And then you stop. But my target is now to make sure the Young Vic represents the makeup of London.”Kwei-Armah explained that he has reversed an earlier plan to drop a financially risky season of black work at the Young Vic.“We will all be in a different world when we go back,” he said. “But I believe BLM has deepened the listening of our white peers. It is true we have to get bums back on seats, but we also have to serve our community. That is now the priority.”The director said “first nights” and season launches at the Young Vic will no longer be formal occasions with a glass of wine. They will be DJ sessions that will mean more to Londoners. He added that he wants to see “more people who look like my mother inside the organisation”. And he suggested that the way meetings are held inside his theatre will also change, so it is not just about putting black people on stage.“Most people in the theatrical world have an understanding that this is now a “must”, if we want to feel just. I know that sounds like a slogan, but there is a clear mandate now.”Kwei-Armah said that while many in the black community are wondering if the attention given to the issue of ersity is just “a moment” rather than the birth of a movement, he believes it can be both.“The majority of us are working very hard because of the fear that it will just be a moment. But the dam has broken.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/60901d10061e7c75e0f6b090449312dcc1913d7e/0_54_5100_3060/master/5100.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1fa6ff348dda3fe2e3c9a07c46b57932","title":"how much do you know about hybrid cars take our quiz","story":"From better batteries to regenerative braking, test your knowledge on these low-emission vehiclesHonda has raised the ambition of its Electric Vision strategy to ensure that all European mainstream models feature electrified powertrains by 2022, three years earlier than originally planned.

For extra storage space, comfort and reduced emissions, a hybrid SUV is worth considering for a variety of lifestylesAdam Smith identified Britain as a nation of shopkeepers, but these days it might be more accurate to say we’re a nation of small businesses. There are almost 6m in the country, of which 3.5m operate as sole traders.Many of those people, whether they work at home or from a small office, need transportation that is reliable, spacious, cheap to run and that can double as a family car. Whether you’re a caterer transporting cakes, a fitness trainer carrying weights or a maker selling craftwares at small markets, you need a vehicle that can adapt effortlessly to your needs and budget.A hybrid’s combination of petrol and electric power means those short delivery runs are more cost-effective and you never have to wait on a recharge. Emissions are reduced, meaning a small reduction in car tax but also reductions when certain types of low-emission vehicles are registered as a company car for tax purposes – useful when you’re watching every penny.There are plenty of other reasons to buy a large hybrid if you run a small business, of course, not least a huge amount of storage to stow goods away in. The latest Honda CR-V hybrid, for example, features a wider, deeper boot than in previous models, and can be opened by waggling your foot underneath, ideal if you’re loaded down with goods. A smart, flexible “company” car that’s tax deductible and cheaper to run? Sounds like good business.Face it, when you become a parent, you sign up to run a taxi service for the best part of 20 years. Factor in a twice-daily school run, regular shopping trips, weekend jaunts and holidays with two or three kids, perhaps a dog, too, and the attraction of a big car such as an SUV is undeniable. But there’s a major downside: emissions.Many schools in urban areas suffer from high pollution, exacerbated by parents depositing their kids at the school gates and waiting around when they pick them up later with engines needlessly idling. Fearing the effects, headteachers are calling for car bans and schools are leafleting parents to stop parking nearby. The city of Bristol is even discussing a potential diesel car-free zone, because of the dangerous particulates they emit. The UK Energy Research Centre recently revealed the surge in SUV sales was jeopardising the UK transport sector’s ability to meet EU emissions targets. That’s not a good look for a parent, even if an SUV is.The ideal solution is a more efficient, cleaner version that can still meet the needs of a busy parent – a hybrid that can run on pure electric around sensitive zones such as schools and in town.When you combine the other benefits a modern, large hybrid car brings to the party – such as high safety ratings, masses of room, plenty of storage and parking assist features – they begin to make a compelling case again.There are many downsides to a long commute, not least the grinding tedium of heavy traffic, the slow crawl and tailbacks with repeated stop-starts. Add to that stress and musculoskeletal disorders from sitting in an uncomfortable position, and public transport starts to seem a whole lot more appealing. However, if commute time, connectivity or the price tag make public transport difficult to justify, a low-emission vehicle might just be the next best thing, especially with today’s petrol and diesel prices.A hybrid with a stop-start system automatically shuts down and restarts the engine to reduce the amount of time it spends idling, reducing both fuel consumption and emissions. And you may just end up spending less on maintenance as well. Because of the regenerative braking system, you won’t use your standard brakes as much, resulting in less wear and tear. The batteries in hybrids are also designed to last the lifetime of the car, and have solid warranties to reflect this. The Honda i-MMD battery, which is used to power its new CR-V hybrid, is covered for five years or to a distance of 100,000km, whichever comes first.We all have many factors to consider when choosing which transport option best suits our lifestyle, but for some of us, a hybrid could tick quite a few boxes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1c2fe19fd67bca653c753499a8cadf6d48eaffd/0_0_4893_2936/master/4893.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b8a66804da8d76926a240da37d432a04","title":"hybrid cars have to be plugged in and five other common misconceptions","story":"Complicated and costly? Think again. Driving a hybrid vehicle is a practical way to reduce emissions while being economical and fuss-free, say expertsAs awareness of the climate crisis grows and urban pollution levels creep ever higher, we’re all starting to think more about our carbon footprints. For those who are considering buying a car, which one to go with requires careful thought and research.Should we stick with petrol or diesel, take the plunge to buy an electric vehicle or maybe opt for a hybrid? Of these options, there tends to be the most confusion around hybrids. There are a lot of myths about these vehicles, many of them based on the early, less sophisticated versions that entered the market about 20 years ago. But it’s worth busting through these concerns and getting to grips with what hybrids can offer, as for many of us they can be an excellent choice for greener, more economical and fun motoring.“We were early to market with hybrids back in the late 1990s with the Insight and then the sportier CR-Z,” says Phil Webb, deputy general manager automotive at Honda UK. “These were arguably ahead of their time and are now modern classics. Fast forward 20 years and, while hybrids have changed drastically, the concerns around owning and driving them have not.”Here are some of the most common misconceptions.Myth one: hybrid technology is complicated and difficult to understandThere are different types of hybrid cars, and hearing terms such as “mild”, “full” and “plug-in hybrid electric vehicle” (PHEV) bandied around can be confusing. But it’s quite straightforward. A hybrid car is one that uses two forms of energy to maximise efficiency and reduce emissions. Usually this means combining electrical energy contained in batteries with the combustion energy of petrol or diesel fuel.“Hybrid cars were developed to reduce CO2,” explains Nick Molden, CEO of Emissions Analytics, a global emissions testing specialist. “They do it via two means. Firstly, there’s regenerative braking. When a vehicle brakes there’s a lot of wasted energy. Hybrids capture this energy into the battery and it can then be used to power the vehicle. Secondly, hybrids help the engine work at optimal efficiency as much of the time as possible. Electric power is suited to lower-speed stop-start driving such as you might do in a city. And petrol and diesel engines are more suited to driving at higher, constant speeds – for example, during motorway driving. Hybrid technology means that the two parts work together in harmony, each doing what it’s best at.”“We have deliberately made our hybrids incredibly easy to drive,” says Webb. “Our new CR-V hybrid has three driving modes pure electric, hybrid and engine-only – but what makes it easy to drive is the fact that the car will select the most fuel-efficient way of powering the car, so the driver doesn’t have to.”Myth two: hybrids have to be plugged inSome hybrids are plug-ins, while others are not. Plug-in hybrids have batteries that can be charged from a power outlet and can run on electric power alone for between 30 and 40 miles, before needing the petrol or diesel engine to kick in. But hybrid technology is also available in cars such as the CR-V hybrid, which does not need to be plugged in. And with both types of hybrid, “range anxiety” isn’t something you need to worry about – if the electrical energy runs out, they will shift over to the petrol or diesel engine.Myth three: hybrids are a cop-out. If we care about climate change we should be driving electric carsIn an ideal world, more of us would be driving electric cars. They have zero tailpipe emissions, so in terms of reducing CO2 and combating climate change they’re an excellent choice. But the fact is that electric vehicles aren’t practical for many people – especially those who live in flats or terraced houses and don’t have access to a charging point, or anyone who does a lot of long-distance driving.Tim Anderson, head of transport at the Energy Saving Trust, says: “For motorists who don’t have access to charging points, hybrids can be a worthwhile stepping stone towards reducing their CO2 emissions. They are more energy-efficient than their petrol and diesel counterparts and are easy to buy, drive and live with.”Myth four: hybrids aren’t fun to driveMotoring journalist Tim Barnes-Clay doesn’t agree. “Early hybrids used to feel quite different from ‘regular’ cars, with a lack of connection with the driver’s input and the vehicle’s road behaviour. But now hybrids can be a joy to drive on any road, including motorways. For example, the Honda CR-V hybrid uses CVT automatic transmissions, giving a continuous flow of smooth power.”Myth five: hybrids aren’t very stylishWhen hybrids first came out about 20 years ago they did look quite quirky and different. “However, designers have responded to what consumers want and hybrids are now styled to look as attractive as any other car,” says Keith Adams, editor of car-buying website parkers.Myth six: hybrids are too expensive“Although hybrid cars cost a bit more than their petrol and diesel counterparts, their fuel economy means that savings can be made in running costs,” says Adams. And with minimal running costs and excellent reliability, hybrids are in demand on the secondhand market and their resale value tends to be strong.Misconceptions about hybrids mean they can be seen as the worst of both worlds – not as green as electric cars, and less stylish and enjoyable to drive than conventional petrol or diesel vehicles. But for many motorists, they are the opposite, offering a practical and accessible way to reduce emissions while also being economical and fuss-free."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b9f2191029e5033edacd0e10f21cc1f48d654563/1386_1800_3526_2116/master/3526.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dcd005d88e378c8b805305f897f38f6b","title":"quiet as a deserted chapel test driving a hybrid car","story":" Mike Pattenden and his wife Andrea Walker take the Honda CR-V hybrid out for a spin. Here’s what they discover …Despite being the self-conscious subjects of a photoshoot in the busy car park in Bedfordshire’s Dunstable Downs, no one paid a blind bit of notice to us. Clearly, as a couple, my wife and I were as commonplace to the families, walkers and kite flyers up there on a breezy Sunday morning before lockdown as the Honda CR-V hybrid that was actually the quietly unassuming star of every shot.There were plenty of SUVs in view, even a few other Honda CR-Vs – hardly surprising, given it’s the world’s most popular SUV. More than 9m have been sold since it was launched back in 1995.When it comes to cars, “popular” is a good thing. It means dependable, safe and cheap to run and, consequently, as eye-catching as denim. And yet, this fifth-generation model of the CR-V is remarkable in its own way. It’s a hybrid with an engine that combines the best aspects of petrol combustion and electric to power it.Our CR-V is powered via a combination of a 2.0-litre Atkinson-cycle engine and two electric motors via Honda’s integrated motor assist (IMA) system, meaning it runs in three modes: EV, hybrid and petrol, constantly defaulting to electric at speeds below 30mph. In this mode, the electric motors are used to drive the wheels, using energy from the battery that was previously harvested from the petrol engine while driving at higher speeds. This means the petrol engine is generally used at lower revs, making it more fuel efficient and quieter.And, golly, is it quiet. Honda’s noise-cancelling system makes it feel like a deserted chapel as we drive around this Sunday morning, albeit one with heated pews.“You’d hear a squirrel squeak if you ran over one,” observes my wife as we drive stealthily over to Ivinghoe Beacon, where we like to walk at weekends. Luckily, no such tragedy occurs. Honda’s cross-traffic sensor warns me of a jogger as I begin to reverse (I spot him a moment later in the handy rear camera), and the CR-V hybrid has a collision detection system that prevents a rear-end shunt by slamming on the anchors for you. Having recently endured a trip to Bristol in horrendous stop-start motorway traffic, aggravated by a succession of these infuriating incidents, I’d make this feature mandatory in every car.As for efficiency, the car shifts modes seamlessly, meaning it’s incredibly thrifty, capable of 56mpg in town. You can have fun stretching its electric running, too, through regenerative braking via two paddles behind the steering wheel that slow it like changing down gears in a manual, although, given its powertrain, the CR-V hybrid is an automatic. And because of the way it tops up the batteries, there’s no recharging, so no “powernoia” on long journeys.“You don’t really have to do much, do you?” says my wife approvingly, when she takes the wheel. “I could get used to this.”On the motorway, the car switches to petrol mode at high speed and proves adept at eating up the miles in comfort. There’s a suite of driver-assist features including adaptive cruise control that will adjust distance to the car ahead, lane-keep assistance, in case you wander, and a speed limiter that will automatically maintain a specified speed – handy for the inevitable 50mph surveillance sections. For someone who views a future of driverless cars as dystopian, this level of autonomy feels perfectly acceptable to me.Inside, it’s roomy and well supplied with storage points. The centre console swallows my wife’s chunky handbag whole. There are cup holders for coffee addicts and bottle racks in the door pockets, along with charge points for phones.The boot is roomy enough for a dog. Put the rear seats down and you could probably fit a Shetland pony in. Shell out for the top-of-the-range EX model and it’s also automated, meaning you can open it by waggling your foot underneath, handy for the big shop. All but the most basic models boast a centre console with a 7in touchscreen. I had the radio set to 6 Music within a couple of minutes and the sound from the nine speakers was impressive. You can use its Garmin navigation system or set up a smartphone instead, if you wish.CR-V stands for “compact recreational vehicle”, but perhaps “considerately reinvented vehicle” is a better fit?Honda has raised the ambition of its Electric Vision strategy to ensure that all European mainstream models feature electrified powertrains by 2022, three years earlier than originally planned.

Plus the science behind Boris Johnson’s Covid-19 responseCharles Parker was a remarkable BBC radio producer who valued the voices of working people. He died 40 years ago, but is still remembered for the Radio Ballads, his landmark collaboration with the musicians Ewan MacColl and Peggy Seeger. Made in the late 1950s and early 60s, the Radio Ballads mixed folk music with the real voices of the documentary subjects, whether teenagers or railway workers before, such voices were always played by actors or made into scripts. (There have been more modern versions, but if you want to hear the originals, they’re on the MacColl family website. They used to be available via the BBC, but I couldn’t find them on Sounds.)Anyway, in 2005, an annual Charles Parker prize was established, for the best student radio feature. His daughter, Sara Parker, herself an audio producer, is very involved with the prize, and for the past few years the winners have had their work broadcast on Radio 4. Last week, the 2020 winners’ work went out as New Storytellers in the 15-minute afternoon slot before The Archers (which is, we note, still limping along in dreadful inner-thoughts-of-the-characters mode).Each piece was very different, though there was, perhaps, a theme of loss. Gabriel Green’s Palores, the Bird of Cornwall was almost whimsical. It told the story of the chough, a symbol of Cornwall for hundreds of years and once a very common bird. Flocks dwindled to almost zero in the 1970s, but there are more now, and the bird’s association with one local woman’s personal tragedy lifted this into more than just a soundscape. Projectionists, by Richard Queree, was also lovely. Queree simply talked to a few cinema projectionists, mostly John Newcombe, who, at 82, is Britain’s oldest. Most cinemas don’t use projectionists any more. They, too, are a dwindling flock. Living With Dementia was a prosaic title for Lewis Harrower’s engagingly experimental work his use of sound to convey the hearing difficulties of dementia sufferers, as well as his chatty approach, made a familiar subject into something personal.The best two programmes were pieces of investigative journalism, from Charlotte Hurrell and Alex Morgan. (Both young women went to Birmingham City University, so well done to that institution and course.) In Anything Goes in Holbeck, Hurrell went to Leeds to examine its dedicated zone for street sex workers. Hurrell and two of her friends hung out there, speaking to both sex workers and punters (“How much for a blowie?” one asked her). Lots of voices in this one, from a 14-year-old girl, constantly propositioned on her way to school, to a drunk guy offering to call Hurrell and her friends a cab for their own safety. Hurrell spotted him later negotiating with a sex worker, counting out his coins.The overall winner, This Ain’t My Life, was about a homeless man named Kane Walker. Morgan had met Walker crying on a Birmingham street and spent time talking to him her do-good feeling dissolved when Walker died a few weeks after they’d met. He froze to death. The programme used a shattering recording of Walker made by a homeless worker. “THIS AIN’T MY LIFE!” howled Walker his desperation made tears spring into my eyes. His friends said he went from a happy, boyish lad to someone completely different in just two weeks living on the streets. I wanted every one of these programmes to continue for longer than 15 minutes, but especially this one.Also on Radio 4, and also shattering in its own calm way, Led By the Science considered our government’s response to Covid-19 and whether or not it was “led by the science”. Philip Ball worked through how scientific committees once offered advice to politicians, and how Boris Johnson’s cabinet changed that. There were differing opinions as to the way scientists were used in communication roles and, indeed, as to what science actually is. “Science… isn’t chiselled in stone,” said one expert. Ball: “Science has no magic formula for conjuring certainties out of big unknowns.” In short, it’s not the job of scientists to make public policy decisions, no matter how hard Johnson tries to hide behind them. We can see you, big boy.Vick HopeMassively clever and unbelievably hard-working, Hope hosted Capital’s Breakfast show with Roman Kemp and Sonny Jay from 2017 until February this year.

There’s 73,000 sq ft of empty retail space up for grabs at 44 Union Square in the now boarded up neo-Georgian landmark that was once Tammany Hall. There’s more space to rent on the opposite corner and the neighbouring thoroughfares, Broadway and Fifth Avenue, some of New York’s retail arteries.The pandemic has hit Manhattan hard. The island is usually a shopping hub, home to flagship stores for retailers including Prada, Uniqlo, Macy’s and Nike. But the coronavirus is keeping the tourists and office workers that they rely on to justify their sky-high rents home.Many stores have simply shut up shop. Others are offering “curbside pick-up” for online orders or limiting entrance. A sign outside cupcake shop Baked by Melissa reads: “One Customer At A Time”. No one is queuing.Some brands and restaurants have already decided the city is just too expensive for them. Others with huge Manhattan stores, including Brooks Brothers, J Crew, JC Penney, have filed for bankruptcy.In June, data research group Zenreach forecast that visitors to the shops, restaurants and bars, event venues and so on that keep Manhattan, and other prime retail and entertainment areas, alive, would return to close to normal by September 2020.But as the virus continues to spread in the US the company has now revised its forecast, and sees no return to normal this side of 2021.For some it’s not just the pandemic that has triggered this crisis and “normal” may never return.Simon Collins, former dean of fashion for the prestigious fashion college Parsons School of Design in Manhattan, said many of the big stores in New York had become tired and the coronavirus had just hastened their inevitable doom: “People want something new. They don’t want to see the same things they can get anywhere. Where’s the experience? Why wouldn’t you just buy that online?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f17c991f2dccf559d73f0f191f6fc3a64051b9a0/0_66_5000_3001/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=16b285a0891a295e5bf61969d6bea398","title":"newsweek kamala harris citizenship apology","story":"Magazine’s opinion editor and editor-in-chief ended note by saying op-ed would remain on the site Newsweek has apologized for an op-ed that questioned the California senator Kamala Harris’ American citizenship and her eligibility to be Joe Biden’s running mate, a false and racist conspiracy theory which Donald Trump has not dismissed.“This op-ed is being used by some as a tool to perpetuate racism and xenophobia. We apologize,” read Newsweek’s editor’s note on Friday, which replaced the magazine’s earlier detailed defense of the op-ed.“We entirely failed to anticipate the ways in which the essay would be interpreted, distorted and weaponized,” read the apology, signed by Josh Hammer, opinion editor, and Nancy Cooper, global editor-in-chief.But the pair ended the note by saying that the op-ed would remain on the site, with their note attached.The op-ed was written by John Eastman, a conservative attorney who argues that the US constitution doesn’t grant birthright citizenship. Eastman attempted to sow doubt about Harris’ eligibility based on her parents’ immigration status. Harris’ mother was born in India and her father was born in Jamaica.Eastman ran unsuccessfully in the 2010 Republican primary as a candidate for California attorney general. Harris eventually won the election against Republican Steve Cooley.Newsweek had earlier defended the piece, arguing that Eastman “was focusing on a longstanding, somewhat arcane legal debate” about the 14th amendment and not trying to “ignite a racist conspiracy theory around Kamala Harris’ candidacy”.The conspiracy theory is false. Harris, who was tapped by Joe Biden to serve as his running mate on the Democratic ticket, was born in Oakland, California, and is eligible for both the vice-presidency and presidency under the constitutional requirements. The question is not even considered complex, according to constitution lawyers.Trump built his political career on questioning a political opponent’s legitimacy. He was a high-profile force behind the “birther movement” – the lie that questioned whether Barack Obama, the nation’s first Black president, was eligible to serve. Only after mounting pressure during his 2016 campaign did Trump disavow the claims.Asked about the matter at the White House on Thursday, Trump told reporters he had “heard” rumors that Harris does not meet the requirement to serve in the White House. The president said he considered the rumors “very serious”.Some Newsweek staff had publicly slammed the decision to run the oped. Christina Zhao, a New York news editor, tweeted: “This is an inflammatory and racist op-ed that should never have been published. That is my opinion.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d5d3f483cf2a42f85391d516784315f1ea3eac19/87_0_3483_2091/master/3483.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=44b2065ce2b6cfcd03513421325431e0","title":"us department defense ufo taskforce","story":"Taskforce to detect and anlyze unidentified aerial phenomena that could ‘potentially pose a threat’ to national security, Pentagon saidThe US department of Defense has formed a new body to investigate what it calls “unidentified aerial phenomena” (UAPs) to monitor reported sightings of what most people call UFOs.The move is likely to spark wide interest in alien hunters worldwide looking for signs that humanity is not alone in the universe, although the dry language of the Pentagon’s announcement of the new group belied its intent as watchers of the sky for potential first contact.The Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Task Force (UAPTF) was created by the deputy defense secretary, David Norquist, on 4 August, strengthening an already existing effort that since 2018 has been under the purview of the Office of Naval Intelligence.“The Department of Defense established the UAPTF to improve its understanding of, and gain insight into, the nature and origins of UAPs. The mission of the task force is to detect, analyze and catalog UAPs that could potentially pose a threat to US national security,” the Pentagon said in a statement.The move is only the latest from the Pentagon when it comes to UFOs.The Senate recently required the director of national intelligence and secretary of defense, working with other intelligence and law enforcement agencies, to prepare a public report of government findings on the UAP issue.In April the US also released three declassified videos that show US navy pilots encountering what appear to be unidentified flying objects.

Tehran’s foreign minister described the agreement as a “dagger … unjustly struck by the UAE in the backs of the Palestinian people and all Muslims”.As part of the US-brokered deal, the UAE claimed it won a concession for the Palestinians as Israel agreed to temporarily “suspend” its planned annexation of areas of the occupied West Bank.However, Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has been clear he remains committed to annexation, and Palestinian leaders slammed the UAE deal as a betrayal that damaged their cause.The new alliance has broken the status quo in which Israel was mostly isolated by its neighbours as a pariah.Jordan, which with Egypt was the only other Arab state to have recognised Israel before Thursday’s announcement, issued a statement acknowledging the deal without praising it.The Jordanian ruler, King Abdullah II, has been a prominent critic of Netanyahu’s plan to annex parts of the occupied West Bank. Amman said more progress on the Palestinian issue was needed.While the Palestinian issue has been sidelined regionally, mutual hostility towards Iran shared by Israel and several Middle East states has been a critical factor in their budding relations in recent years. Meanwhile, Washington has attempted to gather a coalition of Israel and autocratic Arab leaders against Tehran and its allies.Jared Kushner, Donald Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser, has said another Arab country is likely to establish ties with Israel in the coming days. Bahrain and Oman, which both welcomed the UAE move, are seen as likely candidates.Trump’s announcement on the UAE appeared to have blindsided the Palestinian leadership and their allies. The Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, suggested he had no forewarning of it.“The Palestinian leadership rejects and denounces the UAE, Israeli and US trilateral, surprising, announcement,” said his spokesman, Nabil Abu Rudeineh, adding that it was a betrayal of Jerusalem and the Palestinian cause.Elsewhere the deal has been widely welcomed, in large part because it was interpreted as halting annexation.The UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, called the accord “hugely good news”. He said: “It was my profound hope that annexation did not go ahead in the West Bank, and today’s agreement to suspend those plans is a welcome step on the road to a more peaceful Middle East.”Even Trump’s opponent in November’s US election, Joe Biden, said the UAE’s move was “a welcome, brave, and badly needed act of statesmanship” that would help ensure Israel remains an “integral” part of the Middle East.“Annexation would be a body blow to the cause of peace, which is why I oppose it now and would oppose it as president,” Biden said.The United Nations secretary general, António Guterres, said annexation “would effectively close the door for a renewal of negotiations and destroy the prospect of a viable Palestinian state and the two-state solution”.Anshel Pfeffer, an Israeli journalist and author of a Netanyahu biography, wrote in the Haaretz newspaper that the Israeli leader had won a significant diplomatic coup while giving nothing to the Palestinians, previously seen as a requisite for regional acceptance.“It is an achievement for Netanyahu that his predecessors who were prepared to make major concessions to the Palestinians only dreamed of,” he said. “A generation of western diplomats who thought that Israel needs to pay in hard currency for any such breakthrough with the Arab world were tearing their hair out last night.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f5733dadcd28213d07412c272cc1e53acf884c45/0_339_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0cac79b64d715fb881cdc686b3a0b310","title":"beirut explosion fbi lebanon investigation us","story":"US diplomat David Hale calls for a thorough and transparent investigation into the blastA team of FBI investigators is due to arrive in Lebanon this weekend to take part in the investigation into Beirut’s explosion, a senior US official has said, after visiting the location of the blast.David Hale, the US undersecretary of state for political affairs, called on Saturday for a thorough and transparent investigation. He said the FBI team was taking part at the invitation of Lebanese authorities in order to figure out what caused the 4 August explosion that killed nearly 180 people and wounded thousands.The cause of the fire that ignited nearly 3,000 tonnes of ammonium nitrate at Beirut’s port remains unclear. Documents have emerged showing the country’s top leadership and security officials were aware of the chemicals stored at the port. France is also taking part in the Lebanese-led investigation.“We really need to make sure that there is a thorough, a transparent and credible investigation. I know that is what everyone is demanding,” Hale said.Search and rescue crews flew in from around the world in the immediate aftermath. Hale toured the site of the blast with Lebanese army officers.Many Lebanese people want the investigation taken out of the hands of their government, fearing that bickering among the entrenched political factions, notorious for corruption, will not allow results to come to light that might damage their leadership.Top Lebanese officials, including President Michel Aoun, have rejected calls for an independent investigation, describing it as “a waste of time” that would be politicised.On Friday, the leader of the powerful Hezbollah group said he did not trust any international investigation, in a clear reference to the FBI’s assistance. Hassan Nasrallah said the cause of the explosion was still unclear, adding that any international investigation would also have to clear Israel of any responsibility in the port explosion.Nasrallah added that Israel would be met “with an equally devastating response” if the investigation pointed to its involvement.Israel has denied involvement and so far no evidence has emerged suggesting otherwise. However, Aoun, who is supported by Hezbollah, has said it is one of the theories being investigated.Hale also stressed the need for full state control over ports and borders, in an apparent reference to claims that Hezbollah holds influence over both in Lebanon. “We can never go back to an era in which anything goes at the port or borders of Lebanon,” he said.Lebanon’s government resigned on 10 August. For now, there are no formal consultations under way on who will replace Hassan Diab as prime minister and no likely candidate has emerged. But the flurry of diplomatic visits appeared to be designed to influence the forming of the new government.Public anger has risen over the ruling elite’s corruption, mismanagement and political uncertainty. Western leaders have said they will send aid directly to the Lebanese people and that billions of dollars will not be pumped into the country before significant reforms take place.On Friday, the United Nations launched a $565m (£432m) appeal for Lebanon with immediate humanitarian assistance and initial recovery efforts.Washington and its allies consider Hezbollah a terrorist organisation, and have accused the Iran-backed group of abusing government funds. Local media have speculated that Hale would be pushing for a government that excludes Hezbollah."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a755301fa33bb8fb74210e89305ea9a4d44907ff/77_0_2774_1664/master/2774.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ab1a84bc94058dde6b82b74c959daaf0","title":"iran calls us defeat over un arms embargo a humiliation","story":"President says US will unilaterally reinstate sanctions a day after only two countries voted for prolonging embargoDonald Trump has vowed to use a contentious provision to unilaterally reinstate UN sanctions on Tehran, following what Iran’s president said was a humiliating defeat for the US in its bid to extend an arms embargo on Tehran.A day after the UN security council overwhelmingly rejected a US resolution to extend the embargo, Trump said at a news conference at his New Jersey golf club: “We’ll be doing a snapback. You’ll be watching it next week.”The US president was referring to the contested argument that the US remains a “participant” in the 2015 Iran nuclear deal – despite Trump’s withdrawal from it – and therefore can force a return to sanctions if it sees Iran as being in violation of its terms.European allies have been sceptical on whether Washington can force sanctions, however, with experts saying a “snapback” threatens to plunge the council into one of its worst ever diplomatic crises.Iran’s president said earlier on Saturday that the US had suffered a humiliating defeat when the council voted on the American proposal on Friday.Russia and China voted against, while 11 members – including France, Germany and Britain – abstained. The US and the Dominican Republic were the only votes in favour.“I don’t remember the US preparing a resolution for months to strike a blow at the Islamic Republic of Iran, and it garners only one vote,” the Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani, said in a televised speech. “But the great success was that the US was defeated in this conspiracy with humiliation.”Iran’s foreign minister, Abbas Mousavi, wrote: “In the 75 years of United Nations history, America has never been so isolated”, while people on the streets of Tehran had mixed reactions.“This is an American political game. One day they give a resolution to the security council, the next they say they have taken Iranian fuel,” said a worker at the city’s grand bazaar, who gave his name only as Ahmadi.A drug store employee named Abdoli told AFP she was happy Iran won but added that it “should interact with the United States and establish relations”.The UN arms embargo on Iran is due to expire under a 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers, which allowed many international sanctions against Iran to be lifted in exchange for curbs on Iran’s nuclear programme. Donald Trump withdrew the US from the deal in 2018.“It’s a serious mistake, we regret that,” the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, said on Saturday of the security council vote in a news conference during a visit to Poland.Israeli’s foreign minister, Gabi Ashkenazi, said the security council’s decision not to extend the arms embargo on Iran could lead to further Middle East instability.“The extremist regime in Iran doesn’t just finance terrorism: it takes an active part in terrorism through its branches around the world and uses it as a political tool. This behaviour represents a danger to regional and international stability,” Ashkenazi said in a statement on Saturday.The security council vote followed a proposal made by the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, for a summit of world leaders to avoid “confrontation” over the American threat to trigger a return of all UN sanctions on Tehran. Trump also said Saturday he would “probably not” take part in the summit.“I think we’ll wait until after the election,” he said, with the US set to hold its presidential poll in November.Speaking in Poland, Pompeo made it clear the US would press on.“It is unfortunate that the French and the United Kingdom ... didn’t support what the Gulf states have demanded, what the Israelis have demanded ... I regret that deeply,” Pompeo told reporters.“The United States is determined to make sure that the Iranians and this regime, this theocratic regime does not have the capacity to inflict even more harm on the world.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f3e1ae492d06bd281022623da6541d4a58cd8aec/0_310_4647_2788/master/4647.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fcf357480496974917dca8866a1b5960","title":"new zealand coronavirus seven new cases confirmed","story":"Auckland’s lockdown extended for two weeks start of provincial women’s rugby season delayedNew Zealand reported seven new cases of coronavirus up to Saturday morning after a lockdown in Auckland was extended.Six of the seven new cases were linked to the cluster at the centre of all the previous community cases, said Ashley Bloomfield, the director-general of health.Up to Saturday, the authorities in New Zealand have reported 37 cases connected to the outbreak with 19 other people in quarantine.The lockdown in Auckland, home to 1.7 million people, was extended for nearly two weeks after New Zealand reported 12 confirmed cases of Covid-19 on Friday.The outbreak has delayed the start of the New Zealand women’s provincial rugby competition for at least two weeks.

I’m just really excited to get back to the beauty side of it all now.”Hollywood Bowl said 48 of its 61 centres were reopening on Saturday, with each operating with reduced numbers of lanes, reduced customer capacity, and groups restricted to a maximum of six people.Stephen Burns, the chief executive of Hollywood Bowl Group, said: “It’s a great relief to finally have clarity on when we can reopen after such unexpected and long delays. We’ve been ready to reopen in the fully government approved Covid-secure way for many weeks and our trained teams are eager to get back to work.“Our centres are spacious and well suited for social distancing, and we’ve put in place wide-ranging hygiene and sanitisation measures. ”Grosvenor Casinos, which has a portfolio of 52 casinos across the UK, said it was reopening 35 in England. Coronavirus safety measures include a capacity cap, voluntary PPE and face coverings for guests and staff, screens on gaming tables and machines, hand sanitiser stations and contactless payments.Jonathon Swaine, managing director at Grosvenor Casinos, said: “We’ve been ready to reopen safely for a number of weeks and we are delighted we can now finally welcome back our customers to enjoy our casinos safely once more.”Genting casinos said it would be opening the majority of its casinos on Saturday. A spokesman said: “After weeks of meticulous planning, we are fully confident that our casinos are ready for re-opening. This is what we have been building towards for some time now, and the delays we have experienced have of course been hugely frustrating and damaging to the business. The re-opening is therefore incredibly exciting for all involved and we cannot wait to welcome customers back into our casinos.”The lockdown restrictions were due to be eased on 1 August, but a rise in coronavirus cases at the time resulted in them being paused for two weeks.The reopening comes as the prime minister, Boris Johnson, announced tougher fines for people repeatedly not wearing a mask.At present, people who refuse to wear a face covering where it is required face a £100 fine, which can be reduced to £50 if paid within 14 days, but under the new measures, that penalty will double for subsequent offences, up to a maximum of £3,200.A clampdown on illegal gatherings of more than 30 people could result in those responsible being hit with spot fines of up to £10,000, a No 10 source indicated.Meanwhile, the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, said an estimated 160,000 holidaymakers were expected to try to return to the UK from France on Friday before the new quarantine measures were brought in.Travellers returning to or visiting the UK from France, the Netherlands, Monaco, Malta, Turks \u0026amp Caicos and Aruba after 4am on Saturday will be required to self-isolate for two weeks."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ca6e5088fa389908e0f625b11f18136a3a0157c6/0_146_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=303be7290a74524ccc2f89da8b261a15","title":"uk to mark 75th anniversary of victory over japan day","story":"VJ Day was declared when emperor Hirohito ordered his people to stop fighting in second world warThe 75th anniversary of VJ Day – the victory over Japan which signalled the very end of the second world war – has been commemorated with a series of events honouring those who fought in east Asia.A televised remembrance service took place at the National Memorial Arboretum in Alrewas, Staffordshire, where a two-minute silence at 11am was led by the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall.Boris Johnson read the exhortation before the silence, which was followed by a flypast by the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight over the arboretum.The RAF’s Red Arrows scheduled a UK-wide tour with flypasts to take place over the four nations’ capital cities. However, due to poor weather the flypasts over Edinburgh, London and Cardiff were cancelled.Instead, the Red Arrows flew over Glasgow Prestwick Airport, where the aircraft landed to greet three second world war veterans.Victory over Japan was declared on 15 August 1945, when the emperor Hirohito addressed his people and told them to stop fighting. The formal surrender of Japanese forces came on 2 September that year, the date traditionally commemorated by the US.The day began with a piper playing Battle’s Over at the Imperial War Museum’s HMS Belfast in London at sunrise, as part of a tribute entitled Waking Up to Peace. Military pipers also played at dawn in India, Australia, New Zealand and Nepal.The defence secretary, Ben Wallace, was joined by military chiefs as he laid a wreath at the Cenotaph in London on Saturday morning.Charles and the duchess laid poppy posies and wreaths at the Kwai Railway Memorial, while veterans looked on from nearby benches in order to maintain social distancing.The prince’s wreath read: “In everlasting remembrance, Charles,” while the duchess’s poppy posy read: “In everlasting remembrance of your service and sacrifice.”The Covid-19 pandemic has meant tributes to mark the landmark anniversary have been organised online and on television, with the Duke of Cambridge appearing on screens across the country in VJ Day 75: The Nation’s Tribute, a pre-recorded BBC programme filmed at Horse Guards Parade.William spoke of how King George VI addressed the nation as “the most catastrophic conflict in mankind’s history came to an end”.“As he marked the moment the world had long prayed for, King George expressed his pride in the international effort from across the Commonwealth and allied nations which secured success in the Asia-Pacific region,” he said.“We are forever grateful to all those who fought alongside us. It is hard for us to imagine what Victory over Japan Day must have felt like at the time a mix of happiness, jubilation and sheer relief, together with a deep sadness and overwhelming sense of loss for those who would never return home.“Today we remember those who endured terrible suffering and honour all those who lost their lives.”Shortly after 10am, the BBC broadcast the Friendship of Nations, which included 10 world leaders paying tribute to all who served. They included the Malawian president, Lazarus Chakwera, the Nigerian president, Muhammadu Buhari, and the Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison. The Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, Donald Trump and Johnson also delivered remarks.Johnson said: “On this 75th anniversary of the end of the second world war, we pay tribute to the heroes deployed thousands of miles away in the mountains, islands and rainforests of Asia. “Unable to celebrate the victory in Europe, and among the last to return home, today we recognise the bravery and ingenuity of those who, in the face of adversity, restored peace and prosperity to the world.“Their immeasurable sacrifice changed the course of history and at today’s commemorations, we take the opportunity to say what should be said every day – thank you.”The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, also paid tribute to those caught up in the conflict, saying they “gave so much, not only to defend our country but for freedom across the world”.Starmer said: “The conflict in the Pacific and south-east Asia was particularly cruel and saw many British, Commonwealth and allied troops lose their lives fighting for a better world and a better future.“On behalf of the Labour party, I want to pay tribute to the wartime generation, who through the horrors of conflict showed us the spirit and determination that we need to always remember and always be grateful for.“It’s important that as we face the challenges of today, we take inspiration from that generation. Through their community spirit and their bravery and their determination for a better world, they’ve shown us what we can achieve when we pull together.”In a special message, the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh – who himself was aboard HMS Whelp in Tokyo Bay as the Japanese signed the surrender aboard USS Missouri on 15 August, 1945 – gave “grateful thanks” to all those who fought for the allied nations.In a statement, the Queen said: “Prince Philip and I join many around the world in sending our grateful thanks to the men and women from across the Commonwealth, and allied nations, who fought so valiantly to secure the freedoms we cherish today.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/36170db42e3a436d4349b2cb09b78fde55877cd3/0_343_5174_3106/master/5174.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=81ec2e42b744a3aba8814e63051b2c5e","title":"go hard go early now new zealand goes back to the drawing board","story":"City of Auckland is under coronavirus lockdown – and ahead of election the government is being criticised over border control, quarantine and testingWhen scientists in Auckland began modelling an outbreak of Covid-19 in the city’s densely populated southern regions – situated right by the country’s only international airport – they hoped they were participating in a drill scenario.“This is exactly the type of outbreak we were worried about, and in fact it’s exactly what happened,” said Professor Shaun Hendy, who works modelling the progression of the disease for the government.Just last week New Zealand celebrated a significant milestone: 100 days free of the deadly disease, which has claimed 800,000 lives worldwide and 22 in New Zealand.But as the seemingly successful elimination strategy was being lauded, both domestically and overseas, the virus was stealthily circulating through the community, with at least one victim falling ill with symptoms as early as 31 July.Three of the person’s family members became infected in the next two weeks but a positive test was not returned until 11 August, by which time dozens more people in the country’s largest city – and its economic powerhouse – had fallen ill.The latest outbreak is a huge blow for the island nation, heralded as a global success story for effectively eliminating the virus in June after a tough seven-week lockdown, which, like similar lockdowns around the world, led to a growth in unemployment, a spike in domestic violence and a surge in mental health problems.“Go hard and go early” was New Zealand’s motto, and combined with strict border controls and high compliance with lockdown measures from “the team of 5 million” it seemed to have worked. Until now.“I was gutted obviously. We had reached 100 days so it does feel like a kick in the teeth,” said Dr Siousxie Wiles, a British microbiologist and science communicator who lives in Auckland, a city of 1.5 million.“But we know that with people coming in there is the chance this would happen.”Wiles praised the government’s resurgence strategy as “absolutely spot-on” and said it had shown an impressive ability to adapt and move swiftly through alert levels.“They have been very fast and very transparent. The speed which they moved people up the alert levels really frightened people, but this is the way to do it. What we will see now is: how quickly can you stamp out an outbreak?”The prime minister made the decision for Auckland to re-enter lockdown six hours after the first positive test result came back – light years ahead of the likes of Vietnam, South Korea, and the Australian state of Victoria all of whom were slower to reinstate lockdown.This decisiveness has won her widespread praise, apart from the opposition who said they should have been consulted.On Friday afternoon Ardern announced a softer resurgence plan than many had expected, one that will allow the economy – even in Auckland – to cope, if not flourish.Tracking and tracing cases related to the south Auckland cluster is the priority, and New Zealand police have been drafted in to help investigate the source or “index case” that kicked it off, with efforts focusing on the borders and the Ports of Auckland area, as well as a cool store facility that handled international freight in the city’s west.In addition, active cases are being quarantined in government-run hotels – a new measure adopted from some south Asian countries.Testing in the community has been ramped up with 30,000 tests conducted in 48 hours and labs working 24 hours. Auckland will remain at level 3 for an additional two weeks, giving health authorities time to test and track everyone related to the outbreak. The rest of the country will remain at level 2.The resurgence plan has earned the approval of epidemiologists, and so far, the compliance of the general public.But the fact it has to be enacted at all is being viewed as a major failure for the Labour coalition government, who are now just five weeks out from a general election. Attention is turning to the borders, where more than 30,000 people have entered a fortnight of mandatory quarantine on returning to New Zealand.Management of the dozens of quarantine hotels has long been lambasted as “shambolic” by the opposition, after a series of people escaped the facilities and made trips to the liquor store and supermarket, prompting the police and army to start regular patrols.In other cases, perhaps as many as 1,000 of them, returning New Zealanders were allowed to leave the facilities without being tested.Wiles called the oversight “deeply disappointing” while the Otago university epidemiologist Sir David Skegg said it was “extraordinary” that border workers were not being tested weekly, on a compulsory basis.“We haven’t been doing weekly testing of workers, so I think that may have turned out to be a missed opportunity to avoid this lockdown,” Professor Hendy said.Skegg agreed and called the government’s handling of the border complacent.“I think it is absolutely vital for our elimination status that we have the most stringent protections at the border.”The health minister, Chris Hipkins, has said all border workers would be tested for the virus by the weekend, but with the disease having circulated in the community for up to two weeks, the horse has well and truly bolted.In Auckland compliance with lockdown measures has been high, even as the city haemorrhages money – a calculated NZ$150m in the last three days alone.Zafer Isiklar is a cafe owner in the Auckland suburb of Mt Eden. He believes this outbreak is the result of incompetence. “They didn’t control the borders or manage quarantine well,” Isiklar said.The region of south Auckland is one of the most densely populated in the country, and the suburb of the latest outbreak is a mere 14km from the country’s only international airport.Hundreds of airport and border workers live in south Auckland, and its proximity to quarantine hotels also had it under Covid modellers’ microscope as a high-risk site for a potential outbreak.According to Statistics New Zealand half of all New Zealand’s overcrowded homes are in Auckland, with the highest rates in south Auckland. Pacific and Māori people are the most likely to live in overcrowded homes. If it was going to happen anywhere, it was here.But Hendy said there were some silver linings to New Zealand’s outbreak, and the prime minister has stressed that things are not complex or severe enough to warrant a level 4 nationwide lockdown, as so far the outbreak is limited to a single cluster.“We definitely have had the benefit of learning from what has happened in other countries,” Hendy said.“The Melbourne example was quite instructive. We learnt that suburban lockdown just didn’t work.”The prime minister has said that New Zealand will be building on it’s earlier success, which she calls “evidence-based”, “following the philosophy of hard and early.”“As we have said from the start, our overall Covid-19 strategy remains elimination. That means stamping out the virus whenever it comes back,” Ardern said.“We have been world-leading in our Covid response – we can do all of that again.”For Aucklander Craig Shearer, a software-developer from Hobsonville, any “science-based approach to handling the pandemic” wins his approval.“I think we have dodged a bullet,” Shearer says.Additional reporting by Phil Taylor in Auckland"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/145768436904c59f79c47320bf883c88345709f4/0_35_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=262ea31de5e7450cd2266afff3996480","title":"israel continues airstrikes on gaza in retaliation for hamas balloon bombs","story":"Israeli forces say they bombed Hamas targets for a fifth consecutive night as clashes broke out along borderIsraeli aircraft have bombed sites belonging to the militant Hamas group in Gaza for a fifth night in a row, the Israel defence force says.The military said early on Sunday that the airstrikes were in response to arson balloons that Hamas-affiliated groups sent across the Gaza frontier into Israeli territory.Clashes also broke out in the evening along the Gaza-Israeli border, the army said. A statement released by the Israel military said dozens of Palestinians burned tyres and hurled explosive devices and grenades towards the security fence while attempting to approach it.The Gaza health ministry said two demonstrators were wounded by Israeli gunfire.Over the past week Israeli forces have carried out repeated night-time strikes on targets linked to the Islamist group Hamas, which controls Gaza.The army says they are in response to the use of makeshift firebombs, attached to balloons and kites, that have been sent into parts of southern Israel, causing thousands of fires in Israeli farms and communities.There were 19 such Palestinian attacks on Saturday, according to Israeli rescue services.In response the army said “IDF fighter jets and aircraft struck a number of Hamas military targets in the Gaza Strip”. It said the targets hit included “a military compound and underground infrastructure” belonging to Hamas.Israel has also closed its Kerem Shalom goods crossing with Gaza and reduced the territory’s permitted Mediterranean coastal fishing zone, in response to the recent balloon launches.Despite a 2019 truce backed by the UN, Egypt and Qatar, the two sides clash sporadically with rockets, mortar fire and incendiary balloons.Gaza has a population of two million, more than half of whom live in poverty, according to the World Bank.Hamas “is responsible for all events transpiring in the Gaza Strip and emanating from it, and will bear the consequences for terror activity against Israeli civilians”, the IDF said.Khalil al-Hayya, a senior Hamas official, accused Israel on Saturday of not honouring an informal truce to ease the blockade it has imposed on Gaza since Hamas took it over in 2007.He told Hamas al-Aqsa TV that the Palestinian people in Gaza were experiencing slow death by the blockade."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e68d7328ea8c574f255b821563c25d742d017d6a/0_282_7155_4293/master/7155.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3ff9d7ae18f692cf85ad7cc6288de325","title":"the underwater future of the maldives in pictures","story":"By 2100 the island nation could be submerged.

My colleagues in Australia will take over shortly. The annual light display honouring victims of the 911 terror attacks is back on, US officials announced on Saturday, saying New York health officials will supervise this year’s tribute to ensure workers’ safety amid concerns related to the coronavirus pandemic. “This year it is especially important that we all appreciate and commemorate 911, the lives lost and the heroism displayed as New Yorkers are once again called upon to face a common enemy,” governor Andrew Cuomo said in a statement. The announcement came days after the National September 11 Memorial \u0026amp Museum cancelled the Tribute in Light over concerns the coronavirus might spread among crews creating twin columns of light to represent the World Trade Center in the Manhattan sky.Alice Greenwald, president and CEO of the 911 Memorial \u0026amp Museum, thanked former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg, Cuomo and the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation for their assistance in offsetting the increased costs associated with the health and safety considerations around the tribute this year. “This year, its message of hope, endurance and resilience are more important than ever,” Greenwald said in a statement. The Tunnel to Towers Foundation recently decided to hold an alternative 911 Never Forget ceremony after the National September 11 Memorial \u0026amp Museum announced family members will not read the names of the nearly 3,000 victims this year, because of the pandemic.France is to propose that masks be worn in shared workspaces as the country grapples with a rebound in coronavirus cases that rose again in the past 24 hours to over 3,000. Employment minister Elisabeth Borne said she would propose on Tuesday at talks with employer and union representatives that masks be compulsory in collective workspaces. Doctors have increasingly called for masks to be required in the workplace while the HCSP, a body advising the government on health policy, issued a recommendation calling for masks to be compulsory in all common indoor spaces. Mexico added back 52,455 jobs in August, president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said on Saturday, hailing the news as a sign of recovery after the country lost more than 1 million jobs in the formal economy due to the coronavirus pandemic. “This is a good indicator ... We’re going to move ahead in spite of everything because we’re working in a professional manner,” he said in a video on Twitter, citing data from the Mexican Social Security Institute (IMSS) on employees registered with the institute. IMSS said last week that 3,907 jobs were lost in July due to the pandemic, adding to 1.1 million jobs lost in the country between March and June, according to Reuters. Sir Keir Starmer has warned Boris Johnson it is his duty to ensure schools in England reopen in September as planned.Writing in the Mail on Sunday, the Labour leader said it was essential for the wellbeing and life chances of children that they were able to return to normal education next month.“So, let me send a very clear message to the prime minister: I don’t just want all children back at school next month, I expect them back at school. No ifs, no buts, no equivocation,” he said.“Let me be equally clear: It is the prime minister’s responsibility to guarantee children get the education they need and the benefit of being back with their teachers and classmates.“My offer to help the government reopen schools still stands, but responsibility for making it happen lies squarely at the door of Number 10.”Britain’s health secretary Matt Hancock will announce this week that Public Health England (PHE) will be scrapped and replaced by a new body specifically designed to protect England against a pandemic by early next month, the Sunday  newspaper reported. Hancock will announce a merger of the pandemic response work of PHE with NHS test and trace into a new body, called the National Institute for Health Protection, the newspaper said.The paper said the new body will become “effective” next month, although it will take until next spring to complete. The Conservative peer and former TalkTalk telecoms boss Baroness Harding, who currently heads Test and Trace, is being tipped to lead the organisation, the paper said. It quoted a senior minister as saying: “We want to bring together the science and the scale in one new body so we can do all we can to stop a second coronavirus spike this autumn.” The reported move follows repeated reports over recent months that ministers have been unhappy and frustrated with PHE’s response to the coronavirus crisis. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesman said: “Public Health England have played an integral role in our national response to this unprecedented global pandemic. “We have always been clear that we must learn the right lessons from this crisis to ensure that we are in the strongest possible position, both as we continue to deal with Covid-19 and to respond to any future public health threat.” The Emirati APEX National Investment company signed a “strategic commercial agreement” with Israel’s Tera Group to cooperate on research and development related to Covid-19, including a testing device. The deal “is considered the first business to inaugurate trade, economy and effective partnerships between the Emirati and Israeli business sectors, for the benefit of serving humanity by strengthening research and studies on the Novel Coronavirus,” the UAE’s state news agency WAM said late on Saturday, quoting APEX’s chairman Khalifa Yousef Khoury. The agreement was signed at a press conference in Abu Dhabi, coming soon after Israel and the UAE announced an agreement on Thursday that will lead to a full normalisation of diplomatic relations between the two states.Mexico will need up to 200 million coronavirus vaccine doses, according to a senior government official.The immunisation of its 120 million inhabitants could start as early as April if clinical trials and regulatory approvals for pharmaceutical firm AstraZeneca go as planned, Reuters reports.In partnership with the governments of Mexico and Argentina, AstraZeneca initially plans to produce 150 million doses in early 2021 and eventually make at least 400 million doses for distribution throughout Latin America. AstraZeneca is among those working on Covid-19 vaccine candidates around the world. Mexico’s government has also said it is considering other options for bringing a vaccine quickly to its population, the second-largest in Latin America. AstraZeneca will be able to produce between 30 and 35 million vaccines per month, Martha Delgado, a Mexican deputy foreign minister, told Reuters in an interview on Friday. The vaccine could require two doses to be effective, Delgado said. “If we need 200 million, we’re going to be vaccinating for a long time,” Delgado added. Last-stage so-called Phase III trials are expected to conclude by November or December, after which AstraZeneca will seek government approvals if the vaccine is found to be safe and effective. If that goes smoothly, Delgado estimated the first vaccines in Mexico could be administered in April. Mexico’s death toll of 55,908 stands as the world’s third highest behind the US and Brazil. Latin America’s 6 million cases and more than 237,000 deaths make it the world’s hardest-hit region. To ensure all Mexicans have access to a vaccine, the government of president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador is in talks with other pharmaceutical laboratories in different stages of developing a vaccine. “Astra’s production isn’t going to be enough for Mexico. We need to supplement that with a couple of more vaccines,” Delgado said. Mexico’s government has completed memorandums of understanding with French drugmaker Sanofi, Johnson \u0026amp Johnson’s Janssen unit, and Chinese companies CanSino Biologics Inc and Walvax Biotechnology Co Ltd. CanSino and Walvax are interested in producing a vaccine in Mexico for delivery to the Latin American market. The US Food and Drug Administration on Saturday granted emergency use authorisation for Yale School of Public Health’s saliva test to detect Covid-19, after a trial on National Basketball Association players and staff. SalivaDirect, the fifth saliva test approved by the FDA for the disease, requires no swab or collection device and uses spit from people suspected of having the coronavirus, the agency said.FDA commissioner Stephen Hahn called the test “groundbreaking” in its efficiency and in being unaffected by crucial component shortages. SalivaDirect is seen as a cheap, simpler and less invasive testing method that requires no extraction of nucleic acid and can use several readily available reagents. The NBA has used the test in a programme involving asymptomatic players, coaches and staff from various teams after partnering with Yale in June, the school said in a separate statement. “We simplified the test so that it only costs a couple of dollars for reagents, and we expect that labs will only charge about $10 per sample,” said Nathan Grubaugh, assistant professor at Yale School of Public Health. The FDA said the test could lower the risk to healthcare workers as the sample is self-collected, under the observation of a healthcare professional.Algeria started reopening its mosques, cafes, beaches and parks on Saturday for the first time in five months, gradually relaxing one of the world’s longer virus confinement periods.Curfews remain in place in more than half the country, and masks are required outdoors as Algeria tries to keep virus infections down, the Associated Press reports.But authorities decided to start reopening public places, saying the virus infection rate is believed to have stabilised.Crowds packed beaches on Saturday in the capital, Algiers, celebrating the opportunity to swim in the Mediterranean Sea during the August heat.Restaurants were also allowed to reopen, and mosques that can hold more than 1,000 people and ensure social distancing measures.However, mosques remain closed to all women, children and the elderly until further notice, and the main weekly prayers on Friday will remain banned to limit crowds. Mosque-goers must wear masks and bring their own prayer mats.This reopening will depend entirely on the discipline of each person to respect protection measures, said the minister for religious affairs, Mohamed Belmahdi, who was among those attending the first services on Saturday at Khaled Ibn El Walid mosque in the resort town of Heuraoua, east of Algiers.He warned that authorities would close mosques again if Algerians show even a slight indifference toward preventive measures. “The health of citizens comes before faith,” he said. Algeria has reported more than 37,000 virus infections and 1,350 deaths as of Friday, the third-highest death rate reported in Africa after South Africa and Egypt.Greek authorities have announced 230 new coronavirus cases over the past day, 27 from international arrivals, the daily I Kathimerini reported.There were also 3 new deaths.Total Covid-19 cases in Greece now stand at 6,858 with 226 deaths. There are 23 patients on ventilators, while 136 have recovered after having been treated in intensive care units.The sharp rise in new daily cases in August, and local outbreaks coinciding with the late opening of the tourist season after two months of strict lockdown, have led the government to impose new social distancing measures and restrictions. From Monday, bars, cafes and restaurants in many parts of the country, including the capital Athens, will have to close at midnight and not reopen before 7am.South African president Cyril Ramaphosa said on Saturday that all indications were that South Africa had reached the peak of Covid-19 infections, as he announced a sweeping removal of lockdown restrictions on the economy. In a televised address, Ramaphosa said the government would end the ban on alcohol and tobacco, allow restaurants and taverns to return to normal business, subject to strict hygiene regulations, and remove the ban on travel between provinces. “All indications are that South Africa has reached the peak and moved beyond the inflection point of the curve,” Ramaphosa said, adding that the cabinet had decided to move to lower, “level two” restrictions from midnight on Monday. “The move to level two means that we can remove nearly all of the restrictions on the resumption of economic activity across most industries,” he said. He said a fall in the infection rates, as well as people recovering, were “significantly reducing the pressure on our health facilities”, but he cautioned that cases could easily surge if people fail to maintain vigilance. Restrictions on international travel remained in place, he said. South Africa has more than half a million cases, but the rate of infections has declined over the past two weeks. One person who tested positive for coronavirus in Wales has died, bringing the country’s total number of deaths since the beginning of the pandemic to 1,587. Public Health Wales said the total number of cases in the country increased by 27, bringing the revised total of confirmed cases to 17,543. Students in Saudi Arabian public schools will be educated via distance learning for the first seven weeks of the new school year, the country’s minister of education said on Saturday, as a precaution against the spread of coronavirus. During that time, the situation for the remainder of the school year will be evaluated, Hamad bin Mohammed Al Shaikh said in remarks carried on the state-run al-Ekhbariya TV channel, according to Reuters.University and technical schools will be online for theory-based curriculums and in person for practical curriculums, he added. Saudi Arabia has seen more than 297,000 cases of coronavirus."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/071c9c168159f3facc6bb2c977c33b0acccbb975/0_231_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7a8947ab3714db26ca3074dfd952ef84","title":"coronavirus live news australia close to vaccine deal england scraps public health agency","story":"Australian health minister ‘genuinely optimistic’ about vaccine in 2021, as British health secretary announces new pandemic authority and France records 3,000 new casesFederal health minister Greg Hunt believes Victoria is seeing the early signs of flattening the curve.Hunt said on the best medical advice he had received, Victoria is on a path to progressive reduction.“There is a long way to go. There will be good days, there will be bad days. There will be days when the numbers are up and days when the numbers are down,” he told Sky News’ Sunday Agenda program.“But the signs now are that the trend is of progressive reduction.”He said the most important thing now is contact tracing to make sure each new case in Victoria is followed up.But Australian Medical Association president Omar Khorshid believes there are just too many people with the virus for contact tracers to keep up.“Once you get hundreds and hundreds of cases a day, you’ve then got to find 10 to 20 to 50 to 100 people per case,” Dr Khorshid told the Nine Network’s Weekend Today program.“It’s just impossible for contact tracers, and it’s why it’s so important that the general lockdowns are in place.”South Korea on Sunday reported 279 cases of the new coronavirus, the most cases since early March, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) said.Out those, 267 were locally transmitted cases, mostly in Seoul and surrounding areas.The new cases bring the country’s tally to 15,318 infections, and 305 deaths, as of Saturday midnight.Queensland premier Annastacia Palaszczuk remains unapologetic regarding the hard border closures with the state’s southern neighbours, crediting the shutdown with allowing Queensland’s economy to reopen.“Until there is a vaccine, life will not return to normal,” she told reporters on Sunday.Queensland’s hospitality and tourism businesses have enjoyed a much-needed revenue boost over the long weekend in the state’s south-east following another day of no coronavirus infections.The state recorded no new infections on Sunday and just nine active cases, including two crew members on a cargo ship off the Queensland coast who remain in hospital after testing positive to the virus on Friday.If community transmissions remain low Palaszczuk said some restrictions impacting the tourism sector could be relaxed by September.A man has died of Covid-19 in New South Wales.The death of the man, who was in his 80s, takes the state’s death toll to 54 and the national toll to 396.The health department has also provided some more details on the five new cases reported in the state.Previous cases have attended the below venues. Anyone who attended these venues at the following dates and times are considered to be casual contacts, and should monitor for symptoms and immediately get tested and isolate if symptoms occur, however mild:A quick summary at the end of the Andrews press conference giving an update of the last 24-hour reporting period.“This is a tough year and we’re going to get through this, all of us,” says Andrews. “We’re tough people ... and we’re all this together.”New Zealand on Sunday reported 13 new confirmed cases of the coronavirus for the last 24 hours, as the country’s first outbreak in months continues to grow.All but one of the new cases were community transmissions and appeared to be linked to a cluster in Auckland where the most recent outbreak started, the director general of health, Ashley Bloomfield, told a media briefing in Wellington. The 13th infected person was a traveller returning from abroad and in a managed quarantine.The new cases bring the number of active cases in New Zealand to 69. Since the start of the year, the country has recorded 1,271 cases, Bloomfield said.On improving communication with families of people in aged care, Andrews says he and the prime minister have talked about it, and how staff can balance the work of caring and the extra stuff like helping a resident with an iPad to contact their family on Zoom.“Getting information to people quickly, I can appreciate that’s something families need and we’re all committed to getting that done.”“We are going to see further chains of transmission, but the trend is good,” says Sutton.He says the reproduction rate is about 0.86 and the last time he looked at it, it was 0.97.Two key quotes here on managing expectations for the short to mid term:Sutton: “Spain had kids not able to leave home for six weeks, they had people exercising only within 150 metres of their home..they still had months of ongoing transmission. It doesn’t turn off overnight.”Andrews: “Even when this second wave is over, we will still see cases...The notion of completely extinguishing it and never seeing it again, I think that would be an unlikely outcome.”Victoria police have given out 243 fines in the past 24 hours, including 84 for breaching curfew. About 30 apiece were for not wearing masks or being caught at a vehicle checkpoint, including a Torquay man driving 140km away from his home, allegedly looking for better surf.Brett Sutton is asked about the effect of Victoria police releasing details every day, and if this is “shaming”.“I don’t think the police intend to shame anyone,” says Sutton, , but people do need to be “called out” for some breaches.“I think it’s overwhelmingly the case that people are doing the right thing.”Andrews pleads with people in regional Victoria to get tested, as numbers are stabilising.He said there were 158 active cases in Geelong, 49 in Bendigo, and 27 in Ballarat.“If there is one ask which is a takeaway from today’s briefing, it’s if people in those regional cities … can come forward and get tested. That is the really important part of us keeping the numbers in regional Victoria low.”Andrews is noting there are still outbreaks today but far fewer than a few weeks ago when the state was “at a tipping point”. He’s cautiously optimistic that the measures are working and that the state is on track to wind back from stage four restrictions in six weeks."},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"\u0026lsquoExtensive Irish commitment to data centres\u0026rsquo could cause cost to consumer, study findsBuyers may want to go green, but for those travelling long distances the range is smallReform needed to safeguard \u0026euro6bn income while promoting electric vehicles, economist warns"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Michael Viney: North Atlantic\u0026rsquos top predator now shares island with 13 other speciesMichael Viney: The wayside ashes of the west stand as defiantly healthy emblems of their kindInidual ants are certainly not smart, but their group wisdom may exceed our ownMichael Viney: Irish numbers have more than doubled since the counts of Operation Seafarer in 1970Michael Viney: A predator denning in parks, gardens and wasteland gets mixed responsesA beefed-up, independent National Parks and Wildlife Service would be just the ticketMichael Viney: Wild grasses have loved the mood swings of our climate this yearAnother Life: As one of many of the world\u0026rsquos declining seabirds, puffins are now receiving much more necessary and serious attentionAnother Life: A new book on the founders of the Tyler Prize shows their political influenceAvian science journal Ibis reports \u0026lsquogreat conservation concern\u0026rsquo about the speciesAnother Life: Dairy farmer Bruce Thompson examines impact of worming drug on beetlesMichael Viney: Crumbling hilltop trig pillars\u0026rsquo played key role in the mapping of IrelandAntipodean flatworms pose risk to indigenous variety which could have severe knock-on effectsAnother Life: Some floaters circle territories and sneak the odd \u0026lsquoextra-pair copulation\u0026rsquoMichael Viney: Plant intelligence rests in the ways by which they solve their problemsA Life on Our Planet is a terrifying catalogue of our self-sabotaging transgressionsGreys carry squirrel-pox virus which is fatal to Ireland\u0026rsquos native redsAnother Life: The disappearance of this bird from cities has prompted much researchRobinson has followed Mair\u0026eacutead, his wife and collaborator, into the list of Covid-19 fatalitiesWill Covid-19 begin a resurgence of the 1970s withdrawal from growth-driven capitalism?Greater industry involvement required if bovine TB to be eliminated by 2030 target"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

File photograph: Dara Mac DónaillThe In a statement today, Minister for Tourism Catherine Martin said she had accepted his resignation. “Tourism and hospitality have suffered significant losses since the start of this pandemic, with the industry in the three midlands counties of Laois, Kildare and Offaly particularly affected at present,” she said. “While Italy is on the green list, meaning that people who return from there do not have to restrict their movements, the Government has called on people to avoid all non-essential travel. Many of our citizens and residents have followed this guidance at some personal and financial cost to themselves.”She said the Government and her Department in particular has encouraged people to holiday in Ireland this year, with the vast majority of people heeding that call.“I was disappointed to learn that the chair of Fáilte Ireland was holidaying in Italy. I rang Mr Cawley this morning and he has offered his resignation which I have accepted. I wish to thank Mr Cawley for his service as chair of Fáilte Ireland.”She said Mr Cawley had served with “energy” over his time as chair and she thanked him for his service to the cause of tourism promotion in Ireland. “He recognises that solidarity with the industry is extremely important at this time, and I have accepted his resignation this afternoon because I believe his position was untenable,” she said.DistractionMr Cawley according to a report in this morning’s Irish Independent, is in Italy for a holiday. He told the paper it was a “family decision and a personal decision” to travel. He said he planned to take two holidays in Ireland this year, and that he had met family members who lived abroad on the Italian trip. In a statement on Saturday afternoon Mr Cawley said it was with great regret that he had tendered his resignation.He said: “It is with great regret that I have this morning tendered my resignation as Chairman of Fáilte Ireland to Minister for Media, Tourism, Arts, Culture, Sport and the Gaeltacht, Catherine Martin TD.“As has been reported in the media this morning I am on a pre-arranged family holiday in Italy, which is on the Government green list. As I have no wish to allow this issue to become a distraction from the important work of Fáilte Ireland in rebuilding the Irish tourism industry, I have decided after six years in the position to step down. I fully support the Government’s policy on tourism and I will continue to help the industry emerge from its current difficulties. It has been a privilege to serve as chair of Fáilte Ireland and to have contributed to the massive growth which Irish tourism has enjoyed prior to this global pandemic”.CEO of Fáilte Ireland Paul Kelly thanked Mr Cawley for his “strong chairmanship” and contribution to Fáilte Ireland and to the tourism industry since his appointment as chairman of the authority in 2014.“Michael has been an invaluable support to the executive team at Fáilte Ireland. He has made a significant contribution to developing and growing the tourism sector in Ireland. On behalf of the executive team and staff I want to express my thanks to Michael and I wish him well in the future,” he said. LeadershipSinn Féin’s spokeswoman on tourism Imelda Munster said the holiday was “a crass error of judgement”.“It shows a desperate lack of leadership… lots of us have family abroad and haven’t seen them, most people would have liked to holiday abroad this year,” she said. “For the head of a tourism board to jet off like that depicts a lack of leadership and no faith in his own industry. (It is) a slap in the face for his own industry, which is on its knees.”Senator Mark Wall, the Labour Party spokesman on tourism, said it was “unbelievable”. “I travelled into the town of Athy and other towns in south Kildare yesterday in the business of tourism, they’re on their knees.”Fáilte Ireland has been the main State agency responsible for a months-long campaign to encourage people to take holidays at home in order to support the domestic tourism industry, which is uniquely exposed to the economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. Italy is on the Government’s so-called “green list” of destinations, meaning normal precautions apply to travel there, with no period of restricted movement expected for those arriving into the State from there. However, the Department of Foreign Affairs continues to advise against non-essential travel overseas. Mr Cawley was paid €21,000 in board fees for each of 2017 and 2018, the most recent years for which information is available. The issue also drew criticism from those in the hospitality trade. Adrian Cummins, the chief executive of the Restaurants Association of Ireland, said “leadership starts at the top and this is definitely poor judgement and shows how out of touch the chairman of Fáilte Ireland is at a moment in time when our tourism industry needs every support it can get.“Restaurants and tourism businesses across the country are struggling to stay afloat, but when you see the chairman of the national tourism board not leading by example it’s shocking optics.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4331413.1597525894!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus 200 new cases reported in largest daily total since may","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSome 25 cases have been identified as community transmission, with 68 per cent of cases among those under 45 years of age.  File photograph: Alan BetsonThere have been 200 new cases of Covid-19 reported on Saturday , the Department of Health has confirmed. It brings to 27,191 the number of confirmed cases of Covid-19 in the State.No new deaths were reported. A total of 1,774 people have died of the disease.It is the largest number of cases reported in a single day since the beginning of May. Dr Ronan Glynn, the acting chief medical officer, said the situation facing the country is “deeply concerning”. The Republic now has “multiple clusters with secondary spread of disease and rising numbers of cases in many parts of the country,” he said, adding the National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) will “monitor this extremely closely over the coming days”. Some 25 cases have been identified as community transmission, with 68 per cent of cases among those under 45 years of age. Sixty-eight of the cases are confirmed to be associated with outbreaks or are close contacts of a confirmed case. Of the new cases, 81 are in Kildare, 56 are in Dublin, and 13 are in Tipperary, where a mushroom facility was closed on Friday following an outbreak among staff at Walsh’s mushrooms in Golden, near Cashel.The HSE has set up a testing facility in the town.“This virus is still out there and has not gone away. Covid-19 seeks to capitalise on complacency and is just waiting for the opportunity to spread. I am asking everyone, especially those who are over 70 or medically vulnerable, to limit your contacts, keep your distance from other people and take extra care to heed public health advice,” Dr Glynn said.Eight cases were recorded in Limerick, six in Laois and Galway, and five each in Meath and Kilkenny. The remaining 20 cases are in Carlow, Clare, Cork, Donegal, Louth, Mayo, Offaly, Roscommon, Waterford and Wicklow.Validation of data has led to the denotification of four confirmed cases.RedoubleThe Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly said a number of our EU neighbours are also experiencing an uptick in cases. “The virus capitalises on complacency. Please redouble your efforts on handwashing, physical distancing and reduce your contacts,” he urged in a message on Twitter.He said the spike in cases in young people is a real concern. “They can get very sick, but do so less frequently than older people. But young people can transmit the virus to anyone. The decisions you make about who you meet and where you go are hugely important,” he said.“It may not be your life but your choices could be the difference between life and death for someone else - someone you love. Remember that most people are susceptible to this virus,” he added.The HSE’s CEO Paul Reid said the number of cases on Saturday was a concern but people should hold firm. HospitalMeanwhile the number of confirmed and suspected cases of Covid-19 in the hospital system continued to remain steady at the end of the week, new figures released by the Health Service Executive (HSE) show. As of 8pm on Friday evening, there was a total of 14 confirmed cases admitted to hospitals, and a further 136 suspected cases across 29 acute hospitals monitored by the health service. This is an increase of one confirmed case and a decrease of two suspected cases when compared to the same time the previous day. When compared with the same time last week, it is an increase of two confirmed cases and 24 suspected cases. There are currently 308 vacant general beds, excluding critical care beds, across the hospital system. Some 33 adult critical care beds are available, in addition to six paediatric beds and 15 critical care beds in the private system. A total of 284 critical care beds are occupied, including eight occupied by Covid-19 patients. A further nine patients with suspected cases of Covid-19 are in critical care beds. Five confirmed cases are ventilated, as well as three suspected cases.The latest data on contact tracing shows the average time taken from referral for a test to obtaining a lab result is two days. This is a slight increase on the same day last week, when the process was being completed in 1.8 days. The average time to complete contact tracing calls is 1.8 days, an increase on last week’s figure of 1.2 days. NorthEarlier, the Department of Health in Northern Ireland reported a further 65 diagnoses of Covid-19 there on Saturday. The total number of cases in the region is now 6,364 there were no further deaths linked to the disease, with the toll remaining at 558.

Photograph: Bryan O’BrienSchools have been urged not to impose financial pressure on families by directing parents to provide clean sets of school uniforms each day.Some parents have expressed concern about recent communications from certain schools urging that freshly-laundered uniforms or school-branded tracksuits be worn every day in order to help limit the spread of Covid-19.There is no reference in public-health guidance to daily washing of school uniforms or any clothes, and acting chief medical officer Dr Ronan Glynn has confirmed no such advice has been issued by health authorities.A Department of Education spokesman said “current policy on school uniforms remains a matter for the board of management of each inidual school”.One mother, whose twins attend a Co Limerick primary school, said she received a note last week “encouraging” parents to have two to three crested tracksuits, “one should be washed and dried every day”. The mother said the crested tracksuits cost €35-€40 each. “That means, having twins, I may have to buy six tracksuits which are also very cumbersome to wash.”Jean Leonard, principal of the Assumption Junior School in Walkinstown, Dublin, said she was changing policy so that all pupils would wear tracksuits, whereas until now those in first and second class wore a uniform. “We are doing this because they are easier to wash,” she said. The principal said she was not asking parents to launder the tracksuits every day because it would be difficult for some, such as those living in accommodation for homeless who had no laundry facilities easily available.“I do think most parents will choose to do it and would like other parents to, but we are conscious there has not been a directive from the department on this.”Paul Rolston of the National Parents’ Council Post-Primary warned any new requirements, such as changing uniforms on a regular basis or buying additional supplies, could put parents under financial pressure. “There are issues to do with dry clean-only uniforms, cost consideration and hassle,” he said. Páiric Clerkin, chief executive of the Irish Primary Principals’ Network, said: “At primary, a lot of schools have tracksuits and uniforms, so there could be flexibility there. We expect schools and boards of management will be pragmatic, support families and come up with flexible approaches which put families at ease.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Covid-19 outbreak spreads to more than 30 people and extends beyond capitalJacinda Ardern sounds warning as number of cases in locked-down Auckland rises to 17Hundreds of police had raided Apple Daily in move decried as assault on press freedom\u0026lsquoGoing hard, going early with lockdown is still the best response,\u0026rsquo Jacinda Ardern saysReturn to nationwide restrictions announced by PM Jacinda Ardern in surprise press conferenceReaders queue from 2am to buy pro-democracy tabloid after owner Jimmy Lai\u0026rsquos arrestFair Work Commission\u0026rsquos decision that man made \u0026lsquooffensive\u0026rsquo video overturned on appealMaria Ressa\u0026rsquos news organisation Rappler is a buffer against dictatorship in PhilippinesLai has been a prominent democracy activist and an ardent critic of BeijingAuthorities warn against complacency as other countries battle a resurgenceCrack in hull of Japanese-owned ship is spilling oil into country\u0026rsquos famed blue lagoonsAttitudes still shaped by legacy code of conduct that dictates women must be submissive and patientAircraft with 190 passengers and crew on board overshoots runway in heavy rain in CalicutAbe avoids reference to nuclear treaty during scaled-back ceremony due to coronavirus\u0026lsquoWhat frightened me the most was how we got used to the piles of dead bodies\u0026rsquo \u0026ndash survivorIndia\u0026rsquos supreme court handed site to Hindus last year in culmination of complex disputeChina says attempts by Washington to engage more closely with Taipei \u0026lsquodoomed to fail\u0026rsquoCountry\u0026rsquos move closer to China set to be confirmed after unusually subdued pollThree men stuck on tiny Pikelot Island after boat ran out of fuel spotted by military aircraftAustralian state to deploy military, impose hefty fines to enforce Covid-19 isolationStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4331432.1597521852!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"french daily covid 19 cases rise above 3 000 in post lockdown high","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe Louvre Museum in Paris.

That Biden chose a candidate so evidently symbolising generational change has raised some Democratic hopes that he is resurrecting the winning Obama-Biden combination of 2008 and 2012. Photograph: Robyn BeckAFP via Getty ImagesThis week, after the most sedate US presidential campaign in recent memory, due to coronavirus, the 2020 election race suddenly got interesting.On Wednesday, hordes of media representatives and Democrat supporters descended on the small state of Delaware to witness what is likely to be the most consequential political decision of Joe Biden’s long career. A day earlier, Biden had named Kamala Harris, a daughter of immigrants and member of the US Senate, as his running mate in November’s election as he seeks to unseat Donald Trump.Hours before their first appearance together at a suburban Delaware high school, supporters were showing up, undeterred by the fact that they would be unable to witness in person this moment of history because of Covid-19 restrictions.“I just felt I wanted to be here,” said Pam, a retired African-American woman who had driven north from Maryland. “They’re the perfect ticket. I have always admired Joe. And Kamala – her intelligence, her experience. She is willing to grow, to do, to help the ordinary person.”That Joe Biden chose to hold one of the key moments of his presidential campaign in Delaware is not surprising.Though born in an Irish-American household in Scranton, Pennsylvania – a connection that his critics say he overplays at every opportunity to demonstrate his homely, man-of-the people, persona – the small state of Delaware, half way between New York and Washington DC, has been his home for more than six decades.Service stationOffaly’s Barack Obama Plaza notwithstanding, few other politicians have a motorway service station named after them. Biden does – the Biden Welcome Center is a recognisable stop-off on the busy I-95 freeway that tracks the east coast.Biden’s secluded lakeside home, surrounded by satellite trucks and media vans this week, is just a few miles away from the high school where Wednesday’s event took place. So too is St Joseph of the Brandywine’s cemetery, the resting place of his son Beau who died in 2015 of brain cancer at the age of 46.Joe Biden’s life story is one of professional triumphs and personal tragedies. In 1972, a week after he was elected to the Senate for the first time at the age of 29, his wife and 13-month daughter were killed in a car crash. His two young sons, Beau and Hunter, survived but spent weeks in hospital. Biden was sworn-in as senator at the hospital bed of one of his sons. He then began the daily commute from Delaware to Washington DC by train to make sure he was always there to give them breakfast.Over the next 40 years, Biden carved a career as a Washington insider as he rose up the ranks of the Senate. He developed a reputation as a bridge-builder, an east coast Democrat who once worked as the only white lifeguard in a predominantly African-American pool, but who could work with arch-conservative Republicans across the aisle.But this bipartisanship brought its own questions – most notably his willingness to work with known segregationists in the Senate.As chair of the senate judiciary committee in the early 1990s he oversaw the Anita Hill hearing, established to investigate allegations of sexual assault brought by Hill, a young African-American government employee, against supreme court nominee Clarence Thomas.Fresh scrutinyHis handling of the episode would come under fresh scrutiny almost 30 years later during the 2020 campaign at the height of the #MeToo movement. So too would his support for the 1994 crime Bill signed by then president Bill Clinton that led to a steep rise in the incarceration rates for black men.The decision by the young senator from Illinois, Barack Obama, to select Biden as his running mate in 2008 surprised many. Biden, then chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, had helped introduce the young Obama to the workings of the upper chamber when he was elected in 2004.But the choice of Biden proved politically astute – adding a generational weight to the experience-lite Obama ticket. “I want someone with gray in his hair,” he reportedly told confidantes. Though temperamentally very different – the loquacious and gaffe-prone Biden contrasted with the reserved, almost austere Obama – they developed a strong working relationship.Twelve years later, Biden has now been faced with the same choice as Barack Obama – who to pick as his own vice-presidential candidate as he seeks to dislodge Donald Trump from the White House.After a months-long selection process, involving teams of lawyers vetting and interviewing almost a dozen woman, Biden named Kamala Harris, a 55-year-old senator from California, this week.The choice was paradoxically the least surprising, and the most radical.Harris, a highly accomplished prosecutor who has impressed through her forensic questioning of Trump officials and US supreme court justice Brett Kavanaugh in her role as senator, was always the most likely choice. She has been the front-runner since ending her own presidential bid last December, a campaign that now appears to have been well-conceived given that it dramatically raised her national profile. \u0026nbspBut the fact that Biden has chosen the first black and Indian-American vice-presidential candidate of any political party without much fuss suggests how far the US has come in terms of what it expects from its political figures.Civil rights marchesHarris was raised in Berkeley, California. Her mother, a PhD student from India, met her father, a Jamaican-born academic, during the civil rights marches of the 1960s.Harris and her younger sister attended services at a black Baptist church and a Hindu temple when they were growing up, with Harris choosing to attend the historically-black institution of Howard University in Washington DC. After law school back in California, she embarked on a successful career as a prosecutor, serving as district attorney of San Francisco and attorney general of California.In 2013 she met her husband, Doug Emhoff, on a blind date. The pair married a year later and she is stepmother to his two children.In her first public appearance with Biden at the Greenville high school this week, a beaming Harris gave some hints of how she intends to campaign over the next 80 days, as she delivered a commanding and comprehensive speech. \u0026nbspShe took on Trump directly – as a former prosecutor, she said, the case against Trump and Pence is “open and shut” –\u0026nbspand she outlined her commitment to racial justice, climate change, as well as plans to deal with the coronavirus pandemic.Harris also spoke in moving terms about her friendship with Biden’s late son Beau. Both served as state attorneys general at the same time, and Biden himself has said that Beau’s respect for Harris was one of the reasons he chose her, despite Harris’s well-publicised attack on the former vice-president’s record on race relations during the first Democratic debate.That Biden chose a candidate so evidently symbolising generational change, as well as representing a different gender and race, suggests he is aware of his own limitations as a candidate. It has also raised some Democratic hopes that he is resurrecting the winning Obama-Biden combination of 2008 and 2012.But like Obama’s choice of Biden, the double-act is about more than identity politics. Just as Biden shared many of Obama’s political policies and instincts, Harris is similarly a centrist candidate. Like Biden, Harris is a moderate progressive, much more to the centre than many in the party would like. While Harris’s record as a prosecutor is likely to come under scrutiny from those who believe she was too reticent to investigate police misconduct, for the most part the left wing of the Democratic Party has rowed in behind her and Biden.InfightingUnlike the 2016 Democratic campaign when the infighting between the Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders camps continued right up to the convention, next week’s largely virtual convention will see left-wing stalwarts of the party such as Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez deliver prime-time speeches, as the Democratic Party tries to show a united front.Such is the effect of the Trump presidency, that the imperative to remove Trump is overriding any real attempt to debate or scrutinise the direction of the Democratic Party at this moment, though that conversation will ultimately return. \u0026nbspAs for the Trump campaign, the president has lost no time in denigrating Harris as “nasty” “angry” and a “mad woman”.“She’s very bad on facts. She is very weak on facts,” he said this week about the one-time federal prosecutor.Trump and his daughter Ivanka in fact donated to Harris’s campaign for attorney general between 2011 and 2014. A spokeswoman said this week that the former developer and reality TV host donated to candidates across the political aisle at that time.With Harris due to hit the campaign trail in the coming weeks, following next week’s national convention when she will officially accept the nomination along with Biden, the Trump campaign now has a new force to reckon with.Given the broadly unsuccessful attempts to smear Harris this week, it is evident that the Trump campaign has a battle on its hands as its confronts the challenge of a Biden-Harris ticket.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"british holidaymakers turn private jets scramble get home france","story":"When thousands of British tourists decided to head to France for a relaxing post lockdown holiday, they were not expecting to all have to leave at once. Such was the scramble to get back across the Channel that private jet companies reported a trebling in requests - including, one firm claimed, from teachers worried about being stuck in quarantine for the start of the new term. Brides-to-be, families and students made up some of the 160,000 tourists that were forced to attempt to make a hasty dash over the border. And even for those not hiring their own jets, it proved expensive after the demand for flights, trains and Eurotunnel tickets soared as Britons went to desperate lengths to get home before the new measures came into place. The news forced Kate, an events organiser from Croydon, south London, to cancel her wedding in Marseille, where she was due to get married on September 12, because the restrictions have made it impossible for friends and family in the UK to fly over to France.For us it is not just about the money we have paid, but all of our guests have hotels that won\u0027t be refunded now.Those who travelled back to the UK by water faced a race against time. The ferry operator Stena Line was desperately trying to get confirmation from the Border Force and the Foreign Office that its passengers would be exempt from quarantine. The boat is meant to leave at 10pm from Hook of Holland in Rotterdam to Harwich, where it was due to arrive at 6.30am tomorrow morning. However, the ferry is due to be in UK waters by 4am, the time the quarantine rule entered into force. Thousands of others made the unexpected journey back to the UK via the Eurostar, which sold out of capacity on its last three trains on Friday a matter of hours after the Government’s announcement. Stuart and Anna Buntine, a couple who own a farm in the Midlands, spent nearly £1,000 to make it home via the Eurostar from France to London’s St Pancras Station.Mr Buntine, 58, said: We didn\u0027t get our notification until this morning, where we were staying in Burgundy there wasn\u0027t a lot of internet.I went to bed last night thinking it was all okay, woke up at 7am to find we had to get back here pretty sharpish.We couldn\u0027t get tickets, all the sites had crashed. “We had to buy business class tickets back today so it cost nearly £1,000.”Ashley Bateson, 54, Katarina Bateson, 52, from south west London, also arrived in France on Thursday just hours before the Government announced it would be added to the coronavirus red-list. The couple, who were meant to return from Paris on Monday, described efforts to purchase last-minute tickets online as “mayhem”.Those who chose to fly were faced with price increases of up to 1000 per cent. Private jet provider PrivateFly reported three times the number of enquiries and bookings for flights out of France and other countries including the Netherlands that were added to the UK’s quarantine list on Saturday.Its chief executive Adam Twidell said that the increase in demand was “instant”, and that new and existing customers wanted to change their flight plans as soon as the announcement was made.“A typical emergency flight might be for a footballer who has missed the airline and needs to get to training, but now we’re seeing the same inquiries from teachers realising they need to get back in a week’s time to start school, and headmasters are not going to appreciate if they’re stuck in quarantine,” he said. Mark Barnes, a preparatory school teacher from Isleworth, west London was holidaying with his wife and two young children, aged six and eight, in Dijon, France, but bagged a seat on a flight back from Paris so he can go back to work on August 26.I have got to get back to school. I would have to isolate for 14 days if I left it any later which would be a pain,” Mr Barnes, 51, said after arriving into London Gatwick.Ben Hillman, 42, who presents the TV show A Place in the Sun on Channel 4, was forced to cancel a two week road trip across France with his wife Gabby, 40, and their two daughters Honor, four, and Hope, five. We don\u0027t have the luxury of going on the holiday as the girls start school two days after we were due to get back,” he said. “For our youngest, Honor, it is going to be her first year of school and that settling week is so important for her.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"britains universities have become indoctrination camps reckoning","story":"The Institute for Fiscal Studies recently announced that 13 universities in the UK face a very real prospect of going bust. Like all such announcements in the higher education sector the news was clearly meant to be received with a gasp of fear. Worse, the IFS warned that it is our least prestigious universities that are most at risk.I don’t know about you, but on reading this news I immediately put my head in my hands and cried, “Oh no. Not our least prestigious universities. Take anything but that.”There are many oddities about our higher education system. Oddest is the presumption that the more universities there are and the more people go to them, the better our country will be.Tony Blair was merely the most notorious proponent of this idea. His target of 50 per cent of young people going to university was achieved last year. Is our country noticeably smarter or more successful as a result? Many would say not. In some ways I would say it is noticeably stupider.One clue as to why lies in the old truth identified by Kingsley Amis. Which is that in certain areas – and universities are the most pronounced – more means worse. You may expand the sector, certainly, but at some liminal point everything you get is worse.Visit the universities at the bottom of the league tables and you will see this for yourself. Universities in towns you knew had a cathedral but are surprised to learn also have a campus. These are full of students being charged top-dollar to learn ‘international relations’ or ‘journalism’ at best. That is to be trained in non-disciplines for careers that barely exist.There might be some excuse if they were, as a by-product, being trained to be open-minded, perceptive and creative iniduals. But for many people university is an indoctrination-camp, not a place for mental stimulation.Those who attend them are being factory-farmed to have the same boring and malevolent views. For example, you have to have been educated at a British university to go home and inform your parents that “gender is a social construct”. Or that the whole curriculum is “colonial” and needs to be “decolonised”.Rather than improve British societies, the automatons churned out by our universities are merely clogging up our country with bad thinking which becomes (when the graduates are employed) massive bureaucratic distraction-techniques. That British universities expand and make money out of this venture does not endear them to all of us.And that is before you get to the racket of ‘international students’. The loss of foreign students in the coming academic year is one of the threats to certain universities that the IFS has identified. But those who warn of this fail to acknowledge what this ‘threat’ reveals.Certainly there are some universities and courses where the presence of international students is a recognisable boon. Historically it has been a magnificent form of ‘soft-power’ among other things.Of course the unions and other spokespeople for the university sector rarely talk of it in such terms nowadays. They suggest that their love of foreign students is simply an expression of their personal liberal internationalism.In fact, for most universities foreign students are a piggy-bank. Their eyes grow beady at the opportunity to charge fees above the cap imposed by the government on British students.Nor is this avarice limited to the universities at the bottom of the league tables. Look at the experience given to many postgraduate students at universities like Cambridge and you will hear a familiar story.Sky-high fees, and the expectation of a full immersion in university life translates into a foreign student being rinsed for cash with the rarest imaginable meetings with a supervisor.Behind the scenes many university staff are embarrassed by this. But the finance departments and overpaid vice-Chancellors love to use the resulting charts to prove that their university is growing.Many could do with contracting, or simply disappearing altogether. And the era of Covid has put some of this into a newly imaginable perspective. Just as the likely diminishment of foreign students in 2020 has exposed UK universities’ over-reliance on this as an income stream, so the necessity to go online reveals a deep question about the nature of the modern university experience.Today if you have access to the internet you can follow a university course at any of the great universities of the world. Many of these – including from American Ivy League schools – are free online. Many other lectures – often far more cutting-edge and free-thinking than those found on our increasingly doctrinaire campuses – are free at the click of a button.Once students begin shelling out fees for a virtual university experience, questions will be raised. “Is this really the best education I can buy?” and “Is such an education worth ‘buying’ in the first place?” Traditionally the greatest universities have given an experience which is about so much more than just lectures.As one retired academic friend said to me recently, the real secret of university education is that the students educate each other. That is one of the ideals of the true, genuinely liberal university system. The lecturers provide the impetus, and the students cogitate amongst themselves.But as the universities have become greedy they have also become more cautious. Not just more cautious – indeed reluctant – about academic freedom (see the seemingly endless restrictions on this at Cambridge). They have also become more cautious in every other way about protecting themselves, certain of their employees and specifically their freedom from litigation.So in their precautionary Covid-aversion they are organising virtual freshers’ weeks, support bubbles and more to try to pretend that the class of 2020 will be a normal one. But it won’t be in any of them. And for some it may be the last.If that is so then we should not mourn the fact. The problem would not have been that 2020 was the year when the students dried up. The problem would be that 2020 was the year that the students saw through the universities and wondered – like everyone else – whether what they get for the down-payment is returned in any currency of value.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"british photographer reveals charmed way a list actors dressing","story":"One might wonder how renowned British photographer Simon Annand managed to charm his way into the dressing room of so many A-list actors and actresses.An intensely private and unseen world, the 65-year-old was granted access to observe the likes of Dame Judi Dench and Sir Anthony Hopkins 30 minutes before the curtain raised, and they found themselves on stage.He revealed to The  that it all began 37 years ago, pulling pints at the Lyric Theatre Hammersmith where he got to know them personally behind the bar as he served them drinks.He had worked behind the bar for two years in the early 1980s. As much as he loved the theatre, he was “frustrated” by the job. So, buying a second-hand camera, he persuaded Griff Rhys Jones to allow him to take some shots, including in his dressing-room just before the actor was to appear in a staging of Charlie’s Aunt.He said: “Immediately, I thought, ‘I haven’t quite seen that before’ and for the next 37 years I started doing all sorts of actors, in the dressing room where they’re getting themselves ready to go out there and face the music.”Now he is lifting the lid on some of the backstage secrets by revealing hundreds of photographs in a forthcoming publication. There are images of Jude Law, just before he transformed into Hamlet at the Wyndham’s in 2009, with a photograph that he had with him of Fred Astaire to “lighten the mood of the Prince’s melancholia”.Then there was Juliet Stevenson, minutes before her appearance in The Heretic at the Royal Court in 2011, seen next to the word ‘listen’ which she had written in huge capitals “to remind herself to do so in the performance”.Other stars include Tom Hiddleston, seen working out for Coriolanus at the Donmar Warehouse in 2014, “preparing for a role full of physical and mental challenges”, Mr Annand recalls. Or, Jeff Goldblum at the Vaudeville Theatre in 2010, limbering up for The Prisoner of Second Avenue, by playing the piano “non-stop” for 20 minutes.He said that while some method actors will be immersing themselves in “aspects of the performance as they get closer to curtain-up”, for example, through music or not talking to anybody, other actors “chose not to get into the part until about two minutes before they step on the stage”.He added: “One of the aspects of my photographs is capturing some of the melancholia that exists in the dressing rooms.”He noticed that on his first assignment. Although Mr Rhys Jones was portraying “a very ebullient character” in the riotous farce Charlie’s Aunt, the atmosphere in his dressing room was entirely different, essentially “more melancholic… more introverted”.His book, Time to Act, will be published on September 14.In an essay written for it, Victoria Broackes of the Victoria \u0026amp Albert Museum, which has staged touring exhibitions of Mr Annand’s work, writes: “The actors are seen as workers, not celebrities. His photographs reveal a fragility and humanness without undermining the courage that comes with being a performer and doing what many of us would find practically impossible.They also give an insight into the intimacy of the actor’s dressing rooms and the various ways they mentally prepare: a calming cigarette a final bit of chat with co-stars the finishing touches of make-up or perfecting the body language of their character.“Contrary to the glamorous image of theatre dressing rooms that we might imagine, most people would be surprised to see the cramped conditions in many British theatres today.”Mr Annand said some of facilities backstage are so minimal, with only one toilet, for example, that one actress was reduced to urinating in a sink.Theatres were long seen as ideal places for thieves and vagabonds to operate and Annand believes that the dressing rooms in old buildings reflect a time when actors were still looked down upon.Many are full of cards sent by other actors and bouquets of flowers. He said: “Some of them just let the flowers sit there and die. I’ve got pictures of four-month-old flowers which have gone grey, brown and brittle. I\u0027m never quite sure why they do that. There are some others who are real gardeners, who chuck them out.”If an actor is playing a famous historical character, such as Winston Churchill, Mr Annand said that they will often have images of those people “dotted around the mirrors, to give them a sense of the journey they need to go on that evening”.Singling out the Theatre Royal Haymarket among historic West End playhouses, he said: “You know that the greatest actors of their generations have been in these rooms. You can feel it in the mortar. If only the walls could talk.”He said: “It’s one of the more remarkable examples – the only one I can think of – where two actors have agreed to share the same room. Mostly stars of that calibre would have their own room. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus could travel five metres air study finds","story":"Coronavirus could travel as far as five metres through the air, a study has revealed for the first time.Tiny droplets of saliva containing Covid-19 could remain in the air for prolonged periods and increase the likelihood of more people contracting it, US researchers found.The scientists were able to isolate infectious particles of the virus at a distance of up to 4.8 metres from patients being treated at the University of Florida Health Shands Hospital.This is significantly further than the advised two metre social distancing rule, which the researchers say provides a false sense of security and could lead to many more people being exposed.Debate has been brewing among scientists for months about how much of a role saliva droplets hanging in the air play in the spread of coronavirus.These findings strengthen the notion that airborne transmission of Covid-19 is likely and plays a critical role in the spread, the study, which is yet to be peer reviewed, states.The public health implications are broad, especially as current best practices for limiting the spread of Covid-19 center on social distancing, wearing of face coverings while in proximity to others and handwashing.Commenting on the study, Dr Linsey Marr, an expert in airborne spread of viruses at Virginia Tech university, said this was a smoking gun.“This is what people have been clamoring for - it’s unambiguous evidence that there is infectious virus in aerosols, she said.However, some experts say the results should be interpreted cautiously, as it is unclear whether the sample of the virus isolated by the scientists is enough to infect someone.“It’s very hard to sample biological material from the air and have it be viable,” said Shelly Miller, an environmental engineer at the University of Colorado Boulder who studies air quality and airborne diseases.“We have to be clever about sampling biological material so that it is more similar to how you might inhale it.”In this study, the scientists used two samplers positioned at two metres and 4.8 metres from the patients in the hospital room.They were able to collect the virus at both distances and laboratory tests revealed the samples were sufficient to infect cells in a dish.This was despite the fact none of the patients had undergone medical procedures which the World Health Organisation had previously identified as primary drivers of airborne transmission.In addition, the air in the room was regularly being cleaned using specialist equipment.Given the virus could still be isolated in the air samples, the scientists believe this means the risk of transmitting the virus indoors is far higher than previously thought.The study concludes: With the current surges of cases, to help stem the Covid-19 pandemic, clear guidance on control measures against SARS-CoV-2 aerosols are needed.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"have finally woken small town belarus turns back europes last","story":"Deep in the Belarusian countryside, burly men with sun-burnt cheeks stood outside their quarry with home-made posters reading “We stand for free and fair elections” mounted on top of the machinery.They were on strike for the first time in their lives in what could be the most significant week in the nation’s post-Soviet history - and another turning point in relations between Europe and Russia.Small-town, working-class Belarus, once loyal to Alexander Lukashenko, the president of 26 years, has turned its back on Europe’s last dictator following widespread election fraud in Sunday\u0027s vote, savagery by riot police and horrifying stories of torture in Belarusian jails.With the opposition ranks swelling in the capital Minsk, it is the heavy industrialised towns like Hrodna that could spell the end of the continent\u0027s longest-serving leader in the coming days.To handyman Roman Vydra, in his mid-40s, a chubby man with a broad face, official results that gave Mr Lukashenko an 80 per cent win at the polls were a personal insult.“No one thought the vote-rigging would be so brazen,” he told The , standing in his tracksuit and oversized blue t-shirt near one of the loaders under the afternoon sunshine.“I don’t know a single person who voted for the current president.”While middle-class activists and intelligentsia marching in Minsk may not trouble Mr Lukashenko and his inner circle as he hangs on to power, factory floors cleared of workers rising up in the name of democracy leaves the strongman facing an uncomfortable reality.Employees at tractor works, quarries, bus depots and oil refineries in Belarus have all downed their tools. Workers at dozens of state-owned factories across the country have either walked out or threatened industrial action unless authorities meet their demands: hold a new, fair election, stop police violence and release thousands of people detained at anti-government demonstrations earlier this week.With state-paid workers turning against him, Mr Lukashenko is losing his main electoral base as well as billions of pounds in revenue that he has used to maintain Belarus’ mighty security apparatus and secret services.  The working-class revolt in Belarus has more than echoes of anti-Communist protests in eastern Europe in 1989 when workers tipped the scales to help bring down the Soviet Union.Belarusian protesters are on the cusp of breaking a decades-old status quo in the region with Belarus serving as essentially the buffer zone between Russia and European democracies.In the medieval town of Hrodna, just nine miles away from Poland where electoral fraud of the scale seen in Belarus would be unimaginable, workers spoke of monthly salaries under £300 and the way that outright lies on state TV, which portrays Belarus as a workers’ idyll, clash with the reality of declining living standards near the EU border.At a quarry, several dozen men in tracksuit trousers and overalls stood by the side of the road, smoking cigarettes and waving white balloons at the passing cars.“We’ve been cheated for such a long time, and now enough is enough,” said Mr Vydra, the handyman, who conceded that he and his friends did not care about elections in the past until they saw last Sunday’s vote-rigging and the ensuing crackdown.This week\u0027s unrest began when protesters against Sunday\u0027s election result were met with a staggeringly vicious police response.Riot police and special forces in full gear would throw stun grenades at unarmed people and fire rubber bullets into crowds, killing three. Belarusians with blood streaming down their faces fled the scene.Days later, protesters were released from detention, with bruises covering their bodies like full-body tattoos in a chilling testament of beatings and torture at the hands of law enforcement.Nearly 7,000 people across the country have been detained, and hundreds have been injured and beaten up while in custody. A 16-year-old man detained at a Minsk protest was taken to hospital from jail on Saturday after he fell into a coma from beatings.The scenes of police violence have stunned the nation of nine million people, drawing comparisons to the country’s history as a major battlefield in the Second World War.Hrodna, a quiet town of 370,000 people, with baroque cathedrals, was plunged into urban warfare for several nights in a row as riot police in full gear chased away anti-Lukashenko demonstrators.Less than a mile away from Hrodna’s picturesque bridge overlooking two medieval fortresses, middle-aged men came out of the Neman cigarette factory to discuss an upcoming walkout during their lunch break. Standing in the air smelling of tobacco, the several dozen men spoke about a car accident provoked by riot police that shook residents to the core.On Tuesday night, riot police officers threw themselves onto a car of a local family and started thrashing it with truncheons as punishment for honking in support of the protests. An armoured vehicle rammed into the car from the back, injuring a five-year-old girl who was in the back seat, local media reported.“What we saw on our streets was open warfare. How can you forget it and move on?” said Rashid Latykov, who came out of the factory building to buy a pack of Minsk cigarettes from a nearby kiosk. “Our country has been seized by a gang.”Earlier that afternoon the cigarette factory workers held a union meeting. It started with a call to stand up to show if they voted for opposition candidate Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, who fled the country after reported threats. The entire room of people in Neman’s blue uniforms got up and clapped.But nothing, perhaps, cuts deeper for Mr Lukashenko than unrest at the iconic Minsk Tractor Works, which accounts for 10 per cent of global tractor production.There is a saying in Belarus that outsiders know the country for two things: potatoes and tractors. Asked about the dangers of coronavirus earlier this year, the president said: Tractors will heal everything.Workers from the plant marched across the city centre on Friday after the prime minister refused to speak to them publicly during a visit.On Thursday, several-hundred angry workers confronted the local mayor outside the gate of the BelAz heavy machinery plant in a Minsk suburb.The country’s eight largest enterprises that have staged walkouts this week brought in a combined £9.5 billion in revenues last year, according to the Russian news website The Bell.Once scared of losing their jobs, workers in Hrodna say they have passed the point of no return.“That violence has changed anything - I can’t stay silent,” Larisa Rybak, a petite woman in blue-and-black overalls of the Hrodna Azot fertiliser plant, told The  as she walked out of the plant’s gate at the end of her shift to join a march into the city centre.At 54, Mrs Rybak, who makes about £400 a month, is nearing state pension age in an economy with dim prospects, but she feels compelled to be part of the movement on the cusp of toppling President Lukashenko. “We have finally woken up, and we won’t leave till he goes.”As the clock struck 5.30pm, she and several-hundred men and women in Hrodna Azot overalls set off from the factory to join a 30,000-strong rally in the centre, chanting “Long live Belarus!” and flashing  peace signs.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"ministers urge no10 wait september expanding red list","story":"Boris Johnson is being urged by ministers not to add any more countries to the quarantine list in order to save what is left of the summer holidays.There are fears that if Greece joined France and Spain on the list it would collapse the travel corridor system that has given overseas holidays to hundreds of thousands of Britons during the pandemic.The status of Greece was uncertain on Saturday with one Cabinet minister saying that it all depends on the numbers.

Perhaps it was partly this contemporary sense of under-appreciation and going unnoticed that gave rise to the exceptionally rich vein of post-war literature that the campaign threw up from the victorious generals especially Bill Slim’s Defeat into Victory, surely a title to conjure with today, to the tactical commanders, Fergusson, Calvert and Masters spring to mind but also the soldiers’ stories, including my favourite wartime memoir of all, Quartered Safe Out Here by George MacDonald Fraser, in which he recounts in primary colours his teenage experience as an infantryman in Burma.But today, those remarkable and erse veterans of Slim’s Forgotten Army, a tiny and dwindling band scattered across the former Empire, need not feel neglected. This is the moment for us all to reflect on the extraordinary sacrifices made by those men and women and celebrate their inspiring achievements. And although it is now 76 years since the victories at Imphal and Kohima set the Fourteenth Army on the road to final victory, the memorial on that battlefield contains a haunting epitaph that still resonates today, exhorting: When you go home, tell them of us, and say for your tomorrow we gave our today.So as the experience of the war passes into history and the living witnesses of the Burma road fade away, modern eyes are left with the images of steaming jungle, swollen rivers, glutinous mud, monsoon and mosquitos, amidst which human endeavour, ingenuity, tenacity and spirit triumphed. Surely a soldier’s tale cut in stone to lift all hearts.  General Sir Mark Carleton-Smith KCB CBE ADC Gen.

As dawn broke a lone piper played \u0027Battle’s O\u0027er\u0027 on the decks of HMS Belfast in London.Various world leaders including the US President Donald Trump and the Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau released a joint televised message while the Duke of Edinburgh contributed to a video memorial featuring veterans of the conflict.On August 15, 1945, the Duke was a young Naval officer aboard HMS Whelp in Tokyo Bay as the Japanese signed the surrender aboard USS Missouri.The Duke of Edinburgh and the Queen also released a joint statement reflecting on their memories of VJ Day and “the jubilant scenes and overwhelming sense of relief” that the war had come to a close. Such joy was tempered, they said, by the cost borne by so many”.On Friday, only around 45 veterans attended the main event at the National Memorial Arboretum – their numbers diminished by social distancing requirements and age.Those present recalled the privations of jungle warfare. In conversation with the Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall (who laid her own posie of poppies) 97-year-old Edward Woodward who served in Burma, India and Malaya with the Royal Corps of Signals, asked them to guess the most sought-after item in their air-dropped rations.Toilet paper, he deadpanned to the amused pair.One of those responsible for delivering those jungle airdrops was Warrant Officer Richard Wellings, who was part of a Dakota crew delivering supplies across Burma.During the service was the first VJ Day commemoration the 97-year-old had ever attended and he did so with a tear in his eye – in memory of fallen comrades and his wife Joan who died two weeks ago. “I feel proud knowing we did something essential and good,” he said.  Others came bearing the scars of the Burma campaign. Lance Sergeant Peter Heppell, 100, sheltered under a Chindit hat during the ceremony – a token of the elite guerrilla training he underwent before flying into Burma. Embedded in his upper left thigh was a piece of a Japanese mortar shell.He said the commemorations were a fitting tribute to the Forgotten Army. “A lot of my mates never came back from there and I think they ought to be remembered,” he said.Prime Minister Boris Johnson read the Exhortation before the two minute silence, which was followed by the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight flypast over the arboretum.The Kohima Address, so often recited in remembrance ceremonies though of particular poignance for VJ Day veterans due to its inscription in the memorial to the 2nd British Division commemorating the fallen during one of the key battles in the Far East, was recited by veteran Richard Day.The 93-year-old, who served with the Royal Welch Fusiliers, was present at Kohima and the words – ‘when you go home, tell them of us and say, for your tomorrow, we gave our today\u0027 – were recited in memory of fallen comrades.The Prime Minister also laid a wreath and spoke with various veterans, among them 91-year-old Jane Elgey, a survivor of the Japanese camps in which over a quarter of all Allied prisoners of war lost their lives.Elgey had been captured aged 12 with her family following the fall of Singapore in 1942. Her father, who worked as a civil servant for the British, managed to get the family on a tugboat but was then separated as Japanese aircraft strafed the harbour. Elgey spent the rest of the war as a prisoner with her mother, grandmother and four siblings.She was put to work fetching water for Japanese officers and fed on just one bowl of rice a day – watered down to  three meals. “If you disobeyed orders you were badly treated,” she says. The family were reunited after the war although her grandmother didn’t survive the camps.As the Prince of Wales said in his speech, the veterans of the Far East “comprised a force whose courage was as remarkable as its ersity”.Friday\u0027s service was designed to reflect the contribution of so many nationalities. Sikh veteran Darbara Singh Bullar, who served as a signaller in Burma and Singapore, laid a wreath alongside the Prince of Wales. Following the two minutes silence a lone Gurkha played the piper’s lament.No Gurkha veterans from the Second World War were in attendance, though a living link to the past was proud to play his part.Captain Buddhi Bahadur Gurung, a 45-year-old Afghanistan veteran is the grandson of the legendary Bhanbhagta Gurung who in March 1945 was awarded the Victoria Cross for a heroic one-man dash through the Japanese lines. No fewer than 29 Victoria Crosses were awarded during the Burma campaign, the highest tally of any theatre of war.“I am proud to be here,” Captain Gurung told the . “I grew up with his stories and that is what inspired me to join the British army and continue what my grandfather did.”The day’s commemorations didn’t entirely pass without a hitch. The Red Arrows had been scheduled for the first UK-wide tour since the London 2012 Olympics, conducting flypasts across the four nation’s capital cities.However, due to poor weather, the flypast over Cardiff and Edinburgh and Cardiff were cancelled. In Scotland, the Red Arrows were erted to Glasgow Prestwick Airport, where the aircraft landed to greet gathered Second World War veterans.The day concluded with the Duke of Cambridge giving a televised tribute on Friday evening. Remembering the address of his great grandfather, King George VI, delivered 75 years ago to mark the end of the war, the Duke spoke of his pride at the resolve of the wartime generation.“To each and every one of you who contributed to the effort, I say – thank you our country owes you a debt of gratitude,” the Duke said in his address. “Your bravery, and the sacrifices you made, will never be forgotten.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"would advise young people publicly commit stay together choose","story":"Lockdown had its challenges. It was full on but rewarding. I am usually away a fair bit playing rugby, but here was an opportunity to spend four months with the family.There were the ball games in the garden. And the endless bedtime stories. But, above all there was a lesson for me: that a stable and loving family can provide a buffer against the most anxious moments.I said ‘stable’ family. What does that mean in 2020?It still means a family where the parents are married.When I suggested it might be a good idea for parents to be married before having kids, I triggered a social media storm. A paper published this weekend by the Centre for Social Justice reveals how the Government treats cohabiting and married couples as the same.And yet, as the CSJ finds, there is a huge difference between marriage and cohabitation. Cohabiting couples are four times more likely to split up, and 70 per cent of young offenders come from families where parents have separated.Children whose parents are married are less likely to be excluded from school, less likely to become addicted to alcohol or drugs, less likely to join a gang, and less likely to end up in jail.What makes these stats a burning injustice is that high earners still tie the knot – 83 per cent marry. However, among the poorest, marriage is a minority activity, with only 45 per cent marrying.When I was growing up, my mum, a prison officer, worked during the day. My dad, a bouncer, was the one who I remember always being around. He was my role model: relaxed, but I knew never to break rules and always talk to him and my mum with respect.Dad was always there for me. I never needed to look up to anyone outside our family for inspiration.But, while dad invested so much time in me, driving me up and down the country so I could play rugby, that was not the case for my older half-brother, my dad’s son from an earlier relationship, which unfortunately broke down.My dad tried to be there for him as much as he could be. However, unfortunately that didn’t prevent my brother from adopting a bad lifestyle – drugs and criminality that eventually ended in prison.I’m very thankful that he is out now and doing great for himself and raising a son of his own, but I’m forced to ask the question of how his life might have been different if he had grown up in a stable home.This was not an exceptional story in our community: almost one in five Afro-Caribbean fathers do not raise their children.How do we help counter this trend? Maybe the answer is marriage. Getting married should mean you are making a unique public commitment to stay together.Yet today so many young people seem reluctant to marry. Unmarried parents have doubtless inspired a generation who do not know what marriage means. There is also always the fear of a potential messy orce – though if you’ve decided you want a child with someone and marry them, then you have decided you want to spend your life with that person.Finally, there is that slide into cohabitation – out of convenience or financial pressures, or sometimes both.In rugby, every win is down to total commitment. You cannot “slide” into a game, you must be prepared to invest time and energy, you must sacrifice to play your best. Above all, you need a strategy.I would advise my children – and other young people – to do the same in life. Choose the strategy that has been shown to deliver the best outcomes.Maybe ministers do not want to be seen to undermine lone parents and the spouse who has the courage to walk away from an abusive relationship, or cohabitees who intentionally choose that lifestyle.However, by blurring two different family structures into one, they are keeping our children from making an informed decision.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/08/14/08/dolly-parton.jpg","title":"dolly parton black lives matter blm dollywood dixie stampede twitter","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.Country music superstar Dolly Parton has explained why she renamed an offensive self-branded dinner show attraction back in 2018.In an interview with Billboard, the singer-songwriter also voiced her support for the Black Lives Matter movement, and addressed the wave of anti-racism and anti-police brutality protests that occurred in the wake of the killing of George Floyd.“I understand people having to make themselves known and felt and seen,” Parton said. “Of course, Black lives matter. Do we think our little white asses are the only ones that matter? No!”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesBack in 2018, the artist, who is known for hits including “Jolene” and “9 to 5”, renamed the Civil War-themed attraction from “Dixie Stampede” to “Dolly Parton’s Stampede”.Parton, who was born in Tennessee, is known for having an especially strong following in the southern US states, where support for the Black Lives Matter movement is often lower. People on social media were quick to praise Parton for speaking out.“Between Dolly Parton’s quiet Covid research fund, BLM support, and her sending generations of children books through the USPS, at 74, she continues to be one of the most relevant and ever timely people of every era,” wrote one Twitter user.Parton was also described as a “national treasure,” and an “American treasure”, while someone else described Parton as “one incredible American”.Comedian and actor Patton Oswalt wrote: “Me: I couldn’t love @DollyParton more.

But for those wanting to persevere, there are two watching orders. Really, you should probably watch these movies in release order, starting the journey with Iron Man and moving onto The Incredible Hulk, then Iron Man 2, Thor, Captain America: The First Avenger, finishing Phase One with Avengers – and what better time to undertake this marathon than when in lockdown due to the coronavirus?Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThis order works well in terms of the post-credit scenes setting up the next movie, plus this gives the series the intended rhythm formed by producer Kevin Feige.However, many fans have taken to watching the movies in chronological order. This might be a little convoluted, but that should not put you off: below is every piece of MCU viewing material mapped out in chronological order, including movies, Netflix shows, one-shots (those mini-films you will find in the DVD extras), and other TV shows. In brackets are the years the films officially take place in, as confirmed by Marvel studios. The best Amazon Prime and Netflix shows to watch while self-isolatingThe 31 most underrated TV shows to watch while self-isolatingHidden gems: The best Netflix originals you might have missedAgent Carter (seasons one and two)Ranking the Marvel Cinematic Universe filmsSummary: Where the Marvel Cinematic Universe all began. While Iron Man may have been the very first film released, the Second Word War-set Captain America comes first on the timeline. The rest plays mainly out in release order, minus Brie Larson’s Captain Marvel. Released as part of Phase Three, the film takes place in the mid-Nineties (when Nick Fury still had both eyes) and therefore lands in the Phase One chronology. All Hail the King (one-shot – Thor: The Dark World)Agents of Shield (season one: episodes 1 — 7)Agents of Shield (season one: episodes 8 — 16)Agents of Shield (season one: episodes 17 — 22)s of the Galaxy (2014)s of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (2014)Agents of Shield (season two: episodes 1 — 19)Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015)Agents of Shield (season two: episodes 20 — 22)Agents of Shield (season three: episodes 1 — 19)What went wrong for Netflix and Marvel?Summary: Phase Two also plays out almost exactly in release order, except s of the Galaxy Vol. 2, which comes directly after the first s (like Captain Marvel, the film was released in Phase Three but actually takes place before then). Also of note, one-shots were phased out during Phase Two as the Netflix shows and Agents of Shield were introduced. For those who do embark on watching Agents of Shield (the second and third seasons are great), you should definitely watch along with the movies as their cinematic counterparts have major effects on the show’s story.Agents of Shield (season three: episodes 20 — 22)Agents of Shield (season four: episodes 1 — 8)Agents of Shield: Slingshot (web series)Agents of Shield (season four: episodes 9 — 22)Agents of Shield (season five, episodes 1 — 19)Cloak and Dagger (season one)Cloak and Dagger (season two)Ant-Man and The Wasp (2017)Agents of Shield (season five, episodes 20 – 22)Summary: Made it this far? Well done, you’ve watched a whole lot of Marvel! Phase Three marks some of the best MCU movies so far, but also some timeline bending difficulties. For instance, Doctor Strange begins before Civil War, but finishes after Civil War, Slingshot features lots of flashbacks, and Agents of Shield season five features a lot of obscure time travelling.Created with Sketch.Marvel films – ranked worst to best Show all 23Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.23. Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke). The result is a film without any direction that serves as a Trojan horse set-up for the Avengers.22. When the Thor franchise lost its director Kenneth Branagh between the first and second films, it also had to kiss goodbye to the Shakespearean theatrics that had lent it a sense of goofy charm. Directed by Game of Thrones’s Alan Taylor, The Dark World prioritises its VFX effects above all else. It’s a dull affair: Christopher Eccleston’s Malekith is (by far) Marvel’s worst villain, being a pile of prosthetics with zero personality, while Chris Hemsworth’s Thor completes one of the most unrealistic London Tube journeys in all of cinematic history.21. Edward Norton’s version of the smashing Hulk often gets forgotten by Marvel fans – and for good reason. Whereas Mark Ruffalo’s bumbling interpretation of the character has a gravitational charm, Norton’s moping monster is void of any charisma. With Liv Tyler phoning in her performance as love interest, Betty Ross, the film falls emotionally flat and serves only as a by-the-numbers origins story.423 Avengers: Age of Ultron20. Just in case we’d forgotten that the Disney corporation is an all-consuming titan that owns half of Hollywood, the sequel to 2012’s Avengers decided to sneak in a little corporate synergy: when Iron Man accidentally creates a sentient robot (voiced by James Spader) who decides the earth’s only salvation is through the destruction of humanity, he announces his grim plans with accompaniment of a little citation of the classic “I’ve Got No Strings” from 1940’s Pinocchio. It’s a moment that exemplifies how Ultron feels like a cold, calculated operation from Marvel Studios. It’s merely tick list of obligations to move us on to the next chapter of the MCU.19. Although Kenneth Branagh’s introductory outing for Marvel’s God of Thunder fared perfectly well on release, it’s suffered massively from the MCU’s dramatic sense of progression over the years. Certainly, Tom Hiddleston’s Loki is a strong, well-crafted character right out of the gate, and his plot against his adoptive father (Anthony Hopkins) is delightfully heightened. Yet, it arguably took until Thor: Ragnarok for Chris Hemsworth’s hero to develop much sense of character beyond the initial “fish out of water” trope.18. A self-centred wealthy white man ventures to a distant land and realises his superhero potential – sound familiar? That’s because Doctor Strange and Iron Man are basically the same story, except one uses magic and the other explosives. Benedict Cumberbatch’s Marveldebut impresses with kaleidoscope visuals but lacks the heart of Robert Downey Jr’s hero, leading to a film that wastes the talents of both Tilda Swinton and Mads Mikkelsen. 723 s of the Galaxy Vol 217. The first s of the Galaxy was a risky Star Wars-inspired romp through space, following a bunch of a-holes who form an unlikely familiar bond. For the second film, James Gunn decided to turn everything up to 11, cramming half a dozen interweaving storylines, leading to Chris Pratt’s gaunt Star Lord getting side-lined. The sequel did, however, introduce the now beloved line “I’m Mary Poppins, y’all”, shouted by Yondu as he gracefully falls from the sky. A wonderfully comedic moment in a film that misses on another half-dozen punches.16. Marvel’s first crossover film was an unparalleled cinematic event – one that arguably changed Hollywood filmmaking forever, now that every major studio seems to be attempting the “shared universe” approach to franchises. Although the MCU has refined the template since, Avengers Assemble still established the focus on humour, character, and heart that would come to define the success story of Marvel Studios. It’s a blockbuster that feels large on all fronts, delivering thrills not only in the “Battle of New York” finale, but in the creation of a team of characters that feel perfectly balanced and complementary.15. Despite Captain America: Civil War (AKA Avengers 2.5) featuring Iron Man, Black Widow, and Ant-Man (as well as introducing Black Panther and Spider-Man), the film remains first and foremost about Captain America. And that’s perhaps why the stuffed blockbuster works – were it not for a central focus, Civil War could have fallen into the trappings of other Marvel sequels in being too convoluted. The Russo Brothers also direct one of the best actions scenes in Marvel history so far, the airport scene, which looks as if it leapt straight out of a comic book.1023 Ant-Man and the Wasp14. While the first Ant Man was a mirror image of its star Paul Rudd, essentially delivering a studio comedy dressed in dex, the second found a new trick up its sleeve in the form of Evangeline Lilly’s Hope van Dyne – a smart, capable female hero who didn’t simply exist to serve as a caretaker for the male characters.13. What comes after the end? It’s the question that was hanging over the Marvel Cinematic Universe ever since the release of Avengers: Endgame was sold to us as the ultimate, cumulative chapter in a series of 22 interconnected films. And yet, while Far From Home is distinctly mid-level Marvel fare, there’s a lot to be said for the fact it isn’t crushed under the weight of its own ambitions. It feels comfortably like the end of a chapter, the beginning of a new one, an epilogue, and a palate cleanser all at once. It also works perfectly well as a film about Spider-Man.12. Ant-Man should not have worked as a film. Just look at the title! Ridiculous to think a movie about a man with ant powers should work – let alone be a blockbuster success and part of the biggest cinematic universe going. Yet, despite production problems (Edgar Wright was initially meant to helm the film), Peyton Reed directs this hilarious heist film with aplomb, taking the Marvel world a little less seriously than others. 11. Marvel redefined cinematic narratives once more in 2018, creating a single culmination to a decade’s worth of films. While it plays as total nonsense to anyone who’s a newcomer to the franchise (if that’s possible), it was, for fans, an unmatched emotional release. The Russo brothers faced the monumental task of making each crossover – from the s of the Galaxy to the kingdom of Wakanda – work in a way that feels natural, while also ushering the MCU’s biggest villain, Thanos, into centre stage. Epic both in its sense of scale and stakes, Infinity War also stages one of the most memorable finales in blockbuster history.10. With or without the beard, Steve Rogers aka Captain America has now become the brooding centre of the Avengers, but there was once a time when he was all about the old-fashioned heroics. Director Joe Johnston stayed true to the film’s 1940s setting in a film that embraces that pulpiness of early comic book history, as Steve punches Nazis and romances military officer Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell), although her character is thankfully never relegated to the role of damsel in distress.9. Despite centring on a super-powered American nationalist, the Captain America trilogy has the most consistent quality in the MCU. Its crowning moment comes with The Winter Soldier – an adrenaline-fuelled conspiracy thriller that features a spectacular twist and provokes questions regarding modern day surveillance. However, given The Russo Brothers root the rest of the movie in realism, the bombastic CGI-heavy ending is a little ridiculous. 8. Brie Larson gives a superpowered performance as Carol Danvers, the actor playing a hero that\u0027s both relatable and aspirational, strong but vulnerable. While Captain Marvel may not revolutionise the studio’s formula, the superhero\u0027s debut outing provides a platform to show off her Thanos-annihilating powers.  Thanks to a smart script, it also offers some of the very best character development in the MCU.7. While Spider-Man’s miraculous arrival in the MCU came with Captain America: Civil War, it was not until Homecoming that we truly got to know Peter Parker. Tom Holland’s incarnation swings past Andrew Garfield’s version, thanks to the film’s lower-stakes high school story allowing for intimate moments with the character. Along with including some great comic performances (Jacob Batalon as Ned stands out), Michael Keaton’s Vulture makes for a terrifying villain, and the twist is superbly done.6. While isive among Marvel fans, Shane Black’s superhero outing – with the writerdirector’s sharp, stinging dialogue – brings Tony Stark\u0027s story arc to an end (or what should have been its end) with humour and heart aplenty. As Robert Downey Jr’s genius, billionaire philanthropist deals with PTSD and struggles with his robotic creations, we see an actor giving his all.  5. It’s a film that’s hard to place within the MCU canon, simply because the majority of its emotional pay-offs only work due to the groundwork laid by over a decade of filmmaking. Avengers: Endgame is less about inidual storytelling and so much more about the collective experience of cinema itself. This exists to be consumed in the dark, surrounded by loved ones, as  you all cheer, gasp, and cry in unison. The fan service at work may, at times, feel a little outrageous in just how bold it feels, but Endgame earns the right to indulge. This, above all, is a celebration of these movies and their impact on the world. 4. Completely transforming the Thor franchise in a single, effortless move, director Taika Waititi injected new energy into the MCU. Ragnarok is perfectly balanced both as a standard Marvel movie, with all the right heroics and world-building intact, and as a work belonging exclusively to Waititi, filled with the humour and charm he’d previously displayed in What We Do in the Shadows and Hunt for the Wilderpeople. By finding a way to incorporate inidual voices into its massive franchise machine, Marvel found the secret to true long-term success.3. Where it all started. Iron Man subverted expectations by not only reintroducing Robert Downey Jr to the world, but by showing that a relatively unknown B-character could be at the centre of a blockbuster. Other cinematic universes fail because they attempt to introduce too much (a mistake made in Iron Man 2). The first Iron Man, though, had a self-contained story that only hinted at a bigger world – a world that would eventually become a multi-billion-dollar franchise. 2223 s of the Galaxy 2. Blasting the Marvel universe into space for an adventure with a truly ragtag group of heroes, including both a talking racoon and a sentient tree-creature, s of the Galaxy is arguably the biggest risk the franchise ever took. And it paid off in spectacular fashion, with director James Gunn giving the superhero genre a light coat of B-movie glee. It also transformed Parks and Recreation star Chris Pratt into the major box office draw he is today.1. Although Black Panther still dutifully fulfils all the requirements of a Marvel film, providing a bridge to films both past and future plus ending in a cinematic battle filled with CGI trickery, Ryan Coogler’s achievement as a director is to use a familiar framework to tell a radical story within mainstream filmmaking. In the strife between Chadwick Boseman’s T’Challa, the ruler of Wakanda, and Michael B Jordan’s Killmonger, he provided a nuanced, layered commentary on colonialism and black identity. It’s a film that triumphs both within its genre, bringing new perspectives to the superhero story, and outside of it, satisfying purely as a piece of narrative drama.23. Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke). The result is a film without any direction that serves as a Trojan horse set-up for the Avengers.22.

It’s the question that was hanging over the Marvel Cinematic Universe ever since the release of Avengers: Endgame was sold to us as the ultimate, cumulative chapter in a series of 22 interconnected films. And yet, while Far From Home is distinctly mid-level Marvel fare, there’s a lot to be said for the fact it isn’t crushed under the weight of its own ambitions. It feels comfortably like the end of a chapter, the beginning of a new one, an epilogue, and a palate cleanser all at once. It also works perfectly well as a film about Spider-Man.12. Ant-Man should not have worked as a film. Just look at the title! Ridiculous to think a movie about a man with ant powers should work – let alone be a blockbuster success and part of the biggest cinematic universe going. Yet, despite production problems (Edgar Wright was initially meant to helm the film), Peyton Reed directs this hilarious heist film with aplomb, taking the Marvel world a little less seriously than others. 11. Marvel redefined cinematic narratives once more in 2018, creating a single culmination to a decade’s worth of films. While it plays as total nonsense to anyone who’s a newcomer to the franchise (if that’s possible), it was, for fans, an unmatched emotional release. The Russo brothers faced the monumental task of making each crossover – from the s of the Galaxy to the kingdom of Wakanda – work in a way that feels natural, while also ushering the MCU’s biggest villain, Thanos, into centre stage. Epic both in its sense of scale and stakes, Infinity War also stages one of the most memorable finales in blockbuster history.10. With or without the beard, Steve Rogers aka Captain America has now become the brooding centre of the Avengers, but there was once a time when he was all about the old-fashioned heroics. Director Joe Johnston stayed true to the film’s 1940s setting in a film that embraces that pulpiness of early comic book history, as Steve punches Nazis and romances military officer Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell), although her character is thankfully never relegated to the role of damsel in distress.9. Despite centring on a super-powered American nationalist, the Captain America trilogy has the most consistent quality in the MCU. Its crowning moment comes with The Winter Soldier – an adrenaline-fuelled conspiracy thriller that features a spectacular twist and provokes questions regarding modern day surveillance. However, given The Russo Brothers root the rest of the movie in realism, the bombastic CGI-heavy ending is a little ridiculous. 8. Brie Larson gives a superpowered performance as Carol Danvers, the actor playing a hero that\u0027s both relatable and aspirational, strong but vulnerable. While Captain Marvel may not revolutionise the studio’s formula, the superhero\u0027s debut outing provides a platform to show off her Thanos-annihilating powers.  Thanks to a smart script, it also offers some of the very best character development in the MCU.7. While Spider-Man’s miraculous arrival in the MCU came with Captain America: Civil War, it was not until Homecoming that we truly got to know Peter Parker. Tom Holland’s incarnation swings past Andrew Garfield’s version, thanks to the film’s lower-stakes high school story allowing for intimate moments with the character. Along with including some great comic performances (Jacob Batalon as Ned stands out), Michael Keaton’s Vulture makes for a terrifying villain, and the twist is superbly done.6. While isive among Marvel fans, Shane Black’s superhero outing – with the writerdirector’s sharp, stinging dialogue – brings Tony Stark\u0027s story arc to an end (or what should have been its end) with humour and heart aplenty. As Robert Downey Jr’s genius, billionaire philanthropist deals with PTSD and struggles with his robotic creations, we see an actor giving his all.  5. It’s a film that’s hard to place within the MCU canon, simply because the majority of its emotional pay-offs only work due to the groundwork laid by over a decade of filmmaking. Avengers: Endgame is less about inidual storytelling and so much more about the collective experience of cinema itself. This exists to be consumed in the dark, surrounded by loved ones, as  you all cheer, gasp, and cry in unison. The fan service at work may, at times, feel a little outrageous in just how bold it feels, but Endgame earns the right to indulge. This, above all, is a celebration of these movies and their impact on the world. 4. Completely transforming the Thor franchise in a single, effortless move, director Taika Waititi injected new energy into the MCU. Ragnarok is perfectly balanced both as a standard Marvel movie, with all the right heroics and world-building intact, and as a work belonging exclusively to Waititi, filled with the humour and charm he’d previously displayed in What We Do in the Shadows and Hunt for the Wilderpeople. By finding a way to incorporate inidual voices into its massive franchise machine, Marvel found the secret to true long-term success.3. Where it all started. Iron Man subverted expectations by not only reintroducing Robert Downey Jr to the world, but by showing that a relatively unknown B-character could be at the centre of a blockbuster. Other cinematic universes fail because they attempt to introduce too much (a mistake made in Iron Man 2). The first Iron Man, though, had a self-contained story that only hinted at a bigger world – a world that would eventually become a multi-billion-dollar franchise. 2223 s of the Galaxy 2. Blasting the Marvel universe into space for an adventure with a truly ragtag group of heroes, including both a talking racoon and a sentient tree-creature, s of the Galaxy is arguably the biggest risk the franchise ever took. And it paid off in spectacular fashion, with director James Gunn giving the superhero genre a light coat of B-movie glee. It also transformed Parks and Recreation star Chris Pratt into the major box office draw he is today.1. Although Black Panther still dutifully fulfils all the requirements of a Marvel film, providing a bridge to films both past and future plus ending in a cinematic battle filled with CGI trickery, Ryan Coogler’s achievement as a director is to use a familiar framework to tell a radical story within mainstream filmmaking. In the strife between Chadwick Boseman’s T’Challa, the ruler of Wakanda, and Michael B Jordan’s Killmonger, he provided a nuanced, layered commentary on colonialism and black identity. It’s a film that triumphs both within its genre, bringing new perspectives to the superhero story, and outside of it, satisfying purely as a piece of narrative drama.Also, the first Spider-Man film takes place directly after Civil War, while Ragnarok, Black Panther and Ant-Man and The Wasp lead directly into Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame. There’s also the latter part of Shield that takes place concurrently with Infinity War. Above is just a guide for a manageable way of watching based mainly on release order.Congratulations. If you’ve watched all of the above, you’ve processed over nine days worth of Marvel movies and television. Nine days! And there’s still more to come, including: Black Widow, The Eternals, Doctor Strange 2, Shang-Chi and Black Panther 2. Oh, and the upcoming Disney streaming service shows, focussing on Loki, Scarlett Witch and Vision, Hawkeye, and the Falcon and Winter Soldier.You can find a full list here.Ant-Man and the Wasp\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Pubs in city centres are struggling to attract customers in the first month of being able to reopen, while locals in the countryside are seeing a good turnout.While offices have been quieter and people have become more hesitant about travel, or simply not allowed to due to the pandemic, usually buzzing areas have seen a knock-on effect. Mike Hill tells The Independent he is waiting for workers and tourists to start coming back to his small pub, The Rake, and beer shop in Borough Market, central London.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“In terms of the commerciality of it, the reality is we’re down 50 per cent on the sites at Borough,” the Utobeer founder says.Hill says another of his sites in Stratford, east London, is also “missing the people who work in and around the area”.What are the UK lockdown rules now?How to ease yourself back into socialising once lockdown liftsThe new lost generationWhich countries are seeing a second wave of coronavirus?How to wear a face mask safelyGreene King, a huge pub chain in the UK, says their city centre pubs are also feeling the absence of office staff, who often head to pubs for after-work pints. “We continue to see a wide disparity between country pubs where customers are returning and those in central London, which rely on custom from tourists and office workers,” Karen Bosher, a director for the pub retailer, tells The Independent.“While most pubs are facing challenging trading, it is city centre ones, and in particular central London, which are being hardest hit as offices and theatres remain closed and the streets are quiet.”Meanwhile, elsewhere in the English countryside, pub landlords have told The Independent they have seen had a good first month of being able to reopen, after staying shut for months due to the pandemic. Joe Tansley, who runs a pub in a village in Worcestershire, says he had 90 customers booked in on the day he spoke to The Independent in early August.

McClarkin also senses a feeling of wanting to “support your local” during this time, which people may realise they have not used enough in the past. “We are seeing far more confidence out in community pubs,” she says, adding this seemed to be the “trend across the country”.Greene King says the “vast majority” of its pubs around the UK have reopened, which has been allowed since 4 July, while 40 per cent in London are still shut “as they are not currently viable”. “In central London, across the City and West End, our pubs are trading significantly behind the rest of our managed estate,” Bosher, the managing director for premium, urban and venture brands, says.She adds: “We are confident that once customers see first-hand the pub safe measures we have introduced in our managed pubs, they will feel reassured that the pub is a safe place to visit.”Like many other pubs, The Rake in London has had to make changes to allow it to reopen safely during the coronavirus outbreak, such as introducing a one-way system and getting customers to write down their name and phone number on a card that is kept for two weeks – in case they need to be traced. The tiny pub, which sits close to the Thames, has been open since early July, albeit on reduced hours.Landlord Mike Hill says it has been a good feeling to see customers coming back. “It’s very much business as usual, in reality,” he tells The Independent. “The problem is, there’s just not enough of them.” Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Swindon is now the fourth worst affected area in the UK when measured as a proportion of population, having seen a 200 per cent increase in new cases over the last seven days.It has nearly as many new cases per person as Leicester, which was the first place to see tougher local restrictions put in place after the nationwide lockdown lifted.The UK as a whole remains a long way off its peak levels from April and May, when daily new cases frequently reached above 5,000.Yet local spikes could see the recent upwards trend continue if not brought under control, as has been the case in other countries like France and Spain.Having endured a big surge in cases during the early stages of the pandemic, London has since seen its number of daily cases drop at an even greater rate than the rest of the country.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

At a time when Londoners from all walks of life are struggling due to the impact of coronavirus, the importance of love and care from others has been magnified tenfold.The phrase comes from a work made by the artist Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith – one of several fantastic lots in an auction kicking off today at sothebys to support The Independent’s Help the Hungry appeal.Over the past four months we have raised more than £7.5m for food redistribution charity The Felix Project – a cause for which we have pledged to raise £10m as well as to open central London’s largest community kitchen.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe auction is an opportunity to get your hands on works by some amazing artists – more likely to be seen on the walls of a museum than your living room. They can also be viewed at Sotheby’s, 34-35 New Bond Street.Ceramic has been a recurring motif for Ai Weiwei (a 1995 series of photographs showed him dropping a Han dynasty urn) and he has often used porcelain, for centuries a secret formula known only to Chinese makers. Flowers, too, are significant – when his passport was taken Ai put a bunch of fresh flowers in a bike basket outside his studio every day until he was able to travel freely. This small plate holds a great deal of meaning.Yinka Shonibare deconstructions of icons of western power couldn’t be more current. This elegant woodcut print, using vivid Batik textiles, transposes animal masks from Mali onto the faces of English aristocratic figures enriched off the back of colonisation and slavery. The patterns of textiles overlay the repeating patterns of power and show how history’s long fingers reach into our present.Unfailingly optimistic, Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s work is always a call to care. He’s known for his colourful and impassioned but peaceful slogans (“Make Art Not War” seems like a good standard to live by) and his advocacy of art as a tool for education and understanding. We Have Only Got Each Other quotes his late mother, the artist Deirdre Borlase, spoken in response to the isions revealed during the Brexit campaign — but its universal meaning is clear.I’m a sucker for a good drawing – I’ve always felt that even at 500-odd years distance, it’s the form that brings you closest to an artist the sweep of a human hand that has just left the page. After many years of deeply mining her own emotions and experiences in her work, Emin is an artist at the height of her powers. Her raw, almost agonisingly expressive draughtsmanship gets me every time and this little sketch nails the feeling of having a really good cry.These three etchings – a supremely generous donation from Anish Kapoor, more usually known for the interactive theatricality of his large-scale sculptures – exude a quiet drama. Their simplicity belies their seductiveness velvety and intense, they draw you in, never quite revealing their secrets.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Wallinger was inspired by X-rays of Old Masters, which he thinks of as akin to spirit photography: “The revelation of the invisible, supernatural life of a painting.”A reminder of the pre-lockdown era, when we were able to wander the Hayward Gallery and bathe in the sea of pulsating colour that was Riley’s superb exhibition. This screenprint is from a series that vibrates right off the paper (Tate owns an edition of Elongated Triangles 5, so you’ll be in good company if you get your hands on this one).The essence of things is what Michael Craig-Martin seeks in his work, and colour is part of seducing the viewer to really look at the objects that make up our world. These sculptural reliefs in polished steel come from a series that pays homage to designers and architects whose vision has shaped what we think of as “modern”. You can’t sit on them, but look at them. Aren’t they beautiful?Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Any Questions? the A-Level student said she had failed to meet her offer from the Royal Veterinary College, adding: “I have now idea how this has happened.

Several roads were closed and the surrounding area was cordoned off“I feel my life has been completely ruined, I can’t get into any universities with such grades or progress further in my life,” the New College Stamford student said. “I would like to know how this has happened.”In response, Mr Gibb, the schools minister for England, who was also appearing on the programme, said: I do feel for you. This should not have happened to you. We don\u0027t want you to have to go through this stress of having to go through an appeal to find out what’s going to happen to your career.“None of this is satisfactory, the best system is for people to take their exams – that’s what should have happened. It’s what we wanted to happen, but we had to take a very difficult decision in March to cancel exams and what we didn’t want was for young people like Nina to have to delay a year.”Starmer urges government to scrap ‘injustice’ of A-level results“The reason for the standardisation model is to ensure we have consistency between schools and we don’t have grade inflation.”Mr Gibb was then challenged over why the system was not working by BBC presenter Chris Mason, as the student told the minister “you have ruined my life”. But the education minister added: It won\u0027t ruin your life, it will be sorted I can assure you. The trouble with these models – when you have a model that standardises grades across the country there will be imperfections in it.”“That’s why we have introduced very robust appeals processes that schools will trigger for candidates like Nina. Those appeals will happen very swiftly and universities have said they will hold offers open until 7 September and we’re working through that now.”The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Under Section 21 of the 1988 Housing Act, no reason needs to be given to seek possession, but tenants must be given two months’ notice.This was extended by ministers to three months at the beginning of the crisis, which will remain in force until 30 September in England. Earlier this month, the Welsh government said landlords would now need to give renters six months’ notice before any eviction, with the exception of cases relating to anti-social behaviour.Boris Johnson has pledged to end so-called no-fault evictions – as did his predecessor Theresa May – in a new Renters’ Reform Bill, but it will not be brought forward until the “urgencies of responding to the pandemic have passed”.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive updates on politics every morning by emailFor property owners and landlords, whose incomes have been adversely affected by the Covid-19 crisis, applications for mortgage payment holidays can be made to banks until the end of October.Sir Ed Davey, acting leader of the Liberal Democrats, claimed the communities secretary Robert Jenrick was leaving families “just days away from the threat of eviction and losing their home”. “If ministers fail to act and we see thousands of people evicted and a sharp rise in homelessness, this Conservative government will have moved from hopelessly incompetent to shockingly heartless,” he said.Leading housing charity Shelter pointed to polling research claiming around 230,000 adult private renters (3 per cent) in England have fallen into arrears since the start of the pandemic while 174,000 were threatened with eviction by landlords or letting agents.Since lockdown began, one in four communications with Shelter’s emergency helpline and webchat services have been from people worried about losing their home, the organisation added.Chief executive Polly Neate told The Independent: “It’s great to see that the governments in Wales and Scotland have taken strong action to protect renters threatened with eviction after the financial turmoil caused by coronavirus. These crucial steps will help keep thousands safe in their homes.“The eviction ban lifts in England in little over a week and time is running out. With the country plunged into an unprecedented recession, tens of thousands could face the trauma of losing their homes over the autumn and winter.“The government must show it hasn’t abandoned renters in this country. When parliament returns after the summer break, their priority must be to give judges new powers to stop renters being evicted because of Covid-19. Otherwise, we risk rising homelessness adding to the economic crisis.” Crisis, a charity that works to prevent homelessness, said it was difficult to calculate the total number of people affected if the government does not extend the ban or introduce emergency legislation, but added that 24,000 possession claims were issued by the courts before the March ban. Many of these are probably ongoing and could be reactivated imminently.Dan Wilson Craw, the deputy director of Generation Rent, added: “If courts start hearing eviction cases in a week with no new protections from the government then thousands of renters will be vulnerable to losing their homes. Warrants paused since March can be reactivated and bailiffs could be around within days.“Because landlords don’t have to give a reason to evict, anyone who has received a valid Section 21 notice faces losing their home – whether they have been able to pay rent or not. The government must extend the ban to stop any evictions using no-fault grounds or where the renter has lost income due to coronavirus.” The government has previously said landlords and tenants should “work together and exhaust all possible options” to ensure eviction cases only end up in court as “an absolute last resort”. Landlords will also be required to set out information to the courts on tenants’ circumstances, including the impact of the coronavirus crisis on a “tenant’s vulnerability”.However, Ruth Jacob, a policy officer at Crisis, told The Independent the judges presiding over these cases will be “powerless” to do anything with the information.“If the landlord is evicting someone under Section 21 they don’t have to give a reason,” she added. “If the notice has been served correctly then there’s no legal protection to prevent someone from being evicted and that’s something the government could solve quickly and easily, early in September.“What we need to see now is the government act as soon as they come back from recess in September to introduce emergency legislation that would actually help to mitigate the effects of the ban coming to an end and protect tenants that have been affected.”However, a survey from the National Residential Landlords Association (NRLA) suggested that 95 per cent of private tenants are paying their rent or have made alternative arrangements with landlords, including deferrals and a decrease in payments. The organisation claimed less than a third of those in arrears, or two per cent of its polling sample, have been served with a possession notice.It is also calling on the government to introduce hardship loans for tenants forced into arrears as a result of the pandemic.Ben Beadle, chief executive of the NRLA, insisted the vast majority of landlords and renters were “working together to sustain tenancies, and critically that the overwhelming majority of tenants are paying rent as normal”. He added: “Eviction is not, and need not be, an inevitable outcome where tenants have struggled to pay their rent due to Covid-19. Those who argue otherwise are stoking needless anxiety for tenants. When the courts do start to hear cases again, it is essential that they deal swiftly with the most serious cases, including those where tenants are committing anti-social behaviour or where there are long-standing rent arrears that have nothing to do with the pandemic.”A spokesperson for the Ministry of Housing, Communities, and Local Government said: “The government has taken unprecedented action to support renters during the pandemic, including providing financial support to enable tenants to pay their living expenses and their rent, and this has helped ensure no one was forced from their home.“New court rules will provide appropriate support to those who have been particularly affected by coronavirus when court proceedings start again, with landlords required to set out information about a tenant’s circumstances, including the effect of the pandemic on a tenant’s vulnerability, when bringing a possession claim.“We’re committed to breaking the cycle of homelessness and to ending rough sleeping for good. That’s why we changed the law so councils now have a duty to try to stop people from becoming homeless and have provided over half a billion pounds to tackle homelessness and rough sleeping in 2020 and 2021.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Help is desperately needed to support wildlife rangers, local communities and law enforcement personnel to prevent wildlife crime. Donate to help Stop the Illegal Wildlife Trade\u0026nbsphere.\u0026nbspThe Independent employs reporters around the world to bring you truly independent journalism. To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.A new study has revealed that one of the world’s most endangered species of elephant is under greater threat than previously thought. Africa’s forest elephants have been decimated by the illegal wildlife trade, with more than two thirds killed in the last decade. There was estimated to be around 90,000 left, with about half of that population believed to be in Gabon.However, a study by a 10-member international research team fears that the total remaining population could be between 40 to 80 percent smaller. The study, published in PLOS ONE, shows the urgency of The Independent’s Stop The Illegal Wildlife Trade campaign, which calls for an international effort to clamp down on the illegal trade of wild animals.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesFunds raised will pay for vital wildlife protection projects implemented by the campaign’s partner charity Space for Giants. This will work to help stop the poaching and illegal trafficking of animalsThe illegal trade of wild animals is the world’s fourth largest criminal enterprise, after arms, drugs and human trafficking.The forest elephant has been ruthlessly hunted by poachers in the rainforests of Democratic Republic of the Congo, Cameroon and Gabon. The ivory is smuggled to Asia where it is in high demand for intricate carving. However the full extent of the bloodshed has been hidden from the world’s gaze.Professor Lee White, Gabon’s Minister of Water, Forests, Oceans, Environment and Climate Change, welcomed The Independent’s Stop The Illegal Wildlife Trade campaign and said that the world must act now to end wildlife crime, to both protect forest elephants but also for greater global security.“The illegal trade of wildlife wreaks havoc in Africa and even threatens to destabilise whole countries,” White said. “The ivory trade is linked to terrorists and criminal syndicates who also smuggle gold, guns and people at Gabon’s border with Cameroon.”White says some poachers in Gabon “take a ‘shoot on sight’ approach” to confrontation with law enforcers, and have become “much more violent and threatening” in the past five years. “It is partly because we have become more professional and aggressive, but also because there’s now much more involvement of organised crime.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailThe new report provides insight into the species’ devastating decline. Biological anthropologist Nelson Ting co-led the study, which revised the population size by using a method known as genetic capture-recapture, which involves assessing dung piles. Ting said “Gabon was thought to be a population stronghold, but even our most optimistic results suggest a smaller population size. Our research shows how endangered they really are. “Forest elephants are among the most threatened animals. More information is key to figuring out the best ways to prevent extinction.”Forest elephants are the smaller, rarer cousins of the giant savannah elephant, and their densely wooded habitat makes them harder to study and count.White, a biologist born in Manchester, spent his childhood in Uganda where he developed a passion for elephants. “Tragically, nobody had noticed that Gabon had lost about a third of its forest elephants. You can’t fly over and see the carcasses because they’re hidden”As poachers continued to empty the country of its forest elephants, White spearheaded a war against them - and against ivory trafficking in particular.The threat to forest elephants has been greatly reduced, but danger still looms large. Gabon has maintained its usual level of frontline protection throughout the Covid pandemic in case of any upturn. Elephants can also be killed during conflict with local people, often after trampling or eating crops. Space for Giants is working with the National Parks Agency and Assala Energy over three years to build 23 miles of electrified farm boundary fences to keep elephants from danger, and to protect people’s livelihoods.Several fences have already been completed. These types of projects provide local communities with a sustainable way to earn a living, and are designed to incentivise the communities to help protect their primary source of undeveloped wealth capital, Gabon’s rich bioersity and forest elephants.White was appointed to Gabon’s cabinet by President Ali Bongo Ondimba, whom he calls “one of the planet’s greenest heads of state”, and today he works to not only save forest elephants for their own sake, but to also protect the health of the whole planet.Space for Giants Founder and CEO Dr Max Graham explains: “Forest elephants are incredibly important for the health of our whole ecosystem and in fighting global warming. “They play a role in the dispersal of seeds, which have to go through their gut to germinate, and the unique way in which they forage creates a forest canopy structure that is perfect for carbon sequestration. “They take out the young growth and leave what is longstanding, which has been attributed to creating carbon stock worth billions.”The survival of forest elephants is a human issue, inextricably linked to issues around environment, poverty, law enforcement and finance.White believes that international effort is needed to end the poaching war being waged against Africa, and that wildlife crime needs to become a new global priority in order to protect species and prevent another global pandemic.“If we don’t deal with the illegal wildlife trade we’ll have criminal and terrorist groups rampaging across the continent, destabilising countries,” says White. “But we also cannot continue to aggress nature and think there will be no price to pay. “If we continue to cut down forests, kill animals and destroy ecosystems the consequences will be catastrophic. We must be stewards of nature if we want it to keep being friendly”.Stop the Illegal Wildlife Trade\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesWithout work, Mostafa, perhaps best known as Latiza Bombe, one of Lebanon’s most notorious drag queens, has had to move out of his apartment, comparatively untouched by the explosion, and return home to his mother. The explosion has left up to 300,000 homeless, as houses and lives were torn apart.In returning home, Mostafa has been forced back into the closet. “She doesn’t know I’m gay,” he explains, “let alone a drag queen.” Latiza Bombe, who describes herself as “sexy yet gross” on her Instagram, is a towering latex-adorned figure on the Beirut scene.My dear Beirut, I am far away but I am feeling your painThe Beirut explosion, which killed at least 172 people, injured thousands and destroyed whole swathes of the city, tearing out balconies and smashing in windows, has seen fund-raising initiatives and donation sites to help repair shattered homes and rebuild independent businesses. But the emergency response has been unique, say those on the ground, in that a queer lens is being applied to fundraising.  Sandra Melhem and Andrea Najarian, members of the city’s LGBT+ community, have raised over $10,000 so far for the LGBT+ victims of the explosion.   “In all cases, not just when it comes to disasters, when you have an underprivileged community, you always need to shed light on it,” Sandra says. “When disaster strikes it’s needed even more. Of course light needs to be shed on all underprivileged groups, not just the LGBT+ community, but also domestic workers, and the elderly.”Money will be used to provide food, clothes and medicine, including HIV medicine. All had already become harder to source even before the explosion, given the acute economic crisis in Lebanon – the country was already on the brink of hyperinflation, and the Lebanese pound, historically pegged to the dollar, is becoming increasingly worthless. The LGBT+ fundraising collective is also building a database to understand precisely what impact this explosion has and might continue to have on the LGBT+ community.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Coming out stories can be very painful, with some people abandoned altogether by their families.LGBT+ rights have been at the forefront of Lebanon’s thawra (revolution) since it began in October, with Lebanese protesters nightly calling for an overthrow of the government, seen as a hangover of the civil war, populated by corrupt men with few concerns outside of their own. The struggles of LGBT+ people have been seen in chants, in graffiti, and in discussions that have taken place up and down the country – as the thawra become bigger than just overthrowing the government, and became a social struggle to build a more inclusive society.  This explosion, and the damage it has had on housing infrastructure, has meant that many, like Mostafa, have to face going home and going back into the closet just to survive.One of the few safe spaces for the LGBT+ community in Beirut was Madame Om, a salon in Gemmayzeh. Throughout the week, crowds would flock there to see drag queens lip sync on the exquisitely tiled monochrome floor. The community hub began life nine years ago in Hamra, to the west of the city, but Hala Habib, who owns Madame Om, moved it to a grand 19th-century mansion house in Gemmayzeh in 2016.Madame Om sustained heavy damage in the blast.“Madame Om is like a friend for me,” Hala explains. “I feel as though I have a lost a friend. This beautiful space was really a space for freedom of expression in every sense of the word. People would do poetry, they sang, danced, loved, had jealous fits, got drunk, made friends.”Hala is determined to reopen the space, although it won’t be in the same building because the damage is so severe. “I’m still in shock,” she says. “I can’t think of the future or any alternative. I know that Om will come back one way or another, but I can’t think of it now…”Around the world fundraising campaigns for the Lebanese LGBT+ community have sprung up – with even Rupaul’s Drag Race alumnae Brooke Lynn Hytes and Pearl both taking to social media to support the Beirut LGBT+ community.One event taking place in Whitechapel, east London, on 22 August – Rebuilding Beirut with Pride – has been organised by a group in London’s LGBT+ Lebanese diaspora, including Danny Nasr. “Although I’ve been privileged enough to be here in the UK and live my life the way I want to, that’s not the case for so many of my friends and family back home,” he tells The Independent. It’s not only physically rebuilding Beirut, but conceptually rebuilding Beirut as this space and a community that each of us can feel a part of\u0026nbspThe event will be raising money for a number of NGOs working on the ground, and also for LGBT+ activists. “Our devastation was so much that we needed something positive to channel it into,” Nasr adds. While public anger increases to rage at the government, for the circumstances which led to the blast, and for a lack of support in the wake of the disaster, NGOs and activists are working to fill the gaps – literally going door to door checking in on civilians, cleaning streets and repairing buildings. And the LGBT+ community has been identified as a vulnerable group – and targeted through activism and fundraising efforts.I’m not sure I believe in justice after BeirutBeirut search teams hunt for missing firemen in blast epicentreDozens of Beirut health facilities ‘non operational’, WHO warnsSeven years of neglect, and 13 minutes of chaos, that destroyed BeirutMy heart is bleeding for Beirut, a city I thought I hatedDalia Mikdashi, at Oxfam Lebanon, says while there is need everywhere, the LGBT+ community must not be forgotten in the wake of the mass trauma, and must be considered specifically in the disaster response. “We have been working with partners who focus on supporting the LGBT+ community for many years and we intend to continue to make sure they recover and thrive after this latest crisis,” Mikdashi says. “In the immediate term this means providing shelter and emergency support such as counselling.”The explosion, says Nasr, and all the destruction it has wrought, has “exacerbated so many of these pre-existing issues that it’s made them almost impossible to ignore, and that’s why they need to be at the centre of how we want to rebuild Beirut. “It’s not only physically rebuilding Beirut, but conceptually rebuilding Beirut as this space and a community that each of us can feel a part of.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.It was a particularly cold June morning in northern Kenya when rangers working in Loisaba Nature Conservancy first spotted a large male elephant limping near a watering hole. The rangers began monitoring the elephant, a large bull with enormous tusks, who was nicknamed Alan. Max Silvester, a Conservation Volunteer in Loisaba, said “the injury was likely the result of a botched poaching attempt. Alan had some of the biggest ivory I have seen.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesA wounded animal is liable to attack anything that comes close to it, and the elephant charged at the team who assembled to help him. “I was very afraid because he was huge,” said Loisaba’s Security Assistant Rita Orahle, who assisted KWS vet Dr Dominic Mijele.“He was trying to scare us by trumpeting because he knew he could not run away due to his injury”, said Dr Mijele. “I darted him and it became obvious that the wound was caused by a bullet which had entered the animal’s right foot, having first grazed the trunk.“After cleaning the injury and administering antibiotics I gave him an antidote and he walked off. If the elephant had been left untreated he would have been dead within a week.”All hunting is illegal in Kenya, a nation that has led the war against the plundering of wildlife, and ivory trafficking in particular. The Independent\u0027s Stop The Illegal Wildlife Trade campaign was launched to call for an international effort to clamp down on poaching and the illegal trade of wild animals.Funds raised will to pay for vital wildlife protection projects implemented by the campaign’s partner charity Space for Giants. This will work to help stop the poaching and illegal trafficking of animals.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailHowever the impact of Covid-19 means help is urgently needed to protect elephants against an increased threat of slaughter.In 2015 Space for Giants worked with international conservation organisation The Nature Conservancy to establish Loisaba as a conservation trust in perpetuity, protecting a critical habitat for a ersity of endangered species.Covering an area of 57,000 acres in the county of Laikipia, Loisaba has an increasing resident population of elephants, estimated at around 800, as well as an abundance of other fauna, including more than 260 bird species and 57 mammals, such as lions, leopards and cheetahs.Space for Giants supports wildlife monitoring, security and conservancy management in Loisaba, financed by The Nature Conservancy and other donors, including San Diego Zoo. The communities around Loisaba understand the value of wildlife, and the happy result is the conservancy is a zero poaching zone - a fact that even pachyderms themselves might understand. Silvester told The Independent “it’s likely that Alan the elephant was shot elsewhere, but the intelligence of this bull, in moving quickly to a place of safety Loisaba Conservancy, allowed the rangers and the vet team to assure his wound was treated quickly and successfully.“He continues to roam Laikipia as a testament to his forefathers, the huge tuskers before him.“Orahle adds “the rangers continued to monitor the bull, and he was last spotted in early August looking happy and not limping at all.”Alan was not the only animal to be rescued in Loisaba that day. The ranger team rushed off to treat a giraffe with a split hoof. In the midst of a raging global pandemic Loisaba’s wildlife operations continue to protect endangered species, preserving bioersity and supporting local communities in the process.The wildlife veterinary unit that saved the elephant is sponsored by Sheldrick Wildlife Trust, working in collaboration with KWS, to attend wildlife cases in Laikipia.

It’s in the deepest recession in UK history, the deepest of any G economy, and the deepest since the invention of Gross Domestic Product. There’s a glimmer of hope buried in the grim data, though. In June, when the Government began to loosen lockdown restrictions, the economy grew an astonishing . per cent. That’s the biggest month-on-month jump since records began. It’s clear that we DO stand a chance of a relatively swt economic recovery - but onlyBrits start going about their pre-Covid lives sooner rather than later. And with hospital cases down  per cent since the peak of the coronavirus pandemic, the NHS is in no danger of being overwhelmed. Of course Covid isn’t over and we can’t be complacent. But Government scientists are attracted to long-term lockdowns because they’re trained to think about public health in the narrowest possible terms. The rest of us, though, understand that in the long run, mass poverty and unemployment kills just as surely as any disease.It’s time to get Britain working.OUR sympathies are with A-level students facing uncertainty today. Given the unprecedented situation has wreaked havoc with their exams, no solution is going to be perfect.And so we offer broad support to the Government and its “triple lock” strategy, which aims to give the vast majority of English and Welsh pupils the results they deserve.It makes much more sense than the indiscriminately clunky Scottish strategy — which saw thousands of kids miss out on good grades, until Nicola Sturgeon was forced to make a humiliating U-turn and bump grades up.We are concerned, though, about the long-term prospects of school leavers across the home nations.

I am proud to “confess” that I have been on two foreign holidays in the past month, utilising legal air bridges, and I am far from ashamed.The myth in coronaphobic Britain is that overseas trips are for the elite, rich and powerful: If you dare get on a plane to low infection-rate locales such as Italy or Greeceyou’re not showing solidarity to the Covid cause and risk spreading the damned virus.That rhetoric hasn’t been helped by the Government’s feeble air bridge policy, which puts any country with a region experiencing a minor outbreak at risk of being added to the quarantine list.The reality is the total opposite. If you and me are shamed into staying home now, travel WILL soon be limited to the elite, rich and powerful.The democratisation of tourism has been one of the most pleasing developments of this new millennium, with the explosion of budget airlines causing price wars and a move towards all-inclusive package deals.Yet our ability to keep seeing the world is now in real peril.Airlines are on their knees. Hotels are closing at an alarming rate. Many popular European tourist destinations remain ghost towns.Goons in the Extinction Rebellion movement have already talked weak parties including Labour into backing the introduction of more travel taxes.All for a virus that, albeit nasty, killed just a fth of the number of people who died from run-of-the-mill flu and pneumonia in the final week of July in the UK.If you’re one of the many people currently tormented over whether to take the risk and book that break, I implore you to go for it.On a practical level, both my week-long trips to Europe were pure ecstasy, with responsible and reassuring safety measures that never came close to overshadowing the glorious experience of being overseas again, something unimaginable just a couple of months ago.Yes, the airport is a little more torturous than usual and you do have to keep the mask on at all times.When I arrived on the Greek Island of Mykonos last week, I was random Covid tested at immigration, causing a touch of nervousness while I waited -hours for the result.  And you’re not going to be able to dance or listen to loud music at night.But the benefits are endless. Your favourite tourist destinations are emptier than they’ve ever been during peak season, you’ll always get into your favourite restaurant, and the staff on British Airways have never been happier to see you on board.Most importantly,more of us choose to fly now, we will help keep affordable travel and tourism viable for years to come.I was one of just three people in total in a gym this week for a pre-booked, hour-long session.When we were booted out the moment our  minutes were up, the entire fitness centre was shut for a -minute deep clean.While we should, of course, encourage cleanliness, these types of self-imposed and over-the-top rules will make it impossible for most businesses to survive long-term.A healthy dose of common sense should be required, too.THE Prince of Woke emerged from his latest multi-million pound Calornian mansion this week to preach to the world, yet again, about racism.In an online conversation with Rashad Robinson, president of US civil rights group Colour Of Change, the usual clichés and judgy mumbo jumbo were out in full force.He spoke of “acting, rather than just saying”, going to “the root of the problem” and charity being “like bringing a bucket of water to a forest fire”.But what Harry didn’t talk about was his own notorious past of racist language and cultural insensitivities.After all, this was the Duke who was forced to undergo racial sensitivity training in the Army after using the P-word to refer to an Asian soldier.And this was the Duke who wore a Nazi unorm to a friend’s birthday party.If Harry wants to help spark real change and debate, it would be much more effective for him to stop the meaningless platitudes and talk publicly in some detail about his own journey.How did he realise that using the P-word as an adult is unacceptable in any circumstances How did he learn that larking about with a swastika around your arm as a member of the Royal Family is just plain wrong The Duke does have a valuable contribution to make about the need to stamp out everyday racism in society – one that will involve less pious preaching and more examination of his own notorious follies and foibles.LIKE Emily Maitlis, Naga Munchetty has become such a powerful BBC News presenter she believes the rules of the public service broadcaster no longer apply to her.First, the Breakfast presenter threw impartiality out the window to express a negative view about the US president Donald Trump.Now this week she has been caught pocketing cash to appear in corporate videos for the troubled car company Aston Martin.The Sun’s TV Editor Andy Halls revealed Naga didn’t follow protocol by seeking approval from her Beeb bosses and did not declare the fee she received either.That would be a sacking offence for most Beeb newsreaders.But Naga received the most minor slap on the wrist, with BBC bosses saying, “She has been reminded of the risk of conflict of interest when undergoing external engagements”.No wonder other BBC news presenters don’t want to follow the rules either.The corporation’s weak approach is asking for trouble.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I think it came from Japan ”“If you don’t stay two metres apart, you would definitely get coronavirus,” Blossom Lee Watkins, seven, of South Shields, South Tyneside, added.“You can’t touch people, that’s why people get coronavirus,” Lucas Claydon, four, of Consett, Co Durham, explained.Four-year-old Tim Ogah, from Newcastle, disagreed. He said: “I didn’t really miss my friends at school because I was far too busy in lockdown.”He added: “You can’t stop coronavirus because it’s too strong. We all need to be really, really careful as it takes over your bodyyou don’t wear a mask.”What about the Prime Minister, the man tasked with guiding us through the pandemic Blossom Lee said: “I don’t like Boris Johnson because he opened up pubs before he opened up parks!”“I don’t like him either because he’s too strict,” Clover replied.Blossom Lee then added: “He said that no one was allowed to have haircuts and then he had a haircut! I think Donald Trump’s hair is worse than Boris Johnson’s, I think Boris’s is great.”Evie Claydon, four, of Consett, Co Durham, cut in: “Everybody in my family has been shaving their hair off because they needed a haircut. My dad now looks like my uncle because my uncle has no hair.”The group agreed that, unlike many adults, none of them would shave their hair offthey couldn’t get to the hairdressers.The children then moved on to discuss the PM’s chief adviser Dominic Cummings.“Why did he go all the way to a castle to test his eyes ” Blossom Lee asked the group.“We just went on loads of walks in lockdown! We didn’t go very far,” Evie replied. “I really enjoyed lockdown because of all the days off nursery.”Matt Hancock, Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, was also brought up. Blossom Lee: “Matt is probably a friend of Boris because he has the same clothes as him.”“I would definitely be friends with him, becausehe’s friends with Boris then I could probably go and meet Boris and talk to him,” said Clover.“I would tell Boris to open everything up and be less strict.”Next, the children were shown a photo of national treasure Captain Sir Tom Moore, who raised £million for the NHS by doing laps of his garden.They instantly recognised him. Lucas said: “I don’t think Captain Tom would be able to play football with me. Well, maybehe had his walking stick.”Clover added: “When Captain Tom was knighted he definitely got a sword and armour.“He must have special armour attached to his walking stick. Maybe he uses his sword as a walking stick ”Blossom Lee said: “Maybe he’s got a magic power, where he shoots things from his walking stick ”Evie cut in: “If I raised £million, I would buy a flying unicorn.”The group were then shown a photo of Prof Whitty.Clover jumped in straight away to say: “I have seen him on an advert on TV. He says ‘stay at home’ and ‘don’t go and meet people’.”Blossom Lee wasn’t sure who he was but said: “I don’t think I would be friends with him because his eyebrows are scary.”Evie added: “If he had brown eyebrows then people would think he was nicer.”Clover said: “We need to glue some hair on him, because he hasn’t got much.”Later, the children were shown a photo of fitness coach Joe Wicks.Clover said: “He’s the person who goes on TV and does workouts and stuff. I would just get tired after doing his exercises though, I had to have a big glass of water afterwards.”The children agreed that Joe’s workouts were far too early in the morning.Most of the children missed going to school.Clover said: “I like school, and I missed not going because my favourite subject is art because I love drawing.”Blossom Lee said: “I think this will all be over in two weeks, I can go back to ballet then.”She added: “You should be washing your hands twice a day, once in a morning and once at night.”She added: “I really don’t like wearing a mask because it steams up my glasses.”GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

In person, hes got about  per cent of his skin that looks like hes been burnt with a kettle of water.The doctors have said he has got no quality of le. He doesnt sleep because of the itching and how sore he is. He shouldnt have to be in the pain hes in.Every hour I have to apply three dferent creams - thats every hour, even during the night. He screams as I put it on as well.Amy added that during his time in the children’s hospital and away from the flat, his eczema “almost disappeared”.She said: We actually started to be able to see part of his skin.But by the time he got discharged, within just a few days, he was back red raw and you couldnt see any of his skin again.Her four-year-old son Theo also suffers from eczema but only has occasional flare-ups while her other son Jaydon doesn’t have any issues, only a “small patch once in a blue moon”.Amy also claims her toilet was broken by the council and she had to wait three days for it to bring a portaloo at the start of July.During the wait the family were left using “buckets and pop bottles” instead.I had a blockage and as they went to unblock it they smashed the whole bottom of my toilet. They left that there, with all faeces still at the bottom. I had to use all my duvet covers and towels to clean it up off the floor, because it all flooded.The smell was not only in my house but you could smell it outside the property.Keeghan is meant to have at least minimum two baths a day for his skin, but he hadnt had that for three weeks because I wasnt bathing him in a stinking bathroom with faeces and urine in the air.The repairs to the toilet were eventually carried out after more than three weeks - while the council say the problem was “resolved as swtly as possible”.Amy said: Ive told them its not just a painting over job. I just want them to recty the problems, actually sort it out, because all theyve done for the past five years is come back with this magic paint to stop paint and mould but it just comes back twice as bad.Birmingham City Council claimed all the “urgent” repair works were carried out in October last year following the court case.A spokesperson for Birmingham City Council said: “While we apologise for any delay to repairs carried out, we do need our tenants to work with us.When a problem arises, we need our tenants to report the issue and most importantly, provide us with access to the property, including keeping scheduled appointments.All urgent repair works to the flat were successfully completed last October.The issues regarding the broken toilet were resolved as swtly as possible and were completed in July.A follow up will be made with Ms Harrison to ensure that there are no outstanding issues.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

A spokesman for Grishin said: “He is the unfortunate victim of a fraud perpetrated by his former we.

After the miners had tests for hepatitis, dengue fever and HIV, overseen by virologist Zhong Nanshan - the medical hero who managed the SARS outbreak in .The doctor sent sample tissues from the infected miners to the Wuhan lab, where many believed the virus was leaked from.

Some women have been making ­thousands of pounds by posting nude or lingerie-clad photographs and videos to paying subscribers online. But while critics have raised ­concerns about revenge porn, others say it is an empowering way for ­women to make a living – and even describe it as a “leline”. Website OnlyFans, which has  million ­users and , “creators”, ­reported a  per cent rise in sign-ups during March and April, while Fanzworld doubled its subscribers. Here, three women who signed up to adult-only subscription sites during lockdown explain why they did it – and how it has kept them financially afloat during the pandemic. Bar Manager Catherine Single mum Catherine, , says fan sites were “a godsend” to her after she went into lockdown facing serious financial hardship.She had been earning £, a month for nearly two years but, because she was self-employed, she found herself without any income when the bar she managed was forced to close. She said: “I totally fell through the gap. It was horrendous. “I needed two years’ worth of accounts to qualy for support and was only three months short of that. “It meant I was entitled to nothing – I couldn’t get help from the government and couldn’t be furloughed. “I was offered £ a month universal credit but that wouldn’t even cover my rent, never mind gas, electricity and feeding my kids, who are seven and . “We were all at home, so the electricity was being used all day and I had to feed my kids more because they weren’t getting their school meals. I panicked because I went from a full-time wage to nothing.” So when friends told Catherine about online adult subscription sites, she signed up. She said: “For me, it was a total leline. I made £, in the first month, after joining Fanzworld and OnlyFans. “Without that work I would have lost everything. “The fan sites were a godsend and got me out of a really sticky situation. “I didn’t feel brilliant having to do it,I’m honest. But lockdown put a lot of people in really bad situations. “I was lucky to find a way out. I’ve had friends take their lives because of financial struggles during the pandemic.”  Catherine, from Preston, Lancs, posted topless photos and glamour shots on the websites, but made sure she always felt comfortable with what she was doing. She said: “Sometimes I would just post a picture of me soaking up the sun in the garden. “The men would pay more for a chat on messenger online and that sometimes felt like a normal chat with a friend. “I had some lovely fans who understood why I was doing what I did and would send money to help me out. “Lots of people have a really bad perception of fan sites and think they’re sleazy, but it’s not what you think and you can make a fortune. You get to set your own standards and charge accordingly. “My subscribers paid £ a month and came from all over the world. A lot of the men in the UK were bored, home alone in lockdown and just wanted interaction.” She added: “I never worried about revenge porn because the men who sign up for these sites often don’t want people knowing.” Catherine now works in security – and runs courses to help get people back into employment after lockdown. She said: “This was a stop gap for me, but it really helped me through what would have been an unbearable time.” AE Nurse Nicola  Mum-of-four Nicola turned to adult sites when her nursing shts in AE were cut during the pandemic. The -year-old said: “I’ve been working in healthcare for  years. While coronavirus was at its peak our shts were reduced to stop there being too many people in the department. “It was such a depressing time, with everything that was going on. I decided to sign up to some sites initially for the fun of it and as an escape.” But Nicola, from Lincoln, earned £, in her first month – much more than her £, nurse’s pay. She said: “I am very careful about what I post. I keep it extremely tasteful. I post pictures or short video clips in swimwear, bikinis or gym wear. “I know some girls go totally nude, but I don’t – and I still do well. “I don’t worry about revenge porn because the pictures I post are no dferent from the holiday photos other women post on Instagram. “The only dference is I’m getting paid for it. I don’t do anything distasteful or harmful.” She added: “I’ve had negative comments from people who have said I do porn, but this isn’t porn. “It’s a legitimate way to make money during a tough time. And it has been a huge help financially.” Graphic Designer Abi  Abi turned to fan sites after she lost her job in the lockdown. The -year-old, who graduated from Leeds Beckett University in , was earning £, a year designing artwork for a paint brush company. She said: “I loved it. It’s what I always wanted to do.” But then coronavirus hit and Abi was made redundant. She joined several sites – including Glamour Lounge Live, which runs live webcams. She said: “I was nervous but because I can’t see the men viewing me I quickly built up my confidence. I’m now making an average of £ a week. I do worry about people re-posting my images, but I won’t post anything too explicit. I still want to go back into Graphic Design but this is a good alternative for now.” "},{"url":null,"title":"american tracks down brit crush","story":"NewsAmerican tracks down Brit crush she met in bar  years ago - but it doesnt end wellKate Lefler used the power of the internet and social media to help her track down a man she met on holiday in Plymouth- but its not a case of happily ever afterShareCommentsByKatie TimmsReporter:,  AUG NewsKate Lefler, , launched a search to find her perfect man named Adam after sparks flew between the pair two years ago \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"News, views and top stories .

Mark Bonito and Sophie Why bought the Fiat Ducato at an auction after it could no longer be used by medics, with all of the ambulanceaposs le-saving kit still inside. They disconnected the equipment and stripped it out, before giving it a good clean and starting the project of turning the emergency vehicle into a home. Mark was determined to use as many reclaimed items as possible, and the pair scouted car boots, charity shops and garage clear-outs to find what they needed. The interior is now unrecognisable, with a kitchen, living room, bed and desk all fitted out for just £,. The flashing blue lights have been removed and the outside has been restored so it still resembles a van but wouldnapost be mistaken for one. Mark and Sophie, who named the van Florence after the hero nurse, now use their mobile home to travel around and take in some of the best sights on offer.  Mark, a web developer from Surrey, said: Weaposve been to Dorset for the amazing panoramic views of the sea, with a am alarm to sit and watch the sunrise with a cup of tea. Weaposve had a few forest adventures, some riverside stays and last weekend we stayed with the children in the South Downaposs National Park, which is a dark sky reserve with an amazing view of the stars.  When weaposve been travelling to these places and there has been heavy traffic, we always say how handy it would be to still have the blue lights. We often get a second glance from other road users too.  The van has also been great for our relationship. We both have families from previous relationships, so it is great being able to have time alone together in the van but be able to get back quickly to our kidswe need to. Mark, , previously owned a Volkswagen T which he converted into a camper, but in April  he decided to upgrade his crash pad and set about refurbishing the ambulance. The bunk bed was picked up at a garage and the kitchen area was constructed from a rescued block found in a skip, with the original ambulance cabinet being converted into a sink. It took two months to complete and Mark recently passed the enhanced driving test required to drive such a heavy vehicle.  Sophie, , who works as a radiographer, said: Mark is always the first to admit that some research should have been carried out, as owning an ambulance does come with its complications. He likes things a little on the quirky side and liked the idea of buying a van that was complete with a good standard of servicing, and fully equipped with gadgets galore. Rescuing a service vehicle that had done a heroic job from being scrapped seemed the right thing to do. Mark added: We love the fact we have a reuse theme with all our reclaimed and upcycled items. Each item bears a memory of where we got it from.

Special Air Service and Special Boat Service members have been medically downgraded or forced to leave because of their condition. The disclosure comes after we revealed last week that thousands of our troops suffer from traumatic brain ­injuries after being hurt in a blast. We also revealed how three SAS officers flew to the US for treatment because none was available here. But many more avoid seeking help for fear of losing their ­prospects, according to one serving SAS soldier.  He told us: “If you seek help for a brain injury, you can kiss your career goodbye. You willbe medically downgraded and that will be it. There is no room for deadwood in an operational unit.”Many TBI sufferers become suicidal following a lack of proper treatment. In the past few weeks, several SAS veterans have taken their own lives. Ex-sergeant Lisa Brydon, , who battled PTSD and depression as she struggled to adjust to civilian le, was found dead in her car in June. In the same month, staff sergeant Jamie Ferguson, , shot himself after leaving a video saying he had asked for help but no one listened. And former SAS sergeant David Penman, , who suffered a TBI in Kosovo, died after ­battling mental health and alcohol issues. The Ministry of Defence claims that only  soldiers have suffered a brain injury in almost  years of combat.  But US military chiefs believe up to  per cent of troops who served in Iraq and Afghanistan could have sustained a brain injury – meaning , ­soldiers could have the condition. Unlike the UK, America screens its troops for TBI before and after combat. If they are diagnosed with the condition, they receive brain scans and ­hormone therapy. Our SAS source, who has served in Iraq, Afghanistan and other conflicts, said: “There are a lot of guys who fit the profile of someone with a TBI. “A lot of people have been blown up or close enough to a blast where they could potentially sustain an injury. A few have confided in me that they are concerned. “We all have contacts in the US special forces and are all aware how seriously TBI are treated in the US military.

The Independent Scientic Pandemic Influenza Group on Behavioursstrongly recommend national government, PHE, the media and others cease using the term aposlocal lockdownapos and instead switch to aposarea of interventionapos or aposrestrictionsapos. Documents released by SAGE said that the terminology used should “emphasise care not punishment” and that local emergency measures should be framed not as something that is done to people, but with and for them.” It also warned localised measures may “undermine previous perceptions of a shared adversity” and the collective spirit that we’re “all in this together”. It adds: “These responses can damage trust in central and local government, and undermine adherence to wider health measures. “Fear can lead to poor decision-making, inappropriate behaviours, and stigmatisation of certain populations, undermining the social cohesion.” Leicester was the first city to suffer a local lockdown when the government said unlike the rest of England it would not be allowed to open pubs, restaurants, hairdressers and other non-essential businesses on July . Since then Oldham, Blackburn and Darwen have experienced the same fate. SPI-B cited an investigation by the LSE Anthropology team of the local intervention applied in Leicester and how it impacted people that lived there. It said: “The lockdown because of its name and its targeting on Leicester was understood as a apospunishmentapos. “People felt that they had been aposforgottenapos but also had become the aposlepers of Leicesterapos or the aposPariahs of Leicesterapos.  “They felt aposashamedapos and like a aposlaughing stockapos because they were still aposin lockdownapos after the national day of lessening of restrictions on th July.” The Leicester investigation also highlighted other problems with local lockdowns, which included mixed and unclear messaging from the Government and confusion over geographical boundaries. Weaposre like the Leicester lepers, local child-protection worker, Tracy Jebbet, told Radio Leicester in July as she shared the news her holiday to Cornwall had just been cancelled. The management of the St Austell campsite she had booked to visit – Pentewan Sands – announced a ban on all bookings from Leicester and Tracy says they have told her she cannot go.  The -year-old told the BBC: We have not had an email from the park and canapost get hold of them. I understand itaposs for the safety of the people camping there and the staff, but we have adhered to the lockdown guidelines % and feel we are being penalised. We are regulars there and had been looking forward to it,but I felt like a bit of a Leicester leper when I saw the post.

Sources say the Sussexes would have to pay an eye-watering £, just as an “initiation fee” – with an annual membership charge on top. But that’s unlikely to be a problem as ­movie experts told the Sunday People Meghan could command million a filmshe ever ed to Hollywood. That would put the couple way above even the flashiest fellow guests at the Coral Casino Beach and Cabana Club, where they are said to be eyeing up a spot. The venue, part of Santa Barbara’s Four Seasons resort, is known for being an “A-list playground”. It is close to the mansion Harry and Meghan have bought in Montecito in her native Calornia. Michael Douglas, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Ellen DeGeneres are club members, and it was also favouredby Ronald Reagan. The number of members is capped at . The site has  acres of gardens, a saltwater aquarium bar with  types of tropical sea creature and a children’s pool and restaurant ideal for Archie. Guests can also rent the private Cabana , which has its own two-storey sundeck and private butlers. Prof Jonathan Shalit OBE, chairman of talent agency InterTalent, told how Meghan could earn £million – or million – for her first Hollywood film or TV series.He said: “I think her pulling power both in America and on a global scale at this moment is phenomenal. “We are talking a million fee. People are going to be fascinated to see her perform at the very start. It is going to be very compelling. “You get a salary based on your box office appeal, it doesn’t relate to quality of acting. “If Meghan is in a movie or on TV, everyone is going to look at it once.”Tonight Paul Feig, who has directed hit films Bridesmaids, The Heat, Spy and Ghostbusters, said he and fellow moviemakers were scrambling to work with Meghan.  Askedhe would sign up the Duchess, he said: “Meghan, bring it on. I would love to have you in a movie. I think she is great. I’m a fan.” And Emmy award-winning director Joe Russo, the man behind the highest grossing movie of all time – Avengers: Endgame – told how -year-old Meghan could offer some “incredible opportunities to filmmakers”. He said: “She can bring an incredible awareness to causes and issues, so I think it’s amazing she’s coming back to work in the business.” It has also emerged that Meghan – who found fame on hit TV show Suits as paralegal Rachel Zane – has been given the go-ahead by the Intellectual Property Office in London to trademark the name of her and Prince Harry’s planned foundation, Archwell, for “television shows” and “motion picture films”. Shalit added that Meghan’s choice of co-star would be crucialshe came back to acting.  He added: “If Will Smith or Tom Hanks agree to play opposite her, that will give her integrity and credibility.”Harry and Meghan could also earn six or seven-figure fees just for turning up at events. In February, Prince Harry, , gave his first speech as a private citizen at a conference thrown in Miami by JP Morgan where, according to some sources, he could have received a fee of up to £,.  Experts have said becoming a brand ambassador for a global giant such as Google or Apple could also earn the couple tens of millions a year. Their new mansion, which was on the market for £million three years ago, boasts nine bedrooms,  bathrooms, a pool, wine cellar, play area and pub games room. The property can only be accessed by a private road. The Sussexes have been living in the house for six weeks, after moving  miles along the coast from a mansion in Los Angeles where they were house guests.  Deed documents reveal that they bought the house on June , after taking out a £.million, -year mortgage. The couple put down a deposit of £.million. Records show Harry and Meghan’s new home – which also has seven acres of land, a pool, tennis court and guest quarters on top of the stunning main property – was sold to a company called the Residential Real Estate Trust. The Trust is registered to the address of Calornia lawyer Andrew Meyer, who is Meghan’s business manager.  The previous owner of the house was businessman Sergey Grishin. The -year-old Russian is known as the “Scarface Oligarch” as he owned another home nearby where the  movie was filmed. Grishin and his former we, Anna Fedoseeva, are currently embroiled in a bitter legal battle.

Omid Scobie said: “It’s something we’ve definitely seen over the decades... women being married into the royal family and leaving scarred. “If this were a business I’d really be investigating, perhaps by human resources, how this happened over and over again.” He claimed Meghan and Harry repeatedly and fruitlessly asked for support to remain full-time royals.  In a podcast, he accused the family of not being concerned enough about their mental health. Brit Scobie, who wrote Finding Freedom with US royal reporter Carolyn Durand, said: “Many of those times it fell on deaf ears or it didn’t seem to be taken seriously enough.” Meghan and Harry have denied co-operating with the authors.A royal spokesman did not comment. It comes as her husband the Duke of Sussex accused social media giants of stoking a crisis of hate and called on advertisers to use their spending power to transform the industry. Writing for US-based business magazine Fast Company earlier this week, the duke outlined his and his we Meghanaposs efforts to help the Stop Hate for Profit campaign.  He revealed they had personally been calling on heads of major corporations, asking them to suspend their advertising revenue from social media sites that fail to tackle hate speech. Harry said their message to them was to reconsider supporting s that have contributed to, stoked and created the conditions for a crisis of hate, a crisis of health and a crisis of truth.

Ms Nicholl wrote: “It was affectionate, warm and funny and touched William deeply. “When he said the couple’s decade-long romance was his inspiration, there was a shy smile from Chelsy, while Kate shed a tear. “The speech was peppered with Harry’s classic sense of humour, and he ribbed his brother ‘William didn’t have a romantic bone in his body before he met Kate, so I knew it was serious when William suddenly started cooing down the phone at Kate.’ “Famous for his mimicry, Harry then impersonated his brother calling Kate ‘Babykins’, to much laughter from the guests.” However, she reveals that Chelsy made him delete one line of his speech for fear it would leave Kate red-faced.  Ms Nicholl writes: “She had helped Harry edit the best man’s speech, sensitively advising him to take out a line about Kate’s ‘killer legs’ that might have embarrassed the bride.” Prince Harry also took responsibility alongside Kate’s sister Pippa Middleton for “transforming the Throne Room at Buckingham Palace into a nightclub” by organising disco balls and “giant glass bowls of Kate and William’s favourite Haribo sweets”.  Ms Nicholl writes: “Harry happily took on the role of master of ceremonies and made sure everyone was having a great time.” However, according to Ms Nicoll, Zimbabwean-born Chelsy decided the royal le was not for her after the wedding and an on-off romance with Harry for seven years. Ms Nicholl wrote: “Being part of the royal wedding had made Chelsy’s mind up once and for all. “The le of a royal bride was not for her and she told Harry she could never make the sacrices Kate had made.” One of Chelsy’s friends told Ms Nicholl: “It was just after the royal wedding when she realised she couldn’t cut it.

And no matter how old or frail they are, their service memories remain vivid. Because the sights and sounds of war can never be forgotten. In May I heard dozens of accounts of VE Day, that glorious moment when the fighting stopped and the boys could finally come home.  Except that wasn’t the whole story. Because in the stling jungles of the Far East tens of thousands of men were still fighting or starving in brutal PoW camps. It would be another three months before atomic bombs forced the Japanese to surrender,  years ago Saturday. And when our boys in the th Army ed home they got a very dferent reception. Brits wanted to move on. They didn’t want reminding of war. So Victory in Europe eclipsed Victory in Japan and those soldiers became the Forgotten Army.Colonel Cary Owtram wrote a memoir of his “ Days on the River Kwai” from notes he’d hidden in bamboo poles at his prison camp. “No publisher would touch it in the s,” his daughter Pat told me.  “People just wanted to forget the war.” Pat and her sister Jean finally published the book themselves, in . But far too many heroes suffered in silence for decades because others wanted to forget. It’s dferent now though, isn’t it  The Royal Family led the VJ Day commemorations, the BBC aired special programmes and told veterans stories and the Red Arrows flew theof Britain to mark the anniversary.

Nile fever can produce severe infections with flu-like symptoms in addition to muscle weakness, confusion and fits but in other cases, people can show no signs of ill health. Others might get a skin rash or nausea. There is no vaccine but it is not contagious. You can only get it by being bitten by a mosquito. The infection comes as the latest blow to hit Spain, after the UK Government slapped quarantine measures on Brits flying in from the popular holiday destination.Travellers arriving in the UK from Spain must quarantine for  days, under coronavirus travel rules implemented at the end of last month.The measures, which followed a spike of infections in Spain, present major setbacks to the countryaposs tourism industry. All the parks and gardens in two of the towns hit with Nile fever are being treated. The wetland areas and the wider countryside will also be disinfected as part of the plan. Yesterday, the mayors of the two towns joined in an emergency meeting and launched safety protocols and warnings to the public. The massive disinfection plan got underway on Friday to prevent the spread of Nile fever. Workers are using a substance which blocks the nerve signals of the larvae, stops them feeding, paralyses them and leads to their death within four days. Another spray is being used for stagnant water and prevents adult female mosquito from laying eggs.

Almost asan payback for the mini-heatwave Brits have been basking in in recent days, next week looks to be a washout. Sunday, Monday and Tuesday will be dominated by overcast skies, heavy rain showers and thunderstorms. However, this may just be a warm up act for Tropical Storm Kyle, which is currently working its way across the atlantic.The sizeable weather front is forecast to strengthen a low pressure area before potentially unleashing gails to the west of the Isles.While it is currently unclear whether Kyle will remain over the sea or hit the Irish coast and then move further east, the storm has the potential unleash some serious gails. Winds as strong as mph could hit the west of the Isles. Along with them could be some comparatively chilly temperatures.  Cool -C highs in the coming week will be C lower than last weekaposs record C six-day run.The Met Office has forecast further wet and windy spells during the rest of August, along with average temperatures.Autumn does not officially begin until September .  Met Office forecaster Marco Petagna said: Remnants of tropical storms can get caught in the jet stream and bring premature autumnal weather to the UK. Computer models show Tropical Storm Kyle doing just this. Kyle may generate a vigorous area of low pressure and bring wet and windy weather to the UK on Thursday into Friday. Itaposs a big change in the weather.  The Weather Outlook forecaster Brian Gaze offered a more gloomy forecast. He said: Itaposs payback time after the heatwave. The storm will bring us back to reality, with a taste of early autumn seeing washouts for families on holidays, with gusts of mph in the West and up to mph in exposed parts of the South. The eight-day run of Met Office thunderstorm warnings which began last Monday is thought to be the longest run on record of thunderstorm warnings each day.

They were getting people to leave. Quite a good amount of water around. Twitter users posted video clips and photos of buildings and roads that flooded.One woman posted footage of cars driving slowly through floodwater, with one pulled over at the side of the road.

On Saturday morning, firefighters used a boat to rescue two people and a dog from a van that became stranded on a flooded road in Bishopaposs Stortford in Hertfordshire. The water was about knee deep. In its yellow warning for thunderstorms, the Met Office said: The warm, humid airmass across the southern half of the UK will lead to further heavy showers and thunderstorms on Saturday, some persisting into the night.

The Met Office issued a yellow warning for thunderstorms across large swathes of England and Wales stretching across the weekend and into most of Monday.The warning says that spray and sudden flooding caused by the rain may lead to dficult driving conditions or road closures.The south of England and Wales are likely to be the wettest areas over the whole weekend, with other parts of the country seeing dry and warmer weather.The Met Office said .mm of rain fell in an hour in Canterbury, Kent, on Saturday, which could lead to some surface flooding.

Johnson needs to reach out and secure a good deal for Britain instead of posturing, pretending no deal would be good. It wouldn’t. It would be bad. Very bad.

A fellow wedding guest explained that a few members of the wedding party had been asked to wear casual summer dresses to the run-through, nothing over the top.But when they arrived, they were left mind-boggled when they saw that the -year-old bridesmaid was wearing a crown on her head reported Daily Star.Taking to Reddit, they wrote: I’m not sureitaposs petty or not of me to post this, Iaposm just genuinely mind-boggled. We were asked to wear sundresses for it… I get there and said bridesmaidhas a crown on her head. Rhinestoned, glittery, homemade, and it stood-out. The guest claimed that the woman had been wearing the crown for a while before she let the bride wear it. She then continued to wear it until it broke.  They said: She’s not the MOH[Maid of Honour] or the sister of the bride or groom. She had the future bride wear it for a few minutes after that, and then she had it back on and continued to wear it until it broke. Originally the person posting the rant thought it was a gt, but the way the bridesmaid acted proved otherwise. They continued: It’s not like she was giving it as a gt because she had it on the whole time and didn’t insinuate it was a gt. Nobody said anything to her so I assumed it was okay, and I understand it was just the rehearsal setup. It just made me cringe a bit.

The nanny was caught on the families CCTV cameras attempting disturbing act in the bedroom of her employers. In a very revealing Reddit post, the mother said she was shocked to discover that the carer she’d hired to look after her -month-old son had been secretly breastfeeding him. To make matters worse, the nanny also happened to be be their neighbours daughter.The mum had opened up to the -year-old nanny about her own breastfeeding issues. However, the nanny  who also looked after the couples -year-old daughter, started attempting to nurse her baby on her own. “During a conversation that we had recently , I mentioned that I don’t produce much milk which forces me to rely on donor milk to feed my son,” the mum confessed “She was very sympathetic and inquisitive about the situation, and I was happy to answer all of her questions while simultaneously thinking nothing of it.” The parents who are often away on active duty have nanny cameras set up in the living room and in my bedroom. They claim they never feel compelled to check the nanny cameras because of their total trust in the nanny. One after one rough day at work the mother decided she wanted a glimpse of her kids. That was when she made the startling discover.  I wanted to see what the little ones were up to so I decided to pop in. My nanny was sitting on my bed, rocking my son, and attempting to breast feed him. “I almost felt sick, it just seemed so inappropriate. I decided to wait until I got home to confront her about it, and when I asked she was incredibly apologetic. She said she wanted to help me because of my milk production issues and never meant any harm.” After initially accepting the nanny’s apology, the mum said she became suspicious and started going through old footage from the home cameras. She soon found it wasn’t a one-off occurrence.  “She unplugs the camera in my bedroom when she goes to put him down for naps and plugs it back in when she leaves,” she added. “After reviewing our recordings this wasn’t the first time she attempted to breast feed my son, among a few other questionable things .” It was then that the mum also noticed that some of her treasured baby items were missing.

Karen Ashbrook spent nine torrid years attempting to have children with her husband Wayne.The Dublin couple endured  IVF cycles and nine miscarriages, RSVP Live reported. They went on to go through four failed surrogacy attempts and then a further two pregnancy losses. Karen and Wayne met when they were  and immediately starting trying for a baby. Following a year without success they went to their GP, which proved the starting point of a long and emotionally painful nine year journey. The first two rounds of IVF failed, but on the third round Karen fell pregnant. “It was incredible,” Karen said. “It was the first time I’d ever gotten pregnant. I always remember it, we had taken the test on Mother’s Day so we thought it was meant to be.” Only a matter of weeks later Karen started suffering extreme pain. She initially brushed it off as normal pregnancy woes before having to be brought to hospital when she collapsed at work. There doctors discovered it was ruptured heterotopic pregnancy, a rare complication. “We were pregnant with twins, one in the womb but one was in my fallopian tube,” Karen explained. “My tube had ruptured and I was lucky I didn’t die. “I was rushed to theatre immediately, and my tube had to be removed and we also lost the twin in the womb.” It was a devastating blow for the couple, but they were determined to carry on and did two more cycles, both of which failed. “At this stage, we were thinking there is something not right, between not being able to get pregnant, then failed IVFs and losing the twins,” Karen said. The couple then began the y and expensive process of testing, from immune issues to genetics with a new fertility clinic in a bid for an answer. All the results came back clear, until they tried the Chicago Bloods test. That test told doctors that Karenaposs body was fighting the embryo. The clinic urged the couple not to worry and that they could prescribe Karen drugs to suppress her immune system so she could hold onto a pregnancy. “We fell pregnant the first round with the clinic but lost the baby again and it just carried on, Karen continued. Every time we would get a positive we would only get as far as the first scan around six or seven weeks to be told it wasn’t viable, my body was attacking the pregnancy.  At this point Karen was on the highest dose of drugs doctors would prescribe. She continued: “I was taking up to eight steroids a day. I was taking intralipids which is like chemotherapy, you are sat down with a drip for three or four hours. That is about €, a shot. I was having to do this before a transfer and afterwards in a bid to try and suppress my immune system and we did all of that, only to get pregnant and by six or seven weeks that would be the end of it once again.” Karen found herself particularly annoyed by one piece of advice people kept giving her. She said: “If I hear that line, relax and it will happen, one more time. You will never relax until you have a baby. It is never gone from your mind. People tried to tell us to take a break from IVF and it will happen but you’re constantly watching your cycle, you’re constantly watching your body, so you don’t relax, you never do. On the couple’s fourth cycle, disaster struck once again. Karen was pregnant and this time her bloods were progressing as they should. However, when her first scan came around doctors told her there was no pregnancy in the womb and that she was miscarrying. When tests showed her hormone levels were still rising, Karen voiced concern she was having another heterotopic pregnancy, however doctors dismissed her fears, insisting her tubes were clear.  However, Karen stuck with her instincts, packed a bag and presented at the maternity hospital and refused to leave. “I kicked up such a fuss that they admitted me, she said. The next morning the consultant came to see me and said, ‘you were dead right, it is in your tube’. Again Karen had to be rushed for surgery and doctors and to remove her only remaining tube. She said: It was devastating. I was just  and now permanently infertile and I would now never get pregnant without IVF.” The couple began treatment with a clinic in Spain, but again Karen would fall pregnant and miscarry by seven weeks. The set backs continued despite painful and expensive treatment with a Harley Street specialist and even when she tried donor eggs to increase her chances. The financial burden on Karen and Wayne has been signicant. You’re talking four or five thousand a go, with IVF, and that is without the medication and everything  on top of it, she continued. One year our medication bill was €,. And there is no support in place for that in Ireland, the government needs to step in and do something about it. In the background the couple had also started the adoption process. After finally being told they were eligible during their IVF journey, the couple was told there were no children to adopt. Following a failed attempt in Spain Karen and Wayne began to explore surrogacy. They chose a clinic in India, but their first cycle failed. A second attempt ending with a miscarriage at  weeks, despite the couple opting for a donor egg. “It was devastating, we thought when we’d heard a heartbeat at seven weeks that was it, because we’d never got to that point before, Karen admited. The couple tried once again but another surrogate miscarried at seven weeks. “That was it, three  failed rounds of surrogacy and we just couldn’t figure out what was wrong, Karen said. Are we just not supposed to have children  We were nearly seven and a half years into it. “Though out all this I was in work, I would get these calls, while in the office to say our surrogate had miscarried or the bloods weren’t looking good. And you have to deal with this, as well as deal with work, every single time, because no one knew. It was so hard.” After deciding they would not try again, Karen and Wayne opted for one final go - this time with an Indian donor rather than a Caucasian one. It worked, and after a brief scare when the clinic warned Karen the bloods had come back low, the good news started coming in waves. She said: “By the time they rang me back,  hours later, the bloods were through the roof, they were so high. They told me it was a sign of multiples. In March, after eight years of trying for a baby, the couple were told their surrogate was expecting twins. On the  October, following nine years of heartbreak, Karen and Wayne became parents to Isabel and Zach.  The couple flew to India the next morning and straight to their children to finally hold them in their arms. That time is a daze, I just couldn’t believe it, Karen admited. It didn’t feel real until we got them home. I burst into tears when we hit the runway in Dublin because I felt like oh my god we’ve done this. We had three and a half weeks with the babies in India but I kept waiting for them to be taken away or for someone to say they aren’t yours and take them off me. Karen said they faced another terrying two years once they got their children home due to Irelandaposs laws around surrogacy. Now she hopes that by shining a spotlight on it things may improve for the many Irish couples going down that route. We had to go to court to even get parental rights for our children, even though Wayne was their biological father, Karen said. We had to go through two years of court to get Wayneaposs parental rights and then I had to be two years living with the babies before I could even go to court and apply for any parental rights. I had no rights to my babies for two years, which was very frightening after everything we’d gone through, to feel like someone could come and just take them.  Karen and Wayne also had to go to court for the children to even be granted Irish citizenship and passports. She said: Ireland is very backwards about this and I’m really hoping that with this increased awareness they can start to put better systems in place. Karen has urged other women struggling not to lose hope, but to advocate for themselves and demand answers.

It’s huge. It’s the first time I’ve had to attend something like this.“You cannot help but feel empathy for the iniduals you see walking around who are wounded as well as for the staff in hospitals we speak with to make a full and proper needs assessment.“We were not there when those patients came through the door – however you can see the aftermath and it’s not a pleasant thing.”Working with charities UK-Med and Humanity Inclusion, David will report back to the Department for International Developmenton what help is needed.He is part of the UK aid-funded UK Emergency Medical Teamwhich was deployed to Beirut, to help the Lebanese in the aftermath of last Tuesday’s devastating explosion.The UK has pledged £ million to the World Food Programme and £m to the emergency relief effort in Beirut.Lebanon was already struggling with a spike in coronavirus cases when the blast hit.David said: “We’ve visited the blast site. It’s a crater and the buildings in the immediate vicinity of the warehouses have been pretty much levelled.“As you move backwards, the shockwave has struck other buildings and all the glass has clearly been blown out.”The UK EMT medics have been visiting affected health facilities across Beirut and meeting with Lebanese health workers and clinical staff, to get an in-depth understanding of how the multiple crises are affecting healthcare provision in Lebanon.They#ve been listening to their assessment of outstanding needs and gaps, to build a comprehensive picture of how the UK can best support.Many casualties will need long-term rehab after suffering slashed tendons and deep cuts to arms, legs and faces from flying glass.David, who now lives in East Midlands, hailed Lebanese medics for saving countless lives in the aftermath of the disaster.He said: “The Lebanese people have done an outstanding job at coping with a mass casualty event on a scale that is just unimaginable.“Geitaoui Hospital was a modern and well-equipped facility, set up to deal with trauma and Covid- to an excellent standard.“The hospital has been utterly devastated by the explosion and shock wave, which rendered the entire facility unusable.“The teams in the hospitals, even though the buildings had some fundamental damage, have dealt with the casualties extremely well.“As an emergency nurse and humanitarian health advisor, I can only imagine how horric it was to deal with the huge numbers of patients in the initial hours after the explosion.“It’s astounding that there were so few casualties, which is testament to the extraordinary efforts and skills of the Lebanese medics.“The challenge now is looking beyond the immediate crisis and getting health facilities up and running again. It’s clear that Covid- will be a signicant issue in the coming weeks.”International Development Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan said: “The Lebanese people continue to be in our thoughts at this terrible time.“The UK is sending these world-leading medics to use their expertise and to make sure the people of Lebanon get the help they need as quickly as possible.“This field team comes on top of the UK’s substantial military support and aid package.“We will do everything we can to help the people of Lebanon in their hour of need.”With the August  explosion believed to have been caused by thousands of tons of ammonium nitrate – which were stored in a warehouse – civil unrest is making le harder, with hospital visits disrupted by road blocks and demonstrations.UK medics to fly to Beirut to assist health response\" title\"#UK medics to fly to Beirut to assist health response# # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph    uk-medics-to-fly-to-beirut-to-assist-health-response embed # secretKGxEMKGuja\" data-secret\"KGxEMKGuja\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

Remember there’s another manager coming in after’.“Maybe that didn’t help!”He joined from Rangers a -year-old, for a reported £,, in  and his arrival coincided with a spark in form that led Scott’s Dundee to equal the best top-flight finish since the league-winning side of  .But less than  months later, when Boyack wasn’t given a squad number by incoming boss Bonetti, he knew it was all over.A former Scotland U  international, the midfielder had been on the fringes of Walter Smith’s Rangers squad during the Nine in a Row era.Despite making his debut in  alongside the likes of Andy Goram, Richard Gough, Jorg Albertz, Paul Gascoigne and Brian Laudrup – and up against Ray Wilkins in the Hibs team – he eventually moved on in search of first-team football.Step forward Dundee, with family ties making it the perfect move.“I had been at Rangers a while and it was time to move on,” he said.“I had family connections to Dundee, my dad was a big fan and was always talking about ducking school so he could go watch the AC Milan European Cup semi-final.“I think that local connection helped and I was quite happy people knew that. Dundee is a small place and I remember my granny from Broughty Ferry getting on the bus with me and saying to everyone, ‘This is my grandson, he plays for Dundee!’“It was the right move and it was great, for the most part anyway – it ended really badly.“Things started off great and I loved it at Dens. As much I was on the fringes of the first team at Rangers and playing in the reserves, Dundee was my first real club where I played consistent first-team football.“It was exciting times and completely dferent to reserve football – it’s just not the same pressure as a young guy at Rangers.“That was boy’s football – I was playing the men’s game at Dundee.“Suddenly it was a relegation battle and there’s all these experienced guys who are playing for a contract or to avoid a wage cut by being relegated.“The pressure was much more, suddenly everything was about  o’clock on a Saturday. Nothing  mattered.”The news was out that fans’ favourite Dariusz Adamczuk was leaving for Ibrox in the summer after three years at the club.Boyack said: “I remember there was a story at the time I was being brought in to replace Adamczuk because he was leaving on a Bosman, going to Rangers funnily enough.“I think it might have been right after I signed when Dariusz got sent off at Dunfermline and got a six-game ban. That gave me my start in the team.“We went on a run after that and won five on the bounce near the end of the season.“We had a good hard-working team with youth and experience mixed well, with some good players in there as well.“It was lucky how it started for me but brilliant as well.”Boyack made his first start the following week in a - win over Hearts before playing the final seven matches of the season, winning five, drawing one and losing the final match against third-placed St Johnstone.He also notched his first senior goal in a win at Pittodrie and followed up with another at home to Dunfermline as Jocky’s side romped up the ision and into a fth-placed finish.Boyack added: “I think at that time Dunfermline were at the bottom but they weren’t a million miles away from us so we needed those wins.“Jocky Scott andJimmy Bone made things very easy for us players, they were pretty old school and they built a good team. There were no favourites, they picked the best team.“We had guys like Gavin Rae in midfield, Iain Anderson, Eddie Annand, Willie Falconer, James Grady then there was Rab Douglas who wasn’t far off the best keeper in the league, he was brilliant.“Really dependable guys like Barry Smith and Brian Irvine, then there was Willie Miller who helped me a lot – anyone who kicked me, he’d kick them back twice as hard!“I think we must have had snot s of Premier League games of experience in that team but young players as well.”The following season, Boyack was a regular in the Dark Blues midfield with only Rae, Douglas and Steven Tweed featuring more for Scott’s men.The Dark Blues would finish seventh, just one point off repeating their fth place of the campaign before.However, that signalled the end of Jocky’s spell in charge and he made way for the flamboyant Bonetti regime.It was clear early on that there were going to be huge changes at Dundee and, unsurprisingly, the new manager didn’t fancy some of the stars he had inherited.But Boyack, who had played  times in the Premier League the previous season, wasn’t too concerned despite several warning signs.“We went on a pre-season trip to Italy and they didn’t seem to know who any of the Scottish players were!” he said.“Some of the older guys were saying the writing was on the wall but I didn’t listen. I said, ‘I’ve got a contract for another year andthey don’t want me, I’ll go somewhere .’”Boyack soon realised the experienced members of the Dark Blues squad were spot on and he was eventually put on the transfer list.It was too late, however, to go anywhere – a problem for a club needing to recoup some of the money they had already spent on new players.At the time, a frustrated Boyack told the Courier: “The managersaid I would remain here until another club met Dundee’s valuation but he spoke to me while watching a football video and I only got  seconds of his time.“No one has told me I am not good enough to play for Dundee and I’ve not become a bad player overnight but it’s now best I move on.”Twenty years on, Boyack is philosophical about his Dens dream turning into a nightmare under Ivano and his brother Dario.He said: “I didn’t play a minute under them but the club had a problem because they’d signed a lot of players but they’d done that before getting rid of the players they didn’t fancy.“I didn’t even get a squad number. They were bringing in good players and they gave my number to Fabian Caballero. He was brilliant so at least they gave it to somebody pretty decent.“ThenCaniggia came in#had somebody said when I signed a year before he’d be there I’d have said they were mad.“They told me really late in the summer that I could go but, at that point, a lot of teams already had their squads signed up.“There was a chance to go to Hibs but they brought in Didier Agathe from Raith Rovers and it ended up being too late for me. It felt like the goalposts had moved.“I eventually dropped down a ision on loan to Ayr in October because I couldn’t go on loan to another Premier League team.“I imagineI had dug my heels in about it all, I maybe wouldn’t have played for a whole year.“Ideally I wanted to continue playing at Dundee and play in semi-finals or finals because I knew what it would mean for the club and the fans.”He added: “For a while I was maybe not quite bitter but disappointed at the way things went. With a bit more time and experience you start to understand clubs do certain things.“I enjoyed it at Dundee, people always ask about the way things ended but it’s blown out of proportion really.“I bump into Peter Marr quite a lot actually and it all doesn’t matter now. I would have loved to have played another ,  games but it wasn’t to be.”Boyack would only play  times for Ayr before Craig Levein snapped him up for Hearts in a £, deal.He made  appearances in three years at Tynecastle. His most consistent football, however, was played at Dens Park under Jocky Scott.Now working in the construction and engineering trade, he says some of his best moments in the game came during his stint in the City of Discovery.“My best memories include my first derby. I remember walking across the road to Tannadice, I’d never done anything like that before.“It’s funny, you always remember the games you did better in! Big Brian Irvine scored, that was great for the big man, then I played in James Grady to get the winner and we won -.“I also remember going to Ibrox and winning. Rangers were flying at that point, seriously flying.“They’d just beaten Dortmund a few days before. My mates were saying we were in for a hiding and I didn’t disagree.“But they didn’t turn up and Gav Rae popped up in the last minute. I don’t know how many times Dundee have won at Ibrox but that was a great time.“And we were at a supporter’s do that night too. On the road down some of the boys were saying it was the worst time to have that, coming back from a game at Ibroxwe got stuffed.“Turns out it wasn’t a bad night after all!”Kane Hemmings says decision to leave Dundee #wasn#t taken lightly# in message to fans\" title\"#Kane Hemmings says decision to leave Dundee #wasn#t taken lightly# in message to fans# # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp kane-hemmings-says-decision embed # secretqvAoqpAp\" data-secret\"qvAoqpAp\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

To the best of my knowledge, he#s not a member of the SNP.#I can#t interrogate how people vote and nor should I interrogate how people vote. It#s a personal choice.#Nicola Sturgeon added that recent polls, which predict an SNP landslide at the next Holyrood election, could create an #issue#these iniduals are barred from holding appointments based on their qualications.She said: #On the basis of current opinion polls, more than half of all the Scottish population intend to vote SNP so there would obviously be an issuewe started to exclude people who have qualications to do things from doing these things because they might vote SNP.#I wouldn#t exclude someone who was qualied because they vote for another party.#I don#t think it should be relevant in terms of somebody#s ability to do a particular job that needs a particular specialism, which I don#t think anybody doubts Mark Priestley has.#I wouldn#t exclude someone who was qualied because they vote for another party.#First Minister Nicola SturgeonThe academic came under fire after the Daily Record revealed tweets he posted ahead of the last general election, in December, one of which stated that the #clear# message in some seats was #vote SNP or get a Tory#.He also tweeted that supporting Neale Hanvey, a candidate who was suspended by the SNP amid an anti-Semitism row, before being readmitted to sit as an SNP MP in June, was perhaps a #lesser of two evils#.Education Secretary John Swinney announced Prof Priestley#s appointment during a statement in which he also apologised to pupils directly affected by the downgrading of awards. Mr Swinney said that it was #deeply regrettable we got this wrong# and announced all downgraded results would be withdrawn and replaced by the original estimates.He also told parliament that the government hoped to learn lessons for the future and said the review led by Prof Priestley would provide initial findings within five weeks.Scottish Conservative education spokesman Jamie Greene said Scottish parents and pupils demand a #truly neutral and fully independent review# into the exams debacle.#If the SNP are serious about righting their wrongs over the fiasco, andthe public are to have any faith in this review, they must consider removing Mr Priestley#, he added.Prof Priestley has been approached for comment.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

If you#re going to one pub where there is a transmission risk and immediately going to another, you are quickly spreading that risk and making that greater than it would otherwise be.#Visiting lots of pubs in a single day or evening massively increases the workload of test and protect, so please think about that # it makes a really big dferenceyou stay in one pub.#There will be further restrictions on hospitality venues, banning queuing both inside and out except for takeaway products and for #unavoidable# safety reasons.Speaking during Friday#s Scottish Government briefing, Prof Leitch said Melbourne provides the #best recent example#, citing that it took four weeks of a six-week lockdown in order to #bend the curve# of infection.He added that while the curve has #slowed# in Grampian, the rate of infection has not yet begun to fall in terms of an overall trend.Scotland#s national clinical director added: #I am not surprised we are still seeing numbers related to this Aberdeen cluster and I#m hopeful as we see that de-acceleration we will then see that curve bend in the next week to  days but I cannot guarantee it so that#s why we continue with lockdown restrictions.#A total of  cases have been identied in Grampian since July  and  cases have so far been linked to the Aberdeen outbreak associated with pubs and other nearby venues, with , close contacts being identied so far.The NHS Grampian area accounted for  of the  new confirmed cases in Scotland overnight, taking the total to , across Scotland, with a further two cases attributed to an outbreak in Orkney.The First Minister also confirmed that nine cases were recorded in Glasgow and a further  in North Lanarkshire, related to a cluster in north-east Glasgow.When askedAberdeen could see its lockdown measures extended for a third week, the First Minister said: #All I can say is, I can#t rule that out but I hope we#ll be able to lt these restrictions as soon as possible.#We will formally review them next Wednesday and give the outcome of that.#For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

However, there are still numerous restrictions in place, including no operation of locks and bridges, limited services and limited staff available on the ground. This remains the position.#We are, however, pleased to let you know that Scottish Canals is planning to re-open canals to navigation in line with the announcement that Scotland’s tourism sector is preparing to reopen during phase three of the Scottish Government route map on July . Subject to the confirmation of phase three from that date, the canals will open to navigation as follows:While boats will be able to transit the canals, the operating hours and days still have to be confirmed#When the canals were closed to navigation at the beginning of lockdown, mooring customers received three months# navigation licence free of charge to June .Scottish Canals added: #We have decided to extend the concession to cover July, with mooring customers getting a credit note issued to their account next month in addition to April, May and June.#A deferment of boat safety certicates has also been further extended until September.With health and safety in mind, Scottish Canals will adopt strict social distancing, segregation and hygiene measures to minimise the risk of transmitting Covid- for the foreseeable future, including cough screens at transaction points, queue management and clear signage to remind people of the importance of physical distancing and good hand and cough hygiene."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor july 3 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSir,Communities on the A are blighted by the noise of bikers, many with illegal exhausts.Inveraray is the gathering point for motorcyclists and on a recent Saturday during lockdown around  were gathered, not two metre social distancing, and failing to adhere to the maximum eight in a group guidance.This has become the norm throughout the summer, and it seems lockdown guidance does not apply to bikers as they have been a constant feature on the roads, even in phase one.The unofficial Argyll TT goes past our homes most weekends over the spring and summer months.I have a bike licence and understand the feeling of freedom, but three-figure speeds past residential entrances, many of them hidden, is completely unacceptable.As a resident you begin to dread the weekend and sunny days. The noise is constant and intrusive for  –  hours in a day, the decibel level in excess of  dB where sounds above  dB are harmful to hearing.This is a serious issue for residents who cannot open their doors and windows, cannot use their gardens, pets are terried, it is often impossible to have a conversation, or a phone call. The noise from hundreds of bikes is explosive and destructive.The speeds are terrying, they travel in intimidating packs, the noise is threatening and the bikers have no respect for the communities they are speeding through.

But what we do not want to do is fall back into the same old traps that were so detrimental to the wildle, nature and ecosystems of our planet. Finding a way forward and a new balance is not just crucial for other species but for that of our own children and future generations too.Many will have been shocked at the sudden increase in fly tipping during lockdown plus the thoughtless parking and abandonment of picnic rubbish, disposable barbecues and indiscriminate toileting as lockdown eased.

It is now one of the most beautul drives in the place, and as a drive it would be destroyed.#The line from Glasgow to Oban took  years to build and finally opened in , proving extremely popular with holidaymakers for many years. The proposed branch line from Dalmally to Inveraray was never built, despite plans to #hide# the railway from the duke’s view. A plan from  shows a proposed tunnel to carry the line through the duke’s policies near to the castle.

Without action and proper investment from central government vital public services will be at risk.This news of huge strain on local authority budgets comes as the SNP is delaying in opening up Scotland’s hospitality and tourism industry. Instead of following other parts of the UK and opening the sector on July , the separatists are forcing businesses to wait until July .This delay will cost businesses millions at a time when thousands of jobs are already on the line.The SNP is risking people#s livelihoods. It needs to accept responsibility for that and take action now.Councillor Alastair Redman,Sir,People occasionally ignore the elephant in the room to support their point of view, but in his latest letter, Councillor Alastair Redman has ignored an entire herd in his living room.In his latest rant he states that the SNP is failing councils as the cost of coronavirus could hit more than £ million, but surely these costs would be the same no matter who was in power He also suggests that #essential local services have been underfunded for years# yet fails to mention the years of needless austerity cuts, actioned by his party and their collaborators, to bail out the greedy and risky practices of the banks, which reduced funding to a devastatingly low level in general. It is worth noting that the Scottish Government has put a greater percentage of their curtailed income into NHS Scotland than any part part of the UK. This has helped NHS Scotland to outperform all of the others, in the UK, for the past five years. This is paying idends now.He s to his familiar attempt to insult by referring to citizens who want to take responsibility for making and managing decisions and working to make their country prosper within the priorities set by its citizens as #separatists#. I’m glad to be described as a separatist because the alternative is to be an apologist for an unrepresentative government in Westminster and to abdicate decision making to that same out-of-touch group.It is Councillor Redman’s final point, however, that demonstrates his blinkered sycophancy. His suggestion that the Scottish Government should follow the example of other parts of the UK. Could he really be saying that we should follow the chaotic shambles and incompetence that has emanated from his chums at Westminster  Does he seriously think that any sensible person, irrespective of their own political affiliation and from any of the devolved nations, would swap what their government#s have done for the Westminster model Sadly, nowhere in his missive does Councillor Redman take time to mention the health and safety of our citizens.It is this, together with scientic advice and without political point scoring, that is driving the Scottish Government#s response to this tragic pandemic.Kevin MacKaveney, TarbertSir,Following reports of littering around Argyll and Bute, including the Isle of Islay, the issue was discussed at a recent meeting of Islay Community Council where community councillors heard that items like rubber gloves have been found dumped in ditches.It is always very disappointing to hear about littering and fly-tipping but doubly so in an area like Islay where residents take such an understandable pride in their environment.We also need to bear in mind that items like disposable gloves can pose a threat to livestock. As well as being profoundly antisocial, this kind of behaviour can be positively harmful.Those acting irresponsibly should remember that there can be serious consequences to their thoughtlessness.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSPSir,We all have a role to play in the recovery of the country’s tourism industry after its reopening on July .Scots could help by taking a trip, visiting an attraction or experience, shopping locally, dining out and booking a staycation.Scottish tourism is facing its biggest challenge in a generation and will need financial support for some time to come to help it recover. The Scottish public has a crucial part to play in helping this happen.It#s easy to not think of yourself as a tourist in your own country but many of the experiences that we often enjoy with loved ones, such as holidays, shopping or eating out, all contribute to our visitor economy.July  marked a new era for the industry as we start to welcome back visitors and take our first steps on the road to a safe and responsible recovery. However, reopening won’t be the same for all businesses, many are still adapting to this #new normal#, so it#s important that we recognise that as we move forward to try and restore our industry.We look forward to helping Scots rediscover their own country in a way that is safe for everyone # visitors, residents and those working within the industry.

Walking and cycling infrastructure needs to be improved, trees can be planted, and renewable energy can be expanded and made more efficient.Transport and food are the most obvious areas for behavioural change in Argyll. We need to be promoting the benefits of electric cars and making them preferable to petrol or diesel cars.We can easily bring food production and consumption closer together by shopping and eating more locally and more naturally. Farming in Argyll is generally quite low impact, but does not have the capacity to feed everyone in the area, meaning that we have to buy in meat which is less sustainably farmed to make up the dference. If everyone ate only the meat that is produced locally, we could dramatically reduce the emissions caused from the transport of imported meat, as well as supporting our local market and ensuring that it remains natural and sustainable. Reducing food waste is also an easy behavioural change.Acting on climate change is all about thinking of others. Across the globe, the people who see the most adverse effects of climate change so far are those who are already marginalised and vulnerable.Kindness and common decency indicate that we must act with the needs of these people in mind, with the knowledge thatwe do not act, ‘these people’ will soon become us and our children.One thing that I think would make a huge dference would bewe all took #our whole selves# to work with us.Whatworld leaders were constantly thinking: #what would my children say about my role in this decision # This kind of moral thinking would make a huge dference in the future of industry and politics, and the more we educate the next generation, the more influence they will have on their parents.Everyone can make changes such as cutting down on their meat and dairy consumption, shopping locally, re-using plastic containers, recycling, composting, reducing food waste, buying fewer new things, using a renewable energy supplier, and cutting down or cutting out air travel.At the Paris Agreement in ,  nations decided to take measures to limit the global temperature increase to . degrees above pre-industrial levels. Our current behaviour will not allow for this.A rise of  degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels will mean that large areas of land around the equator will be uninhabitable, resulting in huge numbers of refugees fleeing for their survival. Sea level rise caused by the rapid melting of the ice caps will mean that small island states such as Kiribati and Tuvalu will be submerged. The combination of the loss of arable land and ocean acidication due to temperature increase will mean global food shortages, such that we have never seen before.The rich will still be able to buy food, but those who are already marginalised and vulnerable will find it increasingly dficult to access basic amenities like food and clean water, further stretching the inequality gap.It’s not too late to make changes, but it soon will be.We all need to have climate change in the forefront of our minds when making any kind of decision, be it personal or business. It is an omnipresent issue and every decision, however big or small, will have an effect."},{"url":null,"title":"science matters are aircraft vapour trails harmful","story":"Dorothy H CrawfordUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAlthough much reduced by the Coronavirus pandemic, everyone has seen the vapour trails produced by high-flying aircraft as they streak across the sky. But what are they  and are they harmful Officially called contrails , these ephemeral, cloud-like structures are primarily made of ice crystals. They form at altitudes over , metres from water vapour in the aircraft’s engine exhaust as it freezes almost instantaneously at temperatures below minus  degrees celsius. There are, however, plenty of other volatiles and solid components in engine exhaust, including soot particles that often act as a nucleus around which the ice crystals form.Official figures show that air traffic contributes around five per cent of greenhouse gases. Yet these estimates only account for CO emissions. They do not include the effect of contrails, which can persist for hours and even expand into cirrus clouds several miles wide. These clouds, which are most abundant over North America and Europe, trap heat within Earth’s atmosphere, so do they improve our climate or contribute to global warming Air traffic has been steadily increasing year-on-year, so, assuming the coronavirus effect is a temporary one, estimates suggest that the distance flown by passengers will double every  years, and that air traffic will quadruple by . Therefore, it is imperative to determine how the increase in clouds created by contrails might affect us.In a recent study*, scientists used a climate model to analyse the future impact of contrails on climate change, taking into account their predicted increase balanced against any likely changes in engine soot emissions.The results show a three-fold increase in contrail cirrus coverage by , despite a  per cent reduction in soot emissions due to improved fuel and engine efficiency. These predictions cover all major air traffic routes and are mostly due to increased air traffic volume, although a sht to flying at higher altitudes also contributes. The area with the greatest increase will be Eastern Asia, where the largest rise in air traffic is expected.This previously unaccounted for, non-CO, climate impact of air traffic is now reckoned to have a more damaging effect on climate change than all the CO emitted from aircraft engines.*Atmos.

But it has also been a time of positive change and reflection, prompting people to be more creative. Writing, be it poetry, song writing or short stories, for example, has given many a way of making sense of this time, of sharing their feelings and looking after their mental health.For those who have found it dficult to know where to begin, Seil author Kenneth Steven offers this advice to help you start your creative writing journey.For me, there are two essential ingredients when it comes to setting out as a creative writer: time and space. By creative writing I mean poetry, short stories, novels and children’s writing: everything involving the use of the imagination.When someone claims they don’t have time to write, I don’t believe them as it’s a question of making time.PD James started writing when nursing a dying husband: he needed care all through the day. There was a part of the night when finally he went to sleep and she had the chance to put pen to paper, so that was what she did. If we are serious about wanting to write, we will make time.For many years I lived in Dunkeld, close to the entrance to the cathedral. When friends heard my address they would roll their eyes and say: ‘What a place to be. And you’re lucky enough to be a writer.’Except it wasn’t that easy. The truth is the modern world invaded even that idyllic corner of Scotland.First, there were thousands of pilgrim feet and voices. I was driven mad by not being able to find sufficient quiet. My former we watched a great deal of television. It was a tiny flat and the distant murmur of low voices maddened me because I couldn’t concentrate.It was she who suggested # probably to stop the grumbling # that I should have a cabin built in my mother’s garden in Aberfeldy, a place where I could hide away to write. After considering the idea for a few days, I realised she was right.When finally I sat down to start working in that simple shed among the trees, the words poured from the pen. I will never forget those first days. Poem after poem appeared as though by magic on the page. For me # and after many years of leading creative writing sessions, I would suggest for the vast majority of others too # finding real quiet makes all the dference.But it doesn’t have to be a hideaway in a garden it can be a living room or a bedroom or an attic – just at a time when others in the household are asleep or absent.There are few rules for creative writers, but one I have discovered is that we are all larks or owls. We’re either attracted to early morning or late evening.I have yet to meet anyone who has said they’re drawn to the mid-afternoon # what I term # hammock time, though that’s when I wrote in the Aberfeldy cabin. I’ve come to believe strongly you will use the time you are given. If that’s what you have, you will adapt to that rhythm.But I quickly came to realise in my cabin that I couldn’t simply turn on good writing like a tap. We go into our creative space weighed down by the modern world. We live lives beset by emails, phone calls and text messages. We are all expected to respond quickly.I think creative writers are generally poor when it comes to practice writing. The creative lives of visual artists, actors, singers and musicians are dominated by practice. Why should it be dferent for those from the writing community What do I mean by practice writing  Describing the view out of the window going back into memory to capture a moment as evocatively as possible imagining a dialogue between two characters. There’s no end to the possibilities. What practice writing provides is creative grounding. It brings us from being all over the place in our minds to give us creative focus.What this practice allows us to do is to start, then to pour ourselves into what I like to call deep writing. It creates a kind of doorway so the real writing can begin.Kenneth Steven is best-known as a poet. Sixteen of his collections have been published and he writes and presents poetry-related programmes for BBC Radio. He is also a Scottish novelist and children’s author. He’s written two handbooks on writing and led workshops and worked as writer in residence at home and abroad. www.kennethsteven"},{"url":null,"title":"if walls could talk","story":"Susan WindramUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsStrachur Smiddy opened its doors again on Saturday, August , after an uncertain few months due to Covid-.The museum will only be open on Saturdays and Sundays, until Sunday September , but for now families can again enjoy stepping back in time in the th-century blacksmith’s smiddy, which has been carefully repaired and restored to its original state and now acts as a working museum with with forge, bellows and anvil, cobbled floor, tools of the trade and beamed ceiling.Browse through the Smiddy’s collection of fascinating artefacts and tools.

Reduce light from the hall. Make sure there are no electronics sending out light e.g. a digital alarm clock with a lit display, sleep buttons on equipment etc.\"You may want to put black curtains at the window or wear an eye mask to limit the light getting into the eye.\"Sleep Scotland suggests wearing an eye maskOn the other end, you should also get lots of light in the morning to help you feel awake and alert.They added: \"Exposure to light at the right time helps keep the circadian clock on the correct time schedule.\"Make sure you open the curtains and turn on the lightsyou need to. Going for a walk is a great way to start the day.\"RoutineIt is only natural that during lockdown many of us have found that we have lost our routine and have been staying up later and lying in bed longer in the morning.Sleep Scotland said: \"Your body clock works best when you stick to a schedule.\"In an ideal world, yoursquoll go to sleep and wake up within a half hour of the same time each day, even on weekends.\"The routines of the day also give us powerful signals and demands that the body remain alert for certain tasks and events.\"Regular waking and bed times, alongside regular meal times are very important for regulating your body and its s.\"Sleep PressureSleep pressure is the term used to describe the feeling of tiredness we have, due to the activity we undertake through the day.,params: .pushSleep Scotland say it is important to be active in order to make sure we create the sleep pressure and drowsiness that will help us to fall asleep.They argue that having a nap can relieve our sleep pressure, meaning we find it harder to fall asleep at bedtime.Take a tech breakNaturally during lockdown many of us have resorted to using screens to help keep us entertained,to work and to socialise with friends.And while most modern tech has a blue light filter, it does not filter all light.More importantly, the things you do online are usually things that stimulate your brain and make it harder to turn off when you get into bed.Therefore, Sleep Scotland say you should unplug from all screens at least an hour before bedtime.They added: \"In the hour before bed, ensure you focus on doing things that are calming.\"Now is the time to read, draw, do some calming exercises, have a warm bath etchellip\""},{"url":null,"title":"selkirk-needs-20mph-speed-limit","story":"A MPH

of cometary dust - producing up to  meteors every hour.If skies are clear, the display of celestial fireworks should be visible across the UK from about midnight tonightuntil .am UK time on Thursday, August  - according to astronomers at Royal Observatory Greenwich.What are the Perseids The astronomical event is associated with the dusty debris left by Comet Swt-Tuttle, which orbits the sun once every  years.The meteoroids from the comet, mostly no bigger than a grain of sand, burn up as they hit the Earthrsquos atmosphere at  miles per second to produce a shooting stream of light in the sky.Peak temperatures can reach anywhere from ,C to ,C as they speed across the sky.The meteors are called Perseids because they seem to dart out of the constellation Perseus.The meteor shower began on July  and will continue to be visible until August .What have astronomers said Anna Ross, an astronomer at the Royal Observatory Greenwich, said the best time to spot the meteors is between midnight and .am on Thursday, when up to  meteors or ldquoshooting stars will be visible per hour, which is more than one every second.She told the PA news agency: ldquoThis makes the Perseids one of the most impressive meteor showers of the year.ldquoDuring the peak night of the shower, you will be able to find it in the north-east of the sky, getting higher throughout the night.ldquoYou donrsquot have to be able to see Perseus to spot meteors, however, as they will be moving away from the radiant across the whole sky in every direction.To make the most of the meteors, Ms Ross said observers should avoid well-lit and built-up areas and try to find an unobstructed view to the east.She added: ldquoFind a dark area and allow around  minutes for your eyes adapt to the dark.ldquoAs meteors move quite fast across the sky itrsquos best to look up without using telescopes or binoculars so you can see as much of the sky as possible.How regular will the meteors be The Perseids are one of the more active meteor showers on stargazersrsquo calendars, producing an average of between  and  shooting stars an hour at their peak.The shower in rsquos was especially active, delivering up to  meteors an hour at its height.While the shooting stars this year wonrsquot be quite as regular, stargazers can still expect to see around  of them an hour.Do I need special equipment to see the Perseids Meteor showers are typically visible with the naked eye, so no special equipment is needed, but those in rural areas with minimal light pollution will have a clearer view.Heading out to a dark spot is the best plan of action, but stargazers should allow around  minutes for their eyes to become accustomed to the dark.Patience is also a virtue, with shooting stars tending to appear in clusters, followed by a lull.The meteors will appear to come from the direction of the Perseus constellation in the north eastern part of the sky, although they should be visible from any point.A cloudy night could still scupper your chances of spotting any meteors, however, so keep your eye on weather forecasts."},{"url":null,"title":"confident-borders-schools-safe-says-council-chief","story":"THE leader of Scottish Borders Council says she has \"every confidence\" that schools have been made safe

Bumps or bruises donrsquot mean something is ruined.Dont can the cans:Canned goods can last for decades. Even a can thats started to rust should still be okay, as long as it isnt bulging and the seal is intact.Check the packaging, use your senses, cook food thoroughly, and donrsquot let the perfect become the enemy of the good. A proper understanding of expirationdates could drastically cut down on food wastemdashnot to mention wasted money out of your pocket..

Surprised . You dont know how to store your cooking oilsSome cooking oils are best stored in the cabinet, while others can be refrigerated. Credit: Getty   Angelina ZinovievaCooking oils sourced from fruits, vegetables, nuts, and seeds each have dferent storage needs. Exposure to oxygen, light or heat will subject oil to oxidation, eventually turning it rancid. While some cooking oils can be stored at room temperature, others do best when stored in the fridge.Corn and rapeseed oils:These do just fine stored in a cool, dark cabinet, or you can refrigerate themit takes more than a year to get through a bottle.Olive oil:Leaving olive oil out on the counter or a table, especiallythe bottle gets direct sunlight, or storing it on or near a stove are surefire ways to turn it rancid quickly. Place it in the coolest, darkest place in your home or use a smaller glass bottle in the kitchen.Peanut oil:Can be kept for as long as two yearsstored tightly capped and away from heat and light. Keeping peanut oil in the fridge may extend shelf le even further.Coconut oil:Very stable andhas a shelf le of two years or more.Avocado, grapeseed, hazelnut, sesame, truffle, walnut, safflower and sunflower:Delicate oils that are especially prone to rancidity, especiallyexposed to too much light or heat. Refrigerating after opening is recommended. Kept cold, these oils will remain viable for six months or more.. Youre using the wrong containers to store your foodWe tested the best-selling plastic and glass food storage containers on the market to find the best of the lot. We dropped them onto a linoleum floor, froze them, microwaved them, stained them, pried them apart, stacked them back together, and lots more.Best glass container:Pyrexs Cook and Eat Glass Storage Setisa great choice. Food wont leak, and the glass wont shatter. While the BPA-free lids maystain, they will come clean after a run in the dishwasher. Therersquos a vent for microwave reheats and, as long as the contents are defrosted, itrsquos also preheated oven safe.Best plastic container:Rubbermaidrsquos Easy Find Lidscontainers wonrsquot spring a leak unless you shake them violently, and drops arenrsquot a problem unless the container happens to fall on its side or a corner. No plastic container is oven-safe, but the set is marked dishwasher- and microwave-safe and carries a letime warranty. You should avoid freezing this set, as expanding food may pop the lid.. Youre incorrectly storing fruits and veggiesDo you know which vegetables should stay at room temperature, which should be kept inside a salad drawer, and which should never be stored together  Are you sure Do not refrigerate:Potatoes, onions, garlic, winter squash, tomatoes, bananas, peaches, plums, avocados, mangoes, melons, apples, pears, kiwis, and citrus. Exceptions include freezing for smoothies, or refrigerating for brief periods when theyre close to spoiling.Keep separate:Produce that emits high levels of ethylene gas, including ripe bananas, apples, stone fruit , cantaloupe, honeydew melons, mangoes, pears, ripe kiwis, tomatoes, onions, and leeks.Store alone:Ethylene-sensitive produce, including aubergine, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, carrots, caullower, cucumber, leafy greens, peas, peppers, squash, sweet potatoes, strawberries, and watermelon.,params: .push. Youre letting your avocados turn brownThere are many ways to store a cut avocado, but only one that will actually keep it from browning and preserve the flavour: Leave the pit in an avocado, and tightly wrap the half in plastic wrap to keep the flavour and texture intact.. Youre letting the food in your fridge accidentally freezeFoods in your fridge shouldnt be freezing. Credit: Getty   IssaurinkoBiting into frozen food thatrsquos merely supposed to be refrigerated isnrsquot just annoying: Freezing can completely alter the taste and texture of your food. And itrsquos probably because yoursquore probably arranging your fridge the wrong way.Check your fridges temperature settings:The ideal temperature range for the interior of your fridge is degC and below.Determine problem areas:According to appliance manufacturer GE, the most common problem areas are the top shelf, the bottom of the fridge , and door shelves.Avoid vents:Most fridges have a cooling vent above the top shelf. This is where most of the cold air comes from, so keeping food away from here may prevent freezing. Adjust your freezer:Turn up your freezer temperature settings, but nothing north of degF, which will facilitate bacterial growth and accelerate food spoilage.Check your ice maker:Make sure that your ice maker is not constantly running. This could make your freezer too cold and subsequently cause your refrigerated foods to freeze.Stock up your fridge:Refrigerators need to be well-stocked to absorb all of the cold air being vented into the cavity. If it is relatively empty, all of the cold air will sink to the bottom of the cavity and freeze your food. A fully stocked fridge will help maintain temperatures and, as a result, use less energy.. Youre not fixing a door that wont shut properlyIf your fridge door wont close, its probably due to an old, dried-out gasket, the rubber seal that runs along its edge. Luckily, the fix is simple: wash the gasket, and apply petroleum jelly to the rubber to revitalize the old rubber.. Youre not regulating your fridges temperatureA full fridge will help keep the temperature consistent. Credit: Getty   Group StudioDid you know your fridge could actually be making you sick  To keep food out of what the Food Saftey Agency calls lsquothe danger zonersquo, it needs to remain below degC. The freezer should be set to -degC to keep freezer burn at bay. If your fridge and freezer are regularly warmer than those temperatures, yoursquore risking faster spoilage. Here are a few things you can do to keep your fridge properly chilled:Invest in a fridge thermometer.To use, place the thermometer in a cup of water. Why  Your refrigerator measures the temperature of the air around your food, but you want to simulate the temperature inside your foods. Check the thermometer after  hours and then, adjust the temperature of each appliance based on the results.Check to make sure the gasket is in good shape, and seals well.If you can open the door with one finger, your seal isnt tight enough. A leaky seal is an energy waster, and may be a risk to your food.Dust your refrigerators cooling coils,theyre visible. You can use a long, skinny brush made for this purpose.Cover your food.For example, leave eggs in their carton, not in the door.Keep a full fridgeto retain the cold, but leave enough room for air to circulate.The product experts at Reviewedhave all your shopping needs covered.

Keep your wall colours neutral, like white and grey, but use your curtains, bedding and cushions to inject splashes of colour.Buying new bedding and hanging a new set of curtains can cost a lot less than a few tins of paint once you factor in all the rollers and brushes yoursquoll need to buy, plus it will take less time too.Once yoursquove bought the cushions, next time yoursquore thinking about changing the colour, just buy new covers and match the size of the cushions. That means you can store the others away, pass them on to a friend or use them in another room.Donrsquot forget about artwork. You can find some really trendy prints online and IKEA is great for cheap frames too. Make sure you buy the same size prints each time, meaning you can keep the same frames. You can update the frames easily too with a cheap can of spray paint.Canrsquot afford a new carpet  Yoursquoll be amazed at what a good deep clean and adding a colourful or patterned rug can do.If your furniture is looking a bit tired, upcycle with a lick of paint and new door handles. You can pick up a tin of furniture paint from most hardware stores or online and you can buy cute, quirky doorknobs from eBay or Etsy, or even just try spray painting the existing ones.Metal accessories like curtain rods and light fittings can benefit from that spray paint too!Upcycling is a great way to keep costs low, give a much loved item a new lease of le and is good for the environment by cutting out waste.Living roomMoving on to the most used room in the house, this can be the most dficult to update as it no doubt has many uses. From the TV room to the playroom to the dining room, your living space probably needs to be more practical than anything . But you can still add some style along the way.Your sofa likely dominates the room and can be the most expensive piece in the room ndash with the exception of the TV! So replacing this often can be costly. But have you considered replacing the covers  If your sofa is in generally good condition but itrsquos looking a bit off-colour, you can buy covers that fit over the top.IKEA do a range of these covers that are made for their sofa ranges, but you can find places online that offer made to measure services. This can be more expensive, but definitely cheaper than buying a whole new sofa and are machine washable! Alternatively, adding a new throw and some scatter cushions can have the same effect.Many of the tips for the bedroom can be used in the living room too.

midnight tonightuntil .am UK time on Thursday, August  - according to astronomers at Royal Observatory Greenwich.What are the Perseids The astronomical event is associated with the dusty debris left by Comet Swt-Tuttle, which orbits the sun once every  years.The meteoroids from the comet, mostly no bigger than a grain of sand, burn up as they hit the Earthrsquos atmosphere at  miles per second to produce a shooting stream of light in the sky.Peak temperatures can reach anywhere from ,C to ,C as they speed across the sky.The meteors are called Perseids because they seem to dart out of the constellation Perseus.The meteor shower began on July  and will continue to be visible until August .What have astronomers said Anna Ross, an astronomer at the Royal Observatory Greenwich, said the best time to spot the meteors is between midnight and .am on Thursday, when up to  meteors or ldquoshooting stars will be visible per hour, which is more than one every second.She told the PA news agency: ldquoThis makes the Perseids one of the most impressive meteor showers of the year.ldquoDuring the peak night of the shower, you will be able to find it in the north-east of the sky, getting higher throughout the night.ldquoYou donrsquot have to be able to see Perseus to spot meteors, however, as they will be moving away from the radiant across the whole sky in every direction.To make the most of the meteors, Ms Ross said observers should avoid well-lit and built-up areas and try to find an unobstructed view to the east.She added: ldquoFind a dark area and allow around  minutes for your eyes adapt to the dark.ldquoAs meteors move quite fast across the sky itrsquos best to look up without using telescopes or binoculars so you can see as much of the sky as possible.How regular will the meteors be The Perseids are one of the more active meteor showers on stargazersrsquo calendars, producing an average of between  and  shooting stars an hour at their peak.The shower in rsquos was especially active, delivering up to  meteors an hour at its height.While the shooting stars this year wonrsquot be quite as regular, stargazers can still expect to see around  of them an hour.Do I need special equipment to see the Perseids Meteor showers are typically visible with the naked eye, so no special equipment is needed, but those in rural areas with minimal light pollution will have a clearer view.Heading out to a dark spot is the best plan of action, but stargazers should allow around  minutes for their eyes to become accustomed to the dark.Patience is also a virtue, with shooting stars tending to appear in clusters, followed by a lull.The meteors will appear to come from the direction of the Perseus constellation in the north eastern part of the sky, although they should be visible from any point.A cloudy night could still scupper your chances of spotting any meteors, however, so keep your eye on weather forecasts."},{"url":null,"title":"new-head-education-named","story":"Ms Brown is currently the chief operating officer for education with the local authority and will take the place of Fiona

said many friends had been left worried and scared after the initial results came out, warning that the fiasco had been ldquobad for their mental health.Erin, who was a sixth-year student at Musselburgh Grammar School, said: ldquoOn a personal level, I was lucky to receive the results that I needed in order to move on to university however, I am aware of a lot of young people, including close friends, who were left scared and worried after not receiving a conditional offer to uni that was reliant on these results.ldquoThis badly impacted their mental health, particularly during the

The impact on Olivebank Road would be truly calamitous.The plan will go before a lsquovirtualrsquo meeting of the planning committee after being called off the delegated list by ward councillor Stuart Currie because of the level of local concern.He said: ldquoI have called this application off the list to ensure that all the concerns raised by local residents are discussed and elected members can understand not only the strength of feeling but also the planning issues that exist as a result of this application.Musselburgh  Inveresk Community Council has lodged an objection, citing traffic congestion, emissions, and the facilityrsquos close proximity to local schools as concerns.A public campaign lsquoNo McDonaldrsquos in Musselburghrsquo was also launched in a bid to halt the plan, highlighting concerns such as increased traffic congestion, litter and air pollution.The planning report stated that there were  written representations to the application and, of these,  were objections.It said: ldquoThe councilrsquos road services advise they accept the conclusions of the traffic network modelling exercise, that the traffic impact associated with the proposed development would be minimal and there would be no adverse impact on the operation of the local highway network.ldquoMany written objections are made on the grounds of the proximity of the proposed drive-thru restaurant to Musselburgh Grammar School, and that such a facility promotes unhealthy eating and thus would lead to harmful health consequences.ldquoThe East Lothian Local Development Plan  does not contain any policies restricting the location of drive-thru restaurant facilities to a certain distance from schools, or any other educational establishments. Nor does it contain any policies relating to unhealthy eating or the health consequences of proposed developments. Thus, and in the absence of national guidance on health consequences of proposed developments, no signicant weight can be given to these matters.The report added: ldquoOn the matter of air quality, the public health and environmental protection officer advised that the proposed development was anticipated to result in up to  customer vehicles visiting the premises daily, which was a signicant number of additional vehicles given the proximity of site to the Air Quality Management Areaon Musselburgh High Street.The officer agreed with the conclusion of McDonaldrsquos Air Quality Assessment that impacts upon air quality at ldquosensitive receptors would not be signicant. The officer advised that, whilst it was acknowledged that additional traffic would have an impact upon queuing and reduce traffic speeds, the composition of the increased traffic would be from passenger cars, which are less polluting than HGVs and buses.The officer concluded that the proposed development would have ldquono harmful impact on air quality nor on the objectives of the AQMA and would not harm the amenity of the area.A McDonaldrsquos spokesperson said: ldquoWe look forward to progressing with this application and believe a new McDonaldrsquos would bring signicant investment to the local community, as well as create at least  new jobs.A supporting statement from the company added: ldquoThere are few restaurants in the country who can claim to have made so many positive changes to support healthier lestyles. McDonaldrsquos believe that the lessons they have learned in making these changes can be used to support a wider drive to reduce obesity.Planners are recommending the plan be approved with a number of conditions, including submission of litter and pest management plans.A council spokesperson declined to comment, saying the planning committee would consider the application next week."},{"url":null,"title":"wavegarden-scotland-surf-resort-takes-step-closer-reality----looks-unreal","story":"Artists drawings of the plans for Wavegarden Scotland show the extent of the project - which is hoped to create  jobs and generate up to poundmillion for the local economy every year.The visitor attraction is planned for the disused Craigpark Quarry near Ratho on the outskirts of Edinburgh.Artist impressions for the food and retail hubsThe project will involve the installation of underwater technology that can create , waves per hour, from slow moving white water for beginners through to powerful barrels up to two metres high for experts.Yesterday, the teams developer confirmed it had been backed by planners to include a food and retail hub, as well as glamping pods for accommodation.Tartan Leisure Ltd, developers of Scotlandrsquos first articial surf park, Wavegarden Scotland, received planning permission today.

With over , results downgraded and pupils in the most deprived areas penalised, appeals on a scale not seen before are now predicted.Theto schools in these exceptional times will already be stressful for teachers. Add to that the tsunami of appeals that secondary teachers face having to process and there is a risk that the pressure will become overwhelming.One way to fix this would be to revert to teachersrsquo estimates for grades which have been reduced. This would show pupils in the most disadvantaged areas, who were twice as likely to have results downgraded, that their hard work will ensure they have the same chances as those in more affluent areas.I hope that is the course John Swinney takes this week. But evenhe does finally do the right thing, this is only the latest in a series of catastrophic errors made during his time as Education Secretary. In June, the late switch from his blended learning plan to a full-timeto schools left teachers and other staff only weeks to prepare.Before Covid-, the SNP said they should be judged on their record on education, but the attainment gap has hardly shted in  years. Mr Swinney was also forced to drop his ldquoflagship education bill and his standardised testing for Ps was widely condemned. He even ended Scotlandrsquos participation in two long-standing international comparison surveys because the SNP did not like the results.Given this abysmal record, it is time for Mr Swinney to be held accountable for his failings and go.

Essentially, this means there should be no way of telling yoursquove been there ndash no litter, no signs of fires, no damage to trees or other elements of the environment.This is a good example of wild campingSome very conscientious campers take this further by removing litter left by others, i.e. the site looks better for them having been there. Hats off to these heroes.If it can sometimes be dficult to define what wild camping is, itrsquos easier to say what it isnrsquot.It isnrsquot pitching a tent in a car park, and it certainly isnrsquot turning up with your entire family and friends and a car full of glamping kit and or lager.It may also surprise some people, but responsible wild camping would not include an open fire at least not in certain areas. SOAC states that you should ldquonever light an open fire during prolonged dry periods or in areas such as forests, woods, farmland... So, fires in the woods are in breach of the code, as are fires anywhere during dry periods.If yoursquore desperately in need of a fire, the place to have it is on the beach.Itrsquos also a good idea to bring your own wood. Collecting fuel on-site isnrsquot a good thing, as dead wood is a valuable part of ecosystems. Cutting branches from trees may constitute vandalism and anyway, green wood burns really badly.Perhaps itrsquos also important to think about the ethos behind wild camping.As mentioned, truly wild camping should have an intrinsic respect for, and minimal impact on, the natural environment.At some of our sites, wersquove seen a huge increase in camping in recent years.Many of those involved are reasonably responsible campers, fires aside, that is, leaving little or no litter.However, the cumulative effect of such a high density of campersis to slowly degrade the natural environment.Then, of course, therersquos the issue of where all these people are going to the toilet, but letrsquos not dwell on that.So, perhaps it just needs a little more thought on the part of the campers.Some sites are simply inappropriate ndash Aberlady Bay and Traprain Law, for example, being a nature reserve and scheduled monument respectively.Others may be OK sometimes, but not when busy.Under these circumstances, it may be that prospective campers should think about choosing another venue.Right, rant over normal service will be resumed next month."},{"url":null,"title":"pictures-section-a68-carriageway-completely-washed-away-storm","story":"The heavy rain falling on the section of road from Pathhead to Fala caused the foundations of the safety barrier and part of the road to wash away, leaving a big hole in its place.Damage to the road began early on Wednesday morning.

Keep your wall colours neutral, like white and grey, but use your curtains, bedding and cushions to inject splashes of colour.Buying new bedding and hanging a new set of curtains can cost a lot less than a few tins of paint once you factor in all the rollers and brushes yoursquoll need to buy, plus it will take less time too.Once yoursquove bought the cushions, next time yoursquore thinking about changing the colour, just buy new covers and match the size of the cushions. That means you can store the others away, pass them on to a friend or use them in another room.Donrsquot forget about artwork. You can find some really trendy prints online and IKEA is great for cheap frames too. Make sure you buy the same size prints each time, meaning you can keep the same frames. You can update the frames easily too with a cheap can of spray paint.Canrsquot afford a new carpet  Yoursquoll be amazed at what a good deep clean and adding a colourful or patterned rug can do.If your furniture is looking a bit tired, upcycle with a lick of paint and new door handles. You can pick up a tin of furniture paint from most hardware stores or online and you can buy cute, quirky doorknobs from eBay or Etsy, or even just try spray painting the existing ones.Metal accessories like curtain rods and light fittings can benefit from that spray paint too!Upcycling is a great way to keep costs low, give a much loved item a new lease of le and is good for the environment by cutting out waste.Living roomMoving on to the most used room in the house, this can be the most dficult to update as it no doubt has many uses. From the TV room to the playroom to the dining room, your living space probably needs to be more practical than anything . But you can still add some style along the way.Your sofa likely dominates the room and can be the most expensive piece in the room ndash with the exception of the TV! So replacing this often can be costly. But have you considered replacing the covers  If your sofa is in generally good condition but itrsquos looking a bit off-colour, you can buy covers that fit over the top.IKEA do a range of these covers that are made for their sofa ranges, but you can find places online that offer made to measure services. This can be more expensive, but definitely cheaper than buying a whole new sofa and are machine washable! Alternatively, adding a new throw and some scatter cushions can have the same effect.Many of the tips for the bedroom can be used in the living room too. Like adding a nice feature wall for a splash of colour or why not try adding a nice gallery wall with lots of family pictures  A great way to add a personal touch to a room. You can even get the family involved to pick out their favourite pictures.Plants are a great way to brighten up a room and fill any unused corners. Donrsquot worry, it doesnrsquot mean another mouth to feed, there are plenty of really great looking fake ones to buy.Have you tried shopping from other rooms in your house  Yoursquod be surprised at how much you can change your rooms by simply swapping the accessories about.HallwayTherersquos nothing nicer than a warm welcome so donrsquot forget your hallway when yoursquore giving your home a makeover.If itrsquos on the small size then good advice is to keep it nice and bright to give the illusion of space and add colour by adding some prints to the wall, some useful hanging hooks and even a funky doormat.Everything in your hallway needs to have a practical use, but that doesnrsquot mean it has to be boring.You can add plants here too butyoursquore limited on floor space, why not try some hanging baskets or small potted plants on shelves.Maybe go the extra mile and paint the doors in your hallway  This trend is becoming more popular, with people opting for painting their doors and skirting boards, from pink to yellow and even black.Hopefully, these tips have given you some DIY inspiration to give your home a little low-cost makeover."},{"url":null,"title":"online-edinburgh-festival-12-must-see-shows-events","story":"Thats exactly what has happened.You cant generally hit pause and play at the same time, but the Edinburgh Festival has managed it for its  iteration, with a rich, brave and pioneering programme of mostly digital and online events with here and there a visual treat for capital residents and those tourists who have decided to come anyway.The theatres may be dark but, as the programme makes clear, the artistic light burns bright regardless.My Light Shines On DisplayAs well as being the umbrella title for much of the digital offering from this yearrsquos Edinburgh International Festivalndash Kirsty Wark fronts the programme, which features a performance by Scottish Chamber Orchestra cellist Su-a Lee ndash My Light Shines On is also a light display project which will illuminate the cityrsquos famous festival venues.Using beacons of light which will be visible from vantage points across the capital it has been created by Scottish lighting designers Kate Bonney and Simon Hayes, the duo behind Pitlochryrsquos Enchanted Forest and the Electric Glen in East Renfreshire.The inspiration is the tradition of the so-called lsquoghost lightrsquo in which a light is left on in a theatre even when the venue is lsquodarkrsquo, as all theatres currently are.

Get used to longevity. To paraphrase Doris Day, its earlier than you think.Futurologists Andrew Scott and Lynda Gratton say society must abandon the out-dated ldquothree stage, -year le and start thinking about the ldquo-year career and the ldquomulti-stage le. You are going to have to change jobs several times in those six decades and retrain just to remain economically viable.Indeed, le may become one le-long learning experience, possibly overseen by computers that will assess how much you are keeping up to date in your field. Learning to live will become ldquoliving to learn. We may soon be under benevolent surveillance from Big Data and AI using algorithms to test progress ndash a bit like corporate Duolingo.Age itself has to be redefined as ldquomalleable, not fixed in a straight line from cradle to grave. Just look at the Rolling Stones, they say, as perky and productive in their seventies as they were half a century ago.Well, up to a point. There are constituencies in Glasgow where many men dont live long enough to collect their state pensions, let alone to the age of . They might not be so sanguine at the prospect of abolishing the retirement age, which is the main recommendation of this book.But Scott and Gratton are right to identy the absurdity of assuming that people cease to be productive by . This numerical determinism is past its sell-by date.In Japan, which is further down the geriatric road than most countries, theyre already on to this. There,  per cent of over-s are still working in the UK fewer than  per cent do. The Japanese working age population has fallen by five million since , because of a declining birth rate. However, actual employment has risen in the same period by .m as more older people remain in work.But arent ldquoyoung people just smarter as Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg put it in an unguarded remark quoted here  Andrew Scott and Lynda Gratton are on a crusade to abolish this kind of casual ageism. A third of workers aged between  and , they claim, experience it.In fact, people are just as intelligent at  as they were at  ndash they just arent so impulsive, according to the authors. They may not be quite so quick off the mark, but they get things done and make fewer mistakes.Society needs to stop seeing old people as a burden and start seeing them as an underused economic resource. Enlisting retirees into the workforce could boost economic productivity and growth by almost as much as when women entered the workforce in the latter half of the th century.Scott and Gratton are particularly hostile to the oft-quoted ldquodependency ratio ndash the number of people over  ided by the number of people of ldquoworking age. Globally, this is currently around . and is expected to reach . by .In the EU the number of people in what is traditionally called the ldquoworking age category , is expected to fall by  per cent in the next  years. In Japan, the oldest country in the world, it will reach ., meaning one worker for every retired person.This dependency ratio is often referred to as a ldquotime bomb, with the implication being that having a lot of old people around is unaffordable. Scott and Gratton argue that this is as economically illiterate as it is offensive to seniors. People aged  may have  productive years ahead of them, according to the authors.Indeed, some people will have to get used to working until their late seventies and eighties. Unless you are in the public sector you wont be able to save enough during the conventional working le to sustain a decent living standard into great age. Yet, politicians and most corporations still think in terms of retirement at . ldquoThis has to change, and change fast, the authors say. Companies will have to stop thinking about career ladders and start thinking about ldquohorizontal careers with ldquomultiple points of entry as people move between occupations over this extended working le.Scott and Gratton are certainly right to regard older people as productive. However, this rather ignores the digital elephant in the room: technological redundancy. Large numbers of unskilled jobs, and many skilled ones, are likely to disappear in the next half century through automation and articial intelligence.Before the pandemic, the Office for National Statistics estimated that . million jobs are in immediate risk in the UK alone. Many more will have been added to that inventory since lockdown. The big winners have been online retailers like Amazon, which increasingly employ robots.Is there going to be enough work in future for young people let alone the active old  Scott and Gratton skirt round this by insisting that productivity iniably creates more jobs than it destroys. That is true in the broad sweep of history, but it sometimes takes a while for this goldilocks outcome to be realised.Then there is over-qualication. Le-long learning is a fine objective, but half the population already enters higher education. More than half of UK university graduates are in jobs which dont require a degree.You could spend your entire le acquiring degrees and incurring debt without ever actually reaching your intended station in le. Many young people already feel they have had their future stolen from them. They may resent increased competition from smart seniors leaping the career ladder.Millennials talk dismissively of ldquogammons and ldquoBoomers, blaming them for high property prices and pensions young people can only dream of. Scott and Gratton think they will just have to accept it, just as they accept equality for women and ethnic minorities.The authors are both professors at the London Business School and largely addressing an elite audience. You imagine global knowledge workers reading this while sipping their skinny lattes on the way to power-point presentations. A good half of this book reads like a self-help manual for middle managers.One of the problems with le-coach literature is a tendency to coin pretentious ways to state the obvious. We need to turn ldquorecreation into re-creation ldquobuild stackable and portable credentials keep ldquostepping beyond the veil of ignorance to see our ldquopossible selves\".

Everyone wins. And all shall have prizes.:IndyRef: New poll shows % would back independence as SNP set for record Holyrood majorityMind you, I dont think Mr Swinney will be interfering in many future examinations. I cant think of any ministerial U-turn that has been quite as humiliating as this one. Not least because Mr Swinney spent half of his statement defending the very moderation system that he had just discarded.No serious government can conduct its business in this way. Mr Swinney gave no principled explanation of why he was abandoning the work of the supposedly independent SQA ndash other than that a number young people felt that the system was unjust. That is undeniably true and we all felt for them.But this capitulation leaves the SQA in an impossible position, and brings the whole examination process into question. Indeed, I dont see how the SQA can continue in its present form. Certainly, it cannot conduct its normal moderation of exam results with any confidence in future years.And nor can Mr Swinney. He must surely go now, after this fiasco, and without delay. Someone must come in to restore respect for the standards in Scottish education and serve the last rites on the Qualications Authority.Indeed, standardised assessment through competitive examinations looks to have had its day. As Mr Swinney hinted, it has become increasingly unpopular in recent years. Though every country including Finland, the leading edge of pedagogical progressivism, uses objective testing.But after this fiasco, examinations like the Highers will surely lose their unique status and will likely be supplanted by teacher estimates of ability which, according to Mr Swinney, is the most reliable way to gauge academic achievement. This, even though he himself concedes that in the past teacher assessment has been no reliable guide to exam performance.The impact on grade inflation will be as the First Minister herself forecast last week ldquoincredible. A % increase in Highers grades means that this years students will forever be marked out as the year when exam credibility went out the window.Whoever called the process by which the Scottish Qualication Authority adjusts exam scores to reflect past school performance ldquomoderation had a dry sense of humour. It has caused fury amongst teachers, pupils, parents.The anger shows no sign of moderating even after Swinneys desperate attempt to put a lid on the worst exam crisis in  years. This was a statement that was as humiliating as it was self-contradictory.:UK falls into recession after lockdown sees record contractionHe began by explaining atwhy the moderation applied by the SQA did not disproportionately downgrade students from deprived areas, as has been widely claimed. This is because the grade inflation, against historic standards, was higher in schools in these areas, at %, than in schools in more prosperous areas, which inflated by only around %. Greater moderation was therefore applied out of fairness, not classism.He then commended the SQAs ldquoopen and transparent adjustment methodology and insisted that it was ldquoin use throughout the UK and across the world\". But, er, not in Scotland any more. Mr Swinney then let the algorithmic cat out of the bag by pointing out that exam moderation happens every year to some extent as the SQA, and its English equivalent Ofqual, manipulate grade boundaries. But not presumably in future.He even announced, solemnly, that the remit of the SQAwas to ensure that every student got ldquothe qualications they deserved. The teacher estimates: ldquo awarded without moderation, he said ldquo would have led to an increase in pass rates without precedent.Sothe methodology was so fair and robust, why was he over-ruling the independent SQA and allowing this unprecedented grade inflation to take place  Well, Mr Swinney had spoken to young people who felt ldquotheir future was being determined by statistical modelling. The credibility of exam grades was of secondary importance to ldquothe risk that people would lose faith in the system. Well, they certainly will now.But does anyone seriously think that the SQA actually marked down working class students because they were living in a deprived postcode  Of course not. The SQA anyway subjected its moderation regime to an Equalities Impact Assessment ndash as it is obliged to do ndash before it published them.Moderation by algorithm is a pretty blunt instrument and doesnt take account of inidual performance. But, as Mr Swinney says, it is very widely used. Capitulating to grade inflation of up to % may win political points in the short term, but it will store up big problems for the future.:John Swinneys SQA U-Turn: Seven things you need to knowEvery year, grade boundaries move up and down to ensure fairness and comparable outcomes. Tens of thousands of pupils have their exam results routinely moderated. The English equivalent of the SQA, Ofqual, uses a very similar ldquostandardisation model against which to correct scores which depart from the historical average.Englands pandemic moderation is, according to reports, even greater than ours ndash % of grades have been adjusted downwards from the estimates provided by teachers, against % in Scotland. We wont know the final figures until tomorrowwhen the English A level results are unveiled. But, strangely, there has not been anything like the controversy over moderation that we have seen here.The inconvenient truth is that the Scottish ldquopandemic cohort, as they are already being dubbed, has exchanged one unfairness for another. They may have got the grades they and their teachers wanted, but those grades will forever be tainted by the chaotic and unprincipled way in which they were awarded.

While the Scottish Government, which is ultimately responsible for safeguarding public health, has a major role to play, I believe businesses are better placed to make things happen and to do so far more quickly.The best way forward should involve a new approach with business taking the lead to implement greater safety measures with the support of government and other public sector bodies.This will start with business owners and managers stepping up and being more proactive in ensuring they operate within a safer framework to stop the spread of this virus. As well as providing a clean and safe environment for their customers at all times, they will also need to consider implementing other creative measures and better utilising existing technology.We are already seeing a number of examples of this across the globe where businesses are driving forward on-the-ground initiatives to reduce the risk of a further lockdown. Restaurants in Kinsale, in County Cork, Ireland have, for example, begun testing the temperatures of all their customers upon entry. Meanwhile Tourism Portugal has introduced ldquoSafe  Clean certication which enables participating hotels to provide the reassurance they have undertaken the appropriate level of disinfecting and have made hand sanitiser available to guests throughout their stay. Even McDonaldrsquos has gone beyond government guidelines by making the wearing of masks mandatory for all customers entering any of their , US restaurants.While businesses in Aberdeen and throughout Scotland should be taking the lead in bringing new and effective measures to fruition, the support of the Scottish Government will be essential as well as beneficial. Agencies including Scottish Enterprise, where we have made initial representations on this issue, could provide grants and other support measures. This could help many hard-pressed businesses put temperature monitoring devices for both staff and customers as well as other facilities in place at a time when the strain on their finances may otherwise prevent such expenditure. This would put even more pressure on the public purse, but it would be a sensible investmentit prevents the economic carnage that comes from further lockdowns.Nicola Sturgeonrsquos leadership has been solid throughout much of this pandemic.

Four thousand years ago, the Babylonians used crushed leeks in lamb stews, as some do today. And thousands of years later, a th century Scots gardener had his wages stopped because he had failed to produce enough for the royal household.But despite such royal favour, leeks were usually considered poor manrsquos fare and gradually dwindled in popularity.Even though more acceptable in the th and th centuries, leeks remained pretty lowly vegetables. The  Suttons catalogue listed  ieties of peas and an astonishing  broccoli, but only  dferent leeks featured: London Flag and Musselburgh.These ieties, first developed in France, were quite dferent to earlier, smaller forms that were similar to our spring onions. Our large, broad leaved leeks are very probably much milder than their forebears.This strong taste must have tainted the breath as garlic does, so may explain why people in the th and th centuries shunned them. But, given the foul odours emanating from every mouth, why would an extra ingredient make any dference  Why not just add to the mix Whatever the state of our breath, many of us want milder, sweeter leeks. Some go to ludicrous levels. They spend every waking moment cultivating utterly tasteless exhibition forms, designed to win fame and silverware at local or even national flower shows.Most of us have a bit more wit, looking for decent-sized, but still recognisably tasty leeks, and this isnrsquot too dficult. Plant size depends on fertility, moisture and spacing. Simple planting methods provide some blanching.Leeks grow under almost any conditions, but do best in moist, weed-free ground. I also give a m bed two barrowloads of good compost. When planting, I use a dibber ndash the sawn-off top of an old spade handle ndash to make a cm deep hole for each leek. I plant -cm apart and fill each hole with water to settle in the cm tall seedlings.Closer planting leads to small specimens and much more prep. work in the kitchen. Like everyone, I grow more leeks from seed than I need. So I line out and close plant the leftovers to make brilliant baby leeks ndash the gourmetrsquos delight.And lersquos too short for excessive blanching: Irsquove never heard of a method that doesnrsquot drive a gardener to an early grave. My fat green leeks would never grace a show bench, but they pass the taste test.For very long white supermarket-style spears, you need to plant in a cm deep trench, filling as plants grow or space rows widely enough to laboriously earth up as yoursquod do with potatoes. And after all that, yoursquod need to remove the gritty soil between leaves before cooking.How hardy are leeks  Summer and autumn harvesting ieties come nice and early and are rarely robust enough to withstand frequent frosts. Tough old Musselburgh, thatrsquos been around for nearly a couple of centuries will take most winters in its stride.Look at the colour of your leeks to see whether they should be finished before the worst of the weather or sit happily till spring. A Belgian study showed that the darker, the bluer, the leaf the hardier it is. Pale green leaved leeks gently collapse and rot in frost.The dark ones contain more chlorophyl and a wax covering than paler shaded ones. They also have a higher sugar content, glucose, fructose and disaccharides, and this gives the sap greater frost protection.Plant of the weekHelenium lsquoButterpatrsquo has rich yellow flowers that add sunshine to your borders when skies are grey.

We await the Governmentrsquos response. This week Labour also called for the licensing of grouse shooting after a big increase in the illegal killing of birds during the lockdown.But in Scotland, Irsquom afraid, the signs of progress are not good. For a start, the Werritty report was based on the flawed premise that driven grouse shooting can be made acceptable. Werritty was explicitly looking for ways in which grouse moors could continue to be a part of the economy instead of questioning whether Scotlandrsquos countryside should tolerate a business that harms the countryside ndash through the burning of heather, for example.The reportrsquos conclusion on licensing also ended up being rather limp because the group that led the report was ided, which meant the compromise of suggesting a licensing systemthere is no improvement in bird of prey populations. Which gives the Scottish Government a get-out: wersquore waiting, theyrsquoll say, to seetherersquos been an improvement hellip still waiting hellip still waiting. The Government has also shown a lack of urgency in responding to Werritty. It does not look good.There are also serious question marks over whether licensing will work. First off, the people who are illegally killing birds of prey are unlikely to be deterred by a licensing systemtheyrsquore not deterred by the law as it stands Scotland for more than  years.Therersquos also a danger thatan ineffective licensing system will be introduced and then everything will just carry on as normal. I spoke to the conservationist Mark Avery about this recently and his view was that the whole idea of licensing depended on how robust the system was a weak one would pretty much allow the wildle criminals to carry on regardless.Some people in the shooting community feel theyrsquore being unfairly singled out over this. I remember speaking to one guy who runs a training school for gundogs who said he was frustrated that certain ways of killing animals ndash fishing for example ndash were seen as socially acceptable whereas shooting had a stigma attached to it. A farrier also told me that at least shooting enthusiasts are being honest about killing animals ndash townies on the other hand will happily tuck into burgers and fish and chips and yet judge people for shooting birds or deer.In some ways, I can see where the country sports enthusiasts are coming from on that one ndash for most of us, grouse shooting is a weird and distant practice and maybe that makes it easier to support moves to control it. But fishing doesnrsquot involve killing every other species in the water, whereas the ideal grouse moor from the point of view of landowners and gamekeepers is one thatrsquos devoid of any predator, which leads to predator control on a mass scale ndash legal and illegal.That is the key to the problem: a model that is effectively based on the killing of birds of prey. Perhaps licensing can do something to improve it. I hope so. Perhaps the Government will support licensing. I hope for that too. But it may be that it all rests on a simple question. Mark Thomas of the RSPB said this week that most of the bird of prey deaths theyrsquod seen during lockdown were linked in some way to shooting.

This is not true but we are currently experiencing a constant bombardment of the SNPs mantra with little air-time given to the opposition viewpoint.We are in danger of losing our way and having independence foisted upon us with all the rather unpleasant consequences that the SNP, with Green support, are happy to sweep under the carpet. Independence must be demonstrably earned over a long time period, with most of the problems ironed out by a competent government and with the support of the vast majority of Scots and not simply rushed whilst a few polls appear favourable.Keeping Mr Swinney in office is a bad start.Dr Gerald Edwards, Glasgow.I MAKE no comment on the suitability of the current Education Secretary as it is blindingly obvious he has neither the competence nor the stature to hold this or any other post in government.That he is probably no worse than the majority of other ministers, especially health, says all there needs to be said about this administration ... I except the First Minister purely on her personality and presentation skills.However my anger at the moment is reserved fully for the Greens, whose votes kept Mr Swinney in situ by voting against the no confidence motion earlier today.The Greens do the whole country, especially our young people, a disservice and one would hope that come the election voters will demonstrate their contempt for a party that is currently a disgrace to politics.James Martin, Bearsden.I FOUND Andy Maciverrsquos latest articlesomewhat adversely affected by non sequitur. Early in the piece he writes \"I have found the SNP in government to be reliable and competent\" and he embellishes that by adding it has \"managed the country perfectly well\". Reading that, I wondered what parallel universe I have been living in since .Later in the same article, he touches upon the SNP Governmentrsquos record and mentions only a few areas where it has fallen short and concedes that \"we are not the envy of the world\". One could fairly regard that conclusion as putting it mildly. In one of her responses to Ruth Davidson at Holyrood this week Nicola Sturgeon said that the SNP record would be on the line next May. It is dficult to argue against that. Yes, let the people decide.Ian W Thomson, Lenzie.ITS just so dficult to draw a metaphorical bead on Andy Maciver when hes in discursive mood on Scotlands ills.First, he draws a negative picture of Scotlands schools which I as a parent and grandparent simply do not recognise. Secondly, he produces a set of statistics which accurately show how far the UKs NHS is falling behind its OECD equivalents, and somehow implies that the Scottish Government is equally responsible for that. But then, just when I think I can pull the trigger, he comes up with this gem: \"So herersquos one idea. The Scottish Government should create a small National Renewal Unit. Give them a big travel budget. And let them bring back the best of the rest of the world to prepare us for a post-coronavirus future.\"Correct, Mr Maciver. Lets do that, lets call it the Scottish Governments Diplomatic Service and let it operate from embassies in the worldrsquos major capitals. Is Mr Maciver beginning to change his erstwhile opinions on independence John Jamieson, Ayr.THE Prime Minister is about to take his ldquowell-earned holiday in Scotland. This despite the pandemic still raging and the country in the worst financial collapse ever known.I would not, however, expect to see him buying a fridge magnet in Burntisland High Street or hear of him hiring a bike in Millport. I may be mistaken, but I would assume his destination will be considerably less public.So can we analyse what we will be missing when he has his two weeks ldquoabroad in Scotland First, the daily photoshoot featuring the hard hat will be off the agenda.Secondly, the withering, dithering, flamboyant speeches will be put on hold.Thirdly, the dynamic decision-making, which can do a -degree turn in a day, will be suspended or maybe not or maybe could be.So how will we cope with such a loss  In Scotland we will be left to the mercy of the First Minister who is so ldquoincompetent she says she doesnrsquot see herself having a holiday.Instead of a holiday she will be forced to continue to manage the pandemic as best she can as well as the hundreds of other problems associated with governing the people of Scotland.George Kay, Burntisland.DESPITE the exam grades fiasco and the Scottish Governmentrsquos disastrous handling of the Covid crisis, Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP are riding high in the opinion polls. Why is this, I ask  The answer is that we have all been deeply brainwashed by Ms Sturgeon and her daily TV broadcasts, lasting more than four months now. Please would someone call Amnesty International Ian Forbes, Glasgow G.THERE is an interesting contrast in apparent attitudes to taking responsibility between Fiona Robertson, Head of SQA and Leslie Evans, boss of our civil service. Ms Robertson has been willing to take the  on her own to defend her agencys position that, unmoderated, this years results would have been unfeasibly higher than the previous years: an attitude for which she courageously offered no apology . Her problem may well be that the model employed was crude in terms of statistical theory and practice, as one of your recent correspondents has helpfully pointed out, but that doesnt take away from the principle thatthe numberslook wrong, they probably are. Criticism of her and her staff should be balanced by that and by recognition that this was never going to be an easy job.Leslie Evans , in contrast, seems to be doing everything possible to avoid recognising that a hash was made of a relatively straightforward disciplinary process, which likely was or should have been set down in the Scottish Governments code of working practices . All this to the extent that anyone with any knowledge of the judicial review process would have backed Alex Salmond for a winner. The inquiry chairman is to be congratulated for demanding clear and personal answers from Ms Evans.Brian Chrystal, Edinburgh EH.JUST who is the Scottish Government  Your reportage of the Holyrood inquiry into the Alex Salmond debacle continually links ldquothe Scottish Government with behaviour likely to obstruct the investigators getting access to facts related to the original botched probe into the alleged behaviour of the former First Minister. However, the name that persistently crops up is that of a civil servant rather than one of a minister or elected or list MSP.I would have thought that a civil servant, as the name implies, is neither a member of nor part of a government but an inidual in a supporting structure charged to carry out the instructions of the sitting executive.It is important in view of the upcoming Scottish elections that there is clarity in just who is not being completely cooperative with the current investigators is it the civil service or is it the SNP administration.David J Crawford, Glasgow G.ROSEMARY Goring says that the Prime Minister is coming to Scotland again because he wants to save the Union . But does he Consider this his parliamentary majority of  must be in danger, judging by his calamitous approval ratings, and the fact that Labour now has a credible leader.So might he not welcome the chance to lose  non-Tory seats before the next General Election, thus improving his chances of winning He may lead the Conservative and Unionist Party, but he has already jettisoned the support of the Northern Ireland Unionist faction, whence comes the \"Unionist\" part of the party name, with his border in the Irish Sea to finalise the EU withdrawal agreement. Might he find it even easier to let Scotland secede, taking its troublesome non-Tory MPs out of the House of Commons  The six Tories would be collateral damage but a price worth paying.Also, by dint of the border and the dependence of the vast majority of Scottish exports upon English ports, he could still keep Scotland on a tight rein.In the meantime we face the prospect of a disrupted food supply due to the forthcoming Brexit shambles. Could that be why the Prime Minister is suddenly keen on fighting obesity, in the hope that we will accept the resulting shortages, perhaps even rationing, as all part of a national weight-loss strategy It could be that there is method in the Prime Ministers madness after all.Jane Ann Liston, St Andrews.Read more: Swinney survives no confidence vote"},{"url":null,"title":"herald-diary-back-school-giggles","story":"WITH youngsters back behind their desks and le settling into the unormity of the school unorm, wersquore recalling classic tales involving kids of all ages .

And lockdown has exacerbated the pressures and the isolation, by putting deadlines back and inhibiting lab work. Sometimes you start the day, and you feel like yoursquove got no direction or sense of urgency, because yoursquore missing some of the lab work and data.For me, personally, my slump resulted in changes in mood and behaviour. I was sleeping more, eating junk food and moving very little. All of this added to the feelings of worthlessness that were rising within me because, especially in lockdown, there really wasnrsquot anyone to bounce ideas off and share experiences with.Since labs started to re-open, I have found that some of the social aspects of PhD study are starting to come back into my le, and commuting to and from the lab by bike has boosted my mood because itrsquos got me moving again.But research was lonely before lockdown.

Keep your wall colours neutral, like white and grey, but use your curtains, bedding and cushions to inject splashes of colour.Buying new bedding and hanging a new set of curtains can cost a lot less than a few tins of paint once you factor in all the rollers and brushes yoursquoll need to buy, plus it will take less time too.Once yoursquove bought the cushions, next time yoursquore thinking about changing the colour, just buy new covers and match the size of the cushions. That means you can store the others away, pass them on to a friend or use them in another room.Donrsquot forget about artwork. You can find some really trendy prints online and IKEA is great for cheap frames too. Make sure you buy the same size prints each time, meaning you can keep the same frames. You can update the frames easily too with a cheap can of spray paint.Canrsquot afford a new carpet  Yoursquoll be amazed at what a good deep clean and adding a colourful or patterned rug can do.If your furniture is looking a bit tired, upcycle with a lick of paint and new door handles. You can pick up a tin of furniture paint from most hardware stores or online and you can buy cute, quirky doorknobs from eBay or Etsy, or even just try spray painting the existing ones.Metal accessories like curtain rods and light fittings can benefit from that spray paint too!Upcycling is a great way to keep costs low, give a much loved item a new lease of le and is good for the environment by cutting out waste.Living roomMoving on to the most used room in the house, this can be the most dficult to update as it no doubt has many uses. From the TV room to the playroom to the dining room, your living space probably needs to be more practical than anything . But you can still add some style along the way.Your sofa likely dominates the room and can be the most expensive piece in the room ndash with the exception of the TV! So replacing this often can be costly. But have you considered replacing the covers  If your sofa is in generally good condition but itrsquos looking a bit off-colour, you can buy covers that fit over the top.IKEA do a range of these covers that are made for their sofa ranges, but you can find places online that offer made to measure services. This can be more expensive, but definitely cheaper than buying a whole new sofa and are machine washable! Alternatively, adding a new throw and some scatter cushions can have the same effect.Many of the tips for the bedroom can be used in the living room too. Like adding a nice feature wall for a splash of colour or why not try adding a nice gallery wall with lots of family pictures  A great way to add a personal touch to a room. You can even get the family involved to pick out their favourite pictures.Plants are a great way to brighten up a room and fill any unused corners.

He theorised that food production could not keep up with human population growth, leading to starvation, war, disease and general catastrophe.In fact, wersquore nowhere near filling the planet with people: put together in a huddle, every person on Earth would actually fit on Islay, with room to spare. Nevertheless, the global population continues to rise, compounding the environmental problems humanity currently faces.This population growth is one of the areas that will be highlighted in Earth Overshoot Day , which this year takes place on August . It marks the moment in the annual calendar when humanityrsquos demand for ecological resources and services starts to exceed what nature can regenerate.The EOD organisers stress one simple truth ndash that the more of us there are on the planet, the less of it there is for each of us. Every person has to be supported in areas such as food provision, healthcare, social ing and waste management, many of which challenge and compromise the environment.The statistics are sobering. If every second family had on average one fewer child, then the projected world population of . billion by  would fall by a billion. By the end of the century, that drop would be four billion.Importantly, that reduction would move Earth Overshoot Day back by a month by .It would mean  per cent more biocapacity per person by the year  ndash a hugely signicant and positive change.Providing high quality education for women also helps to tackle population growth and the accompanying strain on resources. Statistics produced by the World Bank show that the dference in family size between women with no schooling and those with  years of school learning is four to five children per person.Those with the benefit of full education marry later, have smaller and healthier families, and invest in their children. It is clear that female learning generates social change, takes pressure off the planetrsquos resources and acts as a major driver of womenrsquos empowerment.The stark disparity in population growth between developed countries and less developed ones can be seen by comparing Scotland to other poorer nations.In this country, the total population in  was calculated at . million. According to the National Records of Scotland, this is set to rise only slightly to . million by  and then level off.By comparison, Nigeria ndash the most heavily populated country in Africa ndash is predicted to be set to grow from its current  million to  million by  and more than  million by the turn of the century.By lowering the number of people on the planet, we ease the pressure on resources. And as we consume, so we also discard. The levels of waste we generate are frighteningndash and growing.At present, the average person in the United States throws away their body weight in rubbish every month. Population increase means waste has increased tenfold over the last century, and it is now expected to double again by .Recycling and composting are having an impact, but they are not holding back the tide. Urban areas, which now house half the worldrsquos population, are the worst affected, but we are now seeing waste plastic in almost all of our oceans and rivers.How can this problem be mitigated, particularly as societies become wealthier, creating yet more packaging and a throwaway culture  Industrial processes can be improved there can be a greater drive towards re-use and recycling rubbish charges have been seen to have an effect.MADE TO LASTHere at home, there is a drive towards creating a circular economy, a model that aims to eliminate waste and resource over-use by encouraging an extension of the le cycle of products and equipment through initiatives such as sharing, refurbishment and remanufacturing.The Scottish Government published its own vision for this, titled Making Things Last, in , and Zero Waste Scotland took this further through its own study in June.This identies a number of key principles including being led by the available evidence achieving absolute emissions reductions prioritising reduction of emissions over offsetting going beyond net zero and sharing successes and failures to help drive change.Louise McGregor, Head of Circular Economy at the organisation, said this circular model provided a tool not just to dispose of waste in an eco-friendly way, but to reduce it in the first place.ldquoThatrsquos much more effective than waiting for the waste to be generated and then recycling it. Most of the carbon is associated with the production of the products rather than getting rid of it at the end of its le.She described the circular economy as a ldquosystems level approach, explaining: ldquoIf you take something like food waste, then we can do quite a lot to collect that and reprocess it, and of course thatrsquos all beneficial.ldquoBut with a circular economy, you think about things from the start ndash how it is produced in the first place and what you can do at each stage so that waste isnrsquot there to start with. Historically, wersquove not been very good at doing that.Another problem, she says, is that we have developed a throwaway culture. ldquoItrsquos often cheaper to buy something new than to repair a product. One way of incentivising a new approach is to use economic levers. We need to ask how we can use the tax system to make it more cost effective to do the right thing.The countryrsquos farmers, too, are in the front line of the battle against climate change. A report commissioned by WWF Scotland earlier this year raised the prospect of mitigation measures that involve little or no change of land use.Suggested steps included improvements to animal health and breeding, feed additives, use of nitrogen fertilisers, rotational grazing and using plants such as clovers to fix nitrogen levels.Dr Sheila George, the organisationrsquos Food and Environment Policy Manager, said: ldquoAgriculture is at risk from a changing climate but can be part of the climate solution.ldquoOur land is our biggest natural defence against climate change and farmers and other land managers have a key role in protecting it. We need to produce food in a way that reduces emissions and locks up more carbon. ldquoShe added: ldquoBy adapting our farming methods, Scotland could be at the forefront of the global transition to climate-friendly farming with unique export and branding opportunities arising.lsquoldquoTo get there, we need to see a reframing of rural policy andfinancial support along withadvice and training available for land managers."},{"url":null,"title":"opinion-kevin-mckenna-dont-let-hubris-derail-independence-dream","story":"This hasnrsquot stopped a familiar assortment of SNP loyalists from proclaiming the polling results as a decisive, popular endorsement of their partyrsquos policies. They have greeted the YouGov poll indicating % support for Scottish independence with hubristic glee.The English examination results ndash afflicted by the social inequality which disfigured Scotlandrsquos ndash were greeted with a similar sense of conceit. ldquoSee: theirs were worse than ours. For a party committed to reducing educational inequality it doesnrsquot quite butter the parsnips. Such a response ignores the real source of anger at the moderation of Scottish pupilsrsquo examination predictions: that the inequalities and disadvantages spewed out by the process merely highlighted those which lie embedded in the educational system after  years of devolved government. Coronavirus merely exposed what has lain submerged for generations. It would be foolish to regard the sunny numbers in favour of independence as indicating popular absolution.The SNP ndash and by extension the cause of independence ndash have enjoyed a rewarding lockdown. Those residing outside the Holyrood bubble consume their politics via the early evening television and radio news programmes. For the last five months we have clung to these bulletins as theyrsquove updated us on the shting levels of threat to our mortal existence. They have been dominated by two people: the First Minister of Scotland and the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. Scotlandrsquos champion is universally seen to be confident, honest and empathetic the other chap: well ndash letrsquos be charitable here ndash signicantly less so.This is an important ergence at any time, but during a period of national emergency it becomes critical. When your le is in danger you attach less importance to more mundane matters such as education and the handling of the economy. In time, though, these will cease to be mundane and we will resume our close scrutiny of them.The state of emergency has also revealed how enfeebled the opposition to Ms Sturgeon and her administration has become. The Scottish Tories have been forced to jettison one leader and are currently being led by a part-timer who sees her future beyond the reach of democracy in an upper-class, private drinking club.The Labour Party in Scotland meanwhile is led by a poor chap who looks like he is about to cry every time he takes to his feet. Their support has been reduced to those who plough on for old timersquos sake. Between coronavirus and Europersquos most ineffective political opposition the SNP are governing Scotland free of scrutiny. In such circumstances % support for independence is the very least you should be expecting. Such circumstances wonrsquot prevail when a live referendum is unfolding. And Irsquom not convinced the party is anywhere near fit enough to fight one any time soon.On the three most pressing matters which will come to govern a second referendum the SNP donrsquot appear to have made any progress in the six years that have elapsed since the last one. There is no plan for joining the EU and no acknowledgement that such a process could take anything from two to five years. There is still no position on what currency an independent Scotland would use and no workings for settling the border issue with England. Indeed, the only body making the running on what an independent Scotland could look like ndash socially, culturally and economically ndash is Common Weal, the independence-leaning think-tank and advocacy body. But according to Stewart McDonald, the SNPrsquos spokesperson for defence at Westminster, Common Weal are to be regarded with disdain.In a bizarre tweet about the current upheaval in Belarus, Mr McDonald, who strives eagerly to be part of the SNPrsquos inner sanctum, said: ldquoIncredible events unfolding in Belarus: an uprising on the European continent, against an authoritarian Soviet dictator, led by women of courage and substance with their fellow citizens at their back. Common Weal types oddly mute. Quite what Common Weal was supposed to have said about a country . miles away is anyonersquos guess. Perhaps theyrsquoll issue a paper on it. Though Irsquom not sure that ponticating on another countryrsquos internal disputes is a good look for an organisation that resents interference in Scotlandrsquos own affairs.Another emerging problem for the SNP is the calibre of those in its Twitter wing who this week breathlessly announced their intentions to seek the partyrsquos nomination for Holyrood. That none have yet passed party vetting or consulted with local organisations has not dimmed their optimism, which seems to be founded purely on nods and winks at SNP headquarters. You donrsquot want to be unkind here, but each of them would melt in the heat of a y referendum campaign.They are also known among activists to have participated in the stitch-up preventing Joanna Cherry and her Westminster colleagues from ing to Holyrood. This has also caused deep resentment among ldquoCommon Weal types who will do most of the heavy lting at the next referendum. There remains simmering resentment in the party at the juvenile delinquency of the NEC in this matter and this has resulted in the threat of cancelled memberships and reduced subscriptions.This is unfortunate for a party which is currently encountering choppy financial waters and continues to face questions over the pound, in donations it received in  to fight the referendum that never was. Irsquom sure everything is above board here and that the details will be forthcoming in due course. For, how could you hope to fight another referendum any time soonall that money had been spent on something   And how could you expect any of your members to dig deep again in the absence of any receipts The absence of anything resembling an independence Plan B has irked many supporters who have begun to question the SNP leadershiprsquos authentic commitment to the project.

Our role is to amply the amazing work already being done across the world to transform the economy. This is not a step into the unknown we know the sort of changes we need to make.With the rest of her time Dr Trebeck, who has more than eight years of experience as a researcher and policy wonk with Oxfam GB, supports WEAll Scotland, just one of several geographic hubs.ldquoThese hubs are local manestations of the global effort. Other hubs are bubbling up, including WEAll Canada ndash thatrsquos particularly nice as they get to call themselves lsquoWe All Canrsquo.This global approach allows WEAll members to operate collaboratively across many dferent sectors ndash not in silos but working together to try to transform the economic system.ldquoThe wellbeing economy is an agenda that, at its most basic, is about pursuing social justice on a healthy planet, says Dr Trebeck. ldquoIt comes from a recognition that,we donrsquot transform how the economy operates ndash who wins, who loses out of the economic system, how we price things, what we incentivise, how businesses operate, how we build our infrastructure ndash we wonrsquot have a chance of delivering that goal: social justice on a healthy planet.For Dr Trebeck, who has a PhD in Political Science and is Senior Visiting Researcher University of Strathclyde and a Distinguished Fellow of the Schumacher Institute, WEAll is about working with a wide range of partners, friends and allies to think about what can be done, what needs to be done more and what constitutes good practice.ldquoItrsquos about how can we learn from that, she says. ldquoItrsquos about taking a good, hard look at the purpose of the economic system. What are the goals we set ourselves  How do we judge the economy  What are our measures of progress Against a backdrop that has seen UK GDP shrink a record . per cent in the second quarter and plunge the country into its largest recession on record, she points out a wellbeing economy will only ever have been achievedwe have delivered environmental sustainability, addressed climate breakdown and regenerated our environment.She says itrsquos not viable to carry on with how things have been done in the past, adding: ldquoThat was already taking us into some catastrophic terrain and wersquore already seeing the impacts. As an Australian, Irsquom still heartbroken from watching my country burning up last summer. Carrying on with business as usual is not okay.At the heart of the wellbeing economy are issues of environmental protection and social justice and Dr Trebeck feels much of our environmental breakdown has social injustice at its root cause: with huge levels of inequality driving huge amounts of consumption and hence emissions, especially by the very wealthy.ldquoTherersquos been a lot of work been done to demonstrate these links and also how inequality undermines political mobilisation on these issues. So we see itrsquos those countries that are less unequal that are more likely to be more proactive on addressing environmental issues.ldquoThe environmental crisis is a social justice issue and the two of those are bound up in how we design our economics. If we transform the economy towards a wellbeing economy, this will help us deliver on the social justice side of things and on the environment.Dr Trebeck believes therersquos a lot the world can learn from Scotland. ldquoThe global movement has its eyes on whatrsquos happening here and people have taken notice of our agenda. Theyrsquore looking to Scotland for leadership on these issues and are excited by some of the flagship statements and policies but also now saying: lsquoOkay, letrsquos see this add up to something powerful. Letrsquos see those tentative steps become something really concrete.rsquoldquoI think Scotland also needs to learn from whatrsquos going on around the world, so therersquos movement in both directions and collaboration in terms of learning, inspiration and hope.ldquoItrsquos important that Scotland has shown leadership in reaching out and learning from friends around the world rather than competing and seeing the whole world as a sort of zero-sum game.Dr Trebeck points to the fact Scotland is the instigator and holder of the secretariat for the Wellbeing Economy Governmentspartnership ndash a partnership with New Zealand, Iceland and Wales. This was set up to enable governments to collaborate, share and learn from each other, considering collective wellbeing questions around protecting the environment and how to put this at the heart of economic policy making.It paints an optimistic and compelling picture but can it really make a dference to Earth Overshoot Day, pushing back the date when we have exhausted naturersquos budget for the year  ldquoNot yet! However I think Scotland has taken steps in the right direction. We have the seeds of the changes we need to be bringing in.ldquoBusiness has played a huge role in transformation and building a wellbeing economy. Scotland has a good track record in supporting the sort of business models most aligned with this. Things like cooperatives, community interest companies and benefit corporations are emerging in Scotland. And thatrsquos another example where wersquove taken tentative steps in the right direction. I think we just need to breathe more le into them with much more vigour, more oomph.ldquoI sometimes say to my colleagues: lsquoScotland is awake but shersquos still hiding under the coversrsquo. Thatrsquos probably a better place to be than many other countries around the world. Itrsquos certainly better than where we were but equally itrsquos not good enough compared to where we need to be.ldquoWe need to keep going with the conversation around what sort of economic growth we want rather than that carte blanche feelingwe just push down on the accelerator and get the economy going faster, this will solve all our problems.ldquoWe need to have much more of a qualitative lens around what sort of economic growth we need. What is it we want to grow specically  I thinkwersquore going to measure lsquorecoveryrsquo beyond Covid, we canrsquot measure it with old outdated instruments, like GDP measures that are misaligned with what lots of people want to see for Scotland.Such change presents challenges but Dr Trebeck has support. ldquoWhat keeps me optimistic is hanging out with some of the amazing young people in Scotland and around the world who are so passionate, so articulate and so bright. Climate breakdown is something they donrsquot question because theyrsquove grown up knowing that itrsquos a reality . . . and so theyrsquore rolling up their sleeves and being collaborative.Could it be our young people, listening to The Ampliersrsquo soundtrack, who finally persuade Scotland to get out of bed "},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/11699698.jpg?type=article-full","title":"at-glasgow-university-duty-lead-front","story":"In dferent circumstances, Glasgow would be gearing up to welcome delegates from around the world to the UNrsquos COP Conference. A signicant moment for the City and an opportunity to bring momentum to one of the most pressing challenges we face: climate change.But  had dferent ideas. In the blink of an eye, the pandemic has turned the world on its head and reminded us of how fragile society and our economy can be.While COVID- and the climate emergency are distinct crises, they resemble each other in three key respects: they are truly global problems, just like viruses, carbon emissions care little for borders both threaten to impact our poorest communities disproportionately and each demands coordinated action of a magnitude not usually seen in peacetime.This is not to say that as iniduals, we cannot do our bit. From donning our protective facemasks and observing social distancing to recycling more and leaving the car in the garage for short journeysndash all of us have a part to play and each of our choices makes a dference.Nevertheless, global challenges require a global response and it falls to governments and institutions to lead the way. While we continue to make progress in the fight against climate change ndash last year, for instance, more of the UKrsquos electricity production came from zero carbon energy sources than fossil fuels for the first time ndash Earth Overshoot Day, the moment when our demand for ecological resources exceeds what nature can regenerate this year, reminds us of the scale of the challenge that remains.At University of Glasgow we recognise that given the scientic and academic expertise at our disposal, and as a world-changing centre of educational and research excellence, we have a duty to lead from the front.That is why in  we became the first UK university to commit to fully disinvesting from fossil fuels. Why in , we signed the Sustainable Development Goals Accord, committing us, amongst other things, to combatting climate change and environmental degradation. And why last May, we became the first Scottish university to declare a climate emergency.Since then we have been developing Glasgow Green, the Universityrsquos Climate Change Strategy and Action Plan. In the final stages of production, this document commits us to the ambition of achieving carbon neutrality by .We understand that meeting this target will be challenging. It will require further concerted action across the University, buy-in from students, staff and our wider community, a review of current practices ndash including the frequency of international travel, the leveraging of assets such as the Centre for Sustainable Solutions, gold standard carbon offsetting and signicant investment in greening our estate, at a time when resources across higher education are under strain. But it is achievable. And, more importantly, it is the socially responsible thing to do.Recent times have shown all of us what rapid change feels like and, just as signicantly, the clout required to make it happen. In applying these lessons to the climate emergency, it is clear universities are among the handful of organisations with the reach, expertise and resource base to affect real and impactful change.To evidence this you only need to look at the pivotal role Scotlandrsquos universities have played in the fight against COVID-, via vaccine development, world-leading research and the deployment of staff and students to the NHS frontline. As we look to the future, we must ensure that our response to tackling the climate emergency is similarly robust and wide ranging.Working in concert with partners from industry, the third sector, local and national government, the University of Glasgow is determined to continue to play our part in tackling the environmental crisis ndash both in terms of reducing our own carbon footprint and by acting as a centre for ideas, initiatives and innovative research which will help accelerate Scotlandrsquos transition towards becoming a low-carbon economy, particularly as we build back from the pandemic.The environmental crisis remains one of the most pressing issues we face. Earth Overshoot Day is an opportunity for all of us to take stock on what we are doing, and what more might be done, to help move the date.----------------------------------------Centre shows the Universityrsquos desire to be part of the solutionBy ProfessorJaime L. Toney,Director of the Centre for Sustainable SolutionsThe University of Glasgowrsquos Centre for Sustainable Solutions was established in April  to respond to the climate crisis and enhance the growing ambition for the University and its community to be part of the solution.The centre demonstrates the University of Glasgowrsquos commitment to playing an active role in preventing Earthrsquos temperature rising above the .degC threshold defined by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.The centre also recognises the social, cultural, and geopolitical complexities related to the climate emergency. The only way to manage these challenges is for multiple sectors and disciplines to come together to reduce our reliance on carbon, support the social implications of that, and #movethedateBehaviour, choices, and systems must be addressed to enable change, innovation, and sustainability. The centre is dedicated to undertaking activities that will enable iniduals, communities and organisations to act towards a sustainable future through education, research, and partnership.In education, the centre is using the universityrsquos academic expertise to educate the next generation of climate and carbon literate students who are capable of critically engaging with climate and carbon challenges.We are creating bespoke courses that are accessible to all staff and students. We are aligning our work with wider partner initiatives, such as those of the Royal Scottish Geographical Society who have created climate solutions modules for business management, and Education Scotland who are developing primary and secondary education policy in this area.We aim to ensure a common message, language and understanding of the challenges we face and choices that will lead to solutions.The centre seeks out our vocal and engaged student community, finding ways to raise their collective voice. We are proud to support the tremendous effort of the coalition of students and societies who joined together to form the lsquoGlasgow Green New Dealrsquo and spent six months producing a strategic document on priority areas and practices of change that has fed into our University Climate Change Strategy and Action Plan.We work closely with the Glasgow University Environmental Sustainability Teamwho are a team of highly motivated and professional students employed by the university to work on improving the environmental practice of the university. The sustainability agenda is rooted within the core values of our students we recognise them as partners and essential drivers of change for an equitable, as well as sustainable future of our one planet.The Centre for Sustainable Solutions is raising the visibility of research related to environmental sustainability, climate change and the UNrsquos Sustainable Development Goals across the University of Glasgow through our website and social media to reach out and make synergistic connections with collaborators and partner organisations.The centre is partnering with Glasgow City Council and Policy Scotland this autumn to mobilise iniduals and organisations through a structured series of dialogues which will inform and encourage partnership to achieve the cityrsquos ambitious target of net zero by .Through the dialogues we will identy common issues and innovate potential solutions, paving the way for collective impact on challenges posed by climate change.This week, the Global Footprint Network, which leads the Earth Overshoot Day initiative, is focusing on changing the climate trend and #movethedate by reducing population growth through empowering women.Researchers at the University of Glasgow are committed to empowering women and girls to be equal partners through work on understanding and ending violence against women, for example in Brazil and El Salvador, work aimed at changing policies and practices that lead to gendered health inequalities, and reducing gender inequalities in the global south, including understanding trajectories of women in STEM disciplines from higher education into employment.The centre is a new venture but growing quickly in response to the urgency of the issues we face. We are motivated by the enthusiasm of partners in and beyond the University and welcome the participation of others interested in contributing to our work. We embrace the Scottish ethos focused on inclusion, where the sustainable and just transition are synonymous.We intend to find creative and explicit ways to be inclusive by drawing on the erse range of expertise across and beyond the University to ensure we address the multi-faceted and complicated challenge of sustainability that has never been more urgent than it is today.---------------------------------------Students demand action that reflects their climate fearsBy Amy McKenzie Smith, Vice President of Student Activities, University of GlasgowFor students, therersquos a real sense that universities have a duty to be leaders and drivers of change in society. If you ask a student ldquowhat do you want from your university, you will hear obvious answers such as ldquoa decent educationrsquo, ldquoa global reputationrsquo or ldquoexcellent job prospects.Yet, you would struggle to find a student who doesnrsquot also expect their institution to place strong values at the forefront of its mission students want their university to demonstrate ethical standardsthat align with their own.One of those core values for many students across the UK right now is caring about the environment and sustainability, something students want universities to take a lead in addressing.Universities have always been a melting pot of activism and Glasgow is no dferent.Over the past year alone we have seen many student campaigns these included a coalition called the lsquoGlasgow Green New Dealrsquo, which set out a -page document detailing exactly how they want their University to tackle climate change.This clearly demonstrates the studentsrsquo desire for rapid progress on this issue.Students donrsquot just expect universities to be at the helm of research but also to act on the findings of that research.Part of the thinking here is thatuniversities donrsquot operate in sustainable ways, then how can we expect industry, government and society in general to do so either.When looking back over the last year, itrsquos dficult to recall anything apart from COVID- and its massive impact on our lives.But we shouldnrsquot forget that in January, Australia was experiencing record-breaking temperatures and one of its worst ever bushfires, destroying an area the size of South Korea.We should also remember the turn of the year, which witnessed one of the biggest climate strikes to date many students in Glasgow and across the U.K. turned out to show their dismay at the lack of action by political leaders.In many ways, COVID- has heightened the discourse on climate change ndash something that is especially on our minds as we approach Earth Overshoot Day.We now have a golden opportunity to reposition and restart the lsquogreen revolutionrsquondash a small silver lining when considering the awful pandemic that has taken over the world.There are not many instances,any, in modern human history where the planet has lsquopausedrsquo now, as and when normal le resumes, many students want their institutions to do things dferently.The way we recover from COVID- is incredibly important. COP in November  could be a pivotal moment for the planet ndash and for universities, it will be a fantastic opportunity to influence public thinking, harnessing the enthusiasm of our students and staff alike.Students expect the University of Glasgow to take a leading role in COP and show it can live up to its reputation as a world-leading, world-changing University.With the worldrsquos eyes on Glasgow, students want their alma mater to put climate change at the heart of its agenda."},{"url":null,"title":"nicola-sturgeon-leads-tributes-veterans-ahead-vj-day-events","story":"Nicola Sturgeon said people should be inspired by the ldquoidealism of those who fought in the war and commit to creating a ldquobetter, fairer and more peaceful world.Saturday marks  years since Japan surrendered to the Allied forces on August  , ending hostilities.The Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall were due to take part in a private service of remembrance and thanksgiving and then lead a national two-minute silence at am in honour of those who lost their lives in the war.Read more: Bravery of Victoria Cross hero who was last man standing on battlefield remembered  years onThe Red Arrows are also due to fly over Edinburgh, Belfast, Cardf and London - the first time such a flight has taken place since the  Olympic and Paralympic Games.Scotlandrsquos Veterans Minister Graeme Dey will join a number of former and serving members of the armed forces to observe a two-minute silence on the steps of St Andrews House, the Scottish Government building in Edinburgh.Legion Scotland is holding an online service of remembrance and a concert.Ahead of the anniversary commemorations, Ms Sturgeon said: ldquoIt was on this date in  that the conflict in the Far East ended and World War Two came to a close.ldquoIn marking the th anniversary of VJ Day, we remember everyone - the soldiers and civilians on all sides - who paid the ultimate price during the conflict.ldquoWe think of those who served in the armed forces - from across Scotland, the UK, the Commonwealth and the other allied nations.ldquoWe remember the pain and suffering of those who spent years in prisoner of war camps.ldquoAnd we reflect on all those who contributed to the war effort on the home front - and the sacrices they made.ldquoTogether, they ensured the freedoms that we enjoy today.

Shadow health secretary Donald Cameron said: ldquoIt is not acceptablethat Scotlandrsquos public health experts have to practically beg the SNP to provide the necessary data.ldquoTackling this virus requires an honest, open approach.ldquoWe will only stop the spread of Covid with every expert at Scotlandrsquos disposal working together using all the available information.ldquoWe canrsquot have a situation where public health experts are forced to cobble together what they can from limited data.ldquoThis is more evidence of a troubling pattern of behaviour from the SNP on transparency. We have seen a similar approach over the SQA grade methodology, Salmond inquiry documents, and now, worst of all, vital Test and Protect information.Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf said the Government was working hard to ensure the efficiency of the Test and Protect system.He told the BBC: ldquoWhen that data is available, and available in a form that can be veried, then of course we would release that data.ldquoThis Government has released data throughout this pandemic to be as transparent as possible.Asked why schools had re-opened without information on the proportion of contacts traced being known, he said: ldquoWe would not take any gamble or any risk when it comes to young peoplersquos education. In fact, what wersquove said from day one is that our childrenrsquos education is a priority.He added: ldquoTherersquos a number of harms we have to balance, a range of data we have to look at. And having looked at that data, wersquore confident that schools can reopen.A Scottish Government spokeswoman said: ldquoThe Scottish Government is committed to setting out as much data as possible about the Covid- pandemic to help inform and improve our response.ldquoWe work closely with National Records of Scotland and Public Health Scotland to ensure the figures we publish are robust, and will publish signicantly more informationabout the contact tracing process, including the percentage of positive cases followed up, time taken toreach iniduals who had tested positive and time taken to reachtheir contacts.ldquoWe expect to publish this data by the end of August.ldquoThis will be drawn from the case management system used by all territorial health boards and the National Contact Tracing Centre, and Public Health Scotland is continuing to work with CMS users across the territorial boards to improve data quality ahead of publication."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-born-singer-ordered-leave-country-told-can-stay-indefinitely","story":"The Scottish-Nigerian singersongwriter was born in Glasgow in June , less than six months after the British Nationality Act came into force.The act stated that children born to parents from the colonies were no longer entitled to automatic citizenship.She grew up unaware of that fact, which is why, despite having lived in the UK solidly since she was , she was shocked to find she had a fortnight to leave her home or risk detainment.ldquoWhen I received the letter in June  I was completely confused and shattered.

served in the Far East from  until  during whatrsquos now known as the ldquoforgotten war.He would have been so proud to have taken part in todayrsquos VJ Day commemorations, although he would no doubt have found an online ceremony rather alien.Tragically, however, dad missed out on the landmark events by just a couple of months.He died in a care home on June  after contracting the coronavirus, unable to say goodbye to those he loved. It was a cruel end for a man who had always regarded himself as one of lersquos lucky ones.Dad was a natural optimist. Affable and ebullient, he seemed to many people to possess a sense of being truly blessed.The feeling, Irsquom sure, helped see him through to the grand old age of  and was undoubtedly re-inforced by surviving Second World War service with the Royal Air Force in Burma and India.School friends were killed in action, comrades slain and captured, but the fates were on his side.This realisation struck him on his voyage home at the end of the war on the troop carrier the Capetown Castle. In an account he wrote and in my chats with him, he described some of the less fortunate veterans on the vessel.He spoke of them looking close to skeletons, their eyes staring out blankly in their joyless faces. They were menwho were physically and mentally broken either as a result of the fighting or their struggle in prisoner of war camps where they endured forced labour, torture, and starvation.The memory of their tragic condition stayed with dad for the rest of his le.In , the sea journey out to the Far East could not have been more dferent. Aged , and not long out of school in the small town of Ballymoney, in County Antrim, Northern Ireland, my father stepped on to the troop carrier, the Dominion Monarch, in Liverpool in January of that year. It was the first time he had ever travelled overseas.Around  army and air force personnel were on board the massive ship. Dad described much hustle and bustle among the young passengers.He and his comrades had not been told where they were being deployed to, but as they had been issued with tropical kit they knew it was somewhere hot.Daily leboats drills helped pass the time as anticipation turned to boredom over seven weeks at sea.Second World War troops in IndiaThomas E. Nutt, nd from left in back row pictured with RAF colleagues in Burma during WW.  copyNutt familyExcitement ed when the ship reached Mumbai and the soldiers and airmen landed in a city teeming with people, sacred cows and rickshaws. Dad was struck by the beauty of the turquoise shimmer of the Arabian Sea.From Mumbai my father was sent to Burma, most of which was occupied by the Japanese. He worked as an RAF electrician with Air Support Control  , taking messages from General Orde Wingatersquos First Expeditionary Force, known as the Chindits, who were fighting behind enemy lines in Burma to stop the Japanese invading India.The Chindits would request support from dadrsquos unit, whose task was to drop off supplies of food, personnel and even mules to them by plane. Although dad never described it as such, his job was dangerous. It involved pushing out the items through an open plane door as it flew over enemy territory.He and his comrades were attached to wires as they threw out the objects. In one terrying incident witnessed by dad, an airman fell out of the plane and dangled below it before he could be dragged back inside.My fatherrsquos deployment to Burma came to a halt when the Japanese were on the point of capturing his camp. He and his comrades managed to grab a few things and flee. They criss-crossed the land to avoid the Japanese soldiers and with the help of local people reached the town of Kohima.There they boarded a paddle steamer and sailed to safety ndash and eventually to a new posting with Squadron  at an RAF base in Kharagpur, near Calcutta.At Kharagpur dad worked as an electrician, servicing the electrical components of the RAFrsquos Dakota aircraft. He was out of immediate danger.Months later though he was on the move again, this time to Agartala, not far from the Burma border, where he ed to duties supplying the Chindits.At other points of his service in India dad helped to train Ghurka paratroopers. He took troops on planes into Burma and worked on transport gliders.There were happy moments, too. He flew past Mount Everest during one outing and his unit enjoyed a memorable day-long visit from Vera Lynn when they were stationed at Agartala.He longed though for the war to end and tohome, missing his parents, sister and brothers back in Ballymoney.However, he remembered no rejoicing when the Americans dropped the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki killing a quarter-of-a-million people.He felt horror.One paragraph in his account summed up what he later thought about his service: ldquoAt the time, I suppose no-one thought that  Squadron was very dferent from any other squadron.ldquoBut now when I look back on it, I think it was unique. We did not drop bombs or go out to shoot down aircraft. Our main duties were saving lives, evacuating sick or wounded soldiers, dropping supplies and occasionally evacuating civilians from war zones.Dad passed away a victim of the coronavirus pandemic but to me his service in the Far East was a far more crucial and important chapter in his full and wonderful le."},{"url":null,"title":"asda-face-mask-rules-updated-customer-complains","story":"The supermarket giant released claried guidance on wearing face coverings in stores after one customer said many shoppers were not covering their faces.The chain said that although they are doing all they can to remind customers to follow guidance, it is up to the police to enforce the rules.A spokesman said: \"We are strongly encouraging all customers to wear a face-covering when they visit our stores.:Everything you need to know about face coverings in Scotland\"We also have signs at the entrance to the store and on the shelf edges to encourage customers to wear a face covering and are using Asda FMto further remind customers.\"While we will do all we can to strongly encourage customers to respect the new guidelines, the responsibility for policing and enforcing them does lie with the relevant authorities.\"In Scotland, it is compulsory to wear face coverings in shops and public transport, with people with certain medical conditions or disabilitiesand children under fiveexempt.A spokesperson for Asda continued:\"Throughout the pandemic, our customers have embraced many new rules to help keep everyone safe in our stores, and we are confident they will continue to show care and consideration for each other by wearing a face covering when they visit our stores.\"Whilst we will do all we can to strongly encourage customers to wear a face-covering inside our stores, it is the responsibility of the relevant authorities to police the new rules.\""},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"August ,  at : pmIt#s been a successful day for last year#s County Show Champion, as the Irish sports mare has #done the double# in our Ready, Set, Show! horses contest # securing both the public vote while also getting the nod from our judge.

This will require the Scottish Government to invest in lower emission modes of transport, including more fuel efficient ferries.“Orkney’s internal ferry service is a perfect example. This leline for our island communities is operated by ageing vessels, which are costly to run, damaging to the environment and no longer fit for purpose.“Scottish Ministers should therefore be looking to agree on a replacement programme with Orkney Islands Council that would introduce more fuel-efficient vessels that cut emissions, cost less to operate and provide our island communities with the service they need and deserve.“If the Scottish Government is genuinely committed to meeting its climate change objectives, and treating our islands with fairness, replacement of these vessels must now be a priority.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It brings together erse partners to develop the tools, processes and business models that mean rural and poorly connected communities can rapidly establish next generation and G connectivity for local benefit.Currently, only  per cent of the UK is being served by all four UK mobile network operators and there are still , homes and businesses that don’t receive adequate broadband service as investment predominantly focuses on areas with higher population density.To date, mobile connectivity in the UK has relied on mobile network operators to purchase exclusive licences for access to spectrum and they design, build, own, and operate their own networks.  In , Ofcom changed its policy on spectrum sharing to develop a more open and accessible spectrum market one that acts as a  for innovation, reducing the cost of access to high-quality spectrum in regional areas and opening opportunities for new endeavours to address rural connectivity.G New Thinking will help by providing a practical how-to guide for rural communities looking to capitalise on this opportunity and invest in local connectivity. By developing this replicable and flexible approach, the project aims to help poorly connected communities build commercially sustainable, next generation networks using G technologies.By making this guidance widely available, G New Thinking also aims to stimulate local investment in rural connectivity across the country, to close the rural digital ide.

DaoineNow there is much within the machinations that occupy the precious time of our Comhairle officers that could well be regarded as relatively ‘trivial’, although I will fully concede that even the most improbable deliberations might well form the centre of somebody’s entire universe.But when we, as a community, or section of that community, continue to press for answers and resolutions to a subject that has already been explained fully to us, then we should ask ourselves one important question: “Are we doing this for the greater good, or because we are trying to promote our own agenda ”. about some of the material that was included in the Scottish Government’s RSHPguidelines and how I felt that some of it was completely over the top for inclusion in any classroom.Several concerned parents had written to me, asking what on earth was going on.I enquired of both the Director and Chair of Education and Children’s Services as to the validity of these concerns.I was happy to note that the ‘plot’ wasn’t as sinister as had been portrayed by some ‘concerned’ groups both within the counciland on anti-social media.Some alleged that the Comhairle were somehow, through the back-door and under the cover of the Covid- crisis , trying to sneak through an agenda which went against the “moral values of this community”.An inflammatory accusation, one that was sure to ignite passions and ring yet another Pavlovian bell.Except that, far from being subject matter that was about to get rammed down our children’s throats, not just ‘promoted’ it was simply an extreme example of what was included for reference, should anyone wish to avail themselves of it.Yes, some of it was fairly graphic stuff and, as I’ve said before, I was hugely alarmed that it was even considered for anything to be found in our classrooms.But, as is the case with material which has been taught in our schools for at least a couple of centuries the devil is in the detail .Luckily we have seen teachers, historically, opt to use the message of love, forgiveness, compassion and mutual understanding from this particular tome ignoring the more sinister aspects where death, retribution, punishment and all kinds of nastiness are very much front and centre.Choosing your testaments wisely is what this is primarily about.We are lucky to have an educational framework where common sense prevails, otherwise there could be very many distractions in the subjects of Biology, Geology and quite possibly Physics.I attempted to be amusing about a topic which has very legitimate, obvious, and serious, implications for our most impressionableyoung people.I hoped I was taking a cue from people who think that a banana dipped into a jar of Nutella is a suitable metaphor for something.Possibly the obesity crisis I think a jar of Bovril might have been funnier.If people wish to identy as a Unicorn and have sex with the pavement, then that’s fine too, but not surely for inclusion in ‘guidance’ material.Yes, I have to admit that I also jumped onto the bandwagon, until I had the situation clearly explained to me and was told to trust the teacher’.They will be given the ultimate discretion and they know best what’s appropriate for their young audience.We do ‘much ado’ well here.When ‘Ironside’ and ‘Bob the Budget Builder’ steered the Comhairle and helped many local businesses through the worst of the effects of the ongoing pandemic, we turned inward and focused on upholstery.With Bernie, Angus and the Education Department, all under immense pressure to get a hugely problematic school year underway on time, we are more focused on what won’tbe getting taught, rather than what will, and how.Andour kids come home from school with a penchant for strange combinations of fruit and nut sandwiches, then it will have been discussed with the Head Teacher and Parent Council first.A lot of the contentious issues which occupy us here in the Western Islesare perceived to exist somewhere between a conservative, culturally protective, radically Christian, ‘right’, and a somewhat more progressive, more liberal, secular, bunch of left-wing snowflakes.Most of us are somewhere, far more certainly and squarely, in the middle trying to make sense of it all.If we cannot empower and trust our teachers to do what’s best for the most vulnerable amongst us, then we will have failed both.The man of the week, last week, certainly in the northern half of this county, was the irrepressible David Black.Three rounds crammed into  hours saw him claim the Thompson Bruce Trophy at Stornoway and take an early lead in Scarista’s  ‘Blue-Riband’ event.Rounds of +  around Lady Lever Park on Friday and Saturday saw him edge out Eddie Rogers,  +  by just a single shot over  holes.A further shot adrt saw Murdo ‘Griddy’ MacLeod,  +  in third slot.Iain ‘Juke Box’ MacKay won the handicap trophy with two excellent rounds of nett  for a  total.In between his Thompson Bruce exploits, Davie also posted the leading score in the, two-round, Harris G.C. Club Championship.His  was  shots ahead of nearest challengers, Billy Fraser and Cal Robertson, both on .Starting with six straight pars, he succumbed to bogies at the ‘amen’ of corners, the deadly-deceiving brace of par-s at   .Naturally he bounced straight back birdies at the new th, and the th brought him back to level.He swapped a birdie for a bogey at  and  to see him home safely.Only a sht in plate tectonics will see him throw away this lead.Midweek at Stornoway saw the Glennie Trophy claimed by Iain Moir on  Stableford Points. Starting his opening four holes, five-over par, couldn’t have been good for his confidence.He was just one-over for the next .In the Junior section, Calum Gbounced back from his recent humblings at the hands of brother, Geordie H in the Par Bogey competition.Six ahead of the course, he demolished the rest of the field by  clear shots.In the Scarista midweek competition, Billy Fraser kept up his, season-long, decent form, partnering Chris Sutton to a fine win in the Pairs Greensomes.Their  was two ahead of Russell Tennant and Alan Gunn’s, .Benbecula’s finest continue to battle it out for their season-long Order of Merit, Dami Steele ing a semblance of normality, bouncing back from a week out of the top spots to consolidate his lead at the top.His round wasn’t, however, good enough to claim the full points last Tuesday evening, Domhnall MacKay storming to a -pointer and the maximum Point haul.Apparently Donald has been keeping his powderdry and intends, after a decent sabbatical, to make a strong charge over the coming weeks."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/TOURISM-2-copy.jpg","title":"litir do luchd ionnsachaidh","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine.’.

He is a self taught sculptor who created this le size sculpture using nothing but recycled horseshoes. The shoes were supplied by a local farrier. This specially designed sculpture is something which has added another dimension to their in bloom activities and, being made from horse shoes, might even bring us good luck in any future competitions!Bertie said he had this challenging task in his mind for some time.“We, in the Cullybackey Community Partnership, are always looking for something which will enhance the village and will also appeal to our “In Bloom” judges.

These have been in the following council areas: Antrim and Newtownabbey Borough Council , Ards and North Down Borough Council , Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council , Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council , Mid and East Antrim Borough Council , and Newry, Mourne and Down District Council .In addition, there have been  clusters across Northern Ireland with fewer than five people.These figures are up to pm on th August . Cases in a smaller cluster may also be associated with a larger cluster, for example a common geographic location or common social setting.The PHA will be publishing cluster data on a weekly basis each Thursday until further notice.A cluster is currently defined as two or more laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID- among iniduals associated with a key setting, with illness onset dates within a  day period.Key settings which have seen clusters to date since May include workplaces, retail or hospitality premises, domestic gatherings, and sporting settings. COVID- transmission risk is highest in a household setting, and it is to be anticipated that a signicant number of linked cases within households will be identied by efficient contact tracing. It is for this reason that household-linked cases are not reported as clusters.The PHA’s Contact Tracing Servicecontinues to engage successfully with the vast majority of identied contacts and provide appropriate advice to help prevent any onward spread.Over the week up to pm on th August , the number of positive tests reported to the CTS was  – the number of positive cases requiring contact tracing was . There were  positive cases that completed contact tracing, and  contacts identied. There were  contacts successfully contacted and advised. [see Notes to Editors for further explanation of these figures]Since July, the average number of close contacts linked to cases has more than doubled. The rise may be attributed to the gradual easing of lockdown measures, but may also be explained by relaxing of attitudes to social distancing.Dr Gerry Waldron, Head of Health Protection at the PHA, said: “Cases are occurring in communities across Northern Ireland. This is an important reminder that we must not become complacent – coronavirus remains in circulation, so each of us has a responsibility to take steps to help keep ourselves and those around us safe.“Maintain social distancing, wash your hands regularly, and get testedyou display any symptoms of coronavirus. You can also download the StopCOVID NI contact tracing app.“This disease has the potential to make its presence felt in any community, as we have seen with clusters appearing across a number of council districts.“Everyone should act on the basis that it might potentially be in your neighbourhood right now, rather than waiting for it to emerge in your local area or for rumours to circulate before taking steps to help protect yourself and others. That’s why following the public health advice remains vitally important. You can spread the virus evenyou dont have symptoms, so taking these steps and exercising good hygiene practices will help prevent cases and reduce the number of clusters.Our analysis of clusters to date has shown that they have been associated with both workplaces and in the community, such as domestic gatherings and in hospitality and sporting settings.“Clusters are managed through the contact tracing programme, and where we need to advise or inform the public of any increased risk to public health we will do so in a timely manner.Dr Waldron added: “Speculation around current clusters of COVID- across Northern Ireland is not helpful.“We will not be commenting on inidual cases of COVID- or going into the detail of every incident that emerges, as this could lead to people being identied, create stigma and focus attention on iniduals, families or groups, and therefore deter others with symptoms coming forward to be tested.”Everyone with symptoms of coronavirus can book a free test. If anyone is concerned that they are experiencing any of the symptoms of coronavirus, they must self-isolate and arrange a test as soon as possible. For further information on the virus, its symptoms and how to book a test, visit www.pha.site coronavirusWe must be aware that COVID- is still a threat and we need everyone to play their part in helping to stop the virus spreading.If you receive a positive test result you will be contacted by the PHA’s Contact Tracing Service from .Members of the public are also encouraged to download the StopCOVID NI contact tracing app on Android or Apple, which complements the work of the Contact Tracing Service.

Three Northern Ireland school principals on the controversy surrounding a covid-hit results day.Amanda McNamee, principal of Lagan College: #We#re dismayed to see our young people unsure of future pathways#Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseAmanda McNamee FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappAmanda McNameeThis year, our school community, like all others, has experienced unprecedented levels of change and disruption since March , but throughout the Covid- pandemic, we have been extremely proud of how our Sixth Form students have coped with the situation that the education system found itself in.Students had their learning disrupted, were denied the opportunity to sit examinations and experienced serious uncertainty about their future, but throughout it all they held an unwavering confidence that their teachers, who knew their learning best, would not let them down.As a centre of learning, Lagan College agrees that statistical modelling has its place in a normal given year.However, we believe more passionately that a teacher#s knowledge of their student#s learning, continuous assessment and potential supersedes this and this has been anything but a normal school year.So, our school community feels extremely disheartened and disappointed that some of our students believe that the education system has let them down.This year, we have recorded a signicant disparity between teacher centre assessed gradesand the final grades awarded by the Northern Ireland examination board.Some % of all A-level grades awarded were reduced, % of AS-level grades awarded were reduced.Unfortunately, until we receive more information and transparency about the awarding process used for an inidual learner, we do not feel confident that grades awarded to every student were a fair reflection of their work to date and potentialthey had been able to sit examinations.We were dismayed to see some of our students upset and disarmed yesterday and uncertain of their onward pathways. However, teachers were on hand to reassure our young people and their families that all of this was simply beyond their control.Let#s now all redouble our efforts in the education system to reflect upon yesterday#s events and ensure that the wellbeing of our young people is not unnecessarily and further impacted upon this year.Alan Hutchinson, principal of Glastry College, Newtownards: #Students# hopes dashed by farce and systemic discrimination#Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseAlan Hutchinson FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappAlan HutchinsonYesterday Glastry College students arrived to collect results full of hope for their future many excited about fulfilling their dreams by accessing higher education courses that will shape their lives and the lives of their families for decades to come. Instead, they were graced with what, at best, can be described as a farce and at worst systemic discrimination.At A-level % of our candidates were downgraded in at least one subject, while % of all Centre Assessed Grades were adjusted downwards.The statistical modelling used by CCEA appears to have taken no account of any work completed, or progress made by students in the seven months they studied during this academic year up until lockdown.Over the last five years our internal tracking data has indicated that we have predicted the overall A-level outcome for students to within -% either way.However, based upon the grades awarded by the examining body this year, our predictions appear to be out by an incredulous %!The question arises, do we trust and value the expert judgment of teaching professionals who have many years# experience, know the students as iniduals and have access to multiple sources of reliable assessment and tracking data, or data scientists who are more interested in decidedly limited and dubious data than the devastation caused to students, parents and teachers Statistics aside, we are dealing here with young people, with human beings, all of whom have hopes and aspirations, many of which are now dashed on a system they were promised would not disadvantage them.Moreover, the policy to go into lockdown appears to have dealt a signicant blow to those deemed to be least in need of the protection afforded by it.On top of this, we must acknowledge the trauma this cohort of pupils has already suffered.The opportunity to showcase their ability, skills, and knowledge acquired and developed over the last seven years was stolen.Their school career abruptly ended with no time for farewells or celebrations.Further anxiety was added by the enforced separation from their peers due to lockdown.Now, instead of aiding and supporting these pupils, CCEA has compounded this emotional distress, predominantly it seems, in non-selective schools by permitting what is nothing short of an incongruous travesty.I sincerely hope that immediate and rectying action is taken in the interests of all the young people unjustly penalised this year by a very flawed system.Gary Kelly, principal of St Kevin#s College, Lisnaskea: #My excitement turned to upset when I saw the pupils# grades#Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseGary Kelly FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappGary KellyWith over  years of teaching experience and  years as principal, yesterday was one of the most upsetting results days I have experienced.After arriving in school on Wednesday excited about downloading the A-level results, this quickly turned to upset when I had seen how many pupils# grades were marked down at A-level.I was expecting, as St Kevin#s College was ranked as the highest performing non-selective school in  and second highest non-selective school in , that this year#s A-level results would follow the student cohort pattern from when these pupils were doing GCSEs one or two years ago. But no - approximately % of Year  A-level pupils had A-levels downgraded with the CCEA exam board. The picture with other exam boards was better than this, down slightly.It was with a heavy heart that I awoke this morning to release grades and speak to pupils and parents.Normally I take delight chatting with pupils and parents on results day and congratulating them, but not this year.I was consoling them and offering a shoulder to cry on and a possible hope of an appeal to help their well-being and mental health, with the knowledge that this could take weeks and months to sort out -ever.In all my years as principal I have never had to deal with so many upset pupils and parents as this year.I understand this is a very dficult process to estimate A-level and GCSE grades with the Covid- outbreak.But why ask teachers to spend days and weeks examining past pupil work, holding standardisation meetings online and socially distanced in school, and entering marks for the majority of the teacher predictions to be downgraded as we did in our school and most schools across Northern Ireland It is not all doom and gloom - the vast majority of our pupils have got their first preference course at university, which is good, our three A*-C pass rate is up on last year.But what we have discovered is that it is the high performing pupils# grades that have been downgraded most and that Northern Ireland CCEA exams have been downgraded more than any English exam board.Pupils are saying you know me Sir or Miss - I am much better than these grades. Look at my exams in school, my coursework, my GCSE results.They say: I might have got into university but I have to carry these results for the rest of my le and put them down on every application form I write - what does this say about me. I have had lots of parents and pupils in tears today - normally we get four to five appeals on a normal exam result day. This year it#s more like  to .I don#t often complain, but when there is such an injustice, I feel we must speak out for our young people both hear and across the whole of Northern Ireland.

Dreams have been shattered, places at top universities have been scrapped and young people have fallen victim to this complete farce of a model that Mr Weir and Mr Edwards have been dodging questions on since Thursday.I should not be a victim of historical data. I should not be downgraded because I chose integrated education rather than a grammar school.Our school prides itself on every pupil achieving their personal best.Does your model take this into consideration I deserve to be treated as an inidual. The modelling that has been used must be open to question and scrutiny, because it does not seem to reflect the actual student.It is more of an exercise in statistics far too much about the modelling is hidden and too many young people have been let down.Had a fire alarm gone off during our exams we#d all have been awarded our predicted grades.We#re going through a global pandemic, which is much more distressing, and thousands of young people have suffered because of this mess, fuelled by the decisions taken by Mr Edwards and Mr Weir.I have % trust in my teachers. Why don#t you Your model should be withdrawn, just like thousands of Ucas offers were withdrawn on Friday.Justin Edwards and Peter Weir, you have failed so many of us and robbed us of the grades we deserved.I hope you both take a long, hard look at yourselves and perhaps just stop to think about this absolute shambles you have created and all those dreams you have shattered in the process.Think about it aswe were your children and it was their futures at stake.Jamie Harkin is head boy at Drumragh Integrated School in Omagh  Belfast   Most ReadYellow Vests and anti-fascists Belfast city centre stand-offHugh McWilliams, millionaire Derry businessman, killed in car crashCoronavirus Northern Ireland:  new cases as fundraiser in memory of Andreea Maftei raises thousandsBallycastle tractor crash tragedy: Miracle as five-year-old Hannah Smyth s home after three months in hospitalCoronavirus: Tributes to Ballymena woman Andreea Mafteiafter she dies at age of ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

PMFacebookTwitterEmailNorthern Ireland’s Education Minister has ruled out using teacher grade predictions to replace disputed A-level results.Peter Weir defended the mathematical model used to standardise the results as the SDLP made a bid to recall the Stormont Assembly to address the controversy.More than a third of A-level grades issued on Thursday were lower than teacher estimates.Giving evidence to his Stormont scrutiny committee, Mr Weir said solely using teacher estimates to allocate A or AS-level grades would lack any level of credibility.In % of cases teachers

was up on previous years.However, many students have been left shocked and disappointed after receiving grades that were signicantly lower than both their performance in previous exams and their teachers’ prediction.The SDLP is seeking the support of other MLAs to secure the  signatures required to force the recall of the Assembly from summer recess.The education committee did sit during recess to question Mr Weir on Friday.During the y hearing, chairman Chris Lyttle urged the minister to intervene and ensure pupils were awarded A-level grades based on either their AS-level attainment or the estimated grade assessed by their teacher.“These are unprecedented times,” said the Alliance MLA.Mr Lyttle said he was aware of a school that had seen its A*-C attainment rate fall from % last year to % under the calculation model.He said the minister was “increasingly isolated” in refusing to use the teacher assessments to allocate the grades.Mr Weir responded by insisting thatteacher predictions were used without standardisation, the results would not have “any level of credibility” because the results would be so much higher than those achieved in previous years.He said that approach would also be unfair on pupils, as some teachers would have been “generous” in estimating grades while others had been “tough” on their students.“There would be no equality whatsoever,” said

acknowledged that the system for calculating A-level results “did not work for everyone”.He said there was no way of creating a perfect replacement for sitting the exams which were cancelled as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.“We were looking to create what was a least-worst solution,” said the minister.Mr Weir highlighted that a fast-tracked appeals process has been established for those students who believe they have been treated unfairly.The standardisation model was developed by Northern Ireland exam body the Council for the Curriculum, Examinations and Assessment .CCEA asked teachers to give a predicted grade for their pupils and then rank them in order within their class.The exams body then used other data to standardise the results.For A-levels, the data included pupils’ AS-level results, making adjustments for those who had applied to take resits.For AS results, the pupils’ GCSE results were also used, as was the performance by their school over the previous three years.Today, SDLP have tabled a petition to recall the Assembly, to urgently address the crisis over exam grading. Many students across Northern Ireland feel robbed of a fair chance. It is not good enough.The Minister for Education and Joint First Ministers must be held to account. pic qsiKOSGK— Social Democratic and Labour PartyAugust , Daniel McCrossan, whose SDLP has urged the Assembly recall, branded the situation a “debacle”.He expressed concern about the mental health impact on children, revealing that a GP had contacted him to alert him that three pupils who had missed out on university places had presented with suicidal thoughts.“This model failed, it failed our children and it failed our young people,” he told the minister.He added: “As the result of this pandemic, they should not pay the price.”Mr McCrossan demanded more transparency on the algorithm used to calculate the grades.In regard to the algorithm, Mr McCrossan said there was a need to “mark the minister’s homework”.Mr Weir said he would make information on the formula public, though he stressed some of it would be technical data.He rejected calls for an independent review of CCEA’s actions.“I think CCEA processes were sound,” he said.“I don’t intend at this stage to have an independent review.”\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland f .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_aac-ac--a-ebcf_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland f .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_aac-ac--a-ebcf_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland f .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_aac-ac--a-ebcf_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland f .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_aac-ac--a-ebcf_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland f .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_aac-ac--a-ebcf_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClose\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland f .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_aac-ac--a-ebcf_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland f .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_aac-ac--a-ebcf_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland f .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_aac-ac--a-ebcf_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland f .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_aac-ac--a-ebcf_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland f .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_aac-ac--a-ebcf_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"CCEA chief excutive Justin Edwards gives evidence to the education committee  FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappCCEA chief excutive Justin Edwards gives evidence to the education committee  Chief executive of CCEA Justin Edwards also faced questions at the committee.He defended the model used, insisting a range of academics and other experts were involved in its development.Mr Edwards stressed the limited time his organisation had to deliver on the minister’s key objectives – to produce a set of results for the  cohort and to ensure standards were in line with previous years.“People have worked inordinate hours in my organisation to deliver a solution,” he said.Mr Edwards added: “I’ve always cited that the best solution was examinations and it was not available to us.“And,it was not available to us, then this alternative approach was the next best operation.”He claimed no better solution had been presented.“If there was a viable alternative to this situation, then let it be brought forward,” he said.PAMost ReadYellow Vests and anti-fascists Belfast city centre stand-offHugh McWilliams, millionaire Derry businessman, killed in car crashCoronavirus Northern Ireland:  new cases as fundraiser in memory of Andreea Maftei raises thousandsBallycastle tractor crash tragedy: Miracle as five-year-old Hannah Smyth s home after three months in hospitalCoronavirus: Tributes to Ballymena woman Andreea Mafteiafter she dies at age of ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The new centre will be moved a short distance to Anderson House at Altnagelvin. Derry was the first city to set-up a COVID centre back on March  at the out-of-hours Western Urgent Care building. The other Covid centre in the Western Trust area opened at South West Acute Hospital on March . The Trust continues to maintain a state of readiness for admissions of patients with suspected Covid- and a further surge. Speaking at the Western Trust’s monthly board meeting, Dr Anne Kilgallen, Chief Executive, said: “Both centres continue to operate, preparing for a potential second surge. googletag.cmd.push “The Altnagelvin centre will move to Anderson and South West centre will reduce its footprint to free up space in the outpatient department. “Movements are allowing us to recommence our outpatient services.” Antibody testing has been offered in the Trust area as of July , she told the Western Trust board. These tests are used to detect antibodies to the COVID- virus to seeyou have previously had the virus. The test works by taking a blood sample and testing for the presence of antibodies to seeyou have developed an immune response to the virus. A total of  tests were carried out and only  ed as positive, which Dr Kilgallen described as an ‘interesting find’. googletag.cmd.push A Covid swab testing service available to staff, patients pre-operatively and staff in the independent sector continues to operate at C-TRIC at Altnagelvin Hospital and Lackaboy in Enniskillen. However, those services are also relocating in August as part of reset plans. The latest NISRA statistics show that  people have died of Covid- in Derry City and Strabane. In the council area there have been  confirmed coronavirus cases –  in the last  days. In response to the Coronavirus pandemic a network of new Primary CareCovid- centres were then rapidly established to manage the growth of Coronavirus cases in the community. They were seen as an essential part of the fight against this virus.  To ensure vital GP services can be maintained, it is believed to be absolutely critical that those who show symptoms are separated from the patients with nonCovid- related conditions.  These centres are not testing facilities and are only for patients who are very unwell, are suspected of havingCovid- and require medical attention.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

This is unacceptable, has reducedthe future options for many school leavers and caused immense distress. Teachers’ assessments should have been trusted much more than they have been. Education minister Peter Weir must intervene and do so urgently.”SDLP Education Spokesperson Daniel McCrossan MLA also expressed his concern and disappointmentat reports from young people that their grades were unfair and inaccurate. He has urged Minister Weir to ensure a robust appeals process is in place.The West Tyrone MLA added:“This is a highly stressful time for pupils across the North and their families. The failure of CCEA to remove the contentiousstandardisation from the grading process and the subsequent failure of the Education Minister to act has compounded that stress. It is not good enough.“The SDLP first raised these issues with CCEA and the Department of Education many months ago. They have been aware of these issues since April and utterly failed to act, at the expense of our young people.It is unacceptable and frankly disgraceful that our children have been left subject to a postcode lottery in relation to their exam results.This is about the future of our children and there can beno room for inequalityor unfairness.“The grading systemsusedmust not be allowed to disadvantagehigh-achieving pupils fromareas of deprivation.Standardisation cannot be allowed to become a euphemism for discrimination against working class children - even unintentionally.It is a crude and ineffective tool and has no place in a modern, fair education system.“It is clear the Minister should never have let this situation escalate and thestandardisationtool should have been put in the bin many months ago. However, Minister Weir must now act urgently to ensure the appeals process is robust and allows young people the opportunity to challenge grades they are deeply disappointed with.“The Minister must also compel CCEA to publish themodelling and calculation process used to determine grades this year, to allow young people all the information they need to seetheir grade is fair, accurate and reflective of their ability.“I want toapologiseto school children right across the North, particularly those getting A-Level grades today and GCSE grades next week. You have been put in an intolerably dficult position and I am sorry thatthis failure was allowed to happen.This is not your fault and we have got your back.“The SDLP will continue to fight for grades to be restored, based onteachersjudgement, and without the crude bias of thestandardisationstool.” googletag.cmd.push  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Entering the school foyer you’re struck that John Hume sits alongside illustrious company in what must have been a golden age of thinkers and creators. A bust made in the Derry man’s honour rests between two gentlemen who excelled in their own fields in Seamus Heaney and Brian Friel.  Each of these men attended the former Bishop Street school around the same time and went on to become giants in their respective disciplines. googletag.cmd.push John Hume’s own journey at the college began in  . “He told his mother he was going to the College and she said, ‘no you’re not, we can’t afford that’, but he passed his Eleven Plus and got in,” current principal Finbar Madden said. Hume was part of the first generation to avail of opportunities through the introduction of the Eleven Plus. It allowed more young people to continue their post-primary education which may go some way to explaining why men like Hume, Friel and Heaney grasped the opportunity with both hands. There was obviously ‘huge talent and ability’, Mr Madden said, as Hume left the school with a scholarship to study at university. googletag.cmd.push He had ambitions of joining the priesthood at the leading Catholic Seminary in Ireland, St Patrick’s College, Maynooth. Hume didn’t complete his clerical studies but instead opted to serve his community in another way. He graduated from the National University of Ireland in  with a bachelor’s degree in French and history and went on to receive a master’s degree. Returning to Derry, Hume would became a teacher at St. Columb’s. Mr Madden said that career lasted from -. At the time, the history curriculum was limited in schools and Hume taught the subject in a broader sense, keen to instil his vision of Ireland’s place in Europe. As he departed, transitioning into a career in politics, some of the key developments in the civil rights movement were starting to unfold. That, however, wasn’t the end of his journey with the school and his legacy endures. The colleges former pupils association present an annual award - the Alumnus Illustrissimus Award - to a past-pupil who has achieved something of major signicance or has made a considerable contribution in his own field. In , the Most Reverend Dr Edward Daly received the inaugural award and the following year John Hume would be recognised for his contribution to politics and peace in Northern Ireland. Mr Madden said: “The school is able to boast of many exceptional students who went out and made their mark locally, nationally and internationally. “The award recognises achievement whatever the field may be sport, science politics, religion and so on.” A proud College boy, Hume maintained connections over the years and wouldfor prize giving ceremonies. “He presented a facsimile of his Nobel prize to the school,” Mr Madden pointed out next to the assembly hall, “and our politics A-level prize is the John Hume prize in government and politics.” “And for as long as he could, he would come every year to prize-giving, he usually turned up unannounced but we always expected him to come, until unfortunately he wasn’t able to. “He had a very, very clear sense of his connectedness with this school and he never lost that right throughout his le. “In a way that many others weren’t able to do, by his connectedness here, by his presence, he was making it clear that St. Columb’s College meant a huge amount to him. “He recognised what the college had helped him to become.” The school’s principal believes that pupils have looked up to Hume over the years and used him as a source of inspiration in their own studies. Mr Madden concluded: “I think Colum Eastwood said it last night, John Hume was Ireland’s Martin Luther King and we recognise that Martin Luther King had a dream and did all he could to achieve it. “I think John Hume did exactly the same thing here.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

In recent seasons, Slaughtneil, Glen, Lavey and Magherafelt have pulled out of the competition as their main players were preparing for senior county finals. Its the younger grades that are the concern, as many coaches adopt a win at all costs attitude to their teams. I once heard an U manager talking about needing an extra session per week to prepare for a big game. The fixture in question was a Feacuteile group game. For the love of God, people need to take a step back. If you have a team talented enough to reach a final, then go all out to win it. As a general rule, dont listen to the doting parents chirping over the wire about getting the perceived strongest team out. Most of the time, they only have their sons or daughters interest in mind and not the clubs overall health  years down the tracks. All underage leagues and group games should be treated accordingly, a chance to develop. In any  of players, there will be many dferent levels of skill and physique. Any club serious about underage, will have enough helpers with their teams to cater for it. Set them targets. Condition players to work on their weak sidethey have mastered a skill. Or better still, encourage them to improve the pace of its execution and challenge them to make better decisions when in possession. For players that are struggling with a skill, thats the dficult part. That is real coaching, requiring both patience and dedication, with very little instant satisfaction. The earlier in the players coaching journey, the easier it will be. Break down the skill into manageable chunks. Where possible, link in with parents, so it can be worked on outside of training sessions. Parents have to take ownership as well. Even something as simple as video examples posted in a Whats App group. In many ways, this is where the most improvement will happen. There will be late developers, sometimes ing from other sports, but iniably those who strive to improve will always blossom. If you cant bring them all along with you, then you cant say you didnt try. At the end of the day, GAA is not for everyone. There are other sports and interests out there. The approach to games is the deal-breaker. It will dictate how many players you will retain. Managers should arm themselves with a piece of paper to plot a grid of who starts each game, how many minutesthey play and how long each substitute gets on the pitch for. Make a note of any players who have had school games that week or with the age group above. It will allow you to give more action to those who need it. All through the league, maintain a strong spine to your team so that it can always be competitive, but make some of your key players sit out some action and challenge others to play central roles in the absence of the so called star players. Better still, play them in dferent positions and tinker about as much as you can. Does anyone really care who wins an underage league or blitz game  Give others an opportunity to wear a starting jersey and watch how your grid changes. Make sure everyone gets starting in a number of games and not token five-minute appearances when the game is over. Youngsters are far from stupid. Its amazing what a jersey number below  can do for someones self esteem. It can feed into the development work you have been talking to the parents about. At the end of the day, championship is where the main focus will always be. And rightly so. A competitive edge must also be developed. If you can get a number of challenge games in and everyone gets playing, it will help maintain a bigger squad. This enables your coaching team to ide themselves up to work on dferent players and aspects of play. Take turns to be the stats person for a night to count things like use of weaker side, playing the final pass for a goal or the number of blocks. It is the perfect psychology to get inside the heads of the players in the top bracket of your squad. Also fire in wee reminders to others you see improving. In Thursdays documentary, iconic Meath midfielder Gerry McEntee referred to how Seaacuten Boylan would always have one on one chats and make him feel like he was the most important person in the world. It was a persona that made people want to improve. Mary K Burke snapped this gem of a photofrom a recent Feacuteile final. Look at the joy on the youngsters faces. Victory helps instil that type of emotion, but imagine an environment where everyone felt like that. Coaching sessions where learning overspills into laughter and where every player gets their fair share of game time. Imagine. That world would be a much better place, somewhere nobody would ever want to leave.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Dan McGrellis passed away peacefully at home, surrounded by his family and friends. He was a well-known and much-loved member of the community, parish and local GAA club. At his funeral, Fr McGavigan paid tribute to a ‘good father, grandfather and great grandfather’. “Dan was a remarkable man. He knew from a young age the importance of a father, losing his own father to cancer when he was only twelve,” he told mourners at St Joseph’s Church, Fincarn. googletag.cmd.push “He was the second of nine children, and took on a father’s role, moving to Scotland to work so money could be sent home for his mother and siblings. “Such instinctive sacrice and generosity, learned at a young age, was to be the mark of the man. Dan was to have very soon celebrated  years as a pioneer, the pin proudly worn on his lapel. “He was far from a shrinking violet, though, and was a regular in the pub in his youth, enjoying a game of darts with friends. The soberest, but perhaps the most sociable of all his friends. googletag.cmd.push “The parish of Banagher has lost a faithful friend who was a companion to many people work colleagues, extended family, GAA, pioneers and the community association to name but a few. “He had a huge heart and had room for everyone, so of course we are sad, even though he lived a long and incredibly full le.” Dan and the rest of the St Marys committee pictured at the opening of the new pitch in . The McGrellis family are steeped in the tradition of the club, and Dan’s seven sons wore maroon ties at his funeral in a nod to their father’s deep affection for St Mary’s. Dan was chairperson of St Mary’s GAC, Banagher from  to , having been vice chairperson in  and . As well as his involvement with the GAA, Fr McGavigan told the congregation that Dan contributed greatly to parish and community le in Banagher. “Parish and community were central to his le,” he said. “He lobbied the council for a footpath from Feeny village to the chapel, ensuring access for the local primary school, and was an early member of Feeny Community Association. “Helping to establish the parish bingo, he was involved in the renovation of the parish hall and ably served for many years as a sacristan in this church.”  Dan’s most loyal commitment, though, was to his family and his we Anne. Fr McGavigan told mourners how the couple encountered each other long before they were married. “The story is told of how he, as a young boy, watched a christening pass his mother’s shop on the way to the chapel,” he said. “The baby was a certain Anne Conway, who was brought here to be christened. “He recalled how he wasn’t much interested in a baby at eight years old, but recounted how a neighbour remarked, ‘this could be the girl you marry’. “Years later, they met again at a dance in Aghabrack and they soon married and settled down to begin a family. So began the McGrellis dynasty. “Dan and Anne patiently, generously and faithfully raised their twelve children, instilling in them their own virtues of hard work, kindness, generosity, respect and good humour.” Fr McGavigan concluded by encouraging Dan’s many children, grandchildren and great grandchildren to be inspired by his le. “Dan was a powerhouse of prayer and work and an inspiration for all of the McGrellis family,” he said “To his children, grandchildren and great grandchildren be inspired today by the holy le and death of a good man, and see in his le the virtues you would like to see in your own. “If you do this, Dan will live on in you and future generations. Woven into your sadness, there is a deep gratitude to God for all that this man has been to us. “We are happy, because we know deep down that his le was complete and that he, in the end, was ready for God.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Along with drivers of internal combustion enginecars using EV charge points as makesht parking bays, EV drivers listed poor maintenance of the existing network as a major problem. Phil Gordon, a Donegal resident who works at Altnagelvin Hospital in Derry, said the majority of the city’s charge points are not ing. “It’s been slowly falling apart for years and nobody is doing anything about it. It was developed around -,” he told the County Derry Post. googletag.cmd.push “I got my EV in  and at that point, in Derry alone there were seven standard chargers and one rapid. At the minute there are only two of the slow chargers left working. “There one on Carlisle Road has been broken for as long as I can remember. There is one in the Diamond that has been out of order for about  or  months. “We’ve been told by eCars that it’s beyond repair, they can’t fix it and there is no plan to replace it. The north west in general has been very badly served by eCars for a long time. googletag.cmd.push “You look at how many there are in Belfast. It’s the biggest city and it has four or five rapid chargers. Derry is the second biggest city in the country and it’s only ever had one.” A map showing EV charge points across County Derry. Responsibility for the network across the island of Ireland lies with eCars, a specic section of Electricity Supply Board . The company began charging last year for the use of its rapid chargers in the Republic of Ireland and further pricing for standard network charging points came into effect yesterday. ESB have said they hope to be able to replace broken chargers, but that ‘planning issues’ are causing a delay. “In County Derry, there are  chargers in total each with two charge points. Of these  are working correctly and our systems indicate recent usage,” a spokesperson said. “There are, however, a number of chargers in Derry City which have faults which cannot be resolved, and new chargers are required. “This is due to the age of the equipment and that they are no longer supported by the original charger manufacturer. “In addition, one charger was removed at the train station due to building works and which is due to be reinstated in coming months by the building contractor. “ESB ecars has plans to replace a section of the existing Standard AC network in Northern Ireland including in Derry. “There are a number of planning issues which need to be resolved first and work is on-going with relevant stakeholders in relation to it at present. “It is hoped that these issues can be overcome with a view to beginning to replace chargers in the coming months.” At present, it is free to charge an electric car using the Northern Ireland network, something EV driver Ronan McElholm feels leaves the system open to abuse. “They’re free, and this is half the problem. When you get something that is free, it’s subject to abuse,” he said. “There is a lot of funding from the government in the Republic, but added to that is the fact you’re now having to pay for it and it makes things easier. “It’s not a fortune to charge your car. It’s only slightly more than the day-time rate. It keeps the freeloaders away because it’s now cheaper to charge at home than on the network.” While the lack of maintenance on the network has caused problems, EV drivers are also having to contend with ICE drivers using the charge points as parking bays. “A lot of places, they’ll put a charger in but don’t enforce the parking, so people park an ordinary car in it because it’s a handy space and they leave it there,” said Phil Gordon “There is no punishment for that. In Derry City, you will get a ticketyou’re parked in an EV charging bay, but a in lot of places, that’s not enforced. “It’s ridiculous. They call it ‘ICE-ing’. Internal Combustion Engine. If they’ve parked an ordinary car in your place, you’ve been ‘iced’. It’s such a common problem there’s a term for it. “You wouldn’t park a car at a petrol pump and walk off and leave it. That’s the equivalent.” Ronan McElholm regularly travels from Derry to Belfast and Dublin for work, and has encountered the problem on numerous occasions. “It causes a problem. I was going to Belfast, finding an abandoned car on a charger with no way of knowing when this person is coming back,” he said. “I’ve never had any issues with the rapid charger on the Glenshane, for example, apart from non-electric cars parking in it. One day there was a van parked and left there for three hours. “Once you hit five o’clock, non-electric cars just park in it, which is an incredibly selfish thing for anyone to do. “They can get a ticket for it, but once the traffic wardens go home, there is no one to ticket you, because the police say it’s not their responsibility. “In the Republic, they are upgrading all the street chargers to rapid chargers, which is a good thing, but unless there is proper policing on it, people just pull in and park. “It needs a change to legislation and the police need powers to ticket cars parked on them.” DfI Minister Nichola Mallon arriving for work in her EV. The political lag caused by Stormont’s two-year period of stalemate has resulted in a backlog across all departments which has delayed any upgrade to the EV charging network. Department for InfrastructureMinister Nichola Mallon raised eyebrows when she arrived in an EV on the day Stormont ed in January. “That was a show. People like myself have tried to contact her to get something done about it and they just don’t reply. All talk and no substance,” said Phil Gordon. “When I got my first Leaf in , there were only about ,-odd cars in the whole of the Republic of Ireland. Now there are about , in the south and -, in the north. “The users are there, but bureaucracy and red tape has left it way down the list of priorities to get the network to a al level.” “They really would need to get their finger out,” added Ronan McElholm. “They certainly do need to get things moving with regards to legislation. The complete charge network needs and overhaul and massive funding. “As an electric car user, I’m prepare to pay for it like it is in the Republic. They’ve really started to upgrade the network there in the last few years, but you can see a big dference.” The UK government has committed to banning the sale of petrol, diesel and hybrid vehicles from . The DfI have said they are engaging with the UK Office of Low Emission Vehiclesto ‘determine how to meet this challenge’. A DfI spokesperson said: “The Department provides advice and guidance in relation to electric vehicles, working closely with OLEV. “The Department is working to identy actions to support the decarbonisation of transport including how best to support the uptake of ultra-low emission vehicles to the Northern Ireland market. “The Minister has engaged with the DAERA Minister to begin working collaboratively to promote the use of electric vehicles and specically to improve the charge point network in Northern Ireland. “She is committed to exploring all options and new solutions to enhance the charge point infrastructure, improve lives and tackle the climate emergency. “The DfI continues to closely monitor funding opportunities for the installation of additional charge point infrastructure. “We will work with commercial providers to ensure that the installation of any additional charge point infrastructure remains fit for purpose commensurate with growth.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Aoibhine McFlynn, from Ballyronan, was chosen for the role of ‘Cassie’ in the film, which was produced in East Susseux, England and released in cinemas on July . The plot follows a reclusive writer who forms a relationship with a young London evacuee named Frank after adopting him during World War Two. Her mum, Edele, says rubbing shoulders with stars like Gemma Arterton and Sir Tom Courtenay, has left Aoibhine keen for more acting experience. “She enjoyed it. She says she wants to do more and that’s what she wants to get into. Hopefully, on the back of this, something  might pop up,” she told the County Derry Post. googletag.cmd.push “I don’t think people thought it was going to be such a big movie. Aoibhine got into it through Alison Campbell models, who put her in for it. Aoibhine with Sir Tom Courtenay. “They flew us over and set us up for four or five nights. The crew and all had been filming for about six weeks, so we were over on the second last week for her scene. “Her role is ‘Cassie’, an evacuee child.

She was a bit younger when we went and did it and it was amazing to see the whole set up and how it was all done.” Pictured with the films lead, Gemma Arterton. Aoibhine’s family are hoping to get together over the next few weeks to watch her on screen, but in the meantime, cinema goers may unknowingly find themselves sharing a room with a film star. “I’ll make them all aware, I’ll roar at the screen,” said Edele, who was planning on visiting the cinema at the weekend with Aoibhine and her husband, Shane. “We might be able to get it here streaming with the family next weekend,we don’t get to the cinema.” Edele says Aoibhine, who also features on a current Phoenix Gas television advertisement, didn’t have to abandon her Loughshore tone for the role. “They wanted the Northern Irish accent, so she didn’t have to change it or anything.” Summerland is in cinemas now and can also be streamed on Amazon Prime Video.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Conor Cahill, a native of Cloyne in the Rebel county, began his trip in Belfast and will make his way down Ireland’s west coast before ing along its eastern seaboard. The walk, which Conor has branded the ‘Camino d’Ireland’ is a huge personal undertaking, but his chosen charity, the Ethiopian Deaf Project , is the priority. “I’m walking anyway, sosomeone  can get the benefit of it then it’s a great story for me,” he told the County Derry Post. googletag.cmd.push “I do this because it pushes my body and resets a lot of my batteries. It’s just like hard training, the benefits are fantastic.” The EDP is a committee of voluntary fundraisers dedicated to supporting deaf children in Ethiopia gain access to formal education. They place a particular emphasis on assisting deaf children from poor rural families or those who are living isolated lives. Fundraising activities, in particular their child sponsorship program, have facilitated the development of a school that is transforming the lives of the children who attend. Miriam ORegan Miriam O’Regan, secretary and founding member of the EDP, said all donations, no matter how small, are helpful. googletag.cmd.push “The money is so hard to raise that we are extremely careful on how it is spent, we know where every cent goes,” she said. “We started my chance I suppose. Myself and my husband, Patrick have two children adopted from Ethiopia, one of whom is deaf. “We then heard of a Dublin priest, Fr. Stephen Monaghan who was trying to do something to help the deaf in Ambo. “We contacted him and said we’d like to help, maybe have a coffee morning or something, the rest is history. “We raised enough to buy land, then with matched funding from Misean Cara to build and extend the school, set up a sponsorship program to support the children and their families. “Now they come with their families once a month to learn sign language and in the next few years we are hoping to get one of the bigger organisations or group to help us establish a much needed boarding house.” Conor stayed in Dungiven while travelling through Derry. Conor feels the experience of being deaf can be a lonely one, but while staying in Dungiven, he was able to meet and talk to a deaf person from the town. “Caroline, my host, took me down to the GAA club and I started talking GAA with a few lads who were down there,” he said. “With social distancing, I was kind of sat in the corner and a deaf lad was brought over by a few of the lads. “I knew straight away he was deaf, so we were signing back and forward and it’s a lovely experience to have. “The other experience I had of that was in a place called Matera, in the south of Italy. I went into a restaurant last year and there were two people signing. “Eventually I went over and introduced myself and signed my name to them. We spent an hour and a half, between signing and texting and talking - communicating. “They told me that, over the three weeks they had travelled from Hamburg, I was the first person that had made any attempt to engage with them. “It’s a tough way to live. Three weeks on holidays and no one making any effort to communicate with them.”  Having already been to Derry City, Conor was keen to experience what rural County Derry had to offer when he was planning his trip. “I had been to Derry [City] before so I decided I didn’t want to go back through the city again, and I wanted to see rural Northern Ireland as much as I could,” he said. “It was great to come through the county and put places to the names, like Slaughtneil from the GAA side of it. “I loved the shared community spirit as that’s dferent in the north. The word ‘community’ is used a lot more. “I did have a chuckle, though, coming through some towns and seeing the signs from winning the  Tidy Towns’ award in . “When you walk Italy, you get an ancient sense of history. When you walk Ireland, our history is a more recent history.” Conor, along with the EDP, is running a ‘Guess the Steps’ competition. Entry is via donation and can be accessed on the EDP website - www.edp-ambo.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Phil Gordon, who works at Altnagelvin Hospital in Derry, says the ‘milk float’ stereotype is outdated and inaccurate. “There are fantastic cars to drive. People have an image that they’re like a milk float, but they’re very powerful cars and fantastic to drive,” he said. “I’ve been saving about pound, a year since I went electric. I do about , miles a year down to Dublin and between Derry and Letterkenny regularly and it suits me perfectly. googletag.cmd.push “I could never go back to a petrol or diesel car. It’s just frustrating they’re not making it easier for more people to get on board.” While the price of EVs is higher than a standard internal combustion enginecar, Derry man Ronan McElholm says the cost of petrol or diesel often means a saving on electric cars. “There is a massive saving. People look at the price of the car and compare it to their petrol or diesel, but you have to factor in the fuel that you use,” he said. “You could easily spend pound, on diesel in three years and then there’s the service costs. The servicing of an electric car is very minimal. googletag.cmd.push “Most of your breaking is regenerative, so it recharges the batteries and brake pads have been known to last , miles on an electric car. “There isn’t as much wear on brakes or tyres, it doesn’t need serviced as much and when you go to sell it, the residual value of the car will be so much more than any combustion engine car. “People have to look at the bigger picture. I would love to see every car become electric.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

To date, that remains the only such cluster in the Causeway Coast and Glens area identied since contact tracing began on May , which is one of eleven identied across Northern Ireland. A Public Health Agencystatement revealed that Newry, Mourne and Down District Councilhad the highest number of identied clusters, while Mid and East Antrimis next highest. Antrim and Newtownabbey Borough Council,Ards and North Down Borough Council andArmagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council all have one identied cluster of over five people. googletag.cmd.push There have been no large clusters identied in the Derry City and Strabane or Mid Ulster districts, that cover the remainder of County Derry. However, the PHA have also said they have identied  smaller clusters, of less than five people, across Northern Ireland, and said they would continue to publish data each Thursday. A cluster is currently defined as two or more laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID- among iniduals associated with a key setting, with illness onset dates within a  day period. Key settings which have seen clusters to date since May include workplaces, retail or hospitality premises, domestic gatherings, and sporting settings.  googletag.cmd.push COVID- transmission risk is highest in a household setting, and it is to be anticipated that a signicant number of linked cases within households will be identied by efficient contact tracing. It is for this reason that household-linked cases are not reported as clusters. Since July, the averagenumber of close contacts linked to cases has more than doubled. The PHA say the rise may be attributed to the gradual easing of lockdown measures, but may also be explained by relaxing of attitudes to social distancing. Dr Gerry Waldron, Head of Health Protection at the PHA, said: “Cases are occurring in communities across Northern Ireland. This is an important reminder that we must not become complacent – coronavirus remains in circulation, so each of us has a responsibility to take steps to help keep ourselves and those around us safe. “Maintain social distancing, wash your hands regularly, and get testedyou display any symptoms of coronavirus. You can also download the StopCOVID NI contact tracing app. “This disease has the potential to make its presence felt in any community, as we have seen with clusters appearing across a number of council districts. “Everyone should act on the basis that it might potentially be in your neighbourhood right now, rather than waiting for it to emerge in your local area or for rumours to circulate before taking steps to help protect yourself and others. That’s why following the public health advice remains vitally important. You can spread the virus evenyou dont have symptoms, so taking these steps and exercising good hygiene practices will help prevent cases and reduce the number of clusters. Our analysis of clusters to date has shown that they have been associated with both workplaces and in the community, such as domestic gatherings and in hospitality and sporting settings. “Clusters are managed through the contact tracing programme, and where we need to advise or inform the public of any increased risk to public health we will do so in a timely manner. Dr Waldron added: “Speculation around current clusters of COVID- across Northern Ireland is not helpful. “We will not be commenting on inidual cases of COVID- or going into the detail of every incident that emerges, as this could lead to people being identied, create stigma and focus attention on iniduals, families or groups, and therefore deter others with symptoms coming forward to be tested.” Everyone with symptoms of coronavirus can book a free test. If anyone is concerned that they are experiencing any of the symptoms of coronavirus, they must self-isolate and arrange a test as soon as possible.

To date, that remains the only such cluster in the Causeway Coast and Glens area identied since contact tracing began on May , which is one of eleven identied across Northern Ireland. A Public Health Agencystatement revealed that Newry, Mourne and Down District Councilhad the highest number of identied clusters, while Mid and East Antrimis next highest. Antrim and Newtownabbey Borough Council,Ards and North Down Borough Council andArmagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council all have one identied cluster of over five people. googletag.cmd.push There have been no large clusters identied in the Derry City and Strabane or Mid Ulster districts, that cover the remainder of County Derry. However, the PHA have also said they have identied  smaller clusters, of less than five people, across Northern Ireland, and said they would continue to publish data each Thursday. A cluster is currently defined as two or more laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID- among iniduals associated with a key setting, with illness onset dates within a  day period. Key settings which have seen clusters to date since May include workplaces, retail or hospitality premises, domestic gatherings, and sporting settings.  googletag.cmd.push COVID- transmission risk is highest in a household setting, and it is to be anticipated that a signicant number of linked cases within households will be identied by efficient contact tracing. It is for this reason that household-linked cases are not reported as clusters. Since July, the averagenumber of close contacts linked to cases has more than doubled. The PHA say the rise may be attributed to the gradual easing of lockdown measures, but may also be explained by relaxing of attitudes to social distancing. Dr Gerry Waldron, Head of Health Protection at the PHA, said: “Cases are occurring in communities across Northern Ireland. This is an important reminder that we must not become complacent – coronavirus remains in circulation, so each of us has a responsibility to take steps to help keep ourselves and those around us safe. “Maintain social distancing, wash your hands regularly, and get testedyou display any symptoms of coronavirus. You can also download the StopCOVID NI contact tracing app. “This disease has the potential to make its presence felt in any community, as we have seen with clusters appearing across a number of council districts. “Everyone should act on the basis that it might potentially be in your neighbourhood right now, rather than waiting for it to emerge in your local area or for rumours to circulate before taking steps to help protect yourself and others. That’s why following the public health advice remains vitally important. You can spread the virus evenyou dont have symptoms, so taking these steps and exercising good hygiene practices will help prevent cases and reduce the number of clusters. Our analysis of clusters to date has shown that they have been associated with both workplaces and in the community, such as domestic gatherings and in hospitality and sporting settings. “Clusters are managed through the contact tracing programme, and where we need to advise or inform the public of any increased risk to public health we will do so in a timely manner. Dr Waldron added: “Speculation around current clusters of COVID- across Northern Ireland is not helpful. “We will not be commenting on inidual cases of COVID- or going into the detail of every incident that emerges, as this could lead to people being identied, create stigma and focus attention on iniduals, families or groups, and therefore deter others with symptoms coming forward to be tested.” Everyone with symptoms of coronavirus can book a free test. If anyone is concerned that they are experiencing any of the symptoms of coronavirus, they must self-isolate and arrange a test as soon as possible.

Stendhal Festival Presents: Unlocked, due to take place in Limavady in the last week of August, would have been the first ever series of socially distant outdoor music gigs in Northern Ireland. However, after receiving advice from the Chief Medical Officer and Chief Scientic Advisor, organisers have had no choice but to cancel the event. The advice said the festival was likely to cause a signicant risk to public health. A statement from the festivals Board of Directors said they were disappointed with the decision, but that it left them with no choice. googletag.cmd.push As a result of this advice from the CMO and CSA and due to the fact that the R rate is on the rise along with the number of localised clusters and confirmed cases across Northern Ireland, we have no alternative but to make the decision to cancel all of the proposed events, a spokesperson said. From the outset we said that while we would do everything within our power to get the events approved, we would always put public health first and act on guidance provided by Government. We are disappointed for all the acts on the bill who were hoping to get back on stage doing what they do best, for the people who supported us and believed in us by purchasing tickets, for those who were to be involved in the production element of the festival, the traders and the event staff who were hoping to secure some income from the events. googletag.cmd.push We would like to thank everyone who supported us on this quest to get festivals back on the agenda post lock-down, in particular our amazing team of volunteers and our local Councillors in Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council, who made a brave decision to support our endeavours in June. We await more detailed feedback on our Risk Assessment and Event Plan from the Department of Health in the hope that further clarity can be gained on the specic threats outdoor gatherings may pose to the public. These documents can still help be a factor in getting outdoor gigs back on the agenda,not for us now, for others in the arts and music industry going forward. The organisers said refunds for tickets would be available on the website by the end of the week.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Ryan OrsquoHiggins opened the scoring early on before Jerome Johnston and Marty Devlin replied for the Ulster champions.The industrious Paddy Sheridan levelled matters in the tenth minute with Martin McCourt giving the Magpies the slightest lead by the water break.Both sides continued to probe before half time with scores hard to come by. Miceal Rooney put Kilcoo two clear five minutes from the short whistle, while OrsquoHiggins scored a beauty right on half time to leave it - to - to Mickey Moranrsquos side.The lsquoFord got the best possible start to the second half with Conor Maginn and substitute Cathal Burns finding their range to put them ahead. It was tit for tat for the next phase of the game and with ten minutes left Kilcoo lead by one thanks to scores from Jerome Johnston, Paul Greenan and Conor Laverty.The games turning point came on the rd minute. A brilliant move involving Darragh OrsquoHanlon, Ryan Johnston and Miceal Rooney placed the ing Ceilum Doherty in and he palmed home from close range.The home side never gave in though and showed great resolve, Marc Reid even coming up to point from distance in what was a superb inidual score and one of the highlights of the game.But the Magpies held out, Doherty adding a good score to seal the three-point victory margin.Bryansford: Marc Reid , Stephen Toner, Ryan McDonald, Aaron McDonald, Timmy Hanna, Conor Maginn , Danny Savage , Fintan Canavan, Conor Devlin, Corey Laverty, Ryan OrsquoHiggins , Paddy Sheridan , Thomas McAnerney, David McKenna, Daniel McDonald.Subs used: Cathal Burns , Chris Clarke , Jack Maginn, Niall OrsquoHiggins, Lewis Casement.Cill Chua: Martin McCourt , Niall Branagan, Ryan McEvoy, Tiernan Fettes, Miceal Rooney , Darryl Branagan, Eugene Branagan, Darragh OrsquoHanlon, Paul Greenan , Shealan Johnston, Jerome Johnston , Conor Laverty , Martin Devlin , Ryan Johnston, Niall McEvoy.Subs used:Ceilum Doherty , Felim McGreevy.Referee: Neil Cousins .Bryansford -Cill Chua -ACFL DIVISION A.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5th August 2020 Downpatrick.jpg","title":"Downpatrick motorists facing further disruption  ","story":"MOTORISTS are bracing themselves for five weeks of town centre disruption in Downpatrick.Work on a pound, sewer improvement scheme starts next week, with NI Water contractors focusing on key areas.They include New Bridge Street, Church Street, Bridge Street, Saul Street, Saul Road, Marian Park, Drumlin Park, Scotch Street, Market Street, Market Lane, Stream Street, Racecourse Hill, Ardglass Road, Edward Street, Knocknashinna Road and the Knockchree Road.A number of short lane closures are expected, with two-way traffic maintained at all locations using temporary traffic controls.Vehicular access for residents and businesses will also be maintained as far as possible but there may be some slight delays according to NI Water which has confirmed that pedestrian access will be available at all times. Parking restrictions will also be in place around the working areas.Ni Water says the investment is part of a programme of work to improve the existing sewers in Downpatrick, which will enhance the local sewerage infrastructure and reduce the risk of out of sewer flooding.It has confirmed that the essential work will involve repairing existing sewers and will mainly be undertaken using underground trenchless techniques, which will signicantly reduce the duration and disruption of the programme.But NI Water is warning that it will be necessary to undertake lsquoopen-digrsquo repairs at some locations due to the condition of the existing sewers.The organisation says that this particular aspect of the work is expected to last just one or two days with contractors also working in the evening, with every effort being made to minimise disruption.ldquoAppropriate traffic management and signage will be in place as the work progresses, said a NI Water spokeswoman.ldquoThe majority of the works will be undertaken during normal working hours. However, to reduce disruption to businesses and the public, some night-time works will be required at key locations.The work will take place at ious locations around the Downpatrick area, including some of the main streets within the town centre.NI Water has confirmed that the contractor working on the Downpatrick scheme mdash Geda Construction mdash will liaise with any affected businesses and properties.The spokeswoman added: ldquoWe appreciate that this work is disruptive and would like to thank the public in advance for their patience as we complete these essential improvement works.ldquoWe are all practising social distancing and our priority is to keep customers and colleagues safe. Please keep your distance and our workers will carry on with their essential work for you.South Down MLA Colin McGrath has met with NI Water officials ahead of work starting in Downpatrick, highlighting the need for communication with the community and the need to complete the scheme quickly.He said it was imperative that consideration was given to the works being done in the evening and at weekends to ensure that the level of public disruption was kept to as low a level as possible.ldquoI canrsquot think of a time in recent memory when Downpatrick has suffered road works after road works than has happened over the past few years, the MLA continued. ldquoIf the public is frustrated by this, it is entirely understandable and entirely justied.ldquoThe past few months have been incredibly worrying and stressful and people are finally able to step out of their homes. Shielding finally came to a end last week and the most vulnerable in our society are able to take those first tentative steps out of their homes again.

The original proposal was to end the scheme on August .Downpatrick councillors Gareth Sharvin mdash who initially proposed the free parking initiative ndash and Oonagh Hanlon have welcomed the extension of the free parking scheme.Cllr Sharvinrsquos suggestion was tabled at the June meeting of the local authorityrsquos Strategic, Policy and Resources when it was also agreed to review the

heartened by the usage, admitting that he did receive some feedback that there were some all-day parkers taking up vital spaces which would have had a negative impact on our local businesses.Agreement to extend the free parking initiative was accepted by the local authority on Monday following a proposal by Cllr Sharvin.ldquoThe near eight weeks of free car parking have been a great benefit to

not hesitate to call on the council to reconsider the car parking charges again,traders feel it is impacting on them signicantly during this continuing pandemic.Cllr Hanlon said while free parking had been extended, it was important that the public remembered that charges would be introduced shortly.However, she expressed disappointment at the lack of signs informing people that parking is free which confused some shoppers.Cllr Hanlon said a number drivers contacted her regarding the issuing of enforcement tickets whilst using the car parks for minor offences.She continued: ldquoThis, in my

Hannarsquos training regime, which included running upwards of  miles a week near his home on the Slieve Croob, gave him the strength to tackle back-to-back races.So after the lung-bursting steepness of Saturday, Sunday morning at :am brought the challenge of the Fletta Trail over close to half-marathon distance with climbing and descending back to the starting point in the village of Malonno.Francesco Puppi, the local Italian favourite and second in the World Long Distance Championships in Patagonia last November and world champion in , was in the race, fresh after not racing on Saturday.Seasoned Italian international Cesare Maestri was also in the field and he too had not raced the day before.As the race set off, these two were joined at the front by Francersquos Sylvain Cachard. Hanna settled into the next bunch, finding his climbing legs quickly and reached the summit in fourth place over half a minute clear of Martin Dematteis.One of the best climbers in the field, Hanna continues to hone his descending skills too and he held on for a long time on the descent in fourth before being caught by Dematteis.However, he achieved a brilliant fth place finish, taking the scalp of the Aymonod, the winner the day before, and many other top runners..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5th August 2020 United.jpg","title":"United front in drive to restore Downe services  ","story":"HEALTH campaigners have welcomed the new united front in the campaign to restore key services to the Downe Hospital.Politicians, trade unions and the Down Community Health Committee worked alongside each other in lobbying the South Eastern Trust to restore emergency services at the Downpatrick hospital which is scheduled to happen on October .In a throwback to previous campaigns, all of the districtrsquos political parties and trade unions are now working alongside hospital campaigners to secure the future of the Downe and to argue for a range of new services.Campaigners say while they will be keeping a watching brief to ensure that the hospitalrsquos AE reopens in October as planned, they are also conscious of the ongoing province-wide review of urgent and emergency care.The review mdash commissioned by the Department of Health ndash aims to establish a new regional care model for Northern Ireland with any future proposals subject to public consultation.At a socially distanced meeting of the community health group in Killough last week, campaigners said that future proposals for the Downe arising out of the review could be crucial and potentially be the launchpad for a major new battleground.Confirmation of theof emergency services in October comes after it was revealed that over the past five years there has been a % increase in AE attendances at hospitals across Northern Ireland.Signicantly, Department of Health figures reveal that the biggest increase mdash .% mdash was at the Downe, with the number of patients increasing from , to ,.Health campaigners say the figure represents another ldquostrong, persuasive reason why they must continue to fight for a local emergency department which is valued and needed.They are delighted with the plannedof AE services, suggesting that with the fastest growing emergency department in Northern Ireland, there is a ldquostrong, logical statistical argument for not only retaining the service, but enhancing it.Health committee chairman Eamonn McGrady,revealed that analysis of increased attendances at emergency departments shows that the growth area is not Belfast, but at hospitals in the Southern , Northern , Westernand South Easternhealth trusts.He added: ldquoWe know we are not home until the Downersquos emergency department is reopened in October and and we will all be keeping a watching brief.Mrs Anne Trainor said she was ldquomore prepared than ever to work harder for the Downe as she will never be able to repay the debt of gratitude that she owes the hospital and its excellent staff for helping her ill husband.She also described a recent meeting with senior officials from the South Eastern Trust to discuss theof emergency services to the Downpatrick hospital as ldquorobust and revealed she was left perplexed when health minister Robin Swann said health officials would ldquoexplore the feasibility of reopening the department.ldquoThis particular service has been part of the Downe Hospital for years. Its need has been proven. There was no need to explore the feasibility of anything, she said.Mrs Trainor said the outcome of the meeting with health officials was that politicians, the community and trade unions stood together in demanding theof AE provision.She added: ldquoThis very much reminded me of the early days of the hospital campaign where everyone was saying the same thing. We won the case for the Downe but, from day one, administrators started to strip services from it.ldquoOver recent days what has given me the greatest heart has been the reaction of the politicians, the community and trade unions on the Downe Hospital issue.Mrs Trainor said she hopes that the unity will continue, insisting that when it comes to hospital services, the people of Downe are asking for nothing more than parity with those in other areas.ldquoThere has been substantial underfunding in this district for many years and we need parity with everyone  alongside rural proofing as, for those in authority, the centralisation of services is still very much alive. Their attitude is that everything stops in Belfast, she continued.ldquoBut everything does not have to be centralised in the city. The Downe is a beautul hospital but is being totally underused, yet it is one of the most modern of its kind. There is room to expand to increase service provision and we also want more consultants and staff alongside increased investment for student nurses.Mrs Trainor added: ldquoThere is total unity across the community on these issues and a strong defence of the Downe Hospital.ldquoThe hospital is the single biggest issue in our district. There is strength in our unity and togetherness. Itrsquos said that lsquounited we stand, ided we fallrsquo but we have no intention of falling anytime soon..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/11694353.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local servicesThese adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Please try again later.Submitting...But when the News Letter asked the two leadersthey could clearly condemn the harsh Hong Kong law or the Chinese government’s appalling treatment of the Uighur Muslim population and the persecution of other minorities such as Christians, there was silence.Ultimately, the consulate amended its report to remove the claim – but with no explanation as to what had gone on.As that story broke on Tuesday, China’s Belfast consulate was featured in The Times for another reason. The paper’s legal editor reported how the consulate was claiming diplomatic immunity to enable it to build ‘the great wall of Belfast’ around its building – despite that being in clear contravention of planning law. The Times noted that theHigh Court had rejected an injunction application from Belfast City Council on the grounds that diplomatic immunity effectively allowed the consulate to do almost as it liked while remaining immune from legal action.Both incidents highlight a problem which has been festering for almost a decade since Stormont began strategically attempting to impress the Chinese government.In common with many countries, Stormont’sleaders were persuaded to court China for one overwhelming reason: Its growing wealth.With Northern Ireland slow to emerge from the global recession, civil servants, politicians and senior business figures saw that even securing a tiny slice of China’s multiplying prosperity could be transformative to a small region like Northern Ireland.But there were always going to be awkward strings attached to getting close toauthoritarian rulers who lock up their internal critics,persecute religiousminorities, censor the internet and have scant respect for free speech.Whereas in  Peter Robinson was meeting Chinese Christian leaders and referring bluntly to “the persecution suffered by those who are barred from practising their faith by the ruling communist regime”, two years later he and other Stormont ministers were respectfully referring to “the Chinese government” and past criticisms had become muted.Where in the past the Dalai Lama had been welcomed to Stormont with open arms, now the first and deputy first ministers could not find time to meet him when he was in Northern Ireland.In fact, a source with knowledge of events eight years ago said that the breakthrough in the relationship – the powerful Madam Liu Yandong’s visit to Belfast in  – had been a direct reward for Stormont’s decision not to meet the Dali Lama.An inidual present on one of several ministerial visits to China that Martin McGuinness did in passing bring up “in an awkward and almost apologetic way” an elliptical reference to China’s appallinghuman rights abuses – but in a way which appeared to be designed to allow Sinn Féin to say at home that they had done so, rather than as a meaningful attempt to impress his views on senior Communist Party figures.Five years ago the executive approved a ‘China Strategy’ – a demonstration of the unusual effort the devolved administration was focussing on the country.Jonathan Bell, first as a junior minister and then as Enterprise Minister, became avidly enthusiastic about promoting links with China. The former DUP minister seemed to be incessantly flying to China where he appeared to develop high-level connections.Both he and Mr Robinson received honorary professorships from a Chinese university and Mr Bellwas given more than £, as a gt fromChina’s vice-president, something he donated toone of the few aspects of the China-Northern Ireland relationship which was not explicitly about cash, the Confucius Institute at Ulster University which works to strengthen ties with China and to promote Chinese language and culture.A decade ago, the Confucius Institute was described by the then senior Chinese propagandist and Politburo member Li Changchun as “part of China’s foreign propaganda strategy” but ministers embraced it uncritically.In a submission to the first and deputy first minister ahead of their trip to China in , senior official Tim Losty –who since  had been Stormont’s man in Beijing – told them that the purpose of the visit was “to create a relationship with the Chinese government that will assist in enhanced trade, increased investment, increasing the number of Chinese students in NI, creating access to research programmes and funding, enhancing NI’s national brand reputation and contributing to global issues”.\u2028Sections of the submission were blacked out when released to this newspaper, but in more than  pages of legible text there was no evidence of Stormont even considering the potential trade-off it was making – essentially silence on human rights abuses in exchange for material benefits.Politicians and civil servants will argue that as a devolved administration without responsibility for foreign policy, such matters are beyond their ambit, and that China would takeno regard of their views anyway.But that is a deeply imperfect answer. Council chambers and the assembly spend hours debating international relations – whether Israel, foreign wars or US actions – far beyond their responsibilities.And our politicians once did condemn the Chinese government, recognising that to do so was fundamentally dferent to condemning the people of a proud civilisation which over thousands of years has given the world cultural and creative wealth.Northern Ireland is now facing a recession perhaps more terrible than anything ever seen in the modern era and there is a utilitarian argument that queasiness about Uighur Muslims being forcibly sterilised and taken to concentration camps, or iniduals being arrested in Hong Kong for carrying quotes from the Bible, should be set aside and our leaders should simply focus on doing what they can for the people of Northern Ireland.Butthat is Stormont’s strategy, should it not face up to what it is doing  Mammon and morality are uneasy bedfellows.This week showed the dangers into which our leaders are stumbling because even when judged on purely pragmatic grounds, perceivedsubservience to China could be damaging inotherregions.The furore over the Mrs Foster and Ms O’Neill’s alleged comments was widely reported in Hong Kong, a major financial centre, and will also have been fed back to Washington, a big investor now increasingly at iance with Beijing.With a pandemic raging and Brexit looming, politicians and civil servants have limited time for fresh challenges. But either continuing the current strategy or altering it will have major implications.________A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityAs reported in the Penarth Times on Thursday, the town councilsaid the results show ldquowidespread backing for changes.The survey, which attracted  responses, showed  per cent of people thought there should be more outdoor space for pedestrians and businesses.Seventy-five per cent thought parking arrangements needed to change, and  per cent said the town needs to ldquoprepare for the future.Some traders, who oppose the changes ndash specically a one-way traffic system around the town and making Windsor Road and Lower Glebe Street a traffic free zone, have said the questions in the survey were too generalised and misleading.As a result of the survey, Penarth Town Council have proposed the following changes to the original ideas:Windsor Road from Arcot Street to the roundabout as a ldquoshared space for delivery vehicles and buses, with a mph speed limit.Lower Glebe Street as a ldquoshared space for delivery vehicles and disabled bays. Other vehicles should not use Lower Glebe Street as a through road.Bus stops will remain as they are. There were concerns over the impact of a bus stop on Hickman Road for traders, due to air pollution, noise pollution and congestion.A two-way system to remain on Stanwell Road from the library to the traffic lights, to allow easy access to the bus stop on Rectory Road and to prevent congestion and ldquorat running through Hickman Road and Arcot Street. A two-way system to also remain from Windsor Road to Railway Terrace.The number of parking bays has also changed. There will now be  extra bays proposed, with  of them on Plassey Street.The leader of the town council, Cllr Rhiannon Birch, explained the findings and what happens next.ldquoEven before Covid-, town centres across the country were facing issues, including the need to modernise infrastructure, and the impact of online shopping, she said. ldquoThe current pandemic has added to the scale of the challenge.ldquoThe consultation shows that a clear majority recognise the need for a degree of change in the town centre, both for it to survive in the present and to thrive in future.ldquoThe results call for the establishment of a greater degree of safe space and proposals which increase a degree of pedestrianisation whilst also increasing parking spaces.ldquoThe results show substantial agreement on these aims. Reflecting this widespread and clear response, Penarth Town Council calls on our partners in the Vale of Glamorgan Council to embrace the results and recommendations.ldquoSpecically, Penarth Town Council believes that creating a safer environment through the closure of Windsor Road to traffic for part of the day, between Arcot Street and the roundabout, including the Lower Glebe Street, would be the best way to ensure that people can feel confident about shopping safely. It would allow safe use of the space in front of shops, bars, cafes and restaurants.ldquoIt also lessens the need for one-way systems on pavements for pedestrians, which are perplexing for many and hard to implement. These proposals can be achieved in a way which also increases the amount of parking spaces available.The results will now be put to the Vales Planning Committee for consultation.For more information, visit https:www.penarthtowncouncil.gov.uk news survey-results Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.
