Among the tweets were ones that pictured Jarrett next to a character from Planet of the Apes, and a doctored image of Whoopie Goldberg wearing a t-shirt that shows Trump shooting himself in the head      Despite apologizing for her previous comments about George Soros and Valerie Jarrett, Barr retweeted a stream of content that backed her remarks while wading into other right-wing causes and conspiracies      Barr also said she thought former Obama adviser Valerie Jarrett was white when she penned the racist tweet that got her show pulled from television          Barr said she though Jarrett \u0027was Jewish and Persian\u0027 amid a bizarre flurry tweets penned late on Tuesday night          Valerie Jarrett was born in Iran but both of her parents are African American, and her great-grandfather was the first credited African American architect. She appeared on MSNBC on Tuesday (pictured) to lay blame for Barr\u0027s rhetoric at the feet of President Trump, saying: \u0027The tone comes from the top\u0027          The shamed star also blamed her racist rant on sleeping pill Ambien. Users have previously reported going into blackouts and performing complex actions such as driving and making food without recalling it           Roseanne\u0027s show was the most viewed program on ABC before it was cancelled over a tweet in which she said Jarrett was the lovechild of the \u0027Muslim Brotherhood and Planet of the Apes\u0027          Actor John Goodman, 65, stepped out to walk his dog in New Orleans on Tuesday soon after news broke that his show \u0027Roseanne\u0027 had been canceled because of his castmate Roseanne Barr\u0027s racist tweets          She then went on to rant about what she described as a Soros plot to overthrow America \u0027by buyingbacking candidates 4 local district attorney races who will ignore US law \u0026amp favor \u0027feelings\u0027 instead-and call everyone who is alarmed by that \u0027racist\u0027.\u0027Following on from that, she called on Americans to unite against his narrative while throwing a reference to MK Ultra, a discontinued CIA program that right-wing conspiracy theorists believe is still ongoing, into the mix           It was during this rant that Barr made the comment \u0027muslim brotherhood and planet of the apes had a babyvj\u0027, using Valerie Jarrett\u0027s initials, that would see her show axed.Barr subsequently deleted the tweet but not before it had been copied and shared across social media, leading to swift calls for her show to be pulled from the air.          After Barr\u0027s now-infamous Planet of the Apes tweet had been sent, Clinton replied around 9am to say that she was not in fact married to a Soros, though she admired the work his foundation does.Barr subsequently sent a Tweet apologizing to Clinton for the mistake, though launched another broadside at Soros by claiming he was a \u0027Nazi\u0027 who betrayed Jews during the holocaust.The actress also launched a salvo at Clinton\u0027s actual husband, Marc Mezvinsky, saying: \u0027HER HUSBAND IS THE SON OF A CORRUPT SENATOR.\u0027Clinton\u0027s father-in-law is a former congressman and convicted felon who in March of 2001 plead guilty to 31 of 69 felony charges of mail, bank and wire fraud.            But as the Clinton saga wound to a close Barr\u0027s tweet about Jarrett was catching a massive amount of attention, forcing the actress to brand her remark \u0027a joke\u0027.She also defended herself against allegations of racism by countering that Islam \u0027is not a race\u0027.The remarks were not enough, however, and around an hour later she offered a full apology to Jarrett and announced that she would be leaving Twitter.           Shortly after midday Wanda Sykes, an African-American comedian and writer working on the Roseanne reboot, announced that she was walking away from the program.Around an hour later ABC broke its silence over the controversy to say that Roseanne was being cancelled.We now know that the network spent this time contacting Jarrett to apologize and inform her of the cancellation.Barr later said that the network had bowed to pressure amid calls for a boycott of Roseanne\u0027s advertisers, though ABC did not immediately respond to her remark.In its statement, ABC said Roseanne\u0027s remark was \u0027abhorrent, repugnant and inconsistent with our values\u0027.       Soon after the news broke, Goodman, who played Barr\u0027s husband Dan on the TV show, was spotted looking very glum as he walked his dog          Goodman, 65, is yet to offer any comment on Barr\u0027s tweets or their show being axed          Gilbert, who played Darlene Conner on the series, had earlier slammed Barr\u0027s tweets as \u0027abhorrent\u0027  Barr also lashed out at former costar Sara Gilbert for her reaction to the racism row, in which Gilbert called her comments \u0027abhorrent\u0027 and \u0027disappointing\u0027, by saying \u0027wow! unreal\u0027  Bar clapped back at Michael Fishman, who played DJ Conner for the entirety of the series and was featured in the revival with a biracial daughter, accusing him of throwing her under a bus      Barr was widely condemned after she tweeted that Jarrett looked like \u0027Muslim brotherhood \u0026amp planet of the apes had a baby\u0027.Jarrett responded to the ordeal when she spoke at a town hall on MSNBC called \u0027Everyday Racism in America\u0027 later on Tuesday. She revealed that Disney CEO Bob Iger had called her to apologize.\u0027He wanted me to know before he made it public that he was canceling the show,\u0027 she said. \u0027First of all, I think we have to turn it into a teaching moment. I\u0027m fine. I\u0027m worried about all the people out there who don\u0027t have a circle of friends and followers coming to their defense. \u0027The person walking down the street minding their own business and they see someone clinging to their purse or walk across the street... or every black parent I know who has a boy who has to sit down and have a conversation, the talk as we call it.\u0027Those ordinary examples of racism that happen every single day.\u0027     ABC has decided to cancel Roseanne Barr\u0027s television show just hours after the comedian posted a racist tweet about Valerie Jarrett          \u0027We have decided to cancel her show,\u0027 Channing Dungey, President of ABC Entertainment, announced on Tuesday afternoon           Disney CEO Bob Iger  tweeted about ABC\u0027s decision, saying: \u0027There was only one thing to do here, and that was the right thing.\u0027 Disney owns ABC Television Group   Barr came under fire for a racist tweet about Valerie Jarrett during an unhinged rant on Tuesday morning          Many on Twitter were appalled by Barr\u0027s tweet, which was in response to an article from a conspiracy website The Disney CEO also tweeted about the decision to terminate the show, saying: \u0027There was only one thing to do here, and that was the right thing.\u0027Shortly after Barr\u0027s show was cancelled, talent agency ICM Partners revealed they were dropping her as a client. \u0027We are all greatly distressed by the disgraceful and unacceptable tweet from Roseanne Barr this morning,\u0027 ICM said in an internal note to employees that was obtained by the Hollywood Reporter. \u0027What she wrote is antithetical to our core values, both as iniduals and as an agency.\u0027 \u0027Consequently, we have notified her that we will not represent her. Effective immediately, Roseanne Barr is no longer a client.\u0027 It appears the cancellation of the show will also affect the cast\u0027s Emmy prospects, as ABC revealed it is suspending the show\u0027s FYC (For Your Consideration) campaign. Other networks including Viacom also dropped reruns of the original Roseanne as the industry turned its back on the show and its star performer. The swift fallout from the tweet began when Wanda Sykes  quit her role as the show\u0027s consulting producer and celebrities condemned Barr\u0027s words.   Emma Kenney, who played Sara Gilbert\u0027s daughter on the show, also revealed on Twitter that she planned to quit before finding out the show had been cancelled. \u0027I am hurt, embarrassed, and disappointed. The racist and distasteful comments from Roseanne are inexcusable,\u0027 the 18-year-old wrote. \u0027As I called my manager to quit working on Roseanne, I was told it was cancelled. I feel so empowered by @iamwandasykes , Channing Dungey and anyone at ABC standing up for morals and abuse of power. Bullies will NEVER win.\u0027Tom Arnold, who co-starred on the show from 1989 to 1993 and was married to Barr from 1990 to 1994, praised the decision to cancel the show.   \u0027Ton of respect for Bob Iger. Tough decision with financial consequences for his company but right for America,\u0027 he wrote. Michael Fishman, who played DJ Conner for the entirety of the series and was featured in the revival with a biracial daughter, said he was \u0027devastated\u0027. \u0027Today is one of the hardest days of my life. I feel devastated, not for the end of the Roseanne show, but for all those who poured their hearts and souls into our jobs, and the audience that welcomed us into their home,\u0027 he wrote on Twitter. Comedian Wanda Sykes had earlier revealed she would not return to the show following the comedian\u0027s racist tweet about Valerie Jarrett (Pictured L-R: Sykes, Russell Peters, Barr, JB Smoove, Keenen Ivory Wayans in 2014)          Sykes, a consulting producer for Barr\u0027s eponymous show on ABC, revealed the news on Twitter          Emma Kenney, who played Sara Gilbert\u0027s daughter on the show, revealed on Twitter that she planned to quit before finding out the show had been cancelled           Tom Arnold, who co-starred on the show from 1989 to 1993 and was married to Barr from 1990 to 1994, praised the decision to cancel the showFishman said he condemned Roseanne\u0027s statement \u0027vehemently\u0027, saying they were \u0027reprehensible and intolerable\u0027 and \u0027truly offensive\u0027.  \u0027My character was designed to represent the inclusive nature of my views. To represent potions of society often marginalized,\u0027 he wrote. \u0027In this moment it is important to be clear. We must stand up against bias, hatred, bigotry, and ignorance to make society a better place for all.\u0027  Many called on ABC to fire Barr or drop the show as others criticized the broadcast network for its enduring silence amid recent controversies with the comedian.Others were skeptical that ABC would dare touch the hit series, which is the third highest-rated show this year following Sunday Night Football and This Is Us.The revival of Roseanne was a ratings juggernaut when it premiered on ABC to a whopping 25 million viewers in April.It\u0027s surprising success even elicited a congratulatory phone call and tweet from President Donald Trump. Ratings dropped steadily thereafter, with last week\u0027s season finale garnering 10.33 million viewers.ABC  initially ordered 13 episodes for the second season and said the show would move away from its controversial politics and focus on family.    Roseanne\u0027s mention of the \u0027Muslim brotherhood\u0027 seems to be due to the long-running conspiracy theory that Jarrett is Muslim, despite there being no supporting evidence           She also retweeted an article with the headline: \u0027Valerie Jarrett...was her mommy a Commie?\u0027The show most recently came under fire for featuring an episode in which Barr\u0027s character believes her new Muslim neighbors are terrorists. Roseanne\u0027s mention of the \u0027Muslim brotherhood\u0027 in her Tuesday tweet seems to be due to the long-running conspiracy theory that Jarrett is Muslim. Jarrett, who was Obama\u0027s senior adviser during his presidency, was born in Iran to American parents and lived in Shiraz for six years. The family had moved to Iran because her father was part of a program that sent American physicians to help developing countries. He ran a children\u0027s hospital.There has never been any indication that Jarrett or her parents are Muslim.  Barr later claimed the comment was a \u0027joke\u0027 when she was called out on Twitter by CNN reporter Andrew Kaczynski. \u0027ABC is doing their best to ignore some of these statements from Roseanne and she is making it really hard for them by taking it to the next level here,\u0027 he wrote. After Roseanne responds, Kaczynski replied: \u0027understand it\u0027s a joke, but can you see why some people think comparing a black woman to Planet of the Apes might be racist and find the Muslim Brotherhood reference to be conspiratorial and Islamophobic?\u0027  Caravans seen outside Thwaites Brewery as 100 travellers take overMoment hero scales Parisian building to rescue dangling childHeart-warming moment boy helps elderly woman get up the stairsWomen throw mugs of tea and council bins at each other in street brawlGun jam saves oblivious men from being shot in the backEuphoric moment colleagues of Arkady Babchenko see him aliveSausage dog with punctured windpipe balloons three times its sizeShocking bodycam footage shows police punching woman at beachWildwood police confront Emily Weinman for drinking on the beachYoung boy tries multiple times to give President Trump a hugValerie Jarrett says government will only be as good as we make it    A number of stars have since condemned Barr for the tweet, including Patricia Arquette and Julianne Moore. Rev Al Sharpton used ABC to fire Barr, while Rosie O\u0027Donnell defended her          Not everyone was happy with ABC\u0027s decision to cancel the show. Some stood by in their support for Barr, while others said the network should have continued without her A number of celebrities  also condemned Barr for the tweet, with some urging ABC to fire her from the show completely.\u0027I am repulsed that Valerie Jarret had that racist and bigoted \u0027joke\u0027 made at her expense and I am sickened that any Black or Muslim person has to keep hearing this sickness in 2018,\u0027 Patricia Arquette tweeted. \u0027You can take @RoseanneOnABC out of racism but you can\u0027t take the racism out of @therealroseanne,\u0027 Don Cheadle wrote. \u0027I told y\u0027all about Roseanne. I told you. So,\u0027 author Roxane Gay added, to which Julianne Moore replied: \u0027Yes you did. #FireRoseanne.\u0027 Reverend Al Sharpton also criticized the comedian and called on ABC to \u0027take action now\u0027. \u0027The comparison by Rosanne Barr on ABC of Former Obama aide, Valerie Jarrett to an APE is racist and inexcusable,\u0027 he tweeted. Tomi Lahren was a rare prominent conservative voice to hit out at Roseanne. \u0027What Roseanne said was wrong,\u0027 she tweeted. \u0027I\u0027m sure she knows that. She made a mistake.\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t know why fellow conservatives are playing mental gymnastics trying to justify it. Come on. Wrong is wrong.\u0027 Only Rosie O\u0027Donnell appeared to lend some support to Roseanne, writing that she loved her \u0027quite a bit\u0027. \u0027The comment Roseanne tweeted was racist and childish and beneath her best self,\u0027 O\u0027Donnell wrote. \u0027She has apologized. Twitter is a dangerous place.\u0027 Caravans seen outside Thwaites Brewery as 100 travellers take overMoment hero scales Parisian building to rescue dangling childHeart-warming moment boy helps elderly woman get up the stairsSausage dog with punctured windpipe balloons three times its sizeShocking bodycam footage shows police punching woman at beachWildwood police confront Emily Weinman for drinking on the beachWomen throw mugs of tea and council bins at each other in street brawlGun jam saves oblivious men from being shot in the backEuphoric moment colleagues of Arkady Babchenko see him aliveYoung boy tries multiple times to give President Trump a hugValerie Jarrett says government will only be as good as we make it    Barr came under fire on the very night the revival of Roseanne premiered in April when she accused Parkland shooting survivor David Hogg of giving a \u0027Nazi Salute\u0027.Barr swiftly took the tweet down and claimed that she had seen a \u0027doctored\u0027 image of Hogg. But internet sleuths found a grab of Barr\u0027s original tweet, which revealed she was commenting on picture of Hogg raising his fist at the March For Our Lives rally. That same week, Barr also made headlines when she tweeted about a bizarre right-wing conspiracy theory claiming Trump broke up a pedophile ring created by Democratic politicians.  Barr claimed that it was Trump who had freed \u0027so many children held in bondage to pimps all over this world\u0027.           In 2015 Barr made headlines after tweeting she \u0027hope UC Davis gets nuked\u0027 after the student body voted to est from companies that have ties to Israel\u0027He has broken up trafficking rings in high places everywhere. notice that. I disagree on some things, but give him benefit of doubt-4 now,\u0027 she added. The tweet was similar to when, in 2015, Barr revealed that she believed the Pizzagate conspiracy theory that Hillary Clinton was running a child sex-ring in a pizza shop. \u0027Americans! The reason #DEMOCRATS aren\u0027t approving #Sessions is bc he will prosecure #HRC – and make arrests over PedoGate RT THIS!! WAKE UP!!\u0027Barr was slammed and derided for the tweets. She later apologized for mentioning child trafficking and said Twitter was \u0027not the place for it\u0027. In 2015 Barr made headlines after tweeting she \u0027hope all the jews leave UC Davis and then it gets nuked!\u0027 after the student body voted to est from companies that have ties to Israel           In 2012 the comedian came under fire after she spoke out against transgender bathroom rightsIn 2012 the comedian came under fire after she spoke out against transgender bathroom rights. \u0027Women do not want your penises forced in their faces or in private bathrooms. Respect that,\u0027 she wrote.  After the comedian\u0027s most recent Twitter controversies came to light, Walt Disney President Ben Sherwood responded that \u0027you can\u0027t control Roseanne Barr\u0027.\u0027Many who have tried have failed. She\u0027s the one and only,\u0027 he added. But as Tuesday\u0027s news has proved, you can still cancel here.                         \u0027You\u0027re a racist pig \u0026amp ABC should be ashamed that they give you a platform,\u0027 another added. Roseanne later tweeted, in an attempt to defend herself, that \u0027Islam is not a race\u0027. \u0027Islam includes EVERY RACE of people,\u0027 she added, still without acknowledging the fact that there is no evidence Jarrett has ties to the Islamic faith. She also retweeted an article whose headline read: \u0027Valerie Jarrett...was her mommy a Commie?\u0027 About an hour later, Roseanne apologized and said she was leaving Twitter.     \u0027I apologize to Valerie Jarrett and to all Americans,\u0027 she wrote in a separate tweet. \u0027I am truly sorry for making a bad joke about her politics and her looks. I should have known better. Forgive me-my joke was in bad taste.\u0027         Caravans seen outside Thwaites Brewery as 100 travellers take overMoment hero scales Parisian building to rescue dangling childHeart-warming moment boy helps elderly woman get up the stairsSausage dog with punctured windpipe balloons three times its sizeShocking bodycam footage shows police punching woman at beachWildwood police confront Emily Weinman for drinking on the beachWomen throw mugs of tea and council bins at each other in street brawlGun jam saves oblivious men from being shot in the backEuphoric moment colleagues of Arkady Babchenko see him aliveYoung boy tries multiple times to give President Trump a hugValerie Jarrett says government will only be as good as we make it    Much like its revival, Roseanne was an almost instant success when it premiered in 1988 and quickly became the umber one show on television It also turned Barr, who previously performed stand-up comedy on Johnny Carson\u0027s Tonight Show, into a household name. The show ran for nine seasons, featuring numerous storylines that were rare for network sitcoms in the nineties.   The show  tackled episodes that focused on taboo topics for the times like homophobia, abortion, teen pregnancy, masturbation, and domestic abuse.Barr, who has a lesbian sister and a gay brother, also made sure to feature a number of LGBT characters on the show. One episode of the show even featured Roseanne contemplating whether or not she should have an abortion, while others discussed previously taboo topics like masturbation.           The show ran for nine seasons, featuring numerous storylines that were rare for network sitcoms in the nineties - such as issues paying bills and homophobia The show won both Barr and Laurie Metcalf, who played her sister, respective Emmy Awards for Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress. It also won the prestigious Peabody Award in 1992. ABC announced in May 2017 that it planned to do a revival of the beloved series, which aired in March of the following year. The news garnered controversy from the beginning when it was revealed Roseanne would return as a pro-Trump grandmother. It also featured episodes that include her husband Dan, played by John Goodman, losing his job to an illegal immigrant and Roseanne\u0027s fears after finding out her new next-door neighbors are Muslim.

And the thing that really matters for people is to feel that they matter.\u0027For what would every cancer patient want? To know that the best, the latest science was being used and available for them.\u0027Her daughter Jess added: \u0027The only time I\u0027ve seen mum cry since she got ill, she was sat in the waiting room and had what she described as the absolutely heartbreaking realisation that those who had that privilege of access or income may well live longer because of that and those that didn\u0027t may well die much sooner because of it.    Dame Tessa is pictured with her daughter Jess (right) and her daughter-in-law Ella Mills (left, holding Jess\u0027 child)\u0027And in her words, that is just the most despicable example of inequality. In those moments, her mission was really identified.\u0027The Health Secretary admitted that there was much about the trials he wasn\u0027t aware of until Dame Tessa brought it to his attention.\u0027There is so much we can do with the data, on the adaptive trials that I didn\u0027t know much about until Tessa brought that to my attention. But there is so much we can do.\u0027The documentary also includes a number of interviews with doctors and academics as well as patients who have been diagnosed with the same aggressive form of brain cancer as Dame Tessa.

I can\u0027t tell you how excited we are that the fence is down.\u0027Our fear now is that it will put it back up again - we just hope it is gone for good.\u0027I was nervous about coming to the press but I am so glad we did now - it may have saved us months of dispute.\u0027Thomas and Rebekah moved into the £220,000 four-bedroom property on Persimmon Homes\u0027s Brook View development just before Christmas.They arrived home from their honeymoon earlier this month to find their home\u0027s outlook blocked by the intrusive wooden panel.And they said that since their return, their lives had been ruined by the fence - and they even considered moving out.  The couple moved into the £220,000 four-bedroom home just before Christmas last year and found the wall metres away from the side of their home when they returned from honeymoon Furious Thomas thought the fence was erected by the owner of nearby Upper Mickle Hay Farm in a dispute with Persimmon over land borders.However, Persimmon insisted that none of its development encroaches on land it does not already own.Thomas said before the wall was toppled: \u0027This was our dream home and now it\u0027s turned into a nightmare - it feels like we are imprisoned in our own house by this fence.\u0027We are being held hostage in a land dispute which is nothing to do with us.\u0027Rebekah and I have just started our own business and had to fight to get a mortgage and then to get this house.\u0027We bought it because of the view which has now been replaced by a huge wooden fence nailed to our own little one.          The wall has fallen: The Entwistle\u0027s home in Blackburn is pictured without the 6ft around it           The couple said they are fearful the wall could be put back up again but a planning meeting will decide whether it was a planning breach or not \u0027Rebekah is always in tears. She is in despair - there was no warning and the fence just appeared.\u0027It is 2ft from our front window and front door - it\u0027s like having the Berlin Wall in front of our home.\u0027 Thomas and his wife, who married in July, said they would not have even considered the property if they had known the trouble in store for them.Thomas said: \u0027We\u0027re not even sure we want to live here now.\u0027Even if the fence gets taken down there is no guarantee it won\u0027t come back later or even be extended around the back - we are in fear of that.\u0027The couple, who had moved from rented accommodation, considered employing their own solicitor.          The wooden structure is pictured on the ground after developers took it down with the help of local council officials Thomas added: \u0027At first I was tearful but now I\u0027m angry.\u0027We specifically bought this house, beating off a lot of competition, for its beautiful views and now they\u0027ve gone.\u0027We now keep the curtains closed in the front room and spend most of our time upstairs - Rebekah is too upset to be in the living room.\u0027We just want it sorted out quickly and permanently so we can enjoy our new home in peace.\u0027          Mr Entwistle was shocked to find that the enormous fence stands just two feet from his living room windowDevelopers Persimmon removed the fence after Blackburn with Darwen Council planning officials visited and told the firm the fence was constructed on land they owned.The council officials will now see if it was in breach of planning regulations.A spokesman for Persimmon Homes said: \u0027Our staff have taken down the fence after consultation with council planning officers.\u0027Local councillor Sylvia Liddle said: \u0027I am delighted for this young couple who have been so distressed - it is a victory for common sense and we now need to ensure it is a permanent solution.\u0027A spokeswoman for the farmer\u0027s land agent Gary Hoerty Associates of Grindleton declined to comment.A spokesman for Persimmon Homes said: \u0027We are confident none of our development encroaches on land not legitimately within our ownership.

It would involve using technology and ‘trusted trader’ arrangements to keep customs checks to an absolute minimum.Last week Jon Thompson, the chief executive of HMRC, told MPs that Max Fac would cost between £17billion and £20billion and take up to three years to bring in. He also told the Treasury committee yesterday that under the plan, customs declarations would cost businesses an average of £13billion a year, with billions more to be added for EU rules of origin checks.But last night Dr Gudgin, a member of the 50-strong group of pro-Leave academics Briefings for Brexit, said the figure was ‘hugely inflated’. Along with John Mills, chairman of retailer JML and chairman of Labour Leave, he warned that no Government policy decisions should be made on the basis of the HMRC’s ‘shoddy calculations’.They said: ‘The Treasury and HMRC have taken to presenting hugely negative calculations of the economic impact of Brexit without formal analyses that can be checked for accuracy.

About 80 per cent of these movements are on World Trade Organisation terms outside customs unions or free trade areas.          Jon Thompson, the chief executive of HMRC, told MPs that Max Fac would cost between £17billion and £20billion‘The only additional paperwork requirements for business from being outside rather than inside the customs union are the production of certificates of origin and any necessary compliance certification. This can’t possibly cost £7billion a year or anything like it for firms trading with the EU after Brexit.‘As things stand at the moment inside the customs union all shipments from the UK to the EU27 involve invoices and dealing with VAT.

(Zimbabwe, for example, was allowed to continue trading diamonds despite the Mugabe government’s involvement in massacring gem miners.)Although some fear De Beers’s move could devastate its core mining business by knocking the floor out of diamond prices, its executives have come round to the view that people are increasingly happy to buy diamonds for their sparkle alone, rather than their high value and exclusivity.And from a PR point of view, it plays to the public’s growing concern about the ethics of the business — and may well empty the pockets of dictators, terrorists and shady middlemen who still make billions from the trade in illegal gems.The science behind the man-made gems set to revolutionise the market is far from new. It was in the early Fifties that technicians at the American industrial giant General Electric took a tiny fragment of diamond (called a ‘seed’) and subjected it to intense pressure and heat (4,000c) in a hydraulic press, while carbon-containing gas was passed over it.    Djimon Hounsou (left) and Leonardo DiCaprio (right), starred in the 2006 film Blood Diamond — which highlighted the illicit trade in diamonds mined by workers in war zonesThis mimicked the conditions that create diamonds over millions of years underground: carbon atoms in the gas stick to the seed one by one, building up the intricate carbon lattice structure of a diamond at a rate of roughly 0.0002 of an inch per hour.The end result, a chunky cube of diamond, can be cut and polished into the traditional shape. Manufactured diamonds produced in this way have sold for a discount of 20-40 per cent on the real thing.De Beers is well versed in the technology, as the world’s leading supplier of synthetic industrial diamonds through its UK-based subsidiary Element Six.Diamond, long regarded as the world’s hardest-known material, is used for cutting, grinding, drilling, oil extraction, marble polishing, and in precision electronic sensors for cars.As well as this high-temperature technique (which also requires pressure equivalent to placing the 7,300-ton Eiffel Tower on a single can of Coke), De Beers has been developing a cheaper synthetic diamond-making process called chemical vapour deposition.This involves pumping carbon-containing gases into a low- pressure vacuum around the diamond seed, again building up in layers to create a single stone.In the past decade, the technologies involved have advanced so much that synthetic diamonds are now much cheaper to produce.What’s more, their quality is such that it is no longer possible to tell the difference between natural and lab-produced gems with the human eye. Even professionals, using magnifying glasses and microscopes, find it difficult.\u0027I\u0027ll treasure it forever\u0027: Heartbroken bride whose fiance...Share this articleThis was amply demonstrated six years ago when 600 lab-grown diamonds were found in a collection of 1,000 gems. The synthetic stones even included intentionally created impurities to make them look more natural.The only people who could detect the difference were experts at the International Gemological Institute in Antwerp.So if the synthetic versions are that good, should buyers care that they are not ‘real’?Well, there is always the small matter of value. One of the biggest fears of traders, collectors and owners of diamond jewellery is that a flood of comparatively cheap, lab-made diamonds will result in a dramatic devaluation of mined diamonds.But in fact, contrary to Marilyn Monroe’s claim, diamonds were never really a girl’s best friend in terms of investment or resale.While large rare diamonds may command a premium, the small ones found in rings, bracelets, pendants and earrings are too common to appreciate in value. They seldom even keep the price paid for them at a jeweller’s.But clearly there will be an impact, not least because synthetic gems are unlikely to have any resale value in a world that could be awash with them.There is no question that this is a canny move by De Beers.

One stupid joke in a lifetime of fighting 4 civil rights 4 all minorities, against networks, studios, at the expense of my nervous systemfamilywealth will NEVER b taken from me.\u0027That comment came hours after Barr retweeted an outlandish statement suggesting that Michelle Obama played a role in her firing.       She suggested Michelle Obama was behind her firing by retweeting two unsourced claims alleging that the former first lady conspired with Channing Dungey ahead of ABC\u0027s decision          \u0027According to sources ABC President Channing Dungey had a long conversation via phone with former First Lady Michelle Obama before deciding to cancel the Roseanne show,\u0027 read the tweet. \u0027Michelle Obama was reportedly enraged and insisted an apology was inadequate.\u0027Barr also retweeted a post that further suggested this was an attempt by the Obamas to get revenge after she mocked the couple\u0027s Netflix deal with a hashtag last week that became a trending topic.\u0027Interesting. A few days after the popular #ObmasNetflixShows was all over the place making people giggle. Not surprised and I would not doubt it being very true,\u0027 read the post that Barr shared with her followers.These were just two of the conspiracy theories retweeted by Barr in the wake of the show\u0027s cancellation.    ABC decided to cancel Roseanne Barr\u0027s television show \u0027Roseanne\u0027 on Tuesday just hours after the comedian posted a racist tweet about Valerie Jarrett          Valerie Jarrett has spoken out on the controversy surrounding Roseanne Barr\u0027s racist tweets, saying the ABC made the right decision to cancel her show          Roseanne caused outrage when she compared ex-Obama adviser Valerie Jarrett to an ape on Twitter           Keeping above the fray: Barr also retweeted an inidual who suggested the Obamas, who employed and are close friends with Valerie Jarrett, did this as revenge because Barr mocked their $50 million Netflix deal (l to r: Jarrett, Michelle and Barack in 2014)It comes after her ex-husband Tom Arnold told CNN\u0027s Anderson Cooper that he wasn\u0027t surprised and it was only a matter of time before all hell broke loose. Arnold - who was a writer on the original Rosanne series - claimed that Barr\u0027s politics and social media showed that she was obsessed with the conspiracy theories that Donald Trump has been feeding to the masses.  \u0027This monkey thing is something that she tweeted before about black people, its a meme that she and thousands of her alt-right fans do. They love to call black people monkeys, it\u0027s not a one time joke,\u0027 Arnold said. \u0027They can do this because we have a white trash racist president. That\u0027s a fact!\u0027Arnold shared his disgust with how Trump was only concerned with how the media had treated him when news of Barr\u0027s tweets made their way to him.        Meanwhile, Barr\u0027s son Jake shared text exchanges with his mother on Wednesday to seemingly prove she was not racist.\u0027Her and her dad, I thought they were white,\u0027 Barr wrote in a text message she purportedly sent her son.She followed that up by saying: \u0027I would never have called a black woman an ape I\u0027m not stupid!\u0027 That is a lie however, with Barr having called former national security advisor Susan Rice just that in a 2014 tweet. The third text stated: \u0027I thought she was Jewish of Iranian.\u0027 Her son captioned the image by writing: \u0027Mom and I are too dumb for the internet lol.           On Wednesday, actor Tom Arnold appeared on AC360 to share that he wasn\u0027t surprised when ABC pulled the plug on the \u0027Roseanne\u0027 reboot  Contextual: Her son also shared text messages that he and his mother purportedly exchanged in which Barr writes that she thought Jarrett was \u0027white\u0027 and \u0027Iranian,\u0027 posted eight hours after the show was cancelled            Commander-in-chief: President Trump complained that ABC president Bob Iger \u0027never ... apologized for the HORRIBLE statements made and said about me on ABC\u0027Barr had previously blasted two of her co-stars for speaking out against her in tweets posted around midnight.Hours after claiming she was quitting Twitter, Barr began to rail against her critics while also posting an occasional apology.Michael Fishman, who played D.J. Conner on the show and started working with Barr when he was just six, was the first to feel the wrath of the show\u0027s creator after he released a statement criticizing her racist tweet saying Jarrett looks like the lovechild of the \u0027Muslim Brotherhood and Planet of the Apes\u0027.\u0027I condemn these statements vehemently,\u0027 wrote Fishman, who is the father of a black daughter in the reboot. \u0027They are reprehensible and intolerable, contradicting my beliefs and outlook on life and society. I have always lived and taught my children to be inclusive. I believe our show strived to embrace different backgrounds and opinions, through open dialogue.\u0027Barr was none too happy with that statement and fired back on Twitter. \u0027I created the platform for that inclusivity and you know it. ME. You throw me under the bus. nice!\u0027, she wrote.Fishman responded, stating: \u0027You fought, built, and designed Roseanne for inclusiveness. That is why yesterday was so out of character with the last 30 years. It was in your hands from the beginning to the end. No one can deny that.\u0027Barr fired back: \u0027Please leave me alone, thanks.\u0027             Michael Fishman, who played D.J. Conner on the show, released a statement criticizing Barr\u0027s racist tweet  Weighing in: Gilbert, who is a producer on the reboot, let her disgust be known on TuesdayBut Fishman was not the only original cast member to take a stand, with Sara Gilbert, who played Roseanne\u0027s daughter Darlene, also releasing a statement that very much echoed the one released shortly after by ABC cancelling the show.\u0027Roseanne’s recent comments about Valerie Jarrett, and so much more, are abhorrent and do not reflect the beliefs of our cast and crew or anyone associated with our show. I am disappointed in her actions to say the least,\u0027 wrote Gilbert, who was a producer on the reboot and largely responsible for reuniting the cast.\u0027This is incredibly sad and difficult for all of us, as we’ve created a show that we believe in, are proud of, and that audiences love— one that is separate and apart from the opinions and words of one cast member.\u0027\u0027Wow! unreal,\u0027 wrote Barr, who had confessed in earlier interviews to the difficult job Gilbert had of trying to rein in her impulse to tweet offensive comments.However, she later followed up, tweeting: \u0027No, I understand her position and why she said what she said. i forgive her. It just shocked me a bit, but I indeed f***ed up.\u0027She reiterated this soon after when a follower criticized Gilbert, saying: \u0027She\u0027s distancing herself from me and my tweet-she has to.\u0027A downcast Gilbert was photographed on her phone outside an LA restaurant yesterday as John Goodman, who played Barr\u0027s husband Dan on the show, looked similarly bereft as he walked his dog in New Orleans.   "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/31/00/4CC4208C00000578-0-image-a-6_1527724492447.jpg","title":"British woman 30 survives plunging 100 metres rocky mountain crossing icy summit","story":"    A British woman has survived a horrific plunge down a rocky mountain after trying to cross an icy summit.

I can\u0027t tell you how excited we are that the fence is down.\u0027Our fear now is that it will put it back up again - we just hope it is gone for good.\u0027I was nervous about coming to the press but I am so glad we did now - it may have saved us months of dispute.\u0027Thomas and Rebekah moved into the £220,000 four-bedroom property on Persimmon Homes\u0027s Brook View development just before Christmas.They arrived home from their honeymoon earlier this month to find their home\u0027s outlook blocked by the intrusive wooden panel.And they said that since their return, their lives had been ruined by the fence - and they even considered moving out.  The couple moved into the £220,000 four-bedroom home just before Christmas last year and found the wall metres away from the side of their home when they returned from honeymoon Furious Thomas thought the fence was erected by the owner of nearby Upper Mickle Hay Farm in a dispute with Persimmon over land borders.However, Persimmon insisted that none of its development encroaches on land it does not already own.Thomas said before the wall was toppled: \u0027This was our dream home and now it\u0027s turned into a nightmare - it feels like we are imprisoned in our own house by this fence.\u0027We are being held hostage in a land dispute which is nothing to do with us.\u0027Rebekah and I have just started our own business and had to fight to get a mortgage and then to get this house.\u0027We bought it because of the view which has now been replaced by a huge wooden fence nailed to our own little one.          The wall has fallen: The Entwistle\u0027s home in Blackburn is pictured without the 6ft around it           The couple said they are fearful the wall could be put back up again but a planning meeting will decide whether it was a planning breach or not \u0027Rebekah is always in tears. She is in despair - there was no warning and the fence just appeared.\u0027It is 2ft from our front window and front door - it\u0027s like having the Berlin Wall in front of our home.\u0027 Thomas and his wife, who married in July, said they would not have even considered the property if they had known the trouble in store for them.Thomas said: \u0027We\u0027re not even sure we want to live here now.\u0027Even if the fence gets taken down there is no guarantee it won\u0027t come back later or even be extended around the back - we are in fear of that.\u0027The couple, who had moved from rented accommodation, considered employing their own solicitor.          The wooden structure is pictured on the ground after developers took it down with the help of local council officials Thomas added: \u0027At first I was tearful but now I\u0027m angry.\u0027We specifically bought this house, beating off a lot of competition, for its beautiful views and now they\u0027ve gone.\u0027We now keep the curtains closed in the front room and spend most of our time upstairs - Rebekah is too upset to be in the living room.\u0027We just want it sorted out quickly and permanently so we can enjoy our new home in peace.\u0027          Mr Entwistle was shocked to find that the enormous fence stands just two feet from his living room windowDevelopers Persimmon removed the fence after Blackburn with Darwen Council planning officials visited and told the firm the fence was constructed on land they owned.The council officials will now see if it was in breach of planning regulations.A spokesman for Persimmon Homes said: \u0027Our staff have taken down the fence after consultation with council planning officers.\u0027Local councillor Sylvia Liddle said: \u0027I am delighted for this young couple who have been so distressed - it is a victory for common sense and we now need to ensure it is a permanent solution.\u0027A spokeswoman for the farmer\u0027s land agent Gary Hoerty Associates of Grindleton declined to comment.A spokesman for Persimmon Homes said: \u0027We are confident none of our development encroaches on land not legitimately within our ownership.

(Zimbabwe, for example, was allowed to continue trading diamonds despite the Mugabe government’s involvement in massacring gem miners.)Although some fear De Beers’s move could devastate its core mining business by knocking the floor out of diamond prices, its executives have come round to the view that people are increasingly happy to buy diamonds for their sparkle alone, rather than their high value and exclusivity.And from a PR point of view, it plays to the public’s growing concern about the ethics of the business — and may well empty the pockets of dictators, terrorists and shady middlemen who still make billions from the trade in illegal gems.The science behind the man-made gems set to revolutionise the market is far from new. It was in the early Fifties that technicians at the American industrial giant General Electric took a tiny fragment of diamond (called a ‘seed’) and subjected it to intense pressure and heat (4,000c) in a hydraulic press, while carbon-containing gas was passed over it.    Djimon Hounsou (left) and Leonardo DiCaprio (right), starred in the 2006 film Blood Diamond — which highlighted the illicit trade in diamonds mined by workers in war zonesThis mimicked the conditions that create diamonds over millions of years underground: carbon atoms in the gas stick to the seed one by one, building up the intricate carbon lattice structure of a diamond at a rate of roughly 0.0002 of an inch per hour.The end result, a chunky cube of diamond, can be cut and polished into the traditional shape. Manufactured diamonds produced in this way have sold for a discount of 20-40 per cent on the real thing.De Beers is well versed in the technology, as the world’s leading supplier of synthetic industrial diamonds through its UK-based subsidiary Element Six.Diamond, long regarded as the world’s hardest-known material, is used for cutting, grinding, drilling, oil extraction, marble polishing, and in precision electronic sensors for cars.As well as this high-temperature technique (which also requires pressure equivalent to placing the 7,300-ton Eiffel Tower on a single can of Coke), De Beers has been developing a cheaper synthetic diamond-making process called chemical vapour deposition.This involves pumping carbon-containing gases into a low- pressure vacuum around the diamond seed, again building up in layers to create a single stone.In the past decade, the technologies involved have advanced so much that synthetic diamonds are now much cheaper to produce.What’s more, their quality is such that it is no longer possible to tell the difference between natural and lab-produced gems with the human eye. Even professionals, using magnifying glasses and microscopes, find it difficult.\u0027I\u0027ll treasure it forever\u0027: Heartbroken bride whose fiance...Share this articleThis was amply demonstrated six years ago when 600 lab-grown diamonds were found in a collection of 1,000 gems. The synthetic stones even included intentionally created impurities to make them look more natural.The only people who could detect the difference were experts at the International Gemological Institute in Antwerp.So if the synthetic versions are that good, should buyers care that they are not ‘real’?Well, there is always the small matter of value. One of the biggest fears of traders, collectors and owners of diamond jewellery is that a flood of comparatively cheap, lab-made diamonds will result in a dramatic devaluation of mined diamonds.But in fact, contrary to Marilyn Monroe’s claim, diamonds were never really a girl’s best friend in terms of investment or resale.While large rare diamonds may command a premium, the small ones found in rings, bracelets, pendants and earrings are too common to appreciate in value. They seldom even keep the price paid for them at a jeweller’s.But clearly there will be an impact, not least because synthetic gems are unlikely to have any resale value in a world that could be awash with them.There is no question that this is a canny move by De Beers. The cost of getting natural diamonds out of the ground is continually growing, which cuts both production levels and profits.

One stupid joke in a lifetime of fighting 4 civil rights 4 all minorities, against networks, studios, at the expense of my nervous systemfamilywealth will NEVER b taken from me.\u0027That comment came hours after Barr retweeted an outlandish statement suggesting that Michelle Obama played a role in her firing.       She suggested Michelle Obama was behind her firing by retweeting two unsourced claims alleging that the former first lady conspired with Channing Dungey ahead of ABC\u0027s decision          \u0027According to sources ABC President Channing Dungey had a long conversation via phone with former First Lady Michelle Obama before deciding to cancel the Roseanne show,\u0027 read the tweet. \u0027Michelle Obama was reportedly enraged and insisted an apology was inadequate.\u0027Barr also retweeted a post that further suggested this was an attempt by the Obamas to get revenge after she mocked the couple\u0027s Netflix deal with a hashtag last week that became a trending topic.\u0027Interesting. A few days after the popular #ObmasNetflixShows was all over the place making people giggle. Not surprised and I would not doubt it being very true,\u0027 read the post that Barr shared with her followers.These were just two of the conspiracy theories retweeted by Barr in the wake of the show\u0027s cancellation.    ABC decided to cancel Roseanne Barr\u0027s television show \u0027Roseanne\u0027 on Tuesday just hours after the comedian posted a racist tweet about Valerie Jarrett          Valerie Jarrett has spoken out on the controversy surrounding Roseanne Barr\u0027s racist tweets, saying the ABC made the right decision to cancel her show          Roseanne caused outrage when she compared ex-Obama adviser Valerie Jarrett to an ape on Twitter           Keeping above the fray: Barr also retweeted an inidual who suggested the Obamas, who employed and are close friends with Valerie Jarrett, did this as revenge because Barr mocked their $50 million Netflix deal (l to r: Jarrett, Michelle and Barack in 2014)It comes after her ex-husband Tom Arnold told CNN\u0027s Anderson Cooper that he wasn\u0027t surprised and it was only a matter of time before all hell broke loose. Arnold - who was a writer on the original Rosanne series - claimed that Barr\u0027s politics and social media showed that she was obsessed with the conspiracy theories that Donald Trump has been feeding to the masses.  \u0027This monkey thing is something that she tweeted before about black people, its a meme that she and thousands of her alt-right fans do. They love to call black people monkeys, it\u0027s not a one time joke,\u0027 Arnold said. \u0027They can do this because we have a white trash racist president. That\u0027s a fact!\u0027Arnold shared his disgust with how Trump was only concerned with how the media had treated him when news of Barr\u0027s tweets made their way to him.        Meanwhile, Barr\u0027s son Jake shared text exchanges with his mother on Wednesday to seemingly prove she was not racist.\u0027Her and her dad, I thought they were white,\u0027 Barr wrote in a text message she purportedly sent her son.She followed that up by saying: \u0027I would never have called a black woman an ape I\u0027m not stupid!\u0027 That is a lie however, with Barr having called former national security advisor Susan Rice just that in a 2014 tweet. The third text stated: \u0027I thought she was Jewish of Iranian.\u0027 Her son captioned the image by writing: \u0027Mom and I are too dumb for the internet lol.           On Wednesday, actor Tom Arnold appeared on AC360 to share that he wasn\u0027t surprised when ABC pulled the plug on the \u0027Roseanne\u0027 reboot  Contextual: Her son also shared text messages that he and his mother purportedly exchanged in which Barr writes that she thought Jarrett was \u0027white\u0027 and \u0027Iranian,\u0027 posted eight hours after the show was cancelled            Commander-in-chief: President Trump complained that ABC president Bob Iger \u0027never ... apologized for the HORRIBLE statements made and said about me on ABC\u0027Barr had previously blasted two of her co-stars for speaking out against her in tweets posted around midnight.Hours after claiming she was quitting Twitter, Barr began to rail against her critics while also posting an occasional apology.Michael Fishman, who played D.J. Conner on the show and started working with Barr when he was just six, was the first to feel the wrath of the show\u0027s creator after he released a statement criticizing her racist tweet saying Jarrett looks like the lovechild of the \u0027Muslim Brotherhood and Planet of the Apes\u0027.\u0027I condemn these statements vehemently,\u0027 wrote Fishman, who is the father of a black daughter in the reboot. \u0027They are reprehensible and intolerable, contradicting my beliefs and outlook on life and society. I have always lived and taught my children to be inclusive. I believe our show strived to embrace different backgrounds and opinions, through open dialogue.\u0027Barr was none too happy with that statement and fired back on Twitter. \u0027I created the platform for that inclusivity and you know it. ME. You throw me under the bus. nice!\u0027, she wrote.Fishman responded, stating: \u0027You fought, built, and designed Roseanne for inclusiveness. That is why yesterday was so out of character with the last 30 years. It was in your hands from the beginning to the end. No one can deny that.\u0027Barr fired back: \u0027Please leave me alone, thanks.\u0027             Michael Fishman, who played D.J. Conner on the show, released a statement criticizing Barr\u0027s racist tweet  Weighing in: Gilbert, who is a producer on the reboot, let her disgust be known on TuesdayBut Fishman was not the only original cast member to take a stand, with Sara Gilbert, who played Roseanne\u0027s daughter Darlene, also releasing a statement that very much echoed the one released shortly after by ABC cancelling the show.\u0027Roseanne’s recent comments about Valerie Jarrett, and so much more, are abhorrent and do not reflect the beliefs of our cast and crew or anyone associated with our show. I am disappointed in her actions to say the least,\u0027 wrote Gilbert, who was a producer on the reboot and largely responsible for reuniting the cast.\u0027This is incredibly sad and difficult for all of us, as we’ve created a show that we believe in, are proud of, and that audiences love— one that is separate and apart from the opinions and words of one cast member.\u0027\u0027Wow! unreal,\u0027 wrote Barr, who had confessed in earlier interviews to the difficult job Gilbert had of trying to rein in her impulse to tweet offensive comments.However, she later followed up, tweeting: \u0027No, I understand her position and why she said what she said. i forgive her. It just shocked me a bit, but I indeed f***ed up.\u0027She reiterated this soon after when a follower criticized Gilbert, saying: \u0027She\u0027s distancing herself from me and my tweet-she has to.\u0027A downcast Gilbert was photographed on her phone outside an LA restaurant yesterday as John Goodman, who played Barr\u0027s husband Dan on the show, looked similarly bereft as he walked his dog in New Orleans.   "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/30/22/4CC3B55C00000578-0-image-m-84_1527715860440.jpg","title":"Mays ex Cabinet ministers visit No 10 plead sensible Brexit","story":"    Justine Greening (left), sacked as Education Secretary, Amber Rudd (centre), who resigned as Home Secretary, and Damian Green (right), who quit as Mrs May\u0027s deputy, met with the PM yesterday and were seen leaving Downing Street (pictured) Following the talks Ms Rudd told The Times: \u0027That\u0027s where the vast majority of the party is. \u0027We just haven\u0027t been as shouty.

The white kids want to know where he is from. The answer is “here”, same as them, but that’s not what they’re asking. After 911 they call him Osama. His parents are from Pakistan. When he visits Karachi, his relatives point out his US accent. He lives between two worlds, belonging to neither.Then, in the sixth grade, something happens. He is doing a science project on Isaac Newton. He visits the public library of the small town in Pennsylvania where he lives, and, browsing books about Newton the scientist he comes across another Newton – Huey P Newton, cofounder of the Black Panther Party. In 1973, Newton published an autobiography called Revolutionary Suicide. Intrigued by the title, the boy picks up the book, and it changes his life.This is the scene that opens Mistaken Identity: Race and Class in the Age of Trump. It’s vividly drawn, and sets the stakes for what follows. Asad Haider has written a book about identity, politics, and the relationship between the two. In particular, he has written a book about “identity politics”, a phrase that, like “political correctness”, is extremely slippery, but which generally means an emphasis on issues of racial, gender and sexual identity.Identity politics finds critics everywhere. Throw a rock at a rack of newspapers and you’ll probably hit an editorial condemning it. Conservatives such as Republican House speaker Paul Ryan blame for polarisation, while liberals like the Columbia University historian Mark Lilla hold it responsible for Donald Trump’s victory, applying the baroque logic that letting people use their preferred gender pronouns is why Democrats struggle to be seen as the party of working people.Haider is also a critic of identity politics, but with a crucial difference: he knows the history of the term and is working from within the tradition that produced it. As he explains, the idea has radical roots. It originated with the Combahee River Collective, an organisation of black lesbian feminist socialists in Boston who published a landmark statement in 1977: “This focusing upon our own oppression is embodied in the concept of identity politics. We believe that the most profound and potentially most radical politics come directly out of our own identity, as opposed to working to end somebody else’s oppression.”This is the original demand of identity politics, and it’s one that Haider embraces: for a revolutionary practice rooted in people’s identities as racialised, sexed, gendered and classed iniduals who face interlocking systems of oppression. These systems have to be fought together, by organising people of different identities in what Haider calls “a project of universal emancipation” devoted to dismantling all of the structures that make them unfree, including and especially capitalism itself.But if anticapitalist revolution is where identity politics began, it has since become something quite different, and is now invoked by certain liberals and leftists to serve distinctly non-revolutionary ends, Haider argues. It involves members of marginalised groups demanding inclusion, recognition, or restitution from above – a seat at the table. These demands are made in response to very real injuries endured by those groups. But their method, he says, ends up strengthening the structures that produced those injuries in the first place.Drawing on Wendy Brown’s idea of “wounded attachments”, Haider contends that identity politics causes people to become invested in their marginalisation as a source of identity, and to continuously enact that identity as a form of politics. This approach can extract occasional concessions from the system but cannot build the power necessary to transform it.Building that power will require forging a “new insurgent universality”, Haider believes. This doesn’t mean pretending that everyone is the same. It doesn’t mean elevating one identity – that of the white male worker, say – above all others. Rather, the universality that Haider wants is built from below. It is “created and recreated in the act of insurgency”, as people come together to combat the common enemy lurking behind their particular oppressions. Freedom for ourselves – whoever “we” are – is inseparable from freedom for everyone. If emancipation is always self-emancipation, self-emancipation is always a collective endeavour.Collective self-emancipation doesn’t require abandoning one’s identity – if that were even possible – but linking it with those of others in widening circles of solidarity. The story that opens Haider’s book is a good example: solidarity across identities is how a Pakistani-American boy could find inspiration in a long-dead Black Panther. Indeed, what Haider found so inspiring about Newton was precisely his vision of a solidarity strong enough to  the world. As an African American in a profoundly racist country, Newton couldn’t escape his identity. Neither could Haider, in a country convulsing with Islamophobic hatred. Yet “Newton did not stop with his own identity”, Haider writes. “His experience led him beyond himself – to take up a politics based on solidarity with Cuba, China, Palestine and Vietnam.”Armed with the explanatory power of the black radical tradition, and Marxism more broadly, Newton connected the dots between different injustices. Haider follows this example, wielding the same tools to advance his critique of contemporary identity politics and make his case for a radical alternative. He draws on a wide range of sources, examining an interracial uprising in colonial Virginia and the riots in Newark three centuries later exploring the ideas of WEB Du Bois, Judith Butler and Barbara Fields, among other great thinkers. And he regularly loops back to recent history, to analyse Occupy Wall Street, Black Lives Matter and the other mobilisations that have moulded our political moment.The result is riveting. Haider moves deftly over difficult terrain. His prose is precise and propulsive. His Marxism is not a mausoleum but a living, breathing thing, coursing with what Lenin called “the concrete analysis of the concrete situation”, faithful to the method of historical materialism while flexible in the face of a fluid social reality. And he writes as both a militant and a theorist, one who believes that theory is integral to political struggle and that theoretical rigour has political stakes.The function of rigorousness, Louis Althusser once said, is to distinguish between “true ideas and false ideas”, between ideas that “serve the people” and ideas that serve its enemies. The American left has shown signs of life recently, but it has no shortage of enemies. Defeating them will require, among other things, ideas. Haider’s book contributes several.

The trouble is, he is totally wrongForty-five years ago, the inventor of the term “paradigm shift” threw an ashtray in exasperation at a young graduate student in the philosophy of science, and soon afterwards ejected him from Princeton. The ashtray hurler was Thomas Kuhn, and his student grew up to become the documentary film-maker Errol Morris, who has – perhaps understandably – harboured a grudge ever since. This book is his long-brewed revenge.Morris explains early on that he is worried about post-truth, fake news, the Trump administration’s invocation of “alternative facts”, and so forth, and hopes his book will serve as an “antidote”. But what exactly makes Kuhn a proto-Trumpian?In his seminal work The Structure of Scientific Revolutions (1962), he argued that science proceeds in two modes. “Normal” science consists of “puzzle-solving”, finding answers to questions that remain within a certain overarching theory, or “paradigm”. But at certain points, anomalies pile up and a revolution occurs, replacing the previous theory or paradigm with a new one, as when Newtonian mechanics was overthrown by Einsteinian relativity. That is a paradigm shift. And, according to Kuhn, it’s usually messier and less objective than people had previously assumed. In particular, he argued, the criterion for the acceptance of a new paradigm is not some kind of provably superior fidelity to objective truth, but simply its consensus adoption by the community of human beings engaged in scientific practice.This is all terribly dangerous, Morris says: “Kuhn’s ideas promote a denial of truth,” and if we can’t rely on objective truth in science then we may as well all become White House spokespeople. (I am paraphrasing slightly.) His aim, then, is to refute this “postmodernist bible”. To do so, somewhat eccentrically, he spends a lot of time on the picture of language advanced in the 1960s by the philosopher Saul Kripke, because he takes this to imply that the meaning of words is fundamentally connected to reality in a reliable way, so that scientific language, too, can point to the world unproblematically. There are also some entertaining interviews, laid out documentary-script-wise, with such luminaries as Noam Chomsky, the philosopher Hilary Putnam and Kripke himself, and Morris races off on tangents about Jorge Luis Borges, Pythagorean mathematics and armadillos, and down some deep Wittgensteinian rabbit holes (or duck-rabbit holes) about rules and language.There’s a really big problem with Morris’s account, and it’s right there in his book’s subtitle: Kuhn did not, in fact, “deny reality”. He simply insisted that we could ultimately never know the fundamental truth about reality, but we could, he thought, make ever more useful predictions about it with scientific theories. This is clear enough even in many of the passages Morris himself angrily cites, as when he quotes Kuhn writing (in 1989) about “the natural sciences, dealing objectively with the real world (as they do)”, or, at the end of The Structure of Scientific Revolutions itself, where Kuhn writes of the evolution of science as “an increasingly detailed and refined understanding of nature”. That doesn’t sound like a postmodernist supervillain denying reality, does it? No, because it isn’t.Morris is also upset about Kuhn’s notorious concept of “incommensurability”. According to Kuhn, competing scientific paradigms are “incommensurable” in that they slice up the world into different sets of incompatible phenomena, but this doesn’t mean, as Morris thinks, that he is saying they can’t be rationally compared at all. In Kuhn’s picture, when assessing theories, the community of scientists decides not that a new paradigm is “true” in that it accurately reflects fundamental reality, but simply that it explains a wider collection of experimental findings than the old one. This was the explicit view of many of the pioneering quantum physicists, who thought that to ask what the mathematics implied about the nature of reality itself was silly. As Chomsky tells Morris, evidently to the latter’s disappointment, it is perfectly respectable to hold the following view: “The world is indeed incomprehensible, it’s a mystery, but we can at least construct intelligible theories.”In Morris’s partial defence, more scholarly critics have long taken Kuhn to task for seeming to be vague about his central terms and using them in apparently different senses in different places. But this book’s central and rather hysterically repeated accusation, that Kuhn thought reality didn’t exist and science was merely a social power game, is just plain wrong. Whenever something sounds a bit relativist, Morris pounces on it and reads it as though it is saying the most ridiculous thing possible: the principle of interpretive charity is here everywhere absent. It’s a particular shame, since in his films about Robert McNamara or Donald Rumsfeld, Morris beautifully withholds authorial judgment in order to allow the subjects to damn themselves. In this book, though, he does the opposite, going on a flamethrower rampage from the start in an attempt to reduce everything to smouldering ash. The cause of truth is not thereby advanced.To buy The Ashtray go to bookshop."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/068461eb2bcffc10c91736c235758e3e08cf9cf5/10_2397_3506_2104/master/3506.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=223048c17b66d784f835d1335ee7cb20","title":"the swish of the curtain an anarchic childrens classic rises again","story":"Pamela Brown’s madcap 1941 tale of stagestruck children inspired the likes of Dame Maggie Smith and Eileen Atkins to start acting. Now it’s stepping back into the limelight“I wanted to act before I read this book,” Dame Maggie Smith once said of Pamela Brown’s classic children’s novel The Swish of the Curtain, “and afterwards there was no stopping me.”For me, the end result was somewhat less lofty, but the antics of the children of the Blue Door Theatre Company in Brown’s novel did lead to evenings spent rehearsing with our local amateur dramatics society (pantomimes in the winter Toad of Toad Hall and Our Day Out in the summer). The 1941 novel – a sort of Ballet Shoes for the theatre - tells of seven children in the sleepy English town of Fenchester. After running out of money and activities one long holiday, they stumble on an abandoned theatre and clean it up to put on their own performances, discovering as they do so a burning ambition to pursue a life on the stage (to the horror of their parents). Part of the novel’s appeal, as well as its humour and the excitement of the group’s entry into an acting competition, is Brown’s pitch-perfect depictions of childhood, from Maddy, the child struggling to keep up, to Lyn, a girl on the brink of romance.Perhaps this stems from the fact that Brown wrote the novel when she was, astonishingly, only 14. Her daughter, Verity Ridgman, says her mother – who died in 1989 – dreamed up the characters with her best friend, and they would discuss them on the way to and from school.“They both fantasised about being actresses and escaping provincial life in Colchester, going to London. They invented this group of children who would be able to fulfil that fantasy,” says Ridgman. “Then the war came along, and my mother was evacuated, and there was nothing to do, she was really bored. So she wrote to her friend in Colchester and they carried on the conversation, really. And then she wrote it up. So she kind of quite inadvertently had done a lot of the groundwork that other people have to do before they start writing.”Rereading The Swish of the Curtain, I’m amazed by how much of it has stayed with me it is one of those books that makes up my very bones, from the antics of nine-year-old Maddy, the youngest of the group who discovers the theatre when she hurls a stone at it in a fit of rage (“there was nothing that annoyed Maddy more than references to her plump little person”), to Lyn and Nigel’s performance of Romeo and Juliet (“he was so happy to find himself acting well that he forgot the argument in which he said the balcony scene should be acted soberly, and once or twice laughed gently, gazing up at Lyn with adoring eyes”). And of course the arch enemy, Mrs Potter-Smith, leader of the Ladies’ Institute – “that frightful woman who pats me on the head and calls me ‘dear laddy’, said Jeremy disgustedly”.“They’re really charming,” says Adam Freudenheim at Pushkin Press, which is reissuing The Swish of the Curtain and its four sequels over the coming months. First published in the 40s and 50s, the Blue Door books were popular in their day, with The Swish of the Curtain later adapted for television by the BBC. But the later books in the series have slipped out of print in the ensuing decades, only available in recent years through print on demand. Pushkin is hoping its reissues will inspire a new generation of children to fall for a series that also counts among its fans the late Victoria Wood and Eileen Atkins, who calls it enchanting and “a must for any child who wants to become an actor”.Brown used the earnings from the books to train at Rada herself.

The city showed that it had a well-established record of achieving high environmental standards and had ambitious goals for improving the environment and sustainable development.With such an environmentally sound reputation, there are many jewels in Bristol’s green business crown. Here are 10 companies helping to grow the city’s green economy …RefillRefill launched in Bristol in September 2015 and is now a nationwide scheme. It was started by the people behind the equally environmentally conscious City to Sea, that campaigns to help tackle the problem of plastics in our oceans. Refill aims to bring together businesses, cafes, museums and other public spaces to make water available for the public to refill their own water bottles, reducing the demand for single-use plastics. There is also a Refill app where you can find free water sources nearby and also add your own refill stations.SkipchenSkipchen’s aim is to tackle food waste. In 2014 it ran an extremely successful pop-up cafe in Bristol that repurposed food that discarded by supermarkets and other restaurants that was still perfectly good for eating. It now operates within the community by having conversations about the problems of waste and working with businesses in collecting their surplus. More recently, Skipchen travelled to areas including Lesbos in Greece, working to help feed refugees out of its Food Rescue Ambulance.Bee the ChangeAs part of the Bristol Green Capital Partnership, Bee the Change set up community bee hives around the city that are nurtured and cared for by the community. It also gave educational talks in schools, universities and other organisations to discuss the role of bees in the environment, as well as allowing attendees to extract their own honey. Bee the Change also plants bee forage (their food supply – nectar and pollen from blossoming plants) and builds sanctuaries for local bees. If you’re keen on getting your own beekeeping wings, natural beekeeping courses are available for groups or iniduals.Incredible Edible BristolIncredible Edible launched in Todmorden, Yorkshire, and has since spread as far as Canada, New Zealand … and Bristol too. It works hard to encourage locals to take advantage of whatever land they have, and nurture it to grow their own food. Thanks to the Bristol team, there are now 30 edible gardens scattered across the city – in parks, on street corners and even in station car parks – that are cared for by volunteers. It’s available for anyone to take away and use to make delicious meals – think herbs and easily grown veg.Grow BristolWhen you think of farming you probably think of huge expanses of fields, tractors and endless countryside. Well, Grow Bristol is here to make you think differently, through urban farming. The urban farming enterprise is developing innovative and sustainable ways to grow food in the city to benefit the people who live there, and has won awards for its work. It supplies greens and other produce to organisations including Farmdrop, who deliver local produce, and Source food hall and cafe, as well as local restaurants.The Severn ProjectAlthough it has a similar model of sustainable food growing as Grow Bristol and Incredible Edible, the Severn Project also helps support people who are recovering from addiction and other mental health issues, and assists ex-offenders by helping them return to employment. Currently, the Severn Project grows produce such as spinach and micro herbs in 1.5 acres of polytunnels, where it also harvests rainwater.Zero GreenIf you’re trying to avoid buying products with excess plastic packaging, it can be tricky finding suitable produce in your local supermarket. Zero Green is Bristol’s first waste-free food shop: customers bring their own containers and bags to fill up with everyday items such as rice and pasta, washing powder and shampoo. The shop is even fitted out with reclaimed wood from the Bristol Wood Recycling Project, which goes to show how well the eco-community in Bristol works together.Bristol Wood Recycling ProjectThe Bristol Wood Recycling Project wants to make sure no wood goes to waste. It reclaims unused wood and provides affordable wood to the community through a small range of furniture and budget firewood and kindling. The project also fosters a community of volunteers who work at the yard.Real Wrap Co.Real Wrap Co. is an environmentally friendly sandwich company that supplies local universities and other big contracts. It produces about 100,000 products a week, but sends almost zero food waste to landfill. It was featured on Channel 4’s Food Unwrapped for being one of the first sandwich companies in the UK to supply leftover bread for the making of beer, to help cut waste.To find out more about how you can support green energy and save money on your bills, visit bristol-energy"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3969b9ed78a6acc662927a4db8f83275143c4e8e/0_358_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=98036f8f27a65cd267467b4053c69ebc","title":"pitiful views on women in boardrooms permeate ftse firms","story":"Leading companies criticised over reasons given for male dominance of boardroomsWomen aren’t a good fit in boardrooms, most of them don’t want the hassle of a big job and they don’t understand the complex issues discussed in board meetings. That is according to executives at the UK’s biggest firms, who have offered the excuses to explain why their boardrooms are dominated by men.The business minister Andrew Griffiths, responding to a report released by the his department on Wednesday, described the comments as “pitiful and patronising” as he sought to highlight how far FTSE 350 companies have to go on ersity at the top level.According to the Department for Business, Innovation \u0026amp Skills, the excuses given included:Amanda Mackenzie, chief executive of Business in the Community, an organisation that champions corporate social responsibility, said: “As you read this list of excuses, you might think it’s 1918, not 2018.

Maybe those that give credence to these excuses are the ones that are not up to sitting on boards and should move over: we are in the 21st century after all.”The independent Hampton-Alexander review is being led by Sir Philip Hampton, one of Britain’s most highly regarded bosses, who has challenged all FTSE 350 companies to make sure at least a third of their board members and leadership are women by 2020.He said excuses such as those highlighted in the government report were heard less now than a few years ago. “However, leaders expressing warm words of support but actually doing very little to appoint women into top jobs – or quietly blocking progress – are really not much better.”The Department for Business said there had been some more tangible progress in recent years, with the number of women on boards having “more than doubled in the FTSE 350 since 2011”, according to the most recent statistics – released in November last year. “In that time, the number of all-male FTSE 350 company boards also fell from 152 to 10,” it said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/446013b2d2bbf76ae9a2a5a09551c502369b63b6/0_0_4163_2498/master/4163.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ba933f6e47e93b4d9a2a7ee42517d4a6","title":"roseanne barr tweets conservative liberal","story":"As the new king of primetime, Richard Madeley said of Roseanne Barr’s disgusting tweets that sedatives don’t make you racist. Barr, whose show has now been cancelled, left Twitter after comparing a woman of colour to an ape and then reappeared claiming that the sleeping pill Ambien had made her say these awful things. She has also said that she is being picked on while other celebrities are not.Her excellent cast has distanced itself from her outbursts, but still she goes on. Watching this woman has for some time been like watching a car crash, and yet her talent is undeniable.When I first saw that Barr was on Twitter, years ago, I was delighted. A working-class heroine is something to be. Or it was at one time. She wrote about imperfect, complicated blue-collar life with edge. In the 90s there was no dishwasher in the Conner family house. They went to the mall, the phone was on the wall, the protagonists were overweight but had a sex life, jobs were hard to come by and the women were often smarter than the men. All of this was an inspiration, with Roseanne as the wisecracking self-styled slobby “domestic goddess” .And then Barr unravelled before our eyes. Physically self-loathing, she had numerous plastic surgeries. She claimed to have been abused by her parents after memories came flooding back. Twenty years after making those allegations, she said that going public with them was a terrible mistake .As a child she had Bell’s palsy. She nearly died in a car accident at 16 and had such traumatic head injuries that she ended up in a psychiatric institution for eight months. In 2012 she ran for presidential nomination. She claims Donald Trump stole her Twitter act.The euphemism used for her is “troubled”. These latest tweets, as obnoxious as they are, are nothing new – Barr has been tweeting outlandish conspiracy theories and racist rants for ages, from rubbish about chemtrails to vicious Islamophobic insults. Her support for Trump came as no surprise. That trajectory was visible. She says of herself that she is a radical and not a liberal, and there is something uncomfortable there that the media establishment don’t want to reckon with.When she married Tom Arnold in 1990, he and Barr claimed that they were America’s worst nightmare – “white trash with money”. The thing is, though, the Conner household were smart. They were shown reading actual books.The reaction to Barr’s new show was critically mixed but she got 18 million viewers. Can you represent Trump voters sympathetically on TV? Yes – and Barr did just that. Roseanne and her sister Jackie (the wonderful Laurie Metcalf, in “Nasty Woman” T-shirt and pussyhat) bicker over Roseanne’s support for Trump, which is portrayed as being about jobs rather than social policy. Money is tight. Dan and Roseanne are shown eking out their expensive medication, swapping statins for anti-inflammatories. Race and gender-fluidity figure (they have a black granddaughter). Grandson Mark wants to wear feminine clothing and is protected by Dan. Family rises above politics.To me this is important, as the liberal bubble of so much popular culture is surely big enough to include a little bit of “otherness”. This is not the view of Roxane Gay, who wrote: “We cannot reach people who make dangerous, myopic political choices. We concede, as Jackie does, or we resist, as hopefully the rest of us will.” She was saying that the myth of a white working-class voting for Trump has to be bust, because so many of his voters were middle-class. So it is not only about jobs.Now, though, no one has to resist the lure of watching something complicated and funny and uncomfortable, because Barr has said inexcusable things. This is her own fault – but what a waste of her gifts. At a time when politics is so polarised, anyone who can show a dialogue between sides is important. In the UK and the US, the liberal media talks mostly to itself and wonders how the right stays in power.Roseanne Barr has always been a peculiar mix of liberal and utterly reactionary social attitudes. And what do we with do that in a tickbox culture? Don’t we spend a lot of our lives learning to separate the art from the artist, usually in the case of great men who do bad things but make great art? So while I don’t think Barr can be forgiven the latest awfulness, I hope we don’t forget that she made some fantastic ground-breaking television.

However, as the  revealed this week, this has become a feature of the British landscape, in the form of concentrated animal feeding operations (Cafos).The bucolic idyll has been rooted deep in the English psyche for centuries, nowhere more so than in the hearts of the metropolitan middle classes, who want the countryside to be their green lung away from the smoke of traffic and who expect to see cows safely grazing on green and pleasant pastureland. Many prefer to remain disconnected from the reality of the processes required to turn those cows into aseptic packages of supermarket meat or fast-food burgers at rock-bottom prices.The idyll has been the city dweller’s romantic delusion of rural life since the industrial revolution, but real agriculture has always been dirty and tough, for workers and animals alike. We instinctively recoil from feedlot-style farming. But if you want to eat cheap beef, this is increasingly what production will look like.There is another way to farm cattle – extensively, outdoors on grass for most of their lives (rather than for just a few months) so that they can express their natural behaviour, in mixed farming systems where livestock are part of a virtuous cycle, creating manure that fertilises other crops, and making use of land that would otherwise be unproductive. Vegetarians and vegans disagree, but in so far as there is a justification for eating red meat and other animal produce, it is that ruminants can digest plant material including grass and straw that is indigestible to humans, and thus make available the huge resource of cellulose in that material for feeding people.Beef produced this way looks and tastes different. It has yellower fat from the beta-carotene in pasture. It has a different nutritional profile to beef from finishing units, where cattle are confined for months and fed a fast-food diet that can include grains, sugar beet pulp, brewing and food manufacturing waste, even cake and sliced white bread. But it is much more expensive. Supply would always be more limited. It becomes something to eat occasionally rather than every day.That would be better for our health, since high levels of red meat consumption are associated with an increased risk of cancer. It would be better for the planet too, since intensive livestock farming is a major source of greenhouse gas emissions. It would make better use of finite resources for feeding a growing global population to rear fewer animals for meat, since more energy and protein can be extracted from land used for crops than for intensive livestock. It would undoubtedly be better for the cows. ​The unarguable case for raising cattle to the highest welfare standards is made in The Secret Life of Cows, the book written by Cotswold beef farmer Rosamund Young, whose herds are reared exclusively on grass. Allowed to roam, she records that they make strong bovine friendships, frolick and play games on spring pastures, and develop into characters as varied as humans. But all this would require a radical overhaul of habits and attitudes.In one sense, feedlot-style units are not new. Farms that specialise in “finishing” one to two thousand cattle at a time – that is, fattening them up with concentrated feed for slaughter – have been operating in the UK for years. Mostly they have been indoors, out of sight in barns or giant sheds. It is the fact that the new units we found are outdoors, as well as the sheer numbers of animals in a confined space without shelter, that echoes the American way. So far, the Cafos in the UK appear to hold 3,000 cattle at a time at most in the US, some feedlots already corral tens of thousands together. So we are not talking the same scale, nor necessarily the same conditions, but rather that the pressures of the globalised economy are driving us in the American direction. This is yet another example of a so-called free market that is profoundly dysfunctional.Even though global demand for beef is rising and prices are relatively high, most British farmers make a loss from rearing beef and depend instead on subsidy from Brussels for their income. The size of the national beef herd is in long-term decline as many give up. Where herds of 30 to 40 beef cattle were common before, the pressure now is to find economies of scale in ever larger herds, with 150 to 200 cattle now nearer a viable minimum. Money is made further up the supply chain by the processers and retailers that work on very high volume and low profit margins, not by farmers. When asked, shoppers say they want the higher welfare standards and environmental protections of locally produced British beef, and supermarkets reflect that demand in their specifications for fresh meat. But the retailers don’t pay British farmers the true cost of production, and use the threat of imports that are cheaper to hold prices down. Less than half of beef sold in the UK is actually processed here in the food service sector – when we can’t see the label – only around a quarter of beef is British.Oligopolies in the retail and food service sectors are mirrored in the processing sector, where there has been remorseless merger and acquisition activity as abattoirs seek to match the power of big supermarket and fast-food buyers. Just four abattoir groups control more than three-quarters of UK red meat processing: ABP, Dawn, which has recently merged with Dunbia, 2Sisters and Morrisons, which retains its own supply chain. The proposed merger of Sainsbury’s and Asda will concentrate markets even further. Hardline Brexit free-marketeers never seem to extend their passion for liberal economics to breaking this tendency towards monopoly.Despite the specific demand for British beef, the money paid to British beef farmers is linked to prices on global commodity markets, supplied by mega-producers in the Americas. They operate to very different standards, using carcinogenic steroid hormones to promote rapid growth, and mass medicating with antibiotics. Michael Gove as environment, food and rural affairs secretary has said that Brexit will enable us to make sure public money only goes to farmers who deliver public benefits. He has said he wants subsidies to reward farmers for preserving soil health and the beauty of the natural landscape while also maintaining high welfare standards. But he has also been a strong proponent of a US trade deal that would open up our markets to cheaper imports of food. The US has made clear that accepting its agricultural standards has to be the basis for any deal.The industry’s nightmare scenario is that Gove makes it stick to one set of rules here while opening up our markets to cheaper, dirtier imports from outside the EU. That could be the death knell for British beef. The sight of intensive units on British soil has at least flushed the choices out in to the open. We all need to talk about what sort of meat we want before it is too late.• Felicity Lawrence is a special correspondent for the  and author of Not on the Label and Eat Your Heart Out"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cd36d31123bdf261f295413e009032a7912d50bd/0_126_3072_1843/master/3072.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f83b5ac142c133b48f4181f99dd76acd","title":"italy brexit eu","story":"George Soros is not exactly an insurgent leader from central casting, but you certainly can’t fault the billionaire philanthropist for his frankness. “The EU is in an existential crisis,” Soros said in a speech in Paris this week, before adding: “Everything that could go wrong has gone wrong.”With Italy compounding Europe’s woes in the wake of the Brexit vote and the rise of rightwing populism more generally, it takes nerve to choose this of all moments to launch a fightback for Europe. Yet this is precisely what Soros proposes. There’s an audacity about his approach that echoes the French general Ferdinand Foch’s message to his commander-in-chief: “My centre is giving way, my right is retreating, situation excellent, I am attacking.”What made that bold message in 1914 so splendid was that Foch went on to win his battle. But can Soros also win this political battle against the odds? Can those who want to preserve not just the European Union project but more specifically Britain’s association with it, win theirs? The heart says both that they must, and also that they can. The head says it will require more than bravado and Soros’s money.The importance of leadership in politics is widely understood. That of timing less so. But success in politics, as the wily French diplomat Prince Talleyrand once observed about treason, depends a lot on dates. All politicians know there are times when public opinion is ready for change, and times when it digs in against it. There are tides in these affairs. Get them wrong, and your campaign is left high and dry. Catch them on the full and you can be swept towards your goal. So it is with attempts to save Britain from Brexit.Back in the immediate aftermath of the EU referendum, it was futile and arrogant to insist that Brexit should immediately be stopped. That didn’t make the cause of stopping it less just or less necessary. But any such effort naturally offended the electorate’s sense of fairness. This wasn’t the time to challenge it. Theresa May undoubtedly got that.That may be changing now. There are several reasons why the 2016 verdict no longer enjoys absolute sway. The embarrassing legacies of the referendum process are one. The slapdash amateurism of the negotiation process is another. The botched general election is a third. A significant degree of buyers’ remorse among Labour leave voters may be a sign of the change, as an assessment by the pollster Peter Kellner suggested last week.But the most important reason is simply that, over time, two things have become clearer. The first is that leaving the EU is long on risk and short on guaranteed reward. The second is that the time for facing that verdict is arriving. The question facing Britain in the summer of 2018 is not whether to reverse the 2016 vote, it is whether the terms of British withdrawal from the EU are terms that should be accepted or not. Time – and the efforts of the House of Lords – have started to allow that view a fairer hearing.Or rather, they were beginning to do so before the Italian crisis exploded last weekend. Had it not been for this, it was becoming increasingly likely that the House of Commons would set conditions for an EU-UK relationship that would end in a rejection of the deal or on a significant last-minute scuttle by May herself towards a softer Brexit, a longer transition and a much closer alignment with Europe. It was becoming increasingly hard to imagine that the red-white-and-blue Brexit of which May spoke in 2016 has any realistic chance of coming to fruition.The Italian crisis may derail some of these judgments. Carlo Cottarelli’s technocratic government is unlikely to survive for long. If Italy, as seems likely, holds early elections in which its continuing eurozone participation is a central and explicit issue, this will preoccupy not just Italians but the entire European political class. If Italy elects an explicitly anti-EU majority, this will become a full-scale challenge to Europe’s existing institutions and policies.In those circumstances, Brexit does not merely become a second-order issue for the EU. Any Brexit deal would also resonate differently in Britain. The EU with which British MPs and voters may be asked to approve a deal this autumn could be a less stable and predictable political entity. The fear is that this would play into the hands of May’s caution and Jeremy Corbyn’s anti-EU instincts.In his Paris speech, Soros rightly argued that Europe and Britain had a common interest in a reformed EU. Such a Europe would distinguish better the EU and the eurozone, by making clear that EU membership can be explicitly multi-track and does not entail joining the eurozone. It would acknowledge that current eurozone rules must be changed and loosened.The problem with this vision of Europe is not that it would not work. It would almost certainly work far better than the present version, and would potentially draw some of the sting of nationalist movements around Europe, and make Europe more attractive in Britain. The problem is that it is not seriously on offer. A multi-track Europe was precisely what David Cameron sought to secure in his 2015-16 negotiations. He didn’t get it. That rejection was followed by Brexit.Yet these may be times for Europe to take a big gamble. It has to change to survive. Time and tide do not bring about change by themselves. Change happens when time and tide are seized by political leaders who know what change to make. In the era of May and Corbyn, it is hard to see who such British leaders might be. But the opportunity is opening, and the time is now."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/172095eccd29c62ef0c7c2fa238c11a986b8bed8/42_159_5426_3255/master/5426.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cd45dc579df1d97a90994da48b5462ea","title":"menopause women stories scotland","story":"For those who still think that the menopause is the punchline to a joke (albeit told by someone who has never experienced a night sweat), the advent of a men-only menopause awareness session at the Scottish parliament was the cause of some consternation. Organised by the Holyrood Women’s Network, and led by the Good Morning Britain regular Hilary Jones, last week’s Q\u0026ampA aimed to educate male MSPs about the physiological challenges facing middle-aged female colleagues and staff. Critics have understandably found it easier to complain about the waste of taxpayers’ money than admit that the whole notion of women’s ageing, leaky bodies being discussed in a public place makes them feel a bit yucky.I don’t remember much about puberty these days, aside from endless attempts to disguise sanitary products in fuschia plastic holders to avoid alerting the world to the shameful fact that I was bleeding. But I certainly don’t recall learning about the menopause during my patchy sex ed lessons. As an adult consumer, used to having my desire for hand-rearedorganicparaben-free products sold back to me with a hefty markup, it never fails to amaze me that we prize the “natural” in everything else other than the female body.But the campaign against period poverty that has gained momentum over the past few years has battered through those taboos effectively. While the focus has been on the substantial minority of women and girls who miss work or school, or use rolled-up newspaper or rags because they can’t afford basic sanitary wear, talking about the bloody reality of a monthly menstrual cycle seems to have gone some way to diminishing the stigma\u0026nbspmore broadly.There have been particular successes in Scotland, thanks to grassroots groups such as Women for Independence, alongside campaigning MSPs such as the SNP’s Gillian Martin and Scottish Labour’s Monica Lennon. Yesterday, the Scottish government announced the national rollout of an Aberdeenshire scheme to provide free period products to poorer families, and there is cross-party backing for a bill to introduce a universal system of free sanitary provision. Across the country, it is becoming increasingly common to walk into a women’s toilet and find free products by the sinks, as inidual institutions – from the Holyrood parliament to Celtic’s Parkhead stadium – take up the gauntlet.It’s a pleasing reminder of the symbiosis between consciousness-raising and results-focused activism, and that one is half-done without the other. The Menopause Cafe movement is another example. Founded last June in Perth by local counsellor Rachel Weiss, these non-profit gatherings are blossoming across the UK as women seize the opportunity to identify symptoms together, share solutions, and say the previously unsayable.I wasn’t surprised that Menopause Cafes began in Scotland: one of the unremarked-upon consequences of the 2014 independence referendum was the way that it politically galvanised older women – iniduals with personal and professional hinterland, often newly free of caring responsibilities – to make a difference in their communities.It seems to me that it is assumed that women are endlessly rabbiting at one another about their gruesome bodily functions, passing down intergenerational nuggets in the queue for the self-checkout. But such sisterly illuminations happen less and less in these days of hyper-busyness, fractured communities, and the online imperative to keep things either porn-perfect or Facebook prim – the site has infamously censored photographs of breastfeeding women. I remember the surprise at my NCT class when the pregnant partners were separated from our menfolk so that we might more easily ventilate our concerns about shitting ourselves during labour. (In the event, that discussion assumed far more vanity than the circumstances allowed for.)According to Weiss, talking in a cafe setting fortifies women for talking elsewhere: “If you are able to say the M-word, then it’s also easier for you to go back to your 28-year-old male manager and say, ‘I need to wear a cotton shirt with this uniform,’ or ‘Yes, I really do need a fan at my desk.’”Any woman over 30 who has clocked comedian Amy Schumer’s brilliant sketch in which she stumbles upon her comedy heroines Tiny Fey and Patricia Arquette clinking wine glasses with Julia Louis-Dreyfus to celebrate her “last fuckable day” – as spuriously determined by male film execs – will have felt a shiver of recognition. Women are trained from birth to monitor their own bodies constantly and to work tirelessly to stop them becoming messy, chaotic or old.But beyond the Hollywood lens, women live, love, work, thrive and campaign long after they have stopped having periods. No wonder more and more of us, at all ages, want to say so out loud.• Libby Brookes is the ’s Scotland correspondent"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fbd79d6ccf60f108f9bc361faa3836ca3e842043/337_313_2446_1468/master/2446.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c18796281e48711efa958f14dece5ece","title":"roseanne ambien racism tweet side effect response sanofi","story":"After the comedian partly blamed her controversial tweets on taking the sedative, drug-maker Sanofi released a statementThe drug manufacturer Sanofi has clarified that one of its most popular medications, the sedative Ambien, does not cause racism.

The next morning, you may not remember that you did anything during the night … reported activities include: driving a car (“sleep-driving”), making and eating food, talking on the phone, having sex.”In a separate tweet, Barr said she was “not giving excuses for what I did” but that she had previously “cracked eggs on the wall at 2am” after taking the drug.Replying to the radio host David Pakman, who had mocked her Ambien tweet, Barr also wrote: “I have had odd ambien experiences on tweeting late at night-like many other ppl do. I BLAME MYSELF OK? it’s just an explanation not an excuse, Ok, bully?”Barr’s tweet led to Ambien quickly becoming a meme on social media.

Now the future of these groups is under review after a Facebook page dedicated to shutting them down posted hundreds of accounts of inappropriate behaviour allegedly perpetrated by drinking society members, including sexual misconduct, bullying and classism.The anonymous claims on Grudgebridge include members of a male drinking society sexually harassing “attractive fresher girls” after confiscating their keys and phones a male member of a society saying female students would “be going home in wheelchairs” after an event and a drinking society member trying to ban someone from entering a bar because they went to a state school.Have you had experience of a drinking society at a university that you would like to discuss with our journalists?You can share your experiences by filling in this encrypted form – anonymously if you wish. Your responses will only be seen by the  and we’ll feature some of your responses in our reporting. You can read terms of service\u0026nbsphere.In response to the allegations, Cambridge University Student Union (CUSU) is to draw up a code of conduct for drinking societies with members and student sexual harassment campaigners, Cambridge for Consent, which should be in place by the end of term.The CUSU student president, Daisy Eyre, said the union’s governing body was also expected to vote on whether to campaign for the end of drinking societies. However, other senior student representatives said the Facebook campaign amounted to an “online fatwa”, with several allegations removed from the page because they were false.Although the student concerned was not a member of the Crescents, the society was disbanded due to the incident, which is being investigated by Trinity Hall.The original administrator of Grudgebridge, who shot the video of the Crescents society, said he then began the campaign to shut down all drinking societies because they reinforced the university’s old boys network and undermined efforts to improve access for working class and black and minority ethnic applicants.The student, who wishes to remain anonymous, said prior to Grudgebridge there had been a passive resignation about the behaviour of drinking societies by the university. He added: “Now it feels like these lads are shitting themselves over what might come out.”The student, who described himself as being lower middle class, added that part of the reason why he had started the campaign was because he went to Eton on a full scholarship. “I know the feeling of being acutely aware of being in a different class,” he said.The page is now administered by two female students who said it complimented the university’s Breaking the Silence campaign, which allows students to anonymously report sexual misconduct and has led to a huge rise in such complaints. “Drinking societies aren’t actually responding to Breaking the Silence until now when they’re at risk – when they’ve been exposed,” said one of the administrators.The other administrator said they had attended one drinking society event in their first term where only attractive white female freshers were invited. “There was the most vile attention and behaviour towards girls by second and third year boys,” she said. “Trying to get girls to sit on their lap. Trying to get them as drunk as possible. We were told that last year three girls had been spiked.”Eyre said Grudgebridge had provoked a “seismic shift” in attitudes towards drinking societies at the university. She added: “It’s like the annoyance that has been bubbling up for years has erupted.”Eyre, who wrote her dissertation on masculinity and the university drinking societies, added: “The norms inside those societies are so warped. It is a crystallised version of lad culture where the jokes are coded in racist, sexist, homophobic deeply intolerant ways. They believe that making jokes - like it’s fine if you slept with the girl who’s passed out - is acceptable and funny.”Andreas Bedorf, who sits on the CUSU council as the president of Downing College’s graduate students, said the Grudgebridge campaigns “reminds me of a witch hunt or inquisition”.Bedorf, who is a member of the college’s men’s rowing and drinking society, Downing Tribe, said he had made several fake submissions to the Facebook page, one of which had been published. Grudgebridge’s administrators acknowledged that some false submissions had been posted, including quotes from the play Posh, which depicts a fictionalised version of Oxford University’s Bullingdon Club. They added they were unable to verify posts due to the high number of submissions but they did remove them on request.A university spokeswoman said colleges were in discussion with their student representatives on a joint approach to unofficial drinking societies and allegations of distressing behaviour, including bullying, peer pressure to drink dangerously, social exclusion and anything that falls under disciplinary procedures."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/227bc4022d54bdea8ed5a1071479f1dc1d5e7d4f/0_58_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d576d1bcecc9444f2540106a599d2c93","title":"ucas criticised over screening of black applicants","story":"Labour MP David Lammy calls for greater transparency in university admissions processThe university admissions service Ucas is under pressure after an investigation revealed that more than half of all applications flagged for possible fraud are from black students.Ucas conducted its investigation after a freedom of information request by the Independent earlier this year indicated the process for investigating fraud in university applications was far more likely to demand proof of claims from black applicants than white ones.That request focused on figures for 2017, but Ucas’s subsequent investigation shows the same pattern over a five-year period, with a total of 2,675 black applicants being flagged out of an applicant population of 260,550.Ucas’s chief executive Clare Marchant said the investigation had shown that applications were only being cancelled where there was clear evidence of fraud or missing information. But she said “there is more work for us to do to ensure that flagging is as robust as it can be across all areas of the verification service.”One of the areas of potential weakness identified by Ucas was the industry standard fraud detection software it deploys as one method of screening applications. It uses an accumulation of historic data as a reference that may have contributed to the results.Ucas said enhancements had already been made to the fraud detection service. It also promised to introduce an additional review of all applications prior to cancellation to avoid errors and said it would ensure that all staff had up-to-date unconscious bias training.The former education minister and Labour MP David Lammy called for greater transparency in the university admissions process. “Ucas need to explain why over half of all flagged applicants are black, despite black students accounting for just one in 10 applications,” he said.“Ucas needs to be able to explain this huge disproportionality and satisfy students from ethnic minorities that their applications will be looked upon fairly.”Overall the total number of university applications flagged for further investigation was small – out of 2.9 million applicants over the past five years 5,160 applications were flagged, of which just over 2,000 were then cancelled.The screening process was designed to spot fake qualifications, plagiarised personal statements and inaccurate information which could give would-be students an unfair advantage. In all the screening systems used Ucas insisted ethnicity and nationality played no part.The findings come amid growing concern about the experiences of black and ethnic minority students studying at universities and colleges in the UK, and mounting anger that they remain underrepresented in the country’s top universities.Lammy, who has campaigned on this issue, said: “I have long been concerned about the lack of transparency in our admissions process as a result of Ucas refusing to publish all of its access data openly.“This is clearly a necessary change so that we can fully understand what is going on within our university admissions process across the board.” Ucas has since said that figures on its verification service would now be published annually.A Department for Education spokesman said any bias against people due to their ethnicity or background was completely unacceptable and welcomed the Ucas investigation.“We have seen record entry rates at universities across all ethnic groups, but we recognise there is more to do. We have introduced sweeping reforms through the Higher Education and Research Act requiring all universities to publish applications, offers and acceptance rates broken down by gender, ethnicity and socioeconomic background.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b2a8783f1fbe7753dd17cbc95d7e7e8e3ec3daac/0_28_1086_652/master/1086.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=31a231de549868843b2b6045f8791a21","title":"rise ultra cyclists london wales london audax","story":"With no spectators, no bags of freebies and no medals, the 400km London-Wales-London ride provides a welcome antidote to overblown sportives“Cycling far?” asks a woman in the bakery as a group of us queues for coffee and sausage rolls, as well as an all-important receipt to prove we passed through Tewkesbury.“Er … London to Wales,” replies a cyclist behind me. A pause. “And back.” It must be hard not to look smug – he’s probably been dying for someone to ask him that all day.This is my first taste of audax: a noncompetitive form of long-distance cycling that traces its history to the 1890s, not long after the invention of the modern bicycle. I was expecting old men on steel-framed bikes with calves cast from iron and glasses held together with gaffer tape, cake and clipboards in dusty village halls, and checkpoints on bleak petrol station forecourts. Only part of that was true.A few years ago I wouldn’t have been far wrong. The London-Wales-London ride had been running for decades under the name of Severn Across, and until recent years the average turnout was around 35 riders.But ultra-distance cycling has surged in popularity. Just as runners who have tackled a few regular marathons might think “what now?” and have a go at an ultramarathon, increasing numbers of cyclists are looking for something more than a 100-mile sportive. This appears to be down partly to self-supported races like the Transcontinental across Europe and the 6,800km Transamerica, partly to the profile of riders like the late Mike Hall and partlyto that familiar human urge to try for a little bit more.Spend any time looking into ultra-distance and audax events and you’ll soon hear about the 1,200km Paris-Brest-Paris and the 1,400km London-Edinburgh-London, which are both held every four years.Last year, organiser Liam FitzPatrick rebranded the Severn Across ride as London-Wales-London. This year the event sold out in under eight hours. FitzPatrick opened a waiting list but closed it once he had another 75 names. The flow of emails from disappointed riders continued right up to the big day.So what I got when I arrived at Chalfont St Peter community centre at 6am on a bright May Saturday morning was a lot of fit cyclists, some expensively cut Lycra and merino, a clutch of carbon bikes … and the odd crusty old-timer. Conscious that it’s all too easy to overdo it early on – a lesson learned from a few ultramarathons – I pottered along comfortably enough to the first checkpoint at Woodstock after 70km. I was somewhat surprised to be greeted by a full fry-up – some of the old reputation clearly still rings true – but I’d missed breakfast so wasn’t complaining.There is time to chat to fellow riders, so I struck up conversations, asking people about their setups (lots had dynamo hubs to generate electricity for lights and GPS units) and trying to pick up ideas for future events. Many are aiming for Paris-Brest-Paris next year, and a fair few tackled London-Edinburgh-London in 2017. The growth of ultra-distance cycling can be seen in the participation numbers for that event: 29 starters in 1989, 1,500 last year.FitzPatrick had warned me before the event that the mental challenge could be tougher than the physical. “What makes it difficult isn’t so much the speed, it’s that you’ve got time to think,” he said. “If your thighs hurt or you’ve got saddle sores then you might have another eight hours of this, grinding you down. When it’s three in the morning, when you’ve had a couple of punctures, when it’s cold and wet … that’s when it gets to you.”His advice for finishing successfully was to pay extra attention to staying hydrated (easy to forget on long events) and not to spend too long riding alone, especially at night.Following his first suggestion, I stopped to refill my water bottles outside the three staffed checkpoints – which meant I did spend some time on godforsaken petrol station forecourts. For the second, I teamed up with fellow rider Alex Kew when we found ourselves at the same pace.It’s not always easy to know when to hold back or when to press on, but I eased off when he was struggling up Yat Rock he paid that back many times once he’d recovered. As a time trialist, Alex couldn’t help himself every time we hit a long straight A-road – he was on the front, head down, powering away, and all I had to do was stick to his back wheel. The miles flew by. Darkness fell. Surrounded by silence but for the whirr of wheels and the sound of breathing, we negotiated gravelly, potholed single-track roads at 30mph with just a pair of small lights to fight the pitch-black night. The company took a lot of stress out of it.London-Wales-London is not a race (technically it’s a randonné). Riders are free to complete the 407km at whatever speed they want so long as they average 15-30kph. That made the earliest allowable finish 10.30pm the latest was 9am the next day.With no serious mechanicals, Alex and I rolled into Chalfont just before midnight. The fastest riders – including world 24-hour time trial champion Jasmijn Muller – were back before it got dark. The last rolled in at 8.20am. London-Wales-London (or Chalfont-Chepstow-Chalfont, as one wag had it) certainly lives up to its epic new name. Whether you’re an old-school audaxer or someone dressed head to toe in Rapha with a fetish for sleeping in bus shelters, it’s a welcoming way to explore. And it’s an antidote to overblown sportives. Rolling in after 407km, we got our brevet cards stamped and tucked into warming bowls of homemade daal. There were no spectators lining the finish chute, no bag of freebies, no medals – but it was all the better for it.London-Wales-London 2019 will run on 4 May"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8ede3aea4d48e8f05a90beb3c8077ca2e61752f7/12_666_1971_1183/master/1971.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a7b91369fd6f6d84dd85eec79be28eec","title":"what a tees 10 of the best summer t shirts","story":"T-shirts are the only acceptable top in this weird, mixed, humid and sort of hot weather.

It is his Weimar danse macabre, at the centre of which is Lulu, a beautiful woman who is a serial seducer and serial survivor, finally to fall victim to Jack the Ripper in London. This nauseous twist of fate is the final torsion of satire and melodrama for someone who is the plaything of her own fatal glamour.The movie is based on the two plays by Frank Wedekind – Earth Spirit (1895) and Pandora’s Box (1905). Louise Brooks plays the showgirl and adventuress Lulu, and her serene yet calculating beauty is framed in a severe black bob, of almost helmet-like shininess and purpose – the very last word in amoral cosmopolitan chic. She is the New Realist flapper of 1930s Germany. That hair is a brilliant signature of her identity. When she escapes the law, it is crucially changed to a more conventional style, combed back from the forehead – as a disguise, of course, and she is indeed almost unrecognisable like that. But when Lulu finally fetches up in London, the hair comes tumbling back down and the bob starts to reassemble itself, though as a dishevelled parody of its former bewitching glory.Lulu is the mistress of a wealthy publisher, Dr Ludwig Schön (Fritz Kortner) whom she one day humiliates by entertaining an old man called Schigolch (Carl Götz) at the apartment he’s paying for she describes him fondly to Schön as her “first patron”. In this apartment we can glimpse what appears to be a menorah, but with its central candlestick missing.Disgusted with himself, and resolving to tear himself away from this involvement, Schön curtly tells her that he is engaged to be married to a high-born young woman, Charlotte Von Zarkikov (Daisy D’Ora). As a way of finessing a diplomatic break from Lulu, he encourages her to take part in a musical revue being produced by his son Alwa (Franz Lederer) with costumes designed by Countess Anna Geschwitz (Alice Roberts) – both of whom are in love with her.But when Dr Schön brings his fiancee Charlotte backstage on Lulu’s opening night, she refuses to go on – refuses to dance for “that woman”. Agonised, intimately humiliated, infatuated, Dr Schön realises that he is still in her thrall, breaks off his engagement and later confronts Lulu with a revolver. It leads to a fatal catastrophe, weirdly presented in this silent movie. It is a gunshot that makes no noise: the musical score here does not represent it with a timpani blast. Schön just reels away. It causes a trial for murder, from which Lulu escapes with the help of a vaudeville strongman Rodrigo Quast (Krafft-Raschig) and finally hides out on a riverboat gambling den. And all this in the company of the infatuated Alwa, who is addicted to the woman who killed his father: doomed to a self-hating love.Lulu is described acidly in court by the state prosecutor as being like that “Pandora” of classical mythology who had a box or jar containing all the evils of this world – Pabst contrives a cutaway to her defending attorney’s contemptuous face. What an absurd flight of fancy, he clearly thinks. And, yes, it is absurd, but not quite in the way he thinks. Pandora is dangerous and toxic, but she has been made that way by her admirers. Her beauty and her ambition are all that she has she is no more conceited and manipulative than the men.And when she is on the run, all that allure coagulates, as if through some hideous chemical reaction, into shame. First they wanted sex from Lulu, now it is money. Everyone, it seems, wants to blackmail Lulu now that there is a price on her head. The capital at her disposal – that brazen public sexiness – has turned into a terrible liability.The London sequence at the end is a strange and mysterious coda, foggy, gloomy, with Salvation Army people trudging earnestly about. It is Christmas, the subject of sickly-sentimental sub-Dickensian references to Christmas trees and Christmas puddings. Jack the Ripper is not as he has come quaintly to be imagined – the sinister top-hatted toff silhouette in the mist. He just looks like a desperate, scruffy, homeless man, who manages to persuade kind-hearted Lulu to spend some time with him, despite the fact that he doesn’t have any money. It’s extravagantly sexual and mad, and Lulu is herself as Scott Fitzgerald might have described her: beautiful and damned."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8ff68bc5cef4df3598b9910c4c1bc9139d4fa7d6/0_419_3777_2266/master/3777.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3ed0b914142bda24a5db5fa371f0e67c","title":"a beginners guide to the world cup 2018 when does the world cup start","story":"From when does the World Cup start to who’s likely to win football’s greatest prize – the 2018 tournament explainedThe Fifa World Cup is an international football tournament contested by 32 nations every four years. This year’s competition kicks off on 14 June, when hosts Russia play Saudi Arabia in Moscow’s Luzhniki Stadium. After a total of 64 matches played in 12 venues across 11 different Russian cities, the champions will be crowned in the same arena on 14 July. It is, without question, the biggest, most prestigious sporting event on the planet.OK, so who organises it and for how long has it been “a thing”?Fifa stands for the Féderation Internationale de Football Association and their third president Jules Rimet was the innovator behind the first World Cup, an invitational tournament contested by just 13 teams that was staged and won by Uruguay in 1930. This year’s tournament will be the 21st.With just 32 teams taking part, an awful lot of nations must miss out. That hardly seems fair.With the exception of Russia, who qualify automatically as hosts, the other 31 teams all had to go through a rigorous two-year qualifying process to make it this far. Fifa has 211 national association affiliates spread across six different confederations around the globe.Did any traditionally “big” countries not make it?England were the only “home nation” to qualify, while Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland all failed with varying degrees of predictability. The USA, the Netherlands, South American champions Chile, Africa Cup of Nations winners Cameroon and the four-times World Cup winners Italy are among the most high profile nations to miss out on qualification for Russia 2018. For many international powerhouses, qualifying is invariably little more than a formality. For others it is an incredible achievement.Iceland will contest their first World Cup finals this summer and with a population of just 335,000 are the smallest country to qualify in the history of the competition.How will a winner be decided from those who did make the cut?The 32 countries have already been drawn into eight groups of four teams which will be decided on a round robin basis. The top two teams from each group advance to the knockout stages, which is when things start to get really tense.What happens if any of these knockout matches end in a draw?If the sides are level after 90 minutes, they play an additional 30 minutes of extra time.And if they’re still level?The outcome is decided by a penalty shoot-out. There have been 26 in World Cup finals history and both Brazil (1994) and Italy (2006) have actually won finals by this very stressful method.Who is expected to win this year’s tournament?It’s a tough one to call. Germany are the holders and are expected to be in the shake-up again, while Brazil, France, Spain and Argentina are other former winners who many expect to do well.Have England ever won the World Cup?Once, in 1966 and they’re still dining out on it over 50 years later.Tell me more ...As tournament hosts, they beat Germany 4-2 in the final at Wembley Stadium to win the Jules Rimet Trophy.The what now?The Jules Rimet Trophy. It was originally called Victory but later renamed in honour of the Fifa president who dreamt up the World Cup. Brazil got to keep it after winning it for the third time in 1970, but it was stolen 13 years later and has never been returned.So what do the winners get now?Acclaim, medals, hero status in their homeland and a hefty financial bonus from their national Football Association. They also get presented with the Fifa World Cup trophy, which is just shy of 37 centimetres in height and weighs 6.1 kilograms. Made of 18 carat gold with a malachite base, it depicts two human figures holding up the earth. It is arguably the most iconic trophy in all of sport.Such a popular event must generate a lot of cash. Who gets it all?Anything else I should know?This year’s tournament will be the first World Cup in which Video Assistant Referees (VAR) will be used to help referees avoid making potentially match-deciding mistakes when it comes to such important issues as awarding goals, penalties or doling out red cards. It will also referees avoid cases of mistaken identity, as has been known to happen from time to time.Sounds like a good idea ...It certainly does in theory, but many are predicting disaster once it’s put into practice. VAR has been tested in a number of tournaments around the world, often with hilarious consequences and a number of referees will arrive in Russia with no prior experience of using it. While Fifa are confident it will be a success, many doom-mongers are predicting that VAR could become the main, unwelcome talking point of Russia 2018.If I want to sound knowledgable in front of people who know more about the World Cup than I do, what should I say?“It’s strange that nobody is mentioning Uruguay as likely winners even though they finished ahead of Argentina in their qualifying group.”If I want to sound knowledgable in front of people who know more about the World Cup than I do, what should I not say?“It’s strange that nobody is mentioning England as likely winners even though they finished ahead of Scotland in their qualifying group.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/321fb67c44181d39a421f4877a5b39915b754da1/755_28_2079_1247/master/2079.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d7e5ae91e60237845024e77da47f4dad","title":"cafu picks his all time brazil xi","story":"The brilliant full-back picks his all-time side from an impossibly talented group of players who have represented Brazil down the years. Now you can do the same with our interactive toolWow, choosing the Brazil best XI of all time – that’s a tough one. There are so many brilliant players in each position, and that means some great players will miss out. My team is set up in a super offensive formation. We might concede a lot of goals, but we would score so many more. In fact, I can guarantee five goals every game!The best form of defence is to have the ball. A team with Falcão, Zico and Rivellino at its heart could play for years without making a mistake in possession. When you have the ball, you don’t have a problem. That is my philosophy in choosing my all-time Brazil XI.The goalkeeper in my special team is Cláudio Taffarel. He was so calm, smooth and peaceful, always giving us confidence on the field. He didn’t do anything fancy, never jumped or ed unnecessarily and always had the ball under control. He played three World Cups, always as Brazil’s No 1. That is not an easy achievement.My right-back is Carlos Alberto Torres. Whether defending or attacking, he was always good. Carlos was a great leader, but his technique was even more incredible. His famous goal against Italy in 1970 was such a beautiful, powerful strike.The two central defenders are Aldair and Lúcio. They never played together, but I believe that they would form an amazing partnership. Aldair was very calm, never made a bad tackle and his positioning was incredible. He was my team-mate at Roma and with the Seleção – he saved my life many times when I was attacking. Lúcio was more aggressive and intense. He scored many goals, and had a great passing range and all-round quality.Left-back, for sure, is Roberto Carlos. A world champion, he played at a high level for many years, with the same quality and intensity whether defending or attacking. He was a giant. I have never seen a shot as powerful as his. He had a missile in his leg!Midfield is the hardest area of the team to pick. There are many, many players who could play in the middle of a Brazil dream team, but I can only pick four. First, my defensive midfielder is Paulo Roberto Falcão, who starred in the 1982 World Cup. He was a smart player, a legend with an elegance rarely seen on a football pitch. The king of assists, he never misplaced a pass or made a mistake.In front of Falcão, I have chosen a ‘super trio’ of attacking midfielders. The first is Rivellino. His elastico move was beautiful, like something from another planet. I love him! He was the best dribbler of a football ever.My other two midfielders are Zico and Rivaldo. Zico was intelligent, had incredible vision and could strike a superb free-kick. A foul around the area was as good as a goal to him. As for Rivaldo, he was a genius. Come on! It was so wonderful to see him with the ball. He played with the same style as Falcão. Rivaldo was brilliant.Picking the two attackers is easy. The first is the best player of all time – Pelé. Do I need to say anything more? The athlete of the century, he scored more than 1,000 goals, and won the World Cup three times. He was complete. I don’t need to say anything more. Pelé is Pelé. No one can beat him.Pelé’s partner up front is Ronaldo. He was incredible too. You had to pay attention to both feet with Ronaldo as they were as good as each other. He was an example to other players, too. He suffered three serious injuries during his career, and was always fighting against these problems.

The East Midlands club, who lost to Fulham in the Championship play-off semi-finals, have been without a manager since Gary Rowett left to take over at Stoke City last week but have now confirmed the 39-year-old’s appointment.Lampard told Derby’s website: “I’ve always wanted to manage a club with a big tradition and history like Derby County, so this is a huge opportunity. I have spent considerable time discussing the role and the club’s objectives with the chairman and board members.“We want to build on the club’s top-six finish in the Championship last season, while at the same time bringing through some of the excellent youth and academy talent we have at Pride Park.“This is my first job as a manager, but I’ve worked closely with some of the best coaches in the game and I’m confident in my own abilities and those of the team around me, including the board. I know it won’t be easy – managing a football team never is – but I’m really looking forward to the challenge ahead.”Lampard retired as a player in 2016 after a spell at New York City. He started his career at West Ham and, either side of his long period with Chelsea, had stints with Swansea City (on loan) and Manchester City. He made 106 appearances for England.Derby’s executive chairman, Mel Morris, said: “His passion and humility shone through in equal measure. The board were unanimous that he was the stand-out applicant with many highly desirable and unique capabilities.“Few players have achieved what Frank has in his career to date. He’s a winner, a leader who knows what it takes to succeed and who has the character and charisma to be a fantastic manager for us.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/665eac50b8c902e4431f1a41446c2f8c32596379/0_79_2109_1265/master/2109.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e40c333a5f89cd3947a87de290d8ecd3","title":"portugal world cup 2018 team guide tactics key players and expert predictions","story":"European Champions have a favourable draw and excellent attacking options but an ageing defence could let them downThis article is part of the ’s 2018 World Cup Experts’ Network, a cooperation between some of the best media organisations from the 32 countries who have qualified for Russia. the is running previews from two countries each day in the run-up to the tournament kicking off on 14 June.Portugal will play this year’s World Cup as European champions, so any dark horse tag has disappeared, but this also means the inferiority complex that has often conditioned the team has been overthrown. The head coach, Fernando Santos, refuses to speak of his team as favourites for the tournament, although he does suggest the ambition is the same as at Euro 2016.Two years on from their triumph in France, Portugal have problems in defence: the centre-backs who featured then do not offer the same guarantees and it has been difficult to find alternatives. José Fonte had a terrible time at West Ham and now plays in China and Ricardo Carvalho has retired from international football. Santos admitted recently that he was willing to experiment with uncapped players, something he had discarded only a few months earlier, including a call-up for Benfica’s Rúben Dias in March, but that was foiled by injury.Dias, in the end, made his debut against Tunisia at the end of May while, also in that game, Leicester City’s new signing Ricardo Pareira, was handed his first start at full-back. There were still problems defensively, however, and especially after Pepe had been substituted and the game ended 2-2.In better news, Portugal seem to have more attacking options and Éder, the hero of 2016, is unlikely to play in Russia. “I understand that emotional part but we don’t have to pay him anything,” Santos said after qualification for Russia was confirmed. “I paid him the way I felt I should pay: I called him and explained why I haven’t been picking him.” Éder was, however, included in the 35-man provisional squad named on 15 May.Players such as Bernardo Silva, André Silva and Gelson Martins give more flair in attack, although Santos has not abandoned the structure that led the team to the European title.The 2016 campaign received some criticism regarding the style of play, despite the historic achievement, but Santos continues to brush off such concerns: “We’re here to win. And we play with our weapons. That’s what I want. I can’t understand the idea of a team that loses but delivers a great game. It makes me confused.”Santos is expected to stay faithful to a 4-4-2 (with 4-3-3 as the plan B), with Cristiano Ronaldo leading the line alongside André Silva, and the focus on an organised defence with swift counterattacks.Which player is going to surprise everyone at the World Cup?Bruno Fernandes. He was Portugal’s Under-21 captain and had impressed in Serie A, with Udinese and Sampdoria, before exceeding all expectations at Sporting in 2017-18. He may not start the tournament but will fight for a place, either in the middle or on the wing.Which player is likely to disappoint?Fernando Santos will have a hard time choosing Pepe’s partner in central defence. Bruno Alves seemed to have won that place in qualifying but had a difficult season with Rangers and played only six league games in 2018. At 36 he is hardly in ideal physical condition either.What is the realistic aim for Portugal at the World Cup and why?Although Portugal are European champions, the bar for the World Cup has to be at the usual height: pass the group stage and then think game by game. There are plenty of candidates who have a better chance but Portugal should beat Iran and Morocco to qualify with Spain from Group B, and with Group A opponents (Russia, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Uruguay) to choose from in the round of 16 it is realistic for Portugal to aim for the quarter-finals.Nuno Travassos writes for Maisfutebol.Follow him on Twitter here.Click here for a profile of Portugal’s Bernardo Silva."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b0ec6e87c133f90c0cad5d128d89424f764b964e/0_346_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ae3e99f8abc10dc87680270f88398883","title":"how have a zero waste kitchen tips from jamie oliver tom kerridge skye gyngell and more","story":"Restaurants have a daily battle against wasting food. We asked top chefs for their home hacks that will save you money and give your cooking a flavour boostAccording to the campaigning waste charity Wrap, UK households bin 5m tonnes of edible food every year. That is 1.1m tonnes less than in 2007, a drop that, in CO2 terms, is equivalent to taking 2.2m cars off the road each year. But, clearly, there is still a lot that could be done to inspire us to use the ingredients we buy with greater diligence.Tom Tanner, a spokesperson for the Sustainable Restaurant Association (SRA), says: “It’s all very well telling people that the average UK household throws out £700 of food each year, but it can be tough playing Ready Steady Cook at home.” The SRA is attempting to help with its new One Planet Plate recipe site, a global inventory of sustainability-focused restaurant dishes complete with recipes.But faced with a fridge full of turning veg, the wreckage of a Sunday roast or pans of leftover rice, there is no such thing as too much inspiration. In that spirit, we asked a range of chefs who grapple with this issue daily to give us their waste-saving tips. Some are eco-conscious practitioners of nose-to-tail and root-to-fruit cooking (Silo in Brighton is Britain’s first “zero-waste” restaurant), while others are simply trying to keep costs down. Here are their household hacks, aimed at saving you a few quid and giving your cooking a flavour boost. Who said that saving the planet can’t be a win-win?We keep all vegetable peelings. Almost the best flavour is to be found in carrot, beetroot or celeriac skins. We make a simple puree using potato peelings cooked in salted water with herb stalks, then pureed with butter, pepper and buttermilk. To turn that into soup, omit the butter and thin using stock. We also make a peel coleslaw – at this time of year, from asparagus, young carrots, leek tops, beetroot and radish leaves – which you can dress with creme fraiche. Stir in honey, salt and any soft herbs for a nice summer accompaniment to roast chicken.Bread should never be wasted. If you look at great cooking from around the world, bread is often used stale and transformed into all sorts of tasty things, such as the classic Italian tomato and bread soup, pappa al pomodoro, or panzanella (tomato and bread salad). Turn already-stale bread into croutons or, if you know you won’t finish your loaf before it turns, thinly slice it and leave to go stale for perfectly crisp toast – it is a fantastic vehicle for tapenade or bruschetta toppings. And you can always blitz stale bread into breadcrumbs for crispy coatings on fishcakes or to toast and scatter over pasta dishes. Delicious.Take the breasts off a chicken, use the leg meat in a curry and, for a third meal, roast the wings and carcass to make a lovely bone broth. Add madeira wine and roasted vegetables, top it up with water and cook gently with fresh herbs and salt. Don’t boil it it will go cloudy. It surprises people that this clear liquid delivers so much flavour.You can pickle pretty much anything with a 3:2:1 mix of vinegar-water-sugar. If it can’t be pickled, it can usually be frozen. In the restaurant, we sweat vegetables in fat, puree and freeze them. That’s a good soup base. You can freeze herbs or salad leaves and mix them with oil to make sauces and pestos. I use the freezer loads at home. Label everything, though. It’s really important. A permanent marker pen is essential kit.Don’t discard meat fat after cooking. As a child, I’d eat my Filipino mum’s vegetables cooked in pork fat. In a Spanish kitchen, we use traditional recipes that emphasise the need of fat for flavour. We’ve used rendered ibérico fat to cook eggs, to flavour garlic soup and whipped like aioli to accompany fish. You can store most fats in jars in the fridge and they will be more effective than constantly using that posh olive oil that you should only use for dressing, not frying.Shop little and often. When I used to shop for the week, I’d end up with everything in the fridge going off, especially quick perishables such as salad leaves, tomatoes, cucumber and mushrooms, or going out of date before I got around to cooking it.Why not use the leftover vegetables from your Sunday roast to make pakoras? Any vegetable you have is fine. Thinly slice, add chopped onion, ginger, garlic, whatever spices you like and chickpea flour (about one-fifth of the total), make into balls in your hand, then deep-fry until crispy.The best way to reduce household waste is putting less on your plate. You can always go back for more. As for leftovers, dried fruit skins blitzed into a powder add an intense orange or lemon zest to cakes.Rather than a supermarket cauliflower that has been stripped of all its leaves and wrapped in cellophane, I’d encourage people to get one that has still got its beautiful green plumage. Don’t be afraid of using everything. It’s a versatile vegetable. We saute the florets, stir-fry the leaves or toss them in turmeric and ras-al-hanout and griddle them, and make a puree from the caramelised stalks.When we have a roast on, any ‘leftyeovers’, as we call them, go into the following day’s beef and potato cakes, shallow-fried with a poached egg and hollandaise. That would work a treat at home too.We dry vegetable peelings to make into flavoured salts which we use to season vegetables. It’s really easy: put the peelings on a rack in a really low temperature oven – a lot of modern ovens have a 50C degree setting – leave for three hours, blend in a processor and mix through sea salt.Once squeezed, good unwaxed lemons can be finely sliced, massaged with salt, packed in a jar and, after four days at room temperature, ferment into this lovely sour condiment. Use that as a relish or in any dish to replace lemons. The other day, I made olives, feta and pasta with preserved lemon. It was the best pasta I’ve had for ages.At home, prepare in bulk. Prepare dishes on a larger scale, freezing portions, and leftovers won’t exist. Not everything freezes well, such as rice, but you can cook those items fresh and be precise. Saucy things such as soup, curries and braises can be batch-frozen ready to pull out whenever it’s convenient."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c1dc5dad67781274e8c4548341b87f25b5e6cae3/0_221_3319_1992/master/3319.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cf04ca10ebfbb0e75807f2ada06c0d71","title":"truth about only children insular confident worry","story":"This week, Elizabeth Hurley said she would like to have had more children, as only children are insular. Such stereotypes are entrenched – so should today’s one-child families worry?Nineteenth-century psychologists, it seems fair to say, did not always approve of only children. It was G Stanley Hall, the American psychologist, who claimed being a lone child was “a disease in itself”. Soon afterwards, another psychologist called Eugene W Bohannon offered a devastating analysis of the only child. They were “less venturesome” and “oversensitive” prone to “priggish self-conceit”. An only boy was likely to be “effeminate, both because he associates too little with boys and too much with the mother”. Bohannon did concede that only children were imaginative, though he put this down to “a lack of companionship” and besides, he pointed out, such talents could well be used for “the practice of deception and lying”.Such stereotypes about spoiled, lonely and peculiar only children have endured for more than a century, despite a wealth of research showing lone children are usually none of those things and often do better in many areas than children with siblings. But despite one-child families becoming far more common, our fascination with their implied unusualness endures. This week, the actor and model Elizabeth Hurley – who has a 16-year-old son, Damian – offered her own take on the issue, saying her one regret was not having more than one child. “I was one of three, a big sister and a little brother to squabble with and to love,” she said in an interview with Grazia. “Damian doesn’t have that. They’re very different, single children, more insular but very at ease with themselves, very self-possessed, focused.”There are obvious reasons for this. Often it isn’t due to a choice to stick with one child – or it doesn’t feel like a choice. Delayed parenthood, fertility problems, relationship breakdowns and financial pressures including housing and childcare costs can all result in a single-child family. But at the same time, evidence is mounting to show a one-child family can be a positive choice for both parents and child.Much of the only-child myth-debunking has been done by Toni Falbo, a professor of educational psychology at the University of Texas, who has researched only children since the 1970s. In one meta-analysis of studies, with Denise Polit, the pair found that “across all developmental outcomes, only children were indistinguishable from firstborns and people from small families” and did better than children from large families.As for being awkward and antisocial, one study from 2011 found that while adults who had been only children engaged in fewer social activities with relatives (which may possibly be explained by having fewer relatives to begin with), they found no difference in the number of social engagements with others, such as friends and colleagues. A survey of more than 2,500 Spanish teenagers found only children experienced higher rates of peer victimisation, but Hughes points out this may be affected by their perception of victimisation: “To some extent, siblings really teach you how to take the rough with the smooth.” A study last year, by Southwest University in Chongqing, China, on more than 250 college-aged students, suggested only children were more flexible in their thinking, and therefore more creative, though showed “lower agreeableness”.The clinical psychologist Linda Blair, author of the book Birth Order, says there can be huge benefits to this family structure, as parents can focus all their time and energy on an only child, “and also continue to have your own life. That means, in terms of the child’s point of view, you make growing up look pretty interesting.” In previous generations, being an only child “didn’t used to be so good for two reasons. One was that parents usually couldn’t have another child – it wasn’t because they chose not to – and the problem was that then they overprotected the child. The other reason was only children were in the vast minority, so they often felt bullied and left out. But nowadays, this is a positive choice for a lot of parents so the kid feels not that unusual and also they don’t feel overprotected, they just feel valued.”There are also downsides, Blair says. “One is that, even with the best efforts of parents to get their child to spend lots of time with kids their own age, they often feel a little bit awkward.” This is partly because these encounters usually happen in a supervised setting – nursery, or school, for instance. “So you don’t get the ease of street smarts that kids learn when they have siblings – not to get your Lego knocked over, not to get beaten up.” Children with siblings “learn to read other kids more quickly and easily. It still comes with single children, but it’s just not quite the same.” Blair advises going on holidays with other families with children of similar ages: “That’s the nearest you’ll get to a situation like siblings.”What may be great for a young child or teenager – having more resources, more attention – doesn’t necessarily hold true when that child is an adult, dealing with ageing parents and, eventually, being alone, with nobody who remembers the idiosyncrasies of your family or who shared your childhood. Although this assumes that most people have a reasonable relationship with their adult siblings. For every only child who remembers a lonely childhood there will be others who were traumatised by a bullying brother or sister.Hughes says it is not the number of siblings that is important, but the quality of the relationships. “There is no guarantee if you had a second child that your children are going to get on beautifully. I personally think that having a sibling is an amazing thing, but I wouldn’t want people who have one child, and don’t think they’re going to be able to have a second, to feel their child is inevitably going to lose out.”As for the perfect family size, says Blair, there is no such thing. “The perfect family, if you want the most psychologically well-adjusted children, is the number of children you have, because if you love them, they will be happy.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9ffd73bfbff3742647892b1f6ce031398eddb312/0_220_5439_3264/master/5439.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=91a5d82d110b9dc12c8e47f90cdb4804","title":"fca watchdog planning price caps on rent to own credit terms brighthouse","story":"FCA’s proposal for firms such as BrightHouse aims to save consumers more than £200m a yearThe City watchdog is planning a price cap for rent-to-own retailers as part of a crackdown on high-cost credit and overdrafts to save consumers more than £200m a year. Although stopping short of capping charges on overdrafts, the Financial Conduct Authority outlined a series of measures on Thursday amid growing calls to protect vulnerable consumers. The changes, the result of an 18-month review by the regulator, come as the Bank of England becomes increasingly concerned about rapid growth in personal borrowing, which is returning to levels unseen since the financial crisis. The Hollywood actor Michael Sheen, debt charities and the Labour party have applied significant pressure on the regulator to act.The FCA said it would consider introducing a price cap for the rent-to-own sector, which includes firms such as BrightHouse, from as early as April next year, although it warned it would need to consult on the measure with the industry first. About 400,000 customers use rent-to-own, and charges can be exceptionally high. One example given by the regulator is of customers paying more than £1,500 for electric cookers that could be bought on the high street for less than £300. The FCA said it would also consult on banning the sale of extended warranties at point of sale, which could save consumers up to £7.7m per year.Alongside the measures for rent-to-own, the FCA said it would introduce rules preventing home-collected credit firms from offering new loans or refinancing during home visits without the customer specifically requesting this.While not making major changes for overdrafts, the regulator said the market required fundamental reform and that it would consider taking radical steps as part of a wider review into retail banking practices. The regulator said it would take some small immediate measures which could help consumers to save £140m per year, including steps to force banks to issue alerts via mobile phones warning of charges, as well as requiring the introduction of online tools to make the cost of overdrafts clearer. The FCA said it would also force catalogue credit and store card firms to do more to help customers avoid persistent debt, similar to the requirements it brought in for credit cards, which could save people up to £27.5m a year. Andrew Bailey, the head of the FCA, said the watchdog had put forward a significant package of reforms to protect consumers, adding: “High-cost credit is used by over 3 million consumers in the UK, some of whom are the most vulnerable in society.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a0eb85c62cfa82370f691ae325344b4b0723de10/952_185_1305_783/master/1305.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=16cb73a0798261b671f960bd5b73c977","title":"jeremy corbyns views could drive jewish people from uk leader","story":"British Jews are asking ‘Do we have a future?’ says outgoing president of board of deputies Jeremy Corbyn holds “antisemitic views” which could drive Jewish people to leave Britain if he becomes prime minister, one of the UK’s most senior Jewish leaders has said.Jonathan Arkush, the outgoing president of the board of deputies, said Corbyn “has views which are antisemitic, and he has problematic views”.He also criticised the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, who should have had a “stronger, clearer voice” in support of the Jewish community, he said. Arkush, who was among senior Jewish leaders who met Corbyn in April to discuss concerns about antisemitism, told the Daily  that British Jews were asking: “Do we have a future here?”“Delegitimising the state of Israel is antisemitic,” Arkush told the newspaper. “He was a chairman of Stop the War, which is responsible for some of the worst anti-Israel discourse.“If he shares the prevalent discourse about Israel, then that view is unquestionably antisemitic.”Arkush said Corbyn would need to tell Jews that he “will not accept a discourse which denies the existence of their own land to the Jewish people … I think we are all entitled to some clarity on his real views about Israel”.Corbyn’s spokesman said the comments were “personal attacks without any evidence to support them … Jeremy has been absolutely clear that he is a militant opponent of antisemitism and is committed to driving it out of our movement”.The spokesman said Labour had deep roots in the Jewish community and was campaigning to increase the confidence of the community, the spokesman said.“Jonathan Arkush’s attempt to conflate strong criticism of Israeli state policies with antisemitism is wrong and undermines the fight both against antisemitism and for justice for the Palestinians,” the spokesman added. “It should be rejected outright.”Rhea Wolfson, a member of Labour’s national executive committee, said she was shocked by the comments. “Jeremy Corbyn is not antisemitic, he does not hold antisemitic views,” she tweeted. “I cannot understand what Arkush is trying to achieve here but I know it isn’t about being constructive.“Jonathan Arkush has never spoken for me, for many other young, progressive Jews, and he doesn’t in this article. We have a lot of work to take a lot of poison out of the debate… around Israel and Palestine, making blanket accusations isn’t constructive and doesn’t move towards a better debate or solutions.”Arkush will hand over the presidency of the Board of Deputies this week to newly elected president Marie van der Zyl. After her election earlier this month, Van der Zyl said the board of deputies wanted to continue dialogue with the Labour leader. “We want to see Jeremy Corbyn lead the Labour party and carry out his pledge to root out antisemitism and all forms of racism within the party,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2247c782e8547b05c8f4973ecd6709791ed94219/0_0_5000_3333/master/5000.jpg?w=1200\u0026h=630\u0026q=55\u0026auto=format\u0026usm=12\u0026fit=crop\u0026crop=faces%2Centropy\u0026bm=normal\u0026ba=bottom%2Cleft\u0026blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxOC8wMS8zMS9mYWNlYm9va19kZWZhdWx0LnBuZw\u0026s=37a3ac16b051ea573feb8973e890620b","title":"brexit uk may get poorer access than israel to eu science scheme","story":"Exclusive: UK may have to pay more for privilege of collaborating, draft paper saysTheresa May’s appeal for a special Brexit deal on science and research collaboration, worth billions to the British economy, is being stonewalled by Brussels as it prepares to offer an arrangement less privileged and more expensive than that given to non-EU states such as Israel.The European commission’s negotiators refused to discuss the issue in formal talks last week, instead insisting they would present the UK with conditions of entry for a “third country” into its €97.9bn research programme once they had been formally published. A draft copy of the so-called Horizon Europe document, seen by the , suggests that the UK is set to be offered less generous access than countries with associate status in the current programme, known as Horizon 2020, including Israel, Turkey, Albania and Ukraine.Those states, along with countries in the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) – Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland – will be “associated to all programme parts” of the new research and science framework, details of which are to be published on 7 June, according to the leaked document.It is understood that wealthy countries with a developed research and development capacity are to be offered a greater opportunity to pay in and collaborate with the EU under a reform of the current programme, which will end in 2020.However, the UK is set to join Canada and South Korea in the category of countries that will have to pay a higher price for the privilege of collaborating, while being barred from a particular raft of programmes designed to encourage innovation.According to the draft paper, so-called “third countries” will not have a seat on the new European Innovation Council, which sets priorities, and their companies will not have the opportunity to apply for “fast, flexible grants and co-investments” designed to “bridge the ‘valley of death’ between research, commercialisation and the scaling-up of companies”.Sources said it was additionally unclear what role the UK would have in shaping the priorities of Horizon Europe after Brexit, given it would no longer be a member state and would not be an EFTA member, acceding country, candidate country or potential candidate country.The European commission’s proposals will need to be approved by the member states. A senior EU official said they were aware that the UK would seek to change the rules from within during negotiations over the bloc’s future budget, known as the multi-annual financial framework (MFF).An EU official involved in the Brexit negotiations said of last week’s talks with the UK negotiators in Brussels: “We … had a discussion on science and technology where we said that from our point of view unfortunately this was slightly early as we are coming forward in early June with the proposals for the next generation of Horizon Europe, the successor to Horizon 2020, and these programmes will set out the conditions for third countries’ participation.“We would be happy to present that to the UK once that has been published. We take good note that the UK wants to maintain its role in shaping and priority setting of EU programmes in the future, and we also took very careful note of the announcement by the UK negotiators that they intend to use their part in the EU28 negotiations about the future MFF as an instrument to influence the definition of third country part rules in EU programmes.”Last week a British presentation to the EU negotiators, who were led by Michel Barnier, argued for full access to Horizon Europe and said “as an associate country we would look to agree an appropriate level of influence on the shape of the programme. This should be greater than current non-EU precedents, recognising the quality and breadth of the UK’s contribution”. Thomas Jørgensen, the senior policy coordinator at the European University Association (EUA) working on Brexit-related issues, said the commission was acting to protect its interests in the face of the emergence of the UK as a rival economic power.He said: “It is entirely understandable that you would want to help small countries in your neighbourhood, but why would you do that for small and medium-size enterprises in South Korea or other third countries such as the UK?“The view from Brussels is that leaving the EU is the UK’s choice, it is their choice to be South Korea. If they say they want a special deal, that’s not going to work.”Jørgensen said, however, that the scale of the UK’s research strength was such that it would inevitably have a large say in at least informal settings about the direction of the programmes.He said: “There is elasticity. But if it comes down to a matter of principles, then that could be a problem.”Diplomats attached to the member states suggested there were additional concerns about giving third countries access to sensitive research information. The UK is seeking an agreement to continue the flow of data between it and the rest of Europe, but a recent report on the country’s handling of personal information held on the Schengen Information System, designed to monitor the flow of people around Europe, has damaged that case.An official paper, dated 18 May 2018 and seen by the , reveals that despite a 2015 evaluation finding serious deficiencies with the UK’s handling of personal data, a follow-up visit in 2017 had discovered that a range of recommendations had not been implemented.The report notes that the EU’s inspectors had found that “very serious deficiencies in the legal, operational and technical implementation of SIS by the UK subsist”.Among the issues that caused concern was the discovery that UK officials had been copying personal data and sharing it with US contractors working for its immigration services and the border police. Some of that information was found to be out of date as well, raising the potential of people being unfairly flagged as they passed through the UK’s borders.In a further indication of the EU’s attitude, on Wednesday the commission announced that the UK could take part in the student exchange scheme, Erasmus, after Brexit, in return for a financial contribution, but that it would have no say in shaping the programme.

Our democracy should not be overshadowed by a isive culture within political parties that scapegoats minorities and alienates some who share similar political positions.”In response to the letter, a Conservative spokesman said: “We take all such incidents seriously, which is why we have suspended all those who have behaved inappropriately and launched immediate investigations.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c7029481e83703920c5601b5fe9e0304dd1b425c/0_936_3771_2263/master/3771.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f13f518bcef068c76224d93262474337","title":"worlds oldest lizard fossil forces rethink of reptile family tree","story":"Discovery pushes back the earliest known member of lizard and snake group by 75m yearsThe fossilised remains of a small lizard discovered in rock from the Italian Alps has shaken up the evolutionary family tree of reptiles and shed new light on the survivors of the most devastating mass extinction the world ever faced, researchers say. Thought to have lived in the triassic period, about 240 million years ago, the creature, known as Megachirella wachtleri, has been unveiled as the oldest known member of a group of reptiles known as squamates – which includes lizards, snakes and peculiar legless creatures known as worm lizards.Researchers say the finding not only sheds light on what the last common ancestor of such creatures would likely have looked like, but reveals that squamates probably appeared far earlier that previously thought, and survived one of the planet’s greatest catastrophes.“All lizards and snakes are descendants from Megachirella or a Megachirella-like lizard,” said Dr Massimo Bernardi, co-author of the study from the University of Bristol, adding that Megachirella would probably have measured about 25-30cm from its nose to the tip of its tail.Writing in the journal Nature, an international team of researchers describe how they reanalysed the 240m year old fossil of the creature which was first discovered in rock from the Dolomites in the early 2000s by an amateur collector. Using an x-ray technique known as CT-scanning, the team were able to examine in 3D previously hidden features of the fossil. In addition, they spent about 400 days visiting and examining some 150 specimens of ancient lizard-like creatures held in collections around the world, and analysed both skeletal and molecular data – including DNA – from living squamates.The results reveal that Megachirella is a squamate, pushing back the earliest known member of the group by 75m years and backing up some previous molecular studies that had proposed squamates existed in the triassic. A further result of the new family tree, the team say, is that it settles a long-standing debate, revealing that geckoes evolved earlier than iguanas.David Martill, professor of palaeobiology at the University of Portsmouth who was not involved in the study, said the revelation that squamates arose before the Great Dying casts the creatures in a new light. “This means squamates are real survivors,” he said. “The Permo-Triassic extinction event was a dangerous time to be alive. Not much escaped its deathly touch.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ea93eaced217b1daf9dd45f6c050e812efc3ebb7/0_81_3400_2040/master/3400.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d833924d1c260398782f32e523a16568","title":"novak djokovic jaume munar progress french open","story":"Former world No 1’s latest French Open win suggests he is in comparable shape to Alexander Zverev and Grigor DimitrovOn a day of rapidly swirling weather and fortunes, Novak Djokovic emerged from a second perfunctory win against a qualifier to stay in the conversation about who is good enough to stop Rafael Nadal winning his 11th French Open. He could get to the quarter‑finals once there, he might even find another gear or two, which was his trademark in his pomp.Certainly the former champion is in shape comparable to that of younger contenders in Alexander Zverev, who took five sets to defeat the world No\u0026nbsp60 Dusan Lajovic, and Grigor Dimitrov, who survived a tempestuous battle over four hours and 19 minutes against the American Jared Donaldson, who was reduced at one point to serving underarm.Djokovic, who beat Dutra Silva in the first round, had to work his way past the stubborn challenge of the 21‑year‑old Spanish qualifier Jaume Munar – ranked 155 in the world – after which he took time to reflect on the troubles of an absent friend, Andy Murray, with whom he has had long\u0026nbspconversations.“I can only imagine how difficult it is for him to deal with the circumstances of injury,” he said. “That’s something that I can relate to. I have had quite a similar situation, although his injury takes more time, obviously. Hopefully we can see him playing on grass because that’s where, I guess, he wants to play.”He does, passionately. But it will not be easy. Nearly a year after he and Murray left Wimbledon, wounded losers who had driven each other to their physical limits in pursuit of the world No\u0026nbsp1 ranking, the Serb is still standing – just, at 22 in the world – while the Scot’s prospects of fulfilling his commitment to end an 11-month sabbatical on the Dutch grass of Rosmalen the week after the French Open remain as clear\u0026nbspas mud.The hip surgery in January that Murray hoped would restore him to full fitness has not clicked as well as he had originally thought, and there is uncertainty in the camp that he will make it to the line in the Netherlands – or even Wimbledon. If he misses the grasscourt season, he will have no ranking. If he were to make his comeback where he has won two of his three grand slam titles, he would be outside the top 150 for the first time since August 2005. Those are scary digits.Djokovic knows as much about struggle and injury as anyone on the Tour. His chronically painful right elbow kept him out for the rest of the year after Wimbledon and his comeback, which involved a recent “minor procedure”, has gone from a limping exit in Melbourne to a decent stroll in Rome last week, where he fought hard against Nadal, and gathered conviction in two wins here. On Friday he will need to lift his game against Roberto Bautista Agut, who saw off the Colombian qualfier Santiago Giraldo in just over two hours.As for his own up-and-down journey Djokovic, true to his enthusiasm for spiritual enlightenment over the past couple of years, tried to put it in a philosophical context. Asked if getting out of his current rut was harder than when he had a similar experience in 2008, he said: “It’s all a personal perspective, how you perceive things in life. It can be really tough and it can be really easy. Everything starts and ends with us in our minds. To sit here and talk about how tough it is, and you have people starving to death, for me there is no point in talking about that.“It’s just the way it is. As an athlete, I have to face these challenges, I will call them and, if I overcome them or not, it’s just a matter of work that I have put in, luck at times, and circumstances. That’s it. I have achieved so much in my life and I’m very, very grateful for that.”In light suited more to burglary than tennis, Cameron Norrie got out of jail against Lucas Pouille when he pulled a set back four minutes short of the tournament late-finish record of 9.56pm in 2010. He will resume on Thursday on the main court needing more heroics to overhaul the Frenchman’s 6-2, 6-4, 5-7 lead.It might not be beyond him. When he induced a final errant forehand from Pouille – who plays with contact lenses – he had effected an escape worthy of Houdini, and looked (to all those close enough to tell) as if he was up for the fight."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7be7771f602e84d42ad9e35b3db57795db0b47f0/0_14_3112_1867/master/3112.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e4242b693b7592b3cc0ac0122460a746","title":"rafael nadal naomi osaka paris johanna konta","story":"• Court more slippery than usual, says 10-times winner Nadal• Johanna Konta and Alison Riske defeated in doublesThe clay of Roland Garros is supposed to be mysterious, an ochre deathbed for the innocent and the ill-prepared. However, at least two players at this French Open have surprisingly ergent views on it.Naomi Osaka, one of the sport’s unusual thinkers, says it is not clay at all – “not clay-clay” anyway, as she put it after bundling Zarina Dyas out in the second round on Wednesday.Asked to explain, the 20-year-old Japanese star with the American twang said: “I just focus more on the tennis part rather than making up excuses of what the surface is and how my play style isn’t suited for it, or whatever.”Her game was good enough to beat the world No 51, 6-4, 7-5. Seeded here for the first time, Osaka does not lack for confidence.As for her dismissal of the dirt at her feet, Rafael Nadal disagrees. The Spaniard, who has a degree in clay, surprised everyone when he said of his favourite killing ground: “The court is more slippery than usual. I slid a lot when I started off or when I moved to another side. It was quite complicated.Johanna Konta, who insisted she had no fear of the Parisian clay after a fourth quick singles exit here, blew a 4-2 lead in the third set of her doubles match alongside Alison Riske, as Annabel Medina Garrigues and Arantxa Parra Santonja won 3-6, 6-4, 7-6 (3) in two hours and 22 minutes.Konta’s first-round conqueror, Yulia Putintseva, went through by defeating the American Jennifer Brady, 6-4, 6-3. Next up for her is Barbora Strycova, who got past Ekaterina Makarova in two sets.Petra Kvitova, who was a game away from going home in her first-round match against the unseeded Verónica Cepede Royg, seems to be her old self again. The eighth seed defeated Lara Arruabarrena 6-0, 6-4 in 68 minutes. She is in the half of the draw that has already lost the defending champion Jelena Ostapenko and Venus Williams. Anett Kontaveit, who looked good in defeating the Romanian qualifier Alexandra Dulgheru, 7-5, 6-2, should provide another stiff test.Heather Watson, who is still in singles, won her doubles match with Tatjana Maria against the French pair Manon Arcangioli and Shérazad Reix, 6-4, 6-4."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7fe73e514a5142094e00559be902a45a9d05978d/1518_1115_4050_2430/master/4050.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a9fd7c959f417415cfd698932612596b","title":"how much screen time is too much for kids parents advice children digital media","story":"Parents have been advised to limit media consumption, but research suggests it’s the nature of it that mattersFor many parents in the digital age, battles over screen time and devices have become a depressing part of family life, and knowing how much is too much has become a moving target.Whether it’s three-year-olds throwing tantrums when the iPad is taken away, seven-year-olds watching YouTube all night, nine-year-olds demanding their own phones, 11-year-olds nagging to play 18-rated video games that “all their friends” are, or 14-year-olds who are never off Instagram, every stage of childhood and adolescence is now accompanied by its own delightful new parenting challenges.Up until a few years ago parenting advice centred around the concept of “screen time” quotas with a Goldilocks-style sweet spot of two or so hours of screens a day, beyond which media use could become harmful.The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) still recommends a maximum of one hour of “high-quality programming” for children under 6, but thereafter simply encourages parents to “place consistent limits on the time spent using media” and designate screen-free time as a family.It’s unclear whether that means four hours playing a video game on a Sunday is okay, or whether it is better to have three 20-minute sessions with the iPad than one hour-long session. Is it really that bad if my 18-month-old watches a couple of episodes of the Twirlywoos before dinner?Many parents will be relieved to hear that recent research suggests that it’s not so much the length, but the nature of the screen time that matters. Whether it’s passive TV or social media monitoring, active video game playing, socialising with WhatsApp, or getting creative in iMovie.Jocelyn Brewer, a psychologist who specialises in the concept of “digital nutrition”, likens media diets to what’s on our plates: rather than counting calories (or screen time), think about what you’re eating. “It’s not just about whether you consume any potential digital junk foods, but also your relationship to technology and the role it plays in your family life,” says Brewer. “We know that using screens to soothe or pacify kids sets up some concerning patterns of relying on devices to calm or distract a child (or teen, or adult) from their experience of unpleasant or uncomfortable emotions – so we want to avoid using screens to placate tantrums, just like we want to avoid eating ‘treats’ to calm emotional storms.”For young children, the most important thing is whether parents and kids are playing, watching or browsing together.Another study from December by the University of Michigan on people aged four to 11 similarly found that “how children use the devices, not how much time they spend on them, is the strongest predictor of emotional or social problems connected with screen addiction”. But the authors said that concern over a child’s screen use is warranted when it leads to poor behaviour, loss of interest in other activities, family or social life, withdrawal, or deception.Talk about kids and technology usually tends towards the negative, but it doesn’t have to be so. The internet and video games can be fun, social and provide a new creative outlet for children. “Evidence-based benefits identified from the use of digital and social media include early learning, exposure to new ideas and knowledge, increased opportunities for social contact and support,” says the AAP. The consensus is that screen time, in and of itself, is not harmful – and reasonable restrictions vary greatly, depending on a child’s behaviour and personality. There is little point in obsessing over how many minutes a day your kids are spending with screens. Instead, parents should be doing what they can to ensure that what they’re watching, playing and reading is high-quality, age-appropriate and safe – and joining in wherever possible.“It’s important there is balance in the online and offline worlds and in leisure and learning, but what that looks like for different kids at different ages and in different families is hard to ‘prescribe’,” says Brewer. “Research shows that not having access to the digital world has a negative impact on kids – so its about finding the right amount with a holistic approach.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6e0b11cbee994f98e49dcdaa0a3f136a2e83e414/210_419_3080_1848/master/3080.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=41c670253f83894cfc6b9a4d0eec4906","title":"for all its absurdity the babchenko stunt is no laughing matter","story":"While Kiev may have prevented a killing, the next time a Kremlin critic is murdered the first question will be: are they really dead? As dramatic plot-twists go, it was top drawer: gasps all round at a press conference about a murder investigation, as the star guest turns out to be the victim himself, smirking and very much not dead. The courageous, controversial and contrarian journalist Arkady Babchenko had not been shot in the back by an assassin, as Ukrainian government officials and gruesome leaked photographs had led everyone to believe. In fact, he had faked his own death as part of a top-secret Ukrainian security services operation to catch real would-be killers operating on Moscow’s orders. At Moscow’s House of Journalists, a memorial plaque to Babchenko was hastily taken down obituaries were taken offline or amended with a rather significant correction.The incredulity, and the delight among friends and colleagues that their sorrow and anguish had been premature, soon gave way to questions about whether fooling the world – and, allegedly, Babchenko’s own wife – for a full day was really the only possible way to play this mysterious special operation. “In half an hour I’m supposed to send the cover to the printers with a dead Babchenko and an article inside. What am I supposed to put on the cover now? Babchenko is alive?” wrote Vitaly Sych, the editor of Ukrainian weekly magazine Novoye Vremya, on Facebook. “Who does this? It’s good, of course, that he’s alive. But it’s a bit weird.”The saga was reminiscent of the ultra-noir comic novellas of Kiev novelist Andrei Kurkov, which often revolve around contract killings: one involves a depressed man who uses a circuitous route to order his own assassination.But this story, for all its absurdity, is clearly no laughing matter: Babchenko really did flee Russia in fear, and there may well have been a genuine assassination plot. The question is whether Ukrainian authorities, in preventing a killing (if that is indeed what they have done) did more harm than good, and whether there was any less provocative way to achieve the same ends. The next time a Kremlin critic is shot to death, or poisoned, or falls curiously from their balcony to die on the concrete below, the first question is always going to be: are they really dead? There’s no doubt that we can expect the “Babchenko defence” to be used as Moscow’s stock response to reports or even photographs of various Russia-linked atrocities for years to come. “Next time you show me photos from Syria by ‘White Helmets’ I will show photo of ‘dead Arkady Babchenko killed by Putin’,” wrote one pro-Russian Twitter user, in a small taste of what is surely to come in large quantities.Of course, that the Kremlin might spin something to its advantage is hardly a reason to abort a potentially life-saving mission. But even assuming there was an excellent operational reason for the subterfuge, questions about the way the stunt was handled remain. Was it really necessary to announce his death, rather than a severe injury, thus traumatising friends, relatives and Russian journalists who had already lost multiple colleagues to bullets?More pertinently, the tone of the grand reveal seemed in remarkably poor taste. Rather than solemnly note the need for such an extraordinary twist of events, Babchenko was wheeled out at the press conference in a bid to create maximum shock effect, like a seaside magician revelling in the audience’s amazement as his sawn-in-half woman becomes whole again. The Ukrainian president, Petro Poroshenko, hailed a “brilliant operation” while the interior ministry advisor Anton Gerashchenko could hardly control his excitement at the cloak-and-dagger plot: “Even Sherlock Holmes successfully used the method of faking his own death to effectively investigate difficult and complicated crimes, however painful that may have been for his relatives and for Dr Watson,” he wrote on Facebook.Volodymyr Groysman, Ukraine’s prime minister, said earlier on Wednesday that Babchenko had been killed by the “Russian totalitarian machine” and demanded that “the murderers must be punished”. It was unclear whether it was all part of the plot to fool the would-be assassins, or whether he was in the dark about the faked death.Now, all will hinge on what hard evidence of the Russian plot Ukraine is able to produce. If Kiev has bagged cast-iron proof that the would-be assassin’s orders came from Moscow, then the whole episode may go down as an audacious, if controversial, success.If not, many are likely to agree with the head of Reporters without Borders, Christophe Deloire: “It is pathetic and regrettable that the Ukrainian police have played with the truth, whatever their motive ... for the stunt,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/583528d9c60699838a9c4f0ab42291dd94b4718c/0_12_3543_2126/master/3543.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=70f191ad77e02b3cf10993ea13b2d178","title":"head of italys m5s rekindles negotiations to form a government","story":"Financial markets welcome reprieve by sending the euro back up after being battered by bitter row over the formation of new governmentThe Italian president, Sergio Mattarella, has granted Italy’s two populist leaders more time to form a government in an attempt to stave off a snap election.Mattarella signalled he was ready to install a technocrat government if a deal could not be reached, but decided to give Luigi Di Maio of the Five Star Movement and Matteo Salvini of the League more time to draw up a list of ministers that could be accepted by all parties, according to a source close to the presidential palace.The decision to “slow things down” – taken three months after an election that resulted in a hung parliament – was an attempt to try to stem a possible financial crisis, after markets slumped on Monday and Tuesday owing to fears of what a new vote could bring.A bitter row between Mattarella and the two populists at the weekend had prompted the latter to step back from their plan to assume power, but the latest twist means Di Maio and Salvini could yet form a government.It is unclear, however, whether the pair will stick by plans to nominate Giuseppe Conte, a law professor, as prime minister – a controversial choice since he has no political experience – and a Eurosceptic as finance minister. On Sunday night Mattarella refused to endorse the nomination of Paolo Savona for the finance brief, saying his appointment would send a message to markets and investors that Italy was prepared to default on its obligations to Brussels and might even contemplate an exit from the eurozone. Mattarella said leaving the euro posed a risk to all Italians’ financial security.Mattarella’s decision set off a chain of events that roiled Italian markets: Conte resigned as prime minister-in waiting and new elections appeared to be imminent, worrying markets and officials in Brussels. Their concern was that new elections could strengthen populist gains in Italy, leading to even greater uncertainty about the country’s future in the eurozone.Those fears were slightly allayed on Wednesday after Di Maio opened the door to new talks with Salvini and suggested he was open to reaching a compromise that could satisfy Mattarella’s objections.Di Maio suggested he was open to dropping Savona as finance minister and putting him into another post, but still wanted Conte, who has served as Di Maio’s personal attorney, to serve as prime minister. Di Maio said that if a deal could not be reached, he favoured snap elections. “There are two paths ahead. Either we launch the Conte government with a reasonable solution or we vote right away,” he said.Italian markets rallied on the news. Any government formed by M5S and the League would have a relatively narrow majority in the senate, limiting its ability to take any dramatic action.Salvini, the bombastic and xenophobic head of the League, who put forward plans during the election campaign to detain and deport hundreds of thousand of immigrants, indicated he still favoured snap elections.Even before the fracas over Savona’s appointment, the marriage of convenience between Di Maio and Salvini has looked tenuous since the 4 March election. The M5S and the League are Italy’s biggest populist parties but differ significantly on policy. An agreement reached this month for a shared agenda was focused on plans to increase spending, cut taxes and take a far tougher approach on immigration than the previous centre-left government, including by creating new detention centres across Italy.Di Maio and Salvini reached a deal to nominate Conte to serve as prime minister last week. Mattarella agreed on the choice, despite questions over whether he had padded out his CV. Mattarella has faced intense scrutiny for his handling of the crisis, with both Di Maio and Salvini accusing the president of acting too politically when his role is supposed to be politically neutral.

The Flemish daily newspaper Het Nieuwsblad asked: “How Belgian is Belgian chocolate, if just about all the top players are in foreign hands?”The founder of Galler, the latest chocolaterie to be purchased, is at least surviving the Qatari takeover. Jean Galler, who once enthused that “chocolate is freedom”, is being retained by the House of al-Thani, headed by Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, the emir of Qatar, as creative director.Last year, the Liège chocolate company recorded a record turnover of €35m and a recurring gross operating profit of €2.5m.The acquisition is the latest foreign takeover of a Belgian chocolate company.Guylian, founded by Guy Foubert in 1958, is owned by the South Korean conglomerate Lotte. Jacques, founded in 1896, is owned by the Dutch business Baronie. Côte d’Or (1883) and Meurisse (1845) belong to the US confectionary group Mondelēz.Dominique Persoone, a chocolatier, told Het Nieuwsblad: “Of course, it is a pity that foreign companies are buying up our crown jewels. I feel it myself: every week, there is a Chinese or Arab person calling me who says he wants to invest millions to grow and conquer the world.”Guy Gallet, the secretary general of the Royal Belgian Association of the Chocolate, Praline, Biscuits and Sugar Confectionery Industries (Choprabisco), was sanguine on the issue.“If they are owned by a foreign company, or the capital is in foreign hands, that is of less importance than that they are creating employment in Belgium,” he told the . “There are a lot of French wines, French châteaux, that have foreign investors, but the wine is still French. It is the same story.”Asked what makes Belgian chocolate special, Gallet said: “It is the heritage, the knowledge, the expertise. The blending and the selection of the cocoa beans.“In general, the bean is ground to a very small particle size so it is smooth in the mouth. And no other vegetable fat is used, although it is allowed.”Questioned as to whether Belgian chocolate could be made outside the country, he insisted: “No, of course not. We have a code of practice and companies know that a Belgian chocolate has to be made in Belgium.”Exports have nearly doubled in the past 18 years, from 300,000 to 600,000 tonnes.Gallet said Choprabisco was now working on an application for EU’s geographical indications. “If we hear of a maker saying their chocolates are Belgian, which are not made in Belgium, then we write to them.

Though immobilised, the rhino is conscious. So, once it has been moved into the right position by a team on the ground, foam earmuffs and a blindfold are placed on its head to reduce stress levels.After marking the ideal cutting point to avoid damaging the living growth plates at the base of the horns, Toft fires up a chainsaw and slices both of them off.Those magnificent horns, which have helped to protect this species for millions of years, are the reason that more than 7,000 rhinos have been killed in South Africa in the past decade. A persistent human desire for rhino horn – for everything from traditional medicine to hangover cures or status symbols – drives the slaughter of more than 1,000 of the animals each year in the country that has the largest rhino population in the world.News doesn\u0027t always have to be bad – indeed, the relentless focus on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame risks convincing the public that the world is hopeless and there is nothing we can do.This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come.Readers can recommend other projects, people and progress that we should report on by contacting us at theupside@theWorldwide, the situation is grave. The northern white rhino became functionally extinct after the death of Sudan, the last male, in March, while the black rhino population is down to about 5,200. The situation for Asian rhinos is equally bleak: there are just 3,200 surviving Indian rhinos, about 76 Sumatran rhinos and 60 Javan rhinos. There are fewer than 30,000 rhinos globally, with Africa’s southern white rhino the most populous species at about 20,000.These alarming figures have driven wildlife managers in several South African reserves to take the drastic step of sawing off hundreds of horns every year, before criminal syndicates can get their hands on them. With the poachers’ prize removed, the risk to the hornless animals is greatly reduced.Toft has removed close to 1,800 horns from 900 rhinos in the past three years in KwaZulu-Natal, which has been heavily targeted by poachers. Both Galliers and Toft acknowledge that dehorning is not a permanent or ideal solution to the crisis. “This is not something we want to do. It’s expensive and invasive but we believe it is a necessary evil,” says Galliers, noting that it costs about £580 to safely dehorn a rhino.The cost is based on the hiring of helicopters and skilled vets. Galliers, also head of the anti-poaching initiative Project Rhino, points out that dehorning must be repeated every 18-24 months as the horns regrow naturally.Even then, there have been cases of dehorned animals being shot for their stumps. Toft has developed a method of removing as much horn as possible without causing pain to the rhino or damage to its growth plates. The horn is removed to about three finger widths from the base, then the stump is further trimmed around the edges with an angle grinder, enabling the removal of an extra 2kg of horn on a large bull.The operation is noisy and violent, but there is no blood – and Toft insists it is no more painful than trimming your fingernails if done correctly.Galliers and Toft believe dehorning could help save rhinos under threat elsewhere in Africa and Asia. But the cost means that might only be possible in small and medium-sized reserves. Dehorning only selected bulls is not an option, as those without horns would be more vulnerable in territory fights. In parks where the entire rhino population is dehorned, all bulls are placed at equal disadvantage. But dehorned rhinos can still fend off lions by using their considerable bulk as a weapon, Toft says. For trophy hunters, the aim is to acquire both the head and the horns. Many other horned animals are hunted: elephants are slaughtered for their ivory, but Toft does not think detusking is a solution. Tusks are partially hollow and contain sensitive roots and nerves. Although it would be feasible to remove the solid portion, a large volume of tusk would have to remain intact, which could still attract the attention of poachers. Tusks are also essential tools for elephants to strip tree bark or dig up succulent roots and tubers.For now, dehorning appears to be achieving success as an emergency measure, buying time while the decades-old debate continues about how to end the demand for rhino horn.This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

Pompeo tweeted that he had had a “good working dinner” with Kim on Wednesday night of steak, corn and cheese.“I will remind you that the secretary of state is from the heartland and likes American food, and he’s hosting someone who’s never been to our country,” the senior state department official said. The Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, meanwhile met his North Korean counterpart, Ri Yong Ho, on Thursday in Pyongyang, a trip seen as an attempt by Moscow to make its voice heard in its neighbour state’s push for diplomacy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff84c48828989deba9b73d38b8209eaa292b5100/0_227_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cfc773ca56f07929c68725954efe29df","title":"karachi residents cool off pakistan heatwave in pictures","story":"Pakistan’s most populous city is in the grips of a heatwave as temperatures soar to 45C.

Photograph: iStockThe Government has insisted that a major overhaul of the special needs assistant (SNA) scheme in schools will improve outcomes for young people and is not aimed at cutting costs.Almost 35,000 students with additional care needs, such as autism, are supported by more than 14,000 SNAs to attend school each day.A review of the scheme by the National Council for Special Education has found that, while it works well for some pupils, “radical changes” are needed to improve outcomes for students.This involves broadening the current role of SNAs – currently confined to care needs such as toileting, mobility and feeding – to help assist with the delivery of speech and language or occupational therapy.It says qualifications required to become an SNA should rise, while existing staff should receive additional training.SNAs will also be renamed “inclusion support assistants” to reflect their focus on developing students’ independence.There are also plans to provide in-school therapy, such as speech and language and occupational therapy, through pilot projects which will later be expanded across the State.The Department of Public Expenditure has previously expressed concern over “rapidly escalating” costs which have jumped by more than a third in the past five years to half a billion euro.However, Minister for Education Richard Bruton said the changes were not about saving money.“This is about ensuring the investment we make in children with special educational needs has the best impact,” he said.Mr Bruton said the report made it clear the State’s current response to meeting the needs of students with additional care needs should be broadened to offer a more comprehensive and tailored response.“My department will now begin to develop proposals to implement the recommendations of the comprehensive review of the SNA scheme,” he said.He said it would take a “number of years” to implement and that the Government was committed in the meantime to ensuring the needs of all children were met.Among the council’s key recommendation include:Frontloading SNA support so the majority of posts are allocated ahead of time, removing the need for assessments and allowing for earlier intervention.Boosting access to a greater range of supports and making expertise available in regional teams to support schools. This will include 10 regional teams with 230 specialist teachers, therapists, special educational needs organisers and behavioural practitioners who will work directly with schools and students.Training and upskilling for SNAs as well as teachers and the wider school community.Students to have access to support without the need for diagnosis of a disability.The council estimates the changes would cost an additional €40 million a year, and says they should be phased in over time.The proposed changes follow an 18-month review of the scheme, along with consultation with schools, parents, policy-makers and students."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3514890.1527752249!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"burst water pipe could affect thousands in louth and meath","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tLast July there was a serious burst in the same pipeline, which led to 80,000 homes and businesses going without water supply for nearly a full week. A burst water main serving thousands of homes in Drogheda and east Meath may cause water outages in the coming days, with Irish Water appealing to residents to conserve water. A burst pipe serving the Staleen water treatment plant has led to Irish Water relying on reservoir supply, as crews have been called in to try and fix the pipeline. Last July there was a serious burst in the same pipeline, which led to 80,000 homes and businesses going without water supply for nearly a full week. On Thursday Irish Water appealed to locals in Drogheda and east Meath to conserve water and restrict usage, so the current reservoir supply does not run out before the pipeline is repaired. “We are hopeful that the repair on this occasion will be achieved in a shorter timeframe.” a spokeswoman for the water utility said. The treated reservoir supply has enough water for customers “at present,” she said. Irish Water will provide updates throughout Thursday as the picture becomes clearer. A crisis management team has been deployed to the area on standby, to respond immediately if the water supply does run out, or restrictions are put in place.Repair crews were at the site of the burst main on Wednesday evening, to begin repairs to the pipe. The burst itself is close to the same stretch of the high pressure water main that burst last year, which had a huge affect on supply. “Irish Water has approved the budget and design for a new pipeline to replace the existing lines” in the area, a spokeswoman said. “We are in the final stages of resolving all of the contractual issues to begin mobilisation of construction of this pipeline within weeks,” she said.

This year, sanction was received for 220 temporary clerical officers to assist permanent staff in processing applications.“The increase in the volume of applications is undoubtedly in part influenced by Brexit-related demand, with around 10 per cent of all applications this year from applicants living in Great Britain,” the department said in response to queries.“However, there are also other drivers of demand, including a trend towards early renewal of passports, a growth in outbound travel, and a growing population.”As of the end of April, more than 276,000 passports had been issued since the turn of the year. In the same period, 39,000 passport applications were received from applicants residing in Northern Ireland, and more than 41,000 were received from applicants residing in Britain.The department said that in addition to taking on temporary staff, the Passport Office was working to improve services, including plans to expand the online renewal project, as part of its response to increasing application volumes. It said iniduals seeking to renew their passport should do so online, as waiting times for this service had been reduced significantly in recent years.“Adults renewing their passports are strongly encouraged to renew their passport online,” it said. “The online passport application service is fast, convenient and secure, and is processing applications in 10 working days, plus postage time.“In fact, in 50 per cent of cases, the processing time is currently down to five working days. “Applicants can apply from anywhere in the world, with no need for a paper form, witness or printed photos. Renewal applications received through Passport Express are currently processed in 16 working days.”It also said that applications from first-time applicants, as well as from those with loststolen passports, take longer to process.“For these categories of applications, robust identity verification and entitlement checks, as well as vital fraud and security procedures, are necessary to ensure that the integrity and security of the Irish passport is maintained,” it said. “These checks take additional time to complete.”Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce"},{"url":null,"title":"clare daly gives impassioned testimony on referendum result in the d%C3%A1il","story":"  May 29, 2018TD applauded by colleagues after impassioned speech during first D\u0026aacuteil sitting since referendum "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3514264.1527712906!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"miriam lord another dark chapter in ireland s never ending story","story":"People Before Profit TD Richard Boyd-Barrett has revealed he may be among those adopted whose births were incorrectly registered.

Photograph: Cyril ByrneIt’s getting to the stage now where we’d be glad to see a bit of ordinary bribery and corruption.A nice political scandal involving money and galloping amnesia, horses, high-living and the type of people who know that peccadilloes aren’t for garnishing your chicken fajita.Because it’s just one dispiriting episode after another in the Dáil these days.Although it’s only a few weeks since the place was convulsed by the cervical cancer screening debacle and the harrowing stories of women caught up in it, so much more has happened in the interim.First, the story was overtaken by the abortion referendum and upsettingly intrusive discussions about women’s private agonies and how much suffering is enough for them and how much is merely unfortunate. By Tuesday, after the overwhelming vote to remove the Eighth Amendment from the Constitution, a big majority of TDs welcomed the result, and they vowed to move on and legislate as quickly as possible. This included those who had opposed repeal.Certain Government representatives who disappeared off the radar during the campaign are noticeably putting themselves about again.Quite a few who declared for No and then got a terrible shock after a thumping majority voted for Yes are radiating the relieved demeanour of TDs who never wanted to talk about abortion in the first place, don’t want to hear the word “abortion” ever again and won’t have to take the coward’s way out any more by pretending they don’t know enough about abortion to offer an opinion.Instead we got the story of Irish babies and toddlers illegally adopted in the 1950s and 1960s and given birth certificates identifying their adoptive parents as their biological parents. Now, on foot of documents discovered by the Child and Family Agency, Tusla, there is a list of people out there who may not know the truth and will have to be told.This is devastating stuff and it may only be, as was repeated by a number of speakers during Leaders’ Questions, the tip of the iceberg.And so we had the Taoiseach acknowledging “another dark chapter” in Irish social history and opining once more that the past is another country and they did things differently there.“Some will say that the past should be left in the past and that we will do more harm than good by disclosing this information ... We disagree,” he told the Dáil. People have the right to know that information is available and must be told.“Ultimately, it is their choice and their lives. They have a right to know about their identities and birth stories.”At this point Leo Varadkar said he was “reminded” of a quote from the American author Alex Haley.“In all of us there is a hunger, marrow-deep, to know our heritage – to know who we are and where we have come from ...”The Taoiseach recalled in the Dáil on Tuesday that he quoted Maya Angelou on Saturday.Enough of the soundbites or prepared scripts, responded Micheál Martin. Would the Taoiseach tell him when the legislation to facilitate children who have been adopted to trace information on their true identities would be passed?Varadkar, and Minister for Children Katherine Zappone, said everything was being done to get the Bill passed as quickly as possible, but there are some sensitive issues outstanding.Labour’s Jan O’Sullivan summed up the mood in the chamber when she spoke of the referendum bringing about “an unveiling of the wrongs done to women” in Ireland and shining a light on the reality of people’s lives.“There was an attitude that prevailed in this country for so long that others knew better. That attitude has slowly and thankfully been demolished,” said the Limerick TD, citing the new evidence on illegal adoptions as “another failure by the State and those who controlled our society.”The birth details have been officially described as “misclassified”.O’Sullivan says this is not appropriate. “It sounds very innocuous. It is not what it is it is illegal adoption and it is high time we dealt with issues that for too long have been kept in the dark.”Richard Boyd-Barrett had a lot to say about “yet another bombshell exposing the toxic relationship between church and State in this country”.But when he brought the story closer to home and personalised it, the TDs in the chamber looked and listened with a mixture of upset and concern.“I was particularly struck by this scandal as I was adopted via the St Patrick’s Guild in the years affected,” he said. “I don’t actually know if I am one of the cases involved – probably not, but I have questions now, as do other members of both my adoptive and birth families.” His colleagues on all sides snapped to attention.Thousands of people could be living in ignorance of their true heritage, he said. “They are going to have events that are life-changing visited on them.”The Taoiseach said people will be given the support they need, and information will be given face to face, in a supportive environment in a venue of the person’s choice. No news will be delivered over the phone.So here we were again in the Dáil chamber, sifting through the details of another scandal, one that has been known about for years with little urgency on the side of governments to get stuck in. One where people, as Boyd-Barrett put it, “have had their identities stolen and their welfare, particularly in terms of their health, compromised unless they know their proper biological heritage”.After the spirit-sapping discussion of illegal adoptions, another long-running story was raised again amid calls for an open public inquiry into the Garda handling of the hit-and-run death of 23-year-old cyclist Shane O’Farrell in 2011. His family say the driver of the car should have been in prison at the time. They have compelling evidence.This is another dark chapter. Lucia O’Farrell, Shane’s mother, has been refusing to let it close. In the Dáil, again not for the first time, TDs called for an inquiry. As the Taoiseach talked about a Gsoc investigation, he was met by shouts of “it’s a cover-up”.It is a story that refuses to go away.And as the evening approached, protesters gathered at the gates to put the cervical cancer screening controversy back in the spotlight. They called for mandatory disclosure of medical information, and supports for those affected by the cervical screen controversy.So many dark chapters now.-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"miriam lord it took 35 years to build this stunning result","story":"Thirty-five years after it was placed into the Constitution, the electorate voted for the Eighth Amendment to be repealed and for provision be made for the regulation of termination of pregnancy.

Photograph: Nick BradshawIt took 35 years to build a landslide.Repealing the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution was neither quick nor easy, despite what the margin of difference might say.Sixty-six per cent said “Yes”. Makes it look simple.But that two-thirds majority conceals hard history and hard-fought battles behind a stunning final result.Woman by woman, story by story, year upon year, day after day. The rocks and pebbles of countless unjust ordeals and small personal tragedies piled up after each furtive trip to Liverpool and beyond.Brave campaigners for basic abortion rights did everything they could to increase the pressure, their efforts ignored and condemned by priests and politicians and that tiresome class of pious people who live in terror of the slippery slope.They thought they could hold back a landslide. On Friday, gravity kicked in. The slippery slope did for them in the end.The Eighth Amendment, which guaranteed a foetus the same right to life as the woman carrying it, is gone from the Constitution. Good riddance to it. It brought nothing but difficulty and despair to Irish women in times when they desperately needed proper care and compassion at home.It was a wonderful morning on Saturday in the RDS when the boxes were opened and the votes counted. It was a wonderful afternoon in Dublin Castle when crowds filled the courtyard to hear the official declaration. It was a wonderful day for Irish women.A day made even better in the happy knowledge that the vast majority of Irish men are looking out for them and want only the best for them. By voting in their droves to repeal, they placed the concerns of women far above the fears of ideologically-motivated crusaders who prize saving souls above having a heart.With repeal looking the likely outcome, there were calls from some quarters for a muted and dignified response. Perhaps it was the reason why there was neither screen nor public address system for the huge crowd at the castle.But no. For all the decades of all the women who suffered, and for all the women who fought and agitated for change, we had to celebrate this historic turning-point in modern Irish society.Some never thought they would live to see the day. Some, like Monica Barnes and Mary Holland and Nuala Fennell and many more, didn’t. The celebration was for them too.It was for Ailbhe Smyth, who never stopped fighting. It was for senator Ivana Bacik, Catherine Murphy, Joan Burton, Catherine McGuinness and many more who were there from the start.Political rivalries were cast aside for the day. “Oh, c’mere to me,” said socialist Bríd Smith, giving Fianna Fáil’s Timmy Dooley a hug.Obstetrician Peter Boylan, looking very cool in his shades turned up and it was like George Clooney had just rambled in, such was the clamour which greeted his entrance. The three co-directors of Together4Yes – Ailbhe Smyth, Orla O’Connor and Gráinne Griffin – arrived to rapturous welcome.Senators Lynne Ruane and Alice Mary Higgins were in floods. Ruth Coppinger was hugging for Ireland. Katherine Zappone, who demanded the referendum as her price for supporting the Government, was ecstatic.“Oh God, I told my husband I’d give up the fags if there was a repeal,” said Fine Gael’s Kate O’Connell, one of the party’s most active campaigners, as she ran out for a smoke.Brendan Howlin arrived in just after Mary Lou McDonald’s big entrance. The Labour party was fighting the cause when all the others didn’t want to know. “We never get the credit,” said Howlin, shrugging. “We carry the flag, but then in comes the fresh faced Leo to take all the glory.”Maybe not. Health Minister Simon Harris pretended to be embarrassed by the “I fancy Simon Harris” poster, but he was secretly thrilled. Wherever he went he was mobbed. No wonder Leo stuck close by him.Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin maintained a low-key presence, but his early intervention and support for repeal and the proposed legislation was a pivotal point in the campaign.It was a courageous move which now sees him on the right side of history and one half of his parliamentary party stranded on the other.As Micheál walked through the crowd, tearful young women hugged him. A man and woman approached. “We’re one of those couples who had a fatal foetal abnormality,” the women said to him. “Thank you. Just, thank you,” she sobbed.Meanwhile, back in the RDS, the Attorney General was chatting to former Supreme Court Judge Catherine McGuinness.She had had eye surgery the day before but the doctor gave her a special dispensation to attend the count. “Theoretically I should have a patch over my eye today.”At Dublin Castle, Frank Crummy (81), who set up Ireland’s first family planning clinic, was resplendent in his repeal jumper, alongside his wife Evelyn.There was a lot of discussion about why so many politicians and pundits called the campaign so wrong. The Together4Yes team remains amused by the old school, outmoded metric used by some of them to evaluate their very effective efforts. It was as if they were affronted at the idea that people outside the Kildare Street bubble might actually know more than they do about what the electorate really wants these days.Independent TD Clare Daly, a politician hugely deserving of credit for the part she played, decided to stay away from the castle bunfight. Instead, a number of Johnny Come Lately politicians with a weakness for self-publicity preened and waved from the platform.It’s always the same.A third of the electorate voted No. “I feel like I’ve lost my country,” a woman told us amid the celebrations in the RDS. She was very sad. She couldn’t be consoled.Cheers and tears and champagne greeted the announcement. The sky fell in briefly when a few drops of rain fell. Everyone danced.Because it was a monumental day.

Legislation to remove the so-called “baptism barrier” on schools admission has been passed by the Dáil.After a late night debate the House accepted the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill which prohibits the requirement for a child to be baptised before they can be admitted to Catholic schools.Religious bodies had argued that banning religion as a selection criterion in admissions would breach their constitutional rights relating to religious freedom and freedom of association.But Minister for Education Richard Bruton said the provision was robust and would mean baptism as a requirement for school entry would be removed from most schools but retained where a child of a minority needs to gain access to a school of their ethos.Three Independent Rural TDs - Michael Healy-Rae, Mattie McGrath and Michael Collins - called a number of votes but, because they did not have the minimum 10 TDs required to press votes, the votes did not take place.Mr Bruton told the Dáil after the Bill was passed: “Ireland is changing and we need to change with it. The expectation of citizens around the education system have changed and I think this Bill will go some distance to ensuring that we keep up with those changes. Fianna Fáil education spokesman Thomas Byrne welcomed the passage of the Bill which he described as “in some ways radical legislation” but said in other way it will not affect many schools in terms of how they operate.“It’s going to give clarity to schools and to children and will result in a fairer education system without being an attack on the ethos of schools, which I have to say I do value.”The legislation now goes to the Seanad.-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Countries are trying to settle nuclear disagreements and set stage for leaders to meetSterilisations were performed on 25,000 people under a now defunct eugenics lawTrademarks issued to US president daughter raise concern about White House ethicsDespite differences on denuclearisation, Kim Jong-un and Trump look to Singapore talks\u0026lsquoThis is not diplomacy, it\u0026rsquos political theatre,\u0026rsquo says monitor after Koreas\u0026rsquo latest talksMoon Jae-in and Kim Jong Un agreed at a surprise meeting on Saturday that a possible North Korea-US summit must be held successfullyHope that US-North Korea summit may go ahead in JuneUS president responds positively to \u0026lsquovery nice statement\u0026rsquo from Pyongyang about desire for talksWhen Taisuke Miyagawa bowed to the nation for his college football hit, it resonated deeplyBerlin and Beijing stand by Iran nuclear deal despite US decision to withdraw from pactDemolition witnessed by foreign reporters but no independent scientists presentGermany\u0026rsquos task is to keep both China and US onside despite contentious trade surplusesMalaysian minister announces conclusion of operation to locate missing planeAccusations of censorship as Otago University says people found cover \u0026lsquoobjectionable\u0026rsquoRoot-and-branch reform under way as regime that ruled for half a century is dismantledTalks between North and South may resume on Friday after military drills involving US finishChinese affluence and urbanisation is leading couples to want to have fewer offspringVirus transmitted by bats and pigs identified as having potential for major outbreakWitness said Philip Wilson ordered him to recite 10 Hail Marys after reporting assault"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3514874.1527744461!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"senior north korea official meets mike pompeo in new york","story":"\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                                            A handout photograph obtained from the  US Department of State shows Kim Yong Chol (left), vice chairman of North Korea, being greeted by US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo  in New York.

Photograph: Getty   US secretary of state Mike Pompeo and high-ranking North Korean official Kim Yong Chol held a second day of meetings in New York yesterday as they try to settle nuclear weapons disagreements and set the stage for an historic summit between their two leaders.The two men left a 90-minute private dinner at a New York apartment on Wednesday night without providing details about their conversation. Another round of talks was scheduled for Thursday, with Mr Pompeo expected to leave New York this afternoon.The United States has been demanding that North Korea abandon its nuclear weapons program amid reports that it is close to being able to launch a nuclear-tipped missile capable of reaching the United States.Pyongyang has long argued that it needed nuclear weapons for its security.There were reports earlier on Wednesday that South Korean officials were noting “quite significant” differences between the United States and North Korea over denuclearization.The New York meetings follow high-level conversations Mr Pompeo held in North Korea in April and earlier in May and are intended to get negotiations between the two long-time adversaries back on track.US president Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jung Un had been scheduled to hold an unprecedented summit in Singapore on June 12th. Disputes between Washington and Pyongyang led Mr Trump to cancel the meeting, only to see a renewal of diplomatic efforts in recent days.Kim Yong Chol, a close aide of Kim Jong Un and vice chairman of the ruling Workers’ Party’s Central Committee, is the most senior North Korean official to meet senior US officials for talks in the United States in nearly two decades.In return for giving up its nuclear weapons, Washington could potentially loosen sanctions on Pyongyang, leading to possible food and other aid to impoverished North Korea and improved ties with South Korea. A senior State Department official briefed reporters separately as Mr Pompeo and Kim Yong Chol met late on Wednesday. The official, who asked not to be identified, said North Korea is “going to have to make clear what they are willing to do” in response to Washington’s demands.Mr Trump, the official said, “can make a fly or no-fly decision anytime he wants,” referring to the possible Singapore summit.If not enough progress is made to lead to a productive meeting between Mr Trump and Kim Jung Un, the official said, “we will ramp up the pressure on them and we’ll be ready for the day that hopefully they are ready.”The two Koreas have technically been at war for decades, even though the Korean War’s military combat ended in 1953, because a peace agreement was never signed. - Reuters "},{"url":null,"title":"hawaiis erupting kilauea volcano pictures","story":"Kilauea volcano has created nearly two dozen lava-shooting fissures on Hawaii\u0027s Big Island since the eruption began, spewing lava and emitting toxic gases.Thousands have been forced to evacuate their homes and experts remain unsure of where more of the hazardous cracks might open up, or when the volcanic activity might stop.The eruption of Kilauea volcano in Hawaii sparked new safety warnings about toxic gas on the Big Island\u0027s southern coastline after lava began flowing into the ocean and setting off a chemical reaction.The idyllic cove from The Beach is closing due to overtourismChelsea murder investigation after man in his 40s stabbed on exclusive street\u0026#39Murdered\u0026#39 journalist Arkady Babchenko turns up alive after death staged to \u0026#39expose Russian plot\u0026#39Thameslink compares poor train service to Poundland chocolate - and is threatened with legal actionBritain\u0026#39s Got Talent, semi final 3: Comedian cuts close to the funny bone - and is Dec overcompensating?EDL founder Tommy Robinson jailed for contempt of court after broadcasting tirade on FacebookComment: Getting women into the boardroom is a win-win.

The WHO acknowledged however, that identifying all potential contacts remains challenging.  Since the start of the current outbreak earlier this month, 54 cases -  including 35 confirmed instances - of the disease have been reported, mostly in the remote areas of Bikoro and Iboko in the country’s north-west Equateur province. Twenty-five people have died. No new cases have been reported in the past two days. Although only a minority of cases have been reported in Mbandaka, the vaccination effort has to date focused on the densely populated city of 1.2 million due to fears the number of Ebola cases could rise rapidly in an urban environment.Dr. Salama said that take up of the vaccine among people deemed to be at risk of the disease has been high. “The vaccine is proving to be a very acceptable intervention to the community,” said Dr. Salama.He acknowledged however, that the WHO and partner agencies were “still at an early stage in this outbreak response”. He said: “We can’t conclude that we have safeguarded the city of Mbandaka.” Dr Salama did not rule out the possibility of further cases in the city.   The WHO is now expanding the vaccination campaign into the rural areas at the centre of the outbreak. On Monday, WHO began vaccinations in Bikoro, where the outbreak was first declared.  The WHO is also expecting to receive approval in the next few days from the government of the DRC to use five new drugs on patients in Ebola treatment centres. The drugs are all unregistered and will be used as part of a clinical trial.  Dr. Salama said that it was not a simple effort to do this kind of trial in this kind of environment. The WHO hopes that the trial will pave the way for future Ebola treatment efforts. Earlier this month, WHO experts concluded that the current Ebola outbreak did not constitute a “public health emergency of international concern. The health agency is however, continuing to monitor potential locations, including 80 ports on the Congo river in DRC and neighbouring Republic of Congo for new cases of the disease.The current outbreak in the DRC is the worst outbreak of Ebola since the 2014 - 2015 outbreak which killed  11,300 people in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health SecurityThe idyllic cove from The Beach is closing due to overtourismChelsea murder investigation after man in his 40s stabbed on exclusive street\u0026#39Murdered\u0026#39 journalist Arkady Babchenko turns up alive after death staged to \u0026#39expose Russian plot\u0026#39Thameslink compares poor train service to Poundland chocolate - and is threatened with legal actionBritain\u0026#39s Got Talent, semi final 3: Comedian cuts close to the funny bone - and is Dec overcompensating?EDL founder Tommy Robinson jailed for contempt of court after broadcasting tirade on FacebookComment: Getting women into the boardroom is a win-win.

Given that Mr Kim has met Xi Jinping, the Chinese premier, twice in recent weeks, Moscow is likely to have emphasised its long-standing support for successive Kim regimes and pressed for a meeting with the North Korean leader.“The significance of this visit is that it shows that Russia want to be involved in the whole diplomatic game that is playing out in the region at the moment”, said James Brown, an associate professor who specialises in Russia-North Korea relations at the Tokyo campus of Temple University.“Russia and Japan may differ on many issues when it comes to North Korea, but one thing they have very much in common is that they feel left out of the present diplomatic process and both want to get back in”, he told The . “Russia has been quite supportive of North Korea in resisting some of the more expansionist demands of the US, and while Moscow says it supports denuclearisation of the North, they back Pyongyang’s position that it should be part of a broader process over many years and that it must be in tandem with the US making concessions as well”, he said. Russia is in favour of North Korea’s desire for the US to reduce its military presence in the region as that would clearly be in Moscow’s best interests, Mr Brown said, while another consideration is simply prestige.Korean detente How did we get here?Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, would also like to be able to obtain a degree of leverage over the North, perhaps through aid or trade, that could also be used to obtain concessions from the US at a later date if Washington is looking to exert pressure from a different direction, Mr Brown suggested. In recent months, coinciding with Pyongyang demonstrating a more conciliatory attitude towards the international community, there have been reports that Russia is looking at economic opportunities in the North. There have been reports that Moscow is ready to push ahead with a new railway link across the shared border that would one day travel the length of both North and South Korea and terminate in the port of Busan. Linked to the trans-Siberian railway, the line would give Russia access to a Pacific port less susceptible to icing in the bitter winter months than Vlaostok. Another proposal is for a gas pipeline to the southern tip of the Korean Peninsula.There are suggestions that Mr Lavrov was due to visit Pyongyang sooner after Mr Ri visited Moscow in May, but that the trip was put on hold by the North Korean side out of concern that it might antagonise Washington at a time when discussions were ongoing about a summit between Mr Kim and US President Donald Trump. Pyongyang now seems to be sufficiently confident that the summit, tentatively scheduled to take place in SIngapore on June 12, is going ahead. Please review our commenting policy\u0026#39Murdered\u0026#39 journalist Arkady Babchenko turns up alive after death staged to \u0026#39expose Russian plot\u0026#39The idyllic cove from The Beach is closing due to overtourismChelsea murder investigation after man in his 40s stabbed on exclusive streetThameslink compares poor train service to Poundland chocolate - and is threatened with legal actionBritain\u0026#39s Got Talent, semi final 3: Comedian cuts close to the funny bone - and is Dec overcompensating?EDL founder Tommy Robinson jailed for contempt of court after broadcasting tirade on FacebookComment: Getting women into the boardroom is a win-win.

Many of our major competitors are growing their investment in higher education and doing more to attract international talent. In order to maintain our global position, we need to continue to invest in higher education and ensure that the UK projects a more open and welcoming message for talented international staff and students.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

They then saw a high-speed flare get thrust out, escaping from the rim of the black hole. Scientists have seen black holes killing and swallowing stars. And the jets have been seen before.But a new study shows the first time that they have captured the hot flare that comes out just afterwards.

The fragment of jaw bone provides evidence of an east-west ide in the evolution of dinosaurs on the North American continent. During the Late Cretaceous period, 66 to 100 million years ago, the land mass was split into two continents by a shallow sea. This sea, the Western Interior Seaway, ran from the Gulf of Mexico to the Arctic Ocean. Dinosaurs living in the western continent, called Laramidia, were similar to those found in AsiaBrains cannot be categorised into female and male, according to the first study to look at sex differences in the whole brain. Specific parts of the brain do show sex differences, but inidual brains rarely have all “male” traits or all “female” traits.

The discovery, made using graphite that was trapped in ancient crystals, could mean that life began almost instantaneously after the Earth was formed. The researchers behind it have described the discovery as “a potentially transformational scientific advance”. Previously, life on Earth was understood to have begun when the inner solar system was hit by a massive bombardment from space, which also formed the moon\u0027s cratersNasa has announced that it has found evidence of flowing water on Mars.

Scientists have previously presumed that we are in a relatively safe period for meteor impacts, which are linked with the journey of our sun and its planets, including Earth, through the Milky Way. But some orbits might be more upset than we know, and there is evidence of recent activity, which could mean that we are passing through another meteor shower. Showers of meteors periodically pass through the area where the Earth is, as gravitational disturbances upset the Oort Cloud, which is a shell of icy objects on the edge of the solar system. They happen on a 26-million year cycle, scientists have said, which coincide with mass extinctions over the last 260-million yearsChinese scientists have created genetically-engineered, extra-muscular dogs, after editing the genes of the animals for the first time. The scientists create beagles that have double the amount of muscle mass by deleting a certain gene, reports the MIT Technology Review. The mutant dogs have “more muscles and are expected to have stronger running ability, which is good for hunting, police (military) applications”, Liangxue Lai, one of the researchers on the project. Now the team hope to go on to create other modified dogs, including those that are engineered to have human diseases like muscular dystrophy or Parkinson’s. Since dogs’ anatomy is similar to those of humans’, intentionally creating dogs with certain human genetic traits could allow scientists to further understand how they occurScientists say that the new dinosaur, known as Ugrunaaluk kuukpikensis, “challenges everything we thought about a dinosaur’s physiology”. Florida State University professor of biological science Greg Erickson said: “It creates this natural question. How did they survive up here?”Illustrations of the Earth and moon show the two to be quite close together, Mr Overstreet said. This is inaccurate, the reason being that these images are not to scale.Supplements are already recommended to pregnant women and children under five, but this report suggests that the benefits were more important in the pre-pregnancy stage when women may not know they are deficient.For this study researchers classified vitamin D levels of 30 nanograms per millilitre or below as “insufficient”. Women above this threshold were 10 per cent more likely to become pregnant than women below it, and each 10 nanogram per millilitre increase in their vitamin D levels prior to conception was linked to a 12 per cent lower risk of pregnancy loss.However, it found no association with vitamin D levels after pregnancy and miscarriage rates.The authors also note that this research would be needed to prove vitamin D levels were causing this change and it may be that factors like poor diet and lifestyle impact on fertility and vitamin D levels.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

One was so long ago that engraving had to do the job of photography the other was recent enough that some people alive today will have heard about it from their parents. In one, a foreign ship came to grief in British waters in the other, a British vessel went down in foreign waters, and down she stayed.First to Texel, safe haven, population 13,500: the largest of the West Frisian Islands off the coast of the Netherlands in the Wadden Sea. Today it is a magnet for Dutch cyclists, walkers, swimmers and riders (the latter an important reminder that Texel is the only known place where an entire navy was defeated by men on horseback, which is another tale altogether).In June 1743, a 700 ton vessel, VOC Hollandia, set sail on her maiden voyage bound for Batavia, the capital of the Dutch East Indies, now known as Jakarta. In any study of trade between Europe and Asia throughout the 17th and 18th centuries, the Dutch East India Company is pivotal, shipping everything from nutmegs and cinnamon to coffee and tobacco, porcelain to rubber. And that is what VOC stands for: Vereenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie.A brief history of democracy: Is it the \u0027will of the people\u0027?Yet on this prestigious occasion, Hollandia, being of brand new and bold design, an impressive 42 metres in length, was carrying a particularly special cargo: not only many VIP passengers but also 130,000 coins. Most were “pillar-dollars”, cut to represent smaller denominations, but among the haul were also highly valuable Mexican and Guatemalan silver coins.Hollandia’s captain must have been nervous therefore, as he headed for Brittany through rough seas. Perhaps he was aware too that just 36 years before, in 1707, at least 1,550 men had perished in the same waters, haplessly drifting towards the Scillies aboard four Royal Navy warships: the Firebrand, the Romney, the Association and the Eagle. (Indeed, square mile for square mile, the treacherous Scillies are probably responsible for more of the world’s estimated 159,000 shipwrecks than anywhere else.)Remember, these were the days before the invention of reliable navigation instruments still before the erection of most lighthouses.Texel is now a popular tourist venueSure enough, like those earlier ships, the Hollandia was blown off course, scarcely six weeks after setting sail, on a blustery 13 July. And it too came to grief off the Isles of Scilly, striking the notorious Gunner Rock, going down just off Annet, an uninhabited nature reserve just 54 acres in size, 20 miles from the Cornish coast.Nobody lived to tell the tale.Miraculously, in 1971 a London attorney called Rex Cowan discovered the Hollandia’s wreck, along with its bronze cannons and some of its treasure. Unusually, he was using a proton magnetometer, allowing him to test the Earth’s field of magnetic resonance, which in the process reveals every slight variation across that field – including ferrous objects embedded in land or sea.However, it is now time to turn to the anniversary of a sinking far further away and to consider the watery grave awaiting an equally emblematic vessel. This was a calamity that was far more preventable.Many boats have come a cropper in the waters around the Scilly Isles (iStock)State of the art flagship and battleship, the HMS Victoria – named in named in honour of the Queen’s impending Golden Jubilee in 1886 – was launched at a cost of £845 from Elswick on the Tyne. When she headed for the Mediterranean in June 1893 for training exercises, she had already endured one major mishap – a grounding at Platea, off the Greek coast, with Captain Maurice Archibald Bourke having permitted members of his crew to misplace the buoys that might have saved him from some very shallow waters.On that first cataclysmic day, 29 January 1892, no full tide – indeed nothing at all – would get the extraordinarily long (100 metres), extraordinarily heavy (11,200 tons) Victoria afloat again. Jettisoning 483 tons of coal, and calling for a tow from three other Royal Navy frigates, somehow the Victoria – its bottom damaged, three of its compartments seriously damaged – resumed its voyage on 4 February, limping into the new Hamilton Dock, Malta, for repairs. Bourke, despite being severely censured, retained his command.  HMS Victoria in dock, prior to completionAt the dawn of a second catastrophic day, 22 June 1893, Bourke and his contemporaries, among them Captain Jenkins on the Collingwood and Captain Markham on the Camperdown, were lined up like tin soldiers ready for an experimental manoeuvre – a very tight one at that. It was their misfortune to be in the hands of Vice Admiral Sir George Tryon, Commander of the British Mediterranean fleet: an obstinate, overbearing man with some very peculiar traits and strategies.Tryon was deliberately taciturn and unapproachable – the better, he thought, to assert the superiority of his rank. The better too to outdo “inferior” French and Italian navies also cruising the vital Mediterranean and the better to force his officers to think on their feet.Inexplicably – and at a time when signalling remained primitive, based as it was on a mixture of flags, semaphores and lamps – Tryon wanted the two columns of his fleet to turn, uniformly, a full 180 degrees, first towards each other then (so the theory went) retracing their prior course. His 11 Captains – with Tryon himself menacingly aboard the Victoria – were to do this whilst positioned a mere 1,100 or 1,200 metres from each other, even though a gap of 1,800-2,200 metres might have been considered a safe bare minimum.Markham hesitated. Surely Tryon had confused radii for diameters? Surely he had issued the sort of order likely to be revoked any minute? Perhaps Tryon really intended the convoy to turn 60 degrees to port, then 60 degrees to starboard, before resuming its original course?Tryon however, was getting impatient. Fearing humiliation – his colleagues also hesitant to defy their esteemed commander – Markham aboard the Camperdown conceded, swinging towards the fated Victoria, despite believing he cannot avoid hitting her.  Even so, the Victoria – built before the installation of automatic bulkhead doors – has many proven stabilisers. Perhaps Bourke is a more gifted captain than he has previously demonstrated?At the last, both lead vessels went straight into reverse thrust. But it was all too late.Vice Admiral Sir George Tryon was a difficult man insofar as his junior colleagues were concernedThe toughened steel ram of the Camperdown tore 9 feet into the side of the Victoria, a full 12 feet below its waterline. After two minutes the two vessels disengage but the Victoria lists, her many gun hatches and portholes taking in floods of swirling water.Three minutes later, her bow dips – but an unrelenting Tryon demands any rescue boats return to their respective ships. Now he commands the leaking Victoria to head straight for the shores of Tripoli, five miles distant. After all, the Victoria’s engines are still running, many men below deck unharmed.Maybe Tryon trusts that the “watertight” doors are still closed, so trapping many hands not already flushed into the ocean. Rapidly though, certainly by collision plus eight minutes, the whole of the Victoria’s bow is submerged, its stern far out of true, propellers turning in open air.At last, but way too late, Tryon yells: “Abandon ship! Everyone for himself!”  Five minutes on, the top deck goes under. Loosened boilers explode. Everything remotely portable bounces into the already hazardous surrounding ocean.Two men on board refuse to jump ship: Reverend SD Morris, the chaplain on duty in the sick bay, who folds his arms across his chest, closes his eyes and says a final prayer and Tryon himself, in time honoured tradition, going down on his watch, muttering: “this is entirely my doing, entirely my fault”.HMS Victoria disappears beneath the Mediterranean’s surfaceBourke – fitter and quicker than his superior – does, with great difficulty, make his escape. A distinguished fellow-escapee is the fevered John Jellicoe, one day himself to be promoted to commander-in-chief of the British Grand Fleet and dispatched to confront a detachment of the German navy off Jutland.Staff Commander Thomas Hawkins-Smith, one of Tryon’s most vocal critics, also survives by clinging on to rigging.\u0027Made in China’ label helps archaeologists solve 800-year-old mysteryIn total, 358 of Victoria’s complement perished, coincidentally the same number as those believed to have been saved. Six bodies only were taken ashore, along with 173 men injured during the tumult. Jenkins on the Collingwood unarguably rescued more people than any other captain on duty – mainly due to his not recalling his lifeboats.The stricken Camperdown, despite taking 90 minutes to effect partial water resistance, partial stability, somehow managed to keep going, battered, but without loss of life.Back in England, reliable news was scarce. Only Markham’s telegram listing 22 surviving officers was to hand and so thousands of anxious friends and relatives milled round the Admiralty.Anger and sorrow rapidly give way to philanthropy. Within three weeks, a remarkable distress fund of £50,000 was raised for Victoria widows and orphans – the equivalent of more than £5m today.John Jellicoe survived HMS Victoria’s sinking and went on to become Commander-in-Chief of the British Grand FleetDebates raged about whether there should be a public inquiry into the disaster some argued that would hand too many secrets of British seamanship to her enemies. A court martial was opened – Bourke’s second – with reporters allowed to witness some of the proceedings. Bourke requested that any captain sistering the Victoria was exempted as a judge.In the dock, Bourke kept referring to navy ships as if they were on a highway, obeying “rules of the road”. But the very concept of obedience troubled the chief investigator, Sir Michael Culme-Seymour – “a safe pair of hands” – throughout his deliberations.It appeared to be common ground that Markham on the Camperdown should have followed his first instinct and aborted the manoeuvre. But then, had there not been a collision, Markham would have been hauled over the coals for insubordination.Tryon actually gave his orders in person ignoring them was extremely difficult, however foolish and foolhardy they were.HMS Camperdown was commissioned at Portsmouth in 1889Culme-Seymour himself had to walk a tightrope: avoiding any hint at a precedent for altering (let alone ignoring) instructions from above. Tryon’s mental health was queried. Perhaps he was suffering from a brain disease, dementia, when he sent the Victoria to its doom?In the end, Bourke came out best, his reputation undiminished. Markham, meanwhile, was censured almost as much as his flag captain, Charles Johnstone. Both could have acted differently at different stages in the unfolding catastrophe. Markham was stripped of his command, his pay halved, and relegated to minor duties. He died early, aged 65, in 1906.Crucially, Tryon’s philosophy of seamanship was abandoned, history not permitted to be kind to his memory. Of the engaged fleet formation only a repaired Camperdown was still being tossed by high seas in 1898.Like the Hollandia, the Victoria’s wreckage lay undiscovered for a long time. Not until 111 years and two months later, on 22 August 2004, was the ship found, by Austrian-Lebanese er Christian Francis, assisted by British explorer Mark Ellyatt. It was positioned almost vertically, 140 metres below their search vessel. They concluded that a full 30 metres of the Victoria’s bow had buried itself in the seabed.Our fascination with the ocean is ceaseless (PA)Three intriguing footnotes to the sinking of the Victoria continue to tantalise. First, it has long been the legend that, at the very moment of inevitable collision between the Victoria and the Camperdown, Mrs Tryon was hosting a party in her London mansion, when Commander Tryon himself, but ghostlike, descended the staircase to join festivities.Second, one of Tryon’s hobbies was collecting memorabilia connected to his hero, Horatio Nelson. In 2012, Ellyat temporarily retrieved Nelson’s sword from Tryon’s cabin but, unsure what to do with this precious artefact, he hid the discovery in a different part of the wreck where it abides till this day.Third, is the very title “Victoria” fated? After all, it was the MV Princess Victoria, a British Railways’ roll-on, roll-off ferry that sank on its passage from Larne to Stranraer, on 31 January 1953, costing 133 lives (at the start of the weekend of the great Lincolnshire floods, which left many people drowned across East Anglia and the Low Countries).How Chad’s killing fields have been turned into an elephants’ havenHow crowdfunding is enabling indie talent to create graphic novelsWhy women in South Africa are carrying the burden of HIVAnd barely six weeks after that terrible storm, a reordered SS Victoria also sank, this time striking rocks – just as the Hollandia did.Why, though, recognise the anniversary of any ship’s demise when there are no living survivors and nothing to add to any inquest? Well, the lure of the sea still captivates and enchants even the most landlocked of the general population.Despite all its dangers – because of all its dangers – the sea is where many of us are most alive.Isles of Scillyor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The animals are cramped very close together – there is no enrichment in their life whatsoever.White foxes in cages, bred for their fur in China (HSI UK)“To make it economical, they are kept in vast numbers – it’s an industry and it’s entirely repugnant.”The animals display repetitive behaviour caused by stress, the BBC star said, adding that they gnawed at one another or at themselves. “The mental distress is immeasurable, he said. Foxes’ lives are governed by their sense of smell and each one has a unique scent, he said, “so imagine being in a shed with thousands of other foxes – it would be extraordinarily distressing.”Foxes in Quebec, Canada their water bowls are out of reach (Jo-Anne McArthur)To see a wild mink would be a treat, Packham said. “Just so someone can have a bit of trimming for their collar or hood or a full coat – I mean, come on, get a grip. We’re meant to have evolved and have greater understanding and respect for all life,” he said. “Let’s do away with this rubbish, can we?”He added: “They’re not going to be comfortable in conditions I’ve seen them kept in – way too small, dark, overcrowded, underfed. It’s shocking, just absolutely shocking. These animals are every bit as wild – they carry all the wild behaviour and needs of wild animals.”Bodies representing fur traders say animals bred and reared in cages are domesticated and know no other conditions so the practice is not cruel.But the experts behind the letter to Mr Gove, including renowned conservationist Dr Jane Goodall, point to the “worrying, even distressing evidence of persistently poor welfare conditions” from investigations at farms that export to the UK.Norway pledges to shut down all fur farms by 2025The letter, copied to all MPs on the environment and farming committee, says: “Wild animals on fur farms live their lives in wire-floored cages thousands of times smaller than their natural territories.“They are denied their biological inheritance to exhibit natural behaviours and stimulations such as hunting, digging and swimming. And they can be kept in what is for them unnatural social groups. For example, naturally solitary mink are compelled to live in very close proximity to each other.“These features of fur farms can inevitably lead to psychological stresses. Instances of stereotypical behaviour, a sign of compromised psychological wellbeing, have been well documented on fur farms, as have cannibalism, untreated wounds, foot deformities and eye infections.”The letter’s authors say that welfare certification schemes require no more than what is legally required in each country.The Council of Europe has recommended housing systems allowing animals to fulfil their biological needs, such as swimming or digging, but none of these are possible to any meaningful extent on fur farms, the letter says.An oversized fox in Finland, bred to be grotesquely obese (Oikeutta Elaimille)Alick Simmons, Britain’s former deputy chief veterinary officer, who signed the letter, said fur farming caused animals sustained psychological damage. “This is too high a price to pay for clothing where there are perfectly acceptable alternatives, and so a UK fur import ban would be entirely consistent with our animal welfare values,” he said.HSI UK, which heads the “#FurFreeBritain” campaign for an imports ban, backed by nearly half a million people, warned of “welfare washing” by fur trade chiefs who were “taking their PR spin to new levels of audacity”.Mette Lykke Nielsen, head of Fur Europe, last month told MPs on the Commons Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee that animals bred on fur farms were domesticated so being kept in cages 2ft 3in x 2ft 5in – just a little larger than the animal itself – was not cruel.A mink on a Canadian fur farm where the cages have not been cleaned (Jo-Anne McArthur )Fox cages were “enriched” with a bone and mink ones with a piece of plastic tubing, she said, insisting that such conditions would be cruel if the animals were wild.Mink would not breed in the cages if their welfare was poor, she insisted.Claire Bass, of HSI UK, said the claim “beggared belief”.She said: “The life of an animal on a fur farm is one of monotonous deprivation, and it’s extremely common that the relentless boredom and lack of space triggers the repetitive pacing and spinning o indicative of mental disturbance.“For the fur trade to shamelessly promote that miserable existence as welfare-friendly is taking their PR spin to new levels of audacity. We hope this letter from veterinary and animal-welfare experts will remind MPs to beware ‘welfare washing’ by the trade. It’s time for the UK to stop trading in this suffering.”However, those lobbying for change could face a big battle. Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee minister Lord Gardiner told the departmental hearing last month: “We think there should be an adherence to humane standards, whether it is in trapping or in fur farming … It is incumbent on the fur industry to be looking to raise standards so that those who wish to have real fur can also feel confident that the animals have been reared and farmed and indeed killed in a humane manner.”And business minister Lord Henley said: “I have no desire to close things down. I am not in the business of banning things.”Fur imports into UK by country and value, 2011-16In 2016 alone £55.6m worth of fur was imported into the UKSources: HSIUKFurEuropeRussian Fur UnionUS Association of Fish \u0026amp Wildlife AgenciesNext week’s parliamentary debate was forced by a petition calling for an imports ban that attracted more than 100,000 signatures. In its response, the government said: “National bans are less effective than working at an international level on animal welfare standards.”It said regulations ensured that any fur imported was from animals that had been treated and killed humanely.Activists said rearing animals for fur humanely was impossible and the government should take a “symbolic” stand against the trade “in line with public beliefs”.The EU bans the import and sale of seal, cat and dog fur but HSI UK says if Britain opted for a soft Brexit – remaining in the single market – a “public morality” clause in EU rules would allow for a UK ban on other animal furs.Foxes kept in wire cages in Poland, the third-biggest exporter of fur to the UK (Open Cages)Fur farming is banned in several other countries including Austria, the Czech Republic and the Netherlands and is being phased out in Denmark, Sweden and Switzerland. India has banned imports of mink, fox and chinchilla fur skins.HSI UK says that based on 2015 figures, China produces 75 million mink, fox and raccoon a year, and the EU produces 45.6 million mink, foxes, raccoon dogs and chinchilla a year.High numbers of rabbits – thought to be hundreds of millions – are also killed for fur around the world.As well as farmed fur animals, an estimated 5 million animals are caught in the wild in traps each year, including coyote, lynx, beaver and otter. or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

But it’s the European Union that protects more than ever our sovereignty in a globalised world,” Mr Bettel said in his address to the parliament’s plenary session in Strasbourg.“The European Union provides added value to European citizens, in countless instances improving their daily lives. However, one of the greatest challenges the union faces today is the fact that these advantages resulting from a country’s membership of the union are simply taken for granted.EU budget chief accused of \u0027bullying\u0027 Italian voters over populistsMay tells EU to stop sound-bites despite coining \u0027Brexit means Brexit\u0027UK must \u0027come fully out\u0027 of EU customs union, Boris Johnson saysEU officials tear into UK’s ‘fantasy’ Brexit negotiating strategyUK ‘strongly objects’ to being excluded from EU’s Galileo satellite“It is therefore not a coincidence that so many UK citizens living in my country have been applying for Luxembourg citizenship since the Brexit referendum. Many others are apparently doing the same in other member states.“These applications for citizenship by British citizens are proof of the huge added value of the public goods and services created by the European Union which these citizens don’t want to abandon: most obviously the four freedoms.”Mr Bettel said the EU did not “want to punish Britain” but that the country could not have “the advantages without the constraints”. “We must have common rules and we must say to UK you can\u0027t have one without the other.”But the country’s PM warned against turning on voters themselves, adding: “Brexit is really a blow for all of us and same goes to Italy.

Mr Sheleg is an Israeli-born businessman who reportedly could soon become the party’s new treasurer. He is the owner of the Halcyon art gallery in London and has recently become a major Tory benefactor. He gave the party £250,000 ahead of last year’s snap election.Ms Chernukhin’s donations are also among the largest. The lavish lifestyle she and her husband led was illustrated during a legal dispute, when it emerged Mr Chernukhin had asked a wealth management firm to buy a £13.5m private jet that was never delivered.Mr Chernukhin was on good terms with Mr Putin in the early years of his presidency, according to reports.He was on the soviet ministry of foreign trade and then served as deputy finance minister from 2000 to 2002. In 2004 he was appointed chairman of a state-owned bank by presidential decree and awarded an order of honour from Mr Putin in 2004.However, he was then dismissed from the role for for his loyalty to Mikhail Kasyanov, a vocal critic of Mr. Putin, and moved to the UK with his family some time later.Cameron\u0027s dinner guests: Anthony and Carole BamfordCameron\u0027s dinner guests: CEO of CQS Michael Hintze (pictured) and his wife Dorothy.Cameron\u0027s dinner guests: Chief Executive of  Media Group, Murdoch MacLennan and his wife Elsa.Cameron\u0027s dinner guests: Lord John Sainsbury (pictured), President of J Sainsbury supermaket, and his wife Lady Sainsbury.Cameron\u0027s dinner guests:  property developer and David RowlandCameron\u0027s dinner guests: chief executive of ICAP plc, Michael Spencer (pictured) and his wife.Mr Johnson told the Andrew Marr Show earlier this year that Ms Chernukhin, as a British citizen, had every right to exercise her democratic rights and donate to a political party.When Marr cited fears that the Conservative Party have been “taking far too much Russian money”, Mr Johnson said: “If there is evidence of gross corruption in the way the gentleman obtained his wealth ... then it is possible for our law enforcement to deprive him of his wealth.”Chris Bryant, Labour MP and vice-chairman of parliament’s all-party group on Russia, said at the time: “The prime minister said quite categorically this week that we should be tackling Putin’s cronies. What could be more of a crony that Putin’s former deputy finance minister?”A Conservative Party spokesman said: “All donations to the Conservative Party are properly and transparently declared to the Electoral Commission and published by them, and comply fully with the law.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

My family is half-French and this is a specific problem.”Less than two weeks later Alexander van Terheyden, a council candidate in Hackney, was also suspended after he called Islam a “violent political ideology” comparable to fascism and communism on social media. In response to allegations of Islamophobia, Mr Van Terheyden said: “I’ve stated Islam is a violent political ideology. Note the word ‘political’ and not religious. Note I do not refer to Muslims, I refer to the political ideology.“My views have always been public. If you mean the fact that I’m happy to voice my discontent for communism, fascism, Islam and other extreme political ideologies there is no secret to this.”Three days later a Conservative council candidate in Watford, Darren Harrison, was suspended for allegedly supporting white supremacists.Mr Harrison apparently attended events held by nationalist anti-Islam group Generation Identity.He denied being a supporter of the group and said: “I do not support their views, but support their right to have their views, as I do anyone else, as long as it does not promote violence which to my knowledge, it does not.”Tory MP accused of Islamophobia after posting anti-Muslim articleOn 24 April Phillipa Auton stepped down as the council candidate in Hounslow after she responded to a story about the 2016 Berlin attacks by tweeting: “Revoke Muslim immigration, repatriate and secure European borders, keep Europe safe”. She stood by her comments and said she “supports free speech”. “You are limited to the number of characters you use in a tweet. I am against illegal immigration and I support having closed borders,” she said. The next day the Conservative mayor of Wokingham, Peter Lucey, also stood down after a number of social media posts about Islam and the English Defence League. Mr Lucey said: “Some past social media posts came to light and those are not appropriate for the town mayor.“I resigned for that reason, and I fully apologise to everyone involved. I would like to apologise to the people of Wokingham and to my party, and I resign from all of them.”On 27 April, Nick Sundin, a Tory council candidate in Newcastle, was suspended after he tweeted the Prophet Mohammed was a “f****** paedophile”. He did not respond directly to allegations of Islamophobia but did delete his Twitter account. Less than a week later, Karen Sunderland, a council candidate in Lewisham, was suspended after old tweets emerged where she called Islam “the new Nazism”.After the story emerged Ms Sunderland’s Twitter account was deleted.World news in picturesWorld news in picturesA worker cleans up the Millenaire migrants makeshift camp along the Canal de Saint-Denis near Porte de la Villette, northern Paris, following its evacuation on May 30.

Digital minister Margot James told BBC Radio 5 Live that fans looking to buy tickets from a secondary site should not choose Viagogo, one of four major ticket reselling firms in the UK, because “they are the worst”. Meanwhile, National Trading Standards said on Wednesday that it had been in contact with the Advertising Standards Authority in relation to Viagogo. “As such we have now launched an investigation into Viagogo, which will look at all legal options to bring them into compliance with the law,” a spokesperson for Trading Standards said.Viagogo has previously been censured by the Advertising Standards Authority for “failing to make clear upfront all fees that can be calculated in advance when making price claims”, putting it in breach of the \u0026nbspUK Code of Non-broadcast Advertising and Direct \u0026amp Promotional Marketing, known as the CAP Code.The ASA said it had received complaints about how prices were presented on the Viagogo website, with quoted costs not making clear to consumers that they would be expected to pay additional fees and charges when ordering tickets. The ASA said it contacted Viagogo in March requesting that the company make changes to its website, and the firm said it would make the necessary amendments. However, the ASA added, as of Wednesday, Viagogo’s website “continues to include pricing information that is in breach of the CAP Code and the ASA’s ruling”. As a result, Viagogo has been placed in the ‘non-compliant advertisers’ section of the ASA’s website. Viagogo has been contacted for comment. The company was not the only firm implicated in the ASA’s crackdown earlier this year: StubHub, Seatwave and GetMeIn were also accused of misleading customers about fees and charges when booking tickets.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Photographer Jim Bourg: This photo was shot with one of two remote cameras. The cameras were monitored and triggered remotely and the pictures were transmitted to clients worldwide within minutes of being taken.US President Barack Obama wipes away tears as he delivers his farewell address in Chicago on 10 January, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: In his final days in office, Obama made a visit home to Chicago. As he spoke from the stage to his wife and daughter in the audience, he became emotional when he talked about what they had sacrificed during his time in office. I turned from photographing the Obama women embracing to find him onstage wiping away tears. A combination of photos shows the crowds attending the inauguration ceremonies to swear in U.S. President Donald Trump at 12:01pm (left) on January 20, 2017 and President Barack Obama sometime between 12:07pm and 12:26pm on January 20, 2009. US President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump attend the Liberty Ball in honour of his inauguration in Washington on 20 January, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: What I see when I look at this picture is the end of a very long day, not to mention weeks and months of preparation by many photographers, editors and network experts and the beginning of everything since. US President Donald Trump greets Director of the FBI James Comey as Director of the Secret Service Joseph Clancy (L), watches during the Inaugural Law Enforcement Officers and First Responders Reception in the Blue Room of the White House on 22 January, 2017. Photographer Joshua Roberts: I have covered the White House for 16 years and normally either the President or the pool is in position when an event starts. In this case the President was not where anyone expected him to be. In fact, he was almost blocking the door when the pool came in. We had to scramble to find a position without bumping him or the furniture as he greeted and thanked members of law enforcement for their security efforts during the inauguration. Luckily, he greeted FBI Director James Comey a few seconds after the pool had made its way into the room.US President Donald Trump, is joined by his staff, as he speaks by phone with Russia\u0027s President Vladimir Putin in the Oval Office on 28 January, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: Very early in the Trump administration, weekends were as busy as weekdays. On Trump\u0027s second Saturday the official schedule said he would be making private phone calls to a number of world leaders including Russia\u0027s Vladimir Putin. I arrived early and, before sitting down at my desk walked up to Press Secretary Sean Spicer\u0027s office. He, too, was just taking his coat off. I gingerly made the suggestion that previous administrations had sometimes allowed photos of such phone calls through the Oval Office windows on the colonnade. To my mild shock, he didn\u0027t even think about it twice. We\u0027ll do it! he said. In truth, I really only expected the Putin call, but we were outside the windows multiple times throughout the day as the calls went on.Senior advisor Kellyanne Conway (L) attends as US President Donald Trump welcomes the leaders of dozens of historically black colleges and universities (HBCU) in the Oval Office on 27 February, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: We\u0027re often asked how much access we have to the Trump administration, and the answer is we have an awful lot. President Trump himself is very comfortable in the spotlight, and his aides are similarly unfazed by cameras. In this instance, senior advisor Kellyanne Conway was so comfortable in our presence she seemed not to consider the optics of kneeling on a Oval Office sofa to take pictures with her phone. Germany\u0027s Chancellor Angela Merkel and US President Donald Trump hold a joint news conference in the East Room of the White House on 17 March, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: Chancellor Merkel made one of the earliest important visits of any US allies to meet Trump in his first months in office. When world leaders give joint news conferences they don\u0027t always tend to give each other their full attention - but Merkel watched Trump intently at several key moments, and here seemed particularly rapt.President Trump reacts as he sits on a truck while he welcomes truckers and CEOs to attend a meeting regarding healthcare at the White House on 23 March, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: The White House organised a listening session with truckers and CEO\u0027s of major American companies, regarding healthcare reform. An 18-wheeler tow truck was parked on the South Lawn of the White House and as Trump welcomed the truckers someone invited the him to come and sit in the driver\u0027s seat. Trump jumped into the cab and started yelling and pretending to drive - creating one of the most memorable pictures of the year. A lesson learned, always be prepared for the unexpected.US President Donald Trump talks to journalists members of the travel pool on board the Air Force One during his trip to Palm Beach, Florida on 6 April, 2017. Carlos Barria: During the many trips to President Trump\u0027s residence in Florida it is usual to see the president coming to the back of the plane to chat with journalists. During one of the trips to the so called \u0027Winter White House\u0027, Trump had a long talk with reporters while the Air Force One entertainment system was playing one of the latest Star Wars movies. As I was listening to Trump talk I was also looking at the movie waiting for a part of the movie to frame the mood of the day. Of the many scenes, I choose the one with Darth Vader.US President Donald Trump speaks during an interview with Reuters in the Oval Office of the White House on 27 April, 2017. \u0026#13US President Donald Trump reacts as he arrives at Harrisburg international airport, before attending a rally marking his first 100 days in office in Pennsylvania on 29 April, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: President Trump travelled to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania to celebrate his hundred days in office with a victory rally. He was in friendly territory as he won with a big difference over his opponent Hillary Clinton in Pennsylvania, during the November elections. As usual when the commander-in-chief arrives local residents gather to greet him. This time a small group of military personnel attended the arrival. Surrounded by secret service agents Trump walked from the Air Force One and raised his hand in a sign of victory as the crowd cheered him on.White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer (L) and White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus watch as US President Donald Trump presents the U.S. Air Force Academy football team with the Commander-in-Chief trophy in the Rose Garden of the White House in Washington on 2 May, 2017. Photographer Joshua Roberts: Covering the White House does not just mean covering the President. White House staffers are an important part of the story and their relationship with the President and each other is an indicator of how things are going in the West Wing. The tendency is to focus exclusively on the President once an event starts but I always try to look around to see how people are reacting as things unfold.Secret Service agents use a presidential limousine as cover from spraying water as US President Donald Trump lands via Marine One helicopter in New York on 4 May, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: The best part of any trip to New York City with the sitting US President is the helicopter ride into Manhattan. The ride out at night can be stunning. Here, Secret Service agents protect themselves from the spray from the East River as Trump lands on the helipad. US President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump wait the arrival of French President Emmanuel Macron (unseen) before a lunch ahead of a NATO Summit in Brussels on 25 May, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: One of the best parts of travelling overseas for White House coverage is the chance to see the U.S. president in different environments and (literally) a different light. Here, Trump and his wife came out of the shadows to greet France\u0027s President Macron.US President Donald Trump meets with Russian President Vladimir Putin during their bilateral meeting at the G20 summit in Hamburg, Germany on 7 July, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: On July 7, I witnessed one of the most important meetings of President Trump\u0027s first year in office. Trump met Russian President Vladimir Putin during a bilateral meeting at the G20 summit in Germany. The world\u0027s eyes were on these two leaders after speculation about Russian interference during the 2016 US elections. We entered the room for less than two minutes, where I took dozens of pictures. But there was this very interesting moment when Trump extended his hand to Putin for a handshake. Putin paused for a second and looked at Trump\u0027s hand. That was the picture that I was looking for, a little moment that seemed to say a lot. First lady Melania Trump chats with US President Donald Trump during their return from Germany at Joint Base Andrews, Maryland on 8 July, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: After President Trump\u0027s trip to Germany he arrived back at Joint Base Andrews, Maryland. First Lady Melania Trump said goodbye to Trump as she was heading off in a different direction that day. While chatting a breeze blew Melania\u0027s hair up in the air. Vice President Mike Pence laughs as President Donald Trump holds a baseball bat as they attend a Made in America product showcase event at the White House on 17 July, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: This summer the White House organized an event to showcase \u0027Made in America\u0027 products. All kinds of exhibitors brought their products as the President and Vice President toured the event. One of the companies was Marucci Sport, a manufacturer of baseball bats based in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. As Trump approached a table full of baseball bats, photographers at the event, including me, rushed to get a good angle hoping that he would pick up a bat. As we predicted, he did. He took one and joked around as though he was hitting something hard. The only thing closer to him right there, was the media.Former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski says hello to reporters as he and White House advisors including Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci accompany President Trump for an event celebrating veterans at AMVETS Post 44 in Ohio, July 25, 2017. Jonathan Ernst: The most visible person in any White House is naturally the President, followed by the press secretary. But there are also the staff who support them. For those of us covering the Trump administration, there seem to be more compelling figures in the West Wing than ever before. It\u0027s crucial to know who\u0027s who and why they\u0027re important. When I raised my camera and back-pedalled ahead of the group to take this image Lewandowski gave me a hello. I liked the photo, but had no idea it would go a little bit viral, especially since Scaramucci, who was the biggest mover and shaker that week, was hidden back in the pack. But I guess the image catches a glimpse of what it\u0027s like to be a West Wing staffer on the road. US President Donald Trump arrives at a rally in West Virginia on 3 August, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: President Trump travelled to Huntington for one of his usual campaign rallies. While members of his family spoke to the crowd he was waiting under a black curtain to be introduced. Suddenly he walked onto the stage, one of the first frames that I took was of his hand. I set my exposure for the light on the stage hoping to create this dark background and it worked. Without his protective glasses on, US President Donald Trump looks up towards the solar eclipse while viewing with his wife Melania and son Barron at the White House on 21 August, 2017. Photographer Kevin Lamarque: On a day when everyone, and I mean everyone, was told not to look at the eclipse without protective glasses, Trump, President of the United States, couldn\u0027t help himself.US President Donald Trump poses for a photo as he and first lady Melania Trump help volunteers hand out meals during a visit with flood survivors of Hurricane Harvey at a relief centre in Houston, Texas on 2 September, 2017. Photohrapher Kevin Lamarque: Trump, eager to deliver the image of a hands-on response to Hurricane Harvey, made this visit to a relief centre and obliged this woman with a selfie as Melania continued to work. Donald Trump welcomes 11-year-old Frank Giaccio as he cuts the Rose Garden grass at the White House on 15 September. Frank, who wrote a letter to Trump offering to mow the lawn, was invited to work for a day at the White House along the National Park Service staff.  Frank was so focused on his task that he did not notice the President arrive to surprise him. He took his father jumping in to grab his attention and point Trump out. Photographer Carlos Barria said: “The image of Trump shouting at a kid who is mowing his lawn might have many interpretations in today\u0027s politically polarized United States. But for me it was just a kid who loved what he was doing, to the point he almost appeared to ignore the President.A man kneels with a folded U.S. flag as the motorcade of U.S. President Donald Trump passes him after an event at the state fairgrounds in Indianapolis, Indiana, U.S., September 27, 2017. In September, soon after Trump had made comments condemning NFL players who kneel during the national anthem, he made a day trip to a rally in Indianapolis. Jonathan Ernst managed to capture a man on one knee with a tri-folded flag and was able to use a portion of the sign on the building he was kneeling in front of to track the man down and tell his story in full. US Army veteran Marvin Boatright wanted to send a message against social injustice. President Donald Trump throws rolls of paper towels into a crowd of local residents affected by Hurricane Maria as he visits Calgary Chapel in San Juan, Puerto Rico on 3 October, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: During an afternoon visit to Puerto Rico for President Trump to survey damage from Hurricane Maria and greet some of its victims, Trump made a stop at a church where food and supplies were being distributed. Among the items were paper towels and Trump, apparently caught up in the moment, decided to distribute some of the rolls.White House Senior adviser Jared Kushner sits behind President Trump during a cabinet meeting in Washington on 1 November, 2017. Photographer Kevin Lamarque: The role of Jared Kushner has gone through a series of changes. He began front and centre as a high profile adviser, but as time has passed and issues surrounding him have surfaced, he has become more of a background figure.Donald Trump and China\u0027s President Xi Jinping shake hands after making joint statements at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on 9 November, 2017. Photographer Damir Sagolj: It\u0027s one of those how to make a better or at least different shot when two presidents shake hands several times a day, several days in row. If I\u0027m not mistaken in calculation, presidents Xi Jinping and Donald Trump shook their hands at least six times in events I covered during Trump\u0027s recent visit to China. I would imagine there were some more handshakes I haven\u0027t seen but other photographers did. And they all look similar - two big men, smiling and heartily greeting each other until everyone gets their shot. But then there is always something that can make it special - in this case the background made of US and Chinese flags. The first time it didn\u0027t work for me. The second time I positioned myself lower and centrally, and used the longest lens I have to capture only hands reaching for a handshake.US President Donald Trump boards Air Force One to depart for Vietnam from Beijing Airport in Beijing, China, November 10, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: There is a Reuters photographer in the tight pool covering the US president for every appearance he makes 365 days a year. This was just one of 32 images of mine that were transmitted on the Reuters wire of President Trump visiting China and Vietnam that day. You never know when a sudden interaction, a gust of wind or a unique facial expression will lead to a striking image that grabs peoples\u0027 attention.Donald Trump registers his surprise as he realises other leaders, including Russia\u0027s Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, Vietnam\u0027s Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc, President of the Philippines Rodrigo Duterte and Australia\u0027s Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, are crossing their arms for the traditional ASEAN handshake as he participates in the opening ceremony of the summit in Manila on 13 November, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: Having covered a few ASEAN summits, I knew to expect the ASEAN handshake. Not everyone in the room knew to expect the ASEAN handshake. A lot was written about this unscripted moment, and what deeper meaning it might have. The simple truth is that sometimes in life there are unscripted moments.Since joining the US president’s legal team Mr Giuliani has made a series of notable television appearances.This includes making the bombshell admission Mr Trump repaid his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, for the $130,000 payment to adult actor Stormy Daniels as part of a nondisclosure agreement related to an affair Ms Daniels says she had with Mr Trump in 2006.But Mr Giuliani was later challenged over how his statement appeared to contradict Mr Trump’s earlier denial of knowledge of the payment to Ms Daniels.Mr Giuliani responded by saying the talk of a $35,000 a month retainer was just “rumour” – despite him having said days earlier it was fact.The Republican also revealed the president recently ordered a hamburger – one of his favourite dishes – with just half a bun.He told The Washington Post the duo dined together on 6 May at the president’s golf club in Virginia.While Mr Giuliani enjoyed a light Cobb salad, Mr Trump, whose weakness for fast food has been widely documented, ordered a well-done burger with half the bun, a choice which The Post claims was “in service to his health”.“I do that, too, sometimes. It’s a good way to do it,” Mr Giuliani said.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Italian governments have failed to meet the aspirations of Italians since at least the 1990s and the voters have been turning to ever more populist and extremist parties as a result.Italy could still get populist government as compromise hintedThe two leading groups in Italy are now the Five Star Movement, which was, literally, founded by a comedian, and is a kind of Italian Ukip and The League, formerly the Northern League, which enjoys most of its support in the wealthier north of Italy, rather than the poorer, more rural south. (Analogous to Catalan separatism in Spain).The League advocated virtual separation for the Northern provinces to form their own state. Some seek outright independence, reversing the historic Resorgimento (unification) of 1861. The League is thus a kind of cross between the politics of the SNP and Ukip.The president vetoed their choice of finance minister because he was a eurosceptic and might seek to lead Italy out of the euro – for which the Five StarLeague parties did not receive a mandate from the Italian electorate. The parties then refused to form a government, hence the stalemate. Some form of technocratic government will govern Italy until fresh elections are held. These may in effect become a referendum on staying in the euro (though not the EU).Italy’s slow-growing economy means poorer public services, bigger national and private debts, lower wages and lower living standards than expected. Some blame immigration, and Italy is certainly the first destination for many making their way across the Mediterranean from Africa.Why Brexiteers are enjoying the crisis in ItalySome also resent the euro, the European single currency, fully adopted in 2002, and regard it as a German racket. On this reading of things, the Germans do well out of Italy by selling the Italians their cars and then lending the Italians the money to pay for them, a cycle leading to a sort of economic bondage. Italians thus believe the EU, and Germany in particular, has too much power over Italy hence the new strain of euro scepticism in what was traditionally an enthusiastic founding member (1957) of the European Union. Once the tacit admission in Italy was that they’d prefer Brussels to turn their affairs than Rome. That has now changed.So the Italian populist parties are stirring up conflicts with the EU Commission in Brussels and the European Central Bank in Frankfurt – convenient scapegoats.The Italian state and the Italian banks are going bust simultaneously, because they rely upon each other and neither is strong.The banking crisis after 2008 exposed two particular Italian problems, apart from longer term demographic and industrial trends, and these are still the immediate issues.  First and most serious is the weakness of her banks. By tradition most of the debts issued by the Italian government were purchased by Italian banks, pension funds and other financial institutions. The Italian banks are therefore stuffed full of Italian government bonds, and investors are becoming increasingly concerned that the weaknesses in Italy\u0027s public finances, namely a very large national debt, would lead to a default on the bonds, leaving them less valuable or worthless, and destroying the financial assets of the banks – which would then suffer a run and go bust.Italy and Italy’s banks would be insolvent – and beyond the capacity of Germany or the EU to rescue. Only a huge programme of buying Italian government debts, via the Italian banks, by the European Central Bank, in turn funded by the German taxpayer, has prevented this collapse from happening sooner.World news in picturesWorld news in picturesA worker cleans up the Millenaire migrants makeshift camp along the Canal de Saint-Denis near Porte de la Villette, northern Paris, following its evacuation on May 30.

These are exacerbated by the populist programme of the Five Star and League parties – which would need to borrow much more in order to fund their ambitious spending programmes.Dissolution with the post-Mussolini, post-Second World War settlement set in during the 1990s, when the old parties, the Christian Democrats and Socialists, became mired in scandal and associated with political and economic failure.Italy’s economy had began to stagnate, losing its competiveness and compounded by a low birth rate and declining working population. The post-war boom, an economic miracle which had seen Italians moving from the countryside to the towns and cities, owning scooters and cars and growing prosperous was ending.What is Italy\u0027s crisis about and how serious is it?In the 1950s and 1960s Italy, carried along by the increase in trade in the original EU, was growing at 7 per cent or so a year. Names such as Fiat, Lambretta and Zanussi became famous globally powerful brands, along with luxury brands such as Prada, Armani and Ferrari.But by the 1990s low growth, higher unemployment and stagnant living standards became the norm increased migration, which might help the Italian economy if properly managed, was viewed with resentment and suspicion.It was then that figures such as Silvio Berlusconi and his Forza Italia gained in popularity, themselves eventually giving way to Five Star and The League.If the economy, public finances and banks were fixed, many of Italy’s political problems would melt away. There are three options:This would mean allowing a Five StarLeague government to carry out its spending plans, allowing it to borrow and print much more money, and have the ECB buy all the resulting debt without complaint.Berlusconi allowed to run again for election as Italy\u0027s prime ministerItaly would also be allowed to print a parallel euro currency of its own, as the populist parties would like, (“mini bonds”) to help fund its spending, any inflationary problems being dealt with by the ECB, again without penalty to Italy.This would require the wealthier economies of Germany, the Netherlands and Finland, for example, to continue to subsidise Italy, in return for its continuing membership of the single currency and something resembling stability.However the ECB has already indicated it wishes to scale back its purchases of Italian government debt – which has fuelled investors’ concerns that no-one else will buy them.Exitaly: Italy leaves the euro In the long term this would enable Italy to devalue its own currency to get through structural reforms, solve any problems with international trade and to accommodate inflation, as was traditional when they used the lira. It cannot do this under the euro, and instead has to cut public spending, cut wages and undergo austerity – all deeply unpopular.However, bringing back the lira also means that interest rates would soar to persuade investors to take on the risk of a devaluing new lira currency or a default by an Italian government unable to pay back its treasury bonds.In the short run, Italy\u0027s already large national debt would need to be redenominated in the new lira currency, which, being worth less than the euro, will make the debt more expensive to service, perhaps prohibitively so.A European Risorgimento: Reform of the euro system: adding a banking union and a fiscal unionThis is the kind of solution President Macron of France has been campaigning for. It would mean that all eurozone governments in effect take on each others debts, and all are responsible for the stability of the banking system in every member state of the single currency.So this would include the likes of Greece, Spain and Italy, but not Sweden, Poland, Denmark, or the UK for that matter, who are not euro members.Five things to look out for that could further impact the eurozoneThere might be more pressure on the Swedes and others to join the euro to “burden share” the costs of the European fiscal union. It would also require a powerful central European finance ministry and chief.   The Macron reforms would work because any monetary union, such as the euro, will never work smoothly, or at all, without a corresponding fiscal union, and preferably banking union too.However the objection is that it would require the transfer of huge sums from the richer northern economies (Germany especially) to the poorer southern ones (Italy especially), and a leap forward in political integration.Angela Merkel has made plain her reluctance to take on such obligations and, in parallel to Italy, extremist eurosceptic movements such as the AfD have been making progress in Germany at the expense of the traditional Christian Democrats and Social Democrats.Germany, as much as Italy itself, may soon have to choose whether it still wants Italy in the eurozone.Without Italy, the zone\u0027s third largest economy, though, the fundamental sustainability of the euro would come under question. Financial chaos could break out and, via “contagion” in interlinked banks and economies, spread through the wider European financial system and economy, with a global impact.One side effect of that would be to make Brexit look somewhat more palatable to the British.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Iran warns US \u0027no one can DESTROY our missile power\u0027                Warsaw begs US to set up military base in Poland as bulwark against...The authors underline that there is significant unease that the current FAM ambition will drive people, potentially, to leave the military rather than properly aiding retention.Moreover, the report states that the FAM does not adequately address the reality that the Army, Royal Navy and Royal Air Force have differing needs and preferences for families\u0027 living accommodation.RUSI also points to the\u0026nbspsell off\u0026nbspof more than 55,000 service family homes to Annington Property Limited in 1996 as significant.The MoD was criticised in January after the National Audit Office (NAO) found the ministry was up to \u0026pound4.2 billion worse off for the sale.PA\u0026lsquoWe are committed to providing our troops with accommodation for their needs\u0026rsquo says a MoD spokeswomanThe MoD has since rented them back on 200-year\u0026nbspunderleases,\u0026nbspand is paying more than \u0026pound178 million a year for the remaining 39,000 properties.RUSI\u0027s report states that the sale has brought year-on-year financial obligations to the ministry that it is struggling to manage effectively and to afford.One senior official told the authors: The accommodation deal is broken and a bad fit for us going forward. It has to be reformed and the FAM is our stab at doing just that.An MOD\u0026nbspspokeswoman said: We are committed to providing our troops with accommodation that meets their needs and is good value. In the last three years, we have invested over \u0026pound500m in housing and pledged a further \u0026pound1.8bn through our Army Basing Programme to build thousands of new homes across the UK.Our Future Accommodation Model will offer increased choice to\u0026nbspa greater number of personnel\u0026nbspand we have been clear we will consult troops and their families as this develops.In the short term, the paper recommends:- The armed forces should give increased priority to families\u0027 accommodation within the employment offer. In particular, increased financial and MoD management resources should be allocated to families\u0027 accommodation.- An Armed Forces Covenant Programme Office, arms\u0027 length from the MoD, should be established, with the review and assurance of accommodation\u0026nbspprovision\u0026nbspfor the armed forces as one of its key responsibilities.- A full test and evaluation programme for the FAM should be developed now and managed as a coherent assessment phase programme."},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/139/590x/Brexit-news-Theresa-May-Conservative-Party-Amber-Rudd-Justine-Greening-Damian-Green-967371.jpg","title":"Brexit news Theresa May Conservative Party Amber Rudd Justine Greening Damian Green","story":"Remainers Amber Rudd, Damian Green and Justine Greening held a private meeting with Theresa May in which they claimed the majority of Tories favour a compromise with the EU.The trio are reported to have asked the Prime Minister to ignore protests on extremes of the Party and pursue a policy which keeps the UK closely aligned to the single market and customs union.Former Home Secretary Amber Rudd said: \u0026ldquoThat\u0026rsquos where the vast majority of the party is.\u0026ldquoWe just haven\u0026rsquot been as shouty.

We have a German mark which they called the euro.Francesco Galietti, head of the political risk consultancy Policy Sonar in Rome, said: \u0026ldquoThe election is going to resemble a referendum, de facto, on the European Union and the euro.\u0026ldquoIn his heart, the average voter will probably be cheering for the anti-establishment forces, but his wallet will be saying the opposite.\u0026ldquoIt will be a heart versus wallet election."},{"url":null,"title":"get all our great stories with the suns newsletters","story":"So if youre after the news that always drives the conversation of the nation, the showbiz scoops that will shock you, all the goings-on in football from the clubs to the players to the fans, look no further.Sign up to our newsletters today by clicking here now. Key Features:Sun 10 - Receive the 10 biggest and best stories of the day, as selected by our editors, sent straight to your inbox so you’re always in the know.Money - The best deals and advice for you and your family.Fabulous - All the hottest trends in fashion and beauty, celeb news and juicy real-life stories.Football - The best columnists, unmissable highlights from your favourite players and clubs and more.TV\u0026ampShowbiz - Get all the latest celebrity and TV news directly into your inbox.Bizarre - For all the gossip on your favourite celebs, the stories behind your favourite TV shows and soaps.

The knife is not the crime. Children seldom randomly pick up knives and decide to stab people. In my experience it often starts when the child is young.This spate of killings will pass but for now it affords the attention and opportunity to reflect.Currently, the debate is cyclical and futile. Mayor of London Sadiq Khan says it’s not his fault, he needs more police. The police say we need more of them. The Government says you’ve had more police but it didn’t make a difference. Meanwhile, children are dying on the streets.The search for solutions must stretch beyond the police. Aside from outrage, there needs to be a focus on the causes, as well as the symptoms, of these crimes.This shouldn’t detract from taking knives away from those carrying them, but we can’t ignore the fact that replacing a blade is as simple as going to the kitchen drawer.Those of us who are more able to look at the world through the eyes of young people who carry knives for protection and status get closer to how they think.What we are witnessing is a sophisticated type of group mind. Some of our boys are so mentally zoned into a culture of violence. All of my youths know, directly, someone murdered, or at least seriously injured, on our streets. Some have been involved.How did we get to this place? Slowly. As the influence of parents, pastors and school principals has waned, all our young people speak of a distinct feeling of powerlessness.The tried and traditional levers and sanctions affecting the development of children are not functioning effectively. For too many, the family bond is damaged and so ruptured we overlook its devastating effects. My young people need something to fight, something to believe in. Like everyone else, they want to be someone, and sometimes that means fighting each other.It is a sad day when, for some, employment prospects are more plentiful with local dealers selling weed and crack than the only other job on offer at the local barber’s.Some of the young people I work with speak about the role of their family’s socio-economic status in their life choices. If they’re lucky, they see their parents locked into dead-end, minimum-wage jobs with no security or satisfaction. Knives, they conclude, are a type of urban qualification. As one put it: “Everyone wants to be someone, this is my way.”Digging deeper, I learned that 85 per cent of my students had never patronised a black-owned business in the past five years, aside from a barber shop. Too many of them carry the assumption that blacks are inferior. “This is how it is,” Adamu told me. “Our business is on the road, we are designed for the hustle.”I began this work with an agenda to keep black boys from being arrested in their droves.Sadly, a lot of our kids have ended up in prison, but they started the three-lap race of life two laps behind. For some, it is almost impossible to work through all the scars.For many of our children, entrance to crime and urban violence is connected to a sense of wanting to be accepted and acceptable — violence is currency.Their hope is that they survive long enough to one day grow out of it. The desire to belong is so real that any community, including gangs, will do.The more law enforcement is used, the more of a challenge it becomes. It almost acts as encouragement because it is something else to beat.Drugs are also a way of life. For some it’s about using, for others it’s selling. It’s simply a way to earn money. A visit to our social housing estates will reveal high levels of organisation. Like any business, you have distribution points, a clear marketing strategy and, most of all, plans to deal with the opposition.I also see the age of involvement getting younger and they don’t care if they live or die. In that sense they are like suicide bombers.Recently I was involved in the rehabilitation of two nine-year-old boys. One was tasked with moving weapons from location to location and the other given addresses for drug drops. He would deliver the packages during school lunch breaks in exchange for McDonald’s, KFC and clothes.Children like these do not grow up seeing themselves as having a future in business or leadership. They are crying out for genuine role models. When our young men find more employment opportunities from businessmen than “road men”, real change will begin.Until that time, we need to love these children back to sanity. They are simply not able to make the rational choices our education and social systems demand.We experience a ruling class committed to maintaining the status quo. Talk about social mobility is just air. Our children are left with the crumbs that fall from the master’s table.The Government is afraid of the mob — but in some areas there is little less than anarchy breaking out.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The Government has no credible policy and the whole world knows it.“Whitehall’s real preparations are for the continuation of EU law and the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice.“The State has made no preparations to leave and plans to make no preparations to leave — even after leaving.”Barring a last-minute change of tune, Mrs May is walking into an ambush which will sour relations with Brussels and condemn Britain to a generation of rancorous civil discord.A botched deal will be dressed up in Brussels newspeak as a triumph for all sides.In fact it will almost certainly betray 17.4million British people who explicitly voted OUT in the biggest democratic mandate ever seen in this country.Voters who hoped for clear and unequivocal freedom from EU laws and regulations are unlikely to stay silent for long.They expected Brexit ministers to carve out a prosperous and independent future.Instead, they have watched defeated Remainers mount a ruthless and successful counter-attack.From a position of strength as a major trading nation, Britain has surrendered on all fronts, caved in to Brussels bullies — and handed over a £39BILLION ransom for the privilege.We are likely to remain bound by a version of the EU customs union, the single market and the European Court of Justice for years to come. Meanwhile, mass immigration runs out of control.Perhaps to his own amazement, EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier has succeeded in his aim to make Britain worse off outside.We will not be allowed to flourish as a free-trading sovereign state.Nobody can be more vividly aware of this than Mrs May as she prepares for her looming summit.Yet she has only herself to blame, starting with the catastrophic snap election which destroyed her Commons majority.She needlessly coughed up that £39billion with nothing in return from Brussels and allowed herself to be derailed by phantom threats of IRA violence if the UK establishes any sort of border with Ireland.The sad truth is that Mrs May is not up to the job as Prime Minister at a momentous point in our history.In an age when words really count, we are lumbered with an ultra-cautious leader who cannot think on her feet or speak without notes.At a time when we should all be doing our best to make Brexit work, we have a Prime Minister who would much prefer to Remain.For the moment, Leavers such as Iain Duncan Smith and Jacob Rees-Mogg are pledging their loyalty.But a bad deal would provoke die-hard Tories into the only honourable action they feel they can take — and put her premiership on the line.They already have the votes needed to trigger a leadership contest.They will not support key Commons votes to dilute Brexit, risking Government defeat by an unholy alliance of Labour opportunists, Lib Dem and SNP wreckers and Tory Remainers.A disastrous combination of weak leadership, cack-handed communication and dismal diplomacy has plunged Britain into a needless constitutional crisis.It says something about Mrs May’s position as leader that her strongest card is the prospect of yet another general election — the third in three years.And the nightmare of political throwback Jeremy Corbyn storming the barricades and leading his Marxist extremists to power.[boxout featured-image=6392734]AS PM, Tony Blair insisted 50 per cent of school leavers must go to university.The result was grade inflation across the board and “Ology” graduates struggling to find a decent job.Now his sensible son Euan, 34, is arguing for tailor-made apprenticeships, giving kids a chance to earn while they learn.His views coincide with new Tory policy – T-levels, technical and trade qualifications which fit pupils to the work they want.They can range from plumbers and computer wizards to City bankers.Many will be driving their own car and buying a home by the time pals leave university with mountains of debt.It is the way forward in skill-hungry Britain.[/boxout] Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Some is also done to shut down anything other than the argument that says “It needs more money”, while other bits are there just because TV executives have noticed it’s the NHS’s 70th birthday and think they’d better do something to look caring.Like, for instance, ITV’s A\u0026ampE Live, “from the frontline”, at Leeds General Infirmary.A self-defeating three-day experiment which, on the one hand gleefully promised us all sorts of carnage: “It’s hotting up here.” But on the other was swift to assure viewers they were operating on a time delay in case patients refused filming consent, thereby ruling out most of the drunks and any possibility of a bloke being wheeled into reception with a Hoover attachment up his fundament.I’d avoid describing LGI as the most sedate-looking A\u0026ampE unit in Britain, though, because ITV had attempted to redress the noise balance by having it hosted by human Tannoy system Davina McCall, who lost little time in telling us: “I had to get hypnotised to do this job, can you believe it?”Yeah, I can, actually.“I saw my granny sever her toes with a lawnmower,” she went on to explain, “and it made me squeamish.” If you thought for one minute, however, it sedated her, you either overestimate the powers of hypnotherapy or you haven’t been watching Davina’s career closely enough.The woman was in full Street Mates mode from the moment she clocked a young couple in the waiting room. “Are you going out?” said Davina, without so much as checking their vital signs.“We were on a date . . . our first date.”“AH-MAY-ZING! THIS IS GREAT. And it’s something to talk about when you have children . . . ”Silence. “I took it too far, didn’t I?”You did rather, Davina, though I get the squeamishness thing and actually flinched when she then told us: “A 23-year-old man, Tommy, is being brought in by ambulance after being rear-ended at high speed.”You’d hope Tommy got some of Davina’s meds as well, ’cos a weird thing happened on Wednesday and Thursday’s broadcasts.She actually calmed down a bit. To the extent I finally noticed the staff, who turned out to be naturals in front of a camera, which really shouldn’t have been a surprise given TV’s insatiable appetite for this sort of show.Among other recent TV offerings, we have: A\u0026ampE Live, A\u0026ampE, 24 Hours In A\u0026ampE, The Real A\u0026ampE, Sun Sea \u0026amp A\u0026ampE, A\u0026ampE On The Road.And that’s just the ones with A\u0026ampE in the title.There’s a whole load more with the words ambulance and emergency, which you may also have watched but entirely forgotten.Why?’Cos an actual visit to A\u0026ampE is a real, vivid, frightening, frustrating, disturbing, impressive and unforgettable experience that can leave you weeping with gratitude for the NHS.TV, by contrast, generally offers a dumb, censored, antiseptic, grovelling, uncritical, cult-like, agenda-ridden version, with this sort of dialogue.Davina (to ambulanceman Gavin): “How important is it you get there early.”“The sooner we get there the more chance the patient has of surviving.”“And that’s so important, isn’t it?”Thank you, live TV. Where would we all be without you?Good Morning Britain’s Piers Morgan: “I leave a lot of phones in my bedroom, ’cos you never know when you’re going to get THE call when your manager says, ‘Got it. Prime-time America. You’re back on’.”And it’s go go go with My 600lb Life.NOTE: In order to avoid Britain’s Got Talent Live, I’m heading south of the border, down Mexico way. Column returns in a fortnight.BBC1’s version of the Jeremy Thorpe murder plot saga, A Very English Scandal, is nuts.It’s very entertaining as well, but it is nuts, with CGI badgers running around in episode one and a couple of Yucca plants shoved in some sand dunes to try and make us think North Devon is actually “California,” on Sunday night.The main issue, however, is that A Very English Scandal can’t quite decide if it’s a comedy or not. So it’s deadly serious whenever Thorpe’s commenting on Europe, immigration or gay rights, but pure Carry On when his ex-lover Norman Scott starts having it off in a caravan with the bird out of Torchwood.It’s more than saved, though, by the incredible storyline and performances of the brilliant Alex Jennings, who totally vanishes into the part of Thorpe’s sidekick, Peter Bessell, Patricia Hodge as Ursula Thorpe, and Ben Whishaw, who’s got the most difficult role of all as the insanely irritating Scott, but does it well enough to make me wish he’d been shot on Exmoor rather than his dog.In that sort of company, of course, it was also incredibly brave to give the lead role to Hugh Grant, who never quite convinces me he’s anyone other than Hugh Grant, yet I will say this for a performance that stands out from anything he’s ever done before.He’s wearing a hat.Courtesy of ITV’s Lee Dixon on England’s World Cup goalies: “You’d be down to one goalkeeper and a nervous one.”“You’d be down to one goalkeeper and a Neville Swan.”INCIDENTALLY, who claimed the following, last week: “People always get excited about cockchafers.”EASIEST gig on the soaps?EastEnders’ Big Mo, who’s just set herself up as Walford’s resident psychic and fortune teller.A job with my name on it, frankly, as I wouldn’t need a crystal ball, money or much encouragement to tell the locals: “This old craphole will be locked in an ever more depressing cycle of baby abductions, love triangles, disrupted weddings, head transplants and escaped animals from now until kingdom come. Get the hell out, while you still can.”Walford CID might also want to put me on a profiling retainer as well, given they’re the only people who haven’t noticed that every single street crime, including – surprise, surprise – last week’s stabbings of Keanu and Shakil, has been carried out by a white, working-class male with a bad stage school Cockney accent.I guess Big Mo’s probably safe in the position for the moment, though, as she seems to have foretold the re-appearance of Shane “Alfie” Richie in The Vic, earlier this month.However, at roughly the same time, she also predicted: “Jean (Slater) will get a job with teeth.”This Morning, “Earth Angel” Sarah Rebecca Vine: “I am a spiritual life coach and healer and, I feel, a messenger to wake people up.” Zzzzz.And First Time Mum, Ferne McCann: “The hypnotherapist session definitely calmed me down and emptied my mind.” Of what?The Chase, Bradley Walsh: “On the flag of South Sudan blue represents the waters of what major river?”Bradley Walsh: “What UK Prime Minister read geography at an all- women’s Oxford college?”Jackie: “Tony Blair.”Bradley Walsh: “In a hospital, the H\u0026ampN unit refers to the head and what other part of the body?”Jackie: “Nose.”And Ben Shephard: “In Australia and New Zealand a ‘long black’ is a variety of which hot beverage?”Teri: “Beer.”The BBC’s Friday night schedule offering us two left-wing panel shows (HIGNFY and New World Order), featuring ’s Mona Chalabi, when one was far too many.The A\u0026ampE Live caption writer responsible for the spelling of “interupt”. Channel 4’s Goggleboxers and all the other people who seem to think The Handmaid’s Tale is a documentary.Car Share lacking either the brains or the balls to make a preview copy of its finale available.And Good Morning Britain without that oaf Piers Morgan, on Thursdays and Fridays. An experience which really is as pointless and empty as Tight Fit performing The Lion Sleeps Tonight, without Steve Grant on lead vocals.Brilliant performances from Alex Jennings, Patricia Hodge and Ben Whishaw, as Peter Bessell, Jeremy Thorpe’s mum and Norman Scott, on A Very English Scandal.BBC1’s Motty: The Man Behind The Sheepskin, revealing an even odder character than I was expecting. Dave’s How The Young Ones Changed Comedy (not entirely for the better).And The Chase offering up my favourite quiz show moment of the year, so far.Bradley Walsh: “Which astrologer published a colouring book called The Art Of Astrology?” John: “Galileo.” Bradley: “Russell Grant.”Gareth Bale: “I haven’t seen the goal back yet, I’ve only watched it again now.”Steve McManaman: “It’s a surprise that Bale’s not playing, but it’s not a surprise that he’s on the bench.”And Rio Ferdinand: “Win the Champions League and it’s chance to be forever mortalised.”(Compiled by Graham Wray)THIS week’s winner is Britain’s Best Home Cook’s Mary Berry and Gary Oldman as Dracula.

In the US — officially the world’s fattest nation — that figure is 18.5 per cent.UK stores now stock plus-size clothes for under-tens, with H\u0026ampM becoming the latest chain to sell a “generous fit” range for kids as young as eight.Obesity is predicted to double in the next 25 years — while tens of millions of pounds of taxpayers’ money has already been thrown at the problem.But a simple — and cheap — solution can already be found on the playgrounds and fields of around 6,000 primary schools where more than a million children take part in the Daily Mile.The exercise regime means that at some point in every school day, pupils leave their classroom, still in their uniform, to run, jog or walk for up to 15 minutes.Youngsters can set their own pace and talk to their friends while they go round.Most of the children complete a mile or more in the quarter of an hour.Teachers all over the country have reported how pupils return to the classroom invigorated and eager to learn after doing what is being called “jography”.Last week, Prime Minister Theresa May praised the Daily Mile and called on schools to take it up — but stopped short of saying it should be compulsory.Now, for all our kids’ sakes, The Sun is calling on Education Secretary Damian Hinds to make the Daily Mile mandatory in all primary schools.The idea began six years ago and has been growing steadily. But only now have scientists been able to prove it really does have an effect.Over the course of an academic year, a team of experts from Stirling University compared nearly 400 children, aged four to 11, from two primaries, with one group doing the Daily Mile and the other not.The Daily Mile kids were put through a series of tests to calculate whether they became fitter and whether they lost fat.IF you are a teacher or parent who would like to get your school doing the Daily Mile check out thedailymile or go to @_thedailymile or on Facebook. There is lots of information showing how easy it is to incorporate the Daily Mile and to support schools who want to get involved. You can also register your interest.The findings, which have just been released, show how they lost an average of four per cent body fat.They were also fitter and more active during the day, while time spent sitting around dropped by an average 18 per cent.Another investigation, conducted at an inner city school in London, found Daily Mile youngsters did much better than expected in SATS tests.Other tests have shown how children also feel less stressed and more confident.Retired head Elaine Wyllie, 62, came up with the idea of the Daily Mile almost by accident when pupils at her St Ninians school in Stirling wanted to get fitter.After just six weeks, not one of the 57 children in her first year was overweight.But to persuade the Government to introduce the Daily Mile into all Britain’s 20,000 primary schools, scientific proof was needed.After reading the latest results from Stirling University, Elaine said: “I knew this research would be the game-changer which would prove what I had believed all along — that the Daily Mile makes children fitter, happier, more active and a healthier weight.“I am delighted and relieved that we now have objective proof.”But education chiefs appear reluctant to make the Daily Mile compulsory for fear of upsetting head teachers, who might see it as an extra burden on their staff.However, Jim Cleaver, head of Westgate Community Primary in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, says: “The beauty of the Daily Mile is its simplicity.“It takes 15 minutes out of the day and for staff it is as easy as opening a door.”At Woodlands, a school for children with special needs in Leatherhead, Surrey, lead nurse Emma Packham has seen children lose weight as a result of the Daily Mile.She says: “We had five children who were clinically obese whose weight was just going up, up, up.“Since we started 18 months ago nobody in the target group has gained weight. Some have lost weight.No other factors in their lives have changed.”It is not just the children’s weight that is changing. Teachers are reporting that behaviour in classroom is improving. And many parents say their children sleep better at night.Former MP Andy Burnham, now the Mayor of Manchester, is a fan and wants his city to become the first where every primary school does the Daily Mile.Unlike some schemes, there would be no costs with introducing it into schools. All associated expenses are currently being paid by Britain’s richest man, Jim Ratcliffe, who has also used some of his £21billion fortune to advertise it during Ant \u0026amp Dec’s Saturday Night Takeaway.Sports commentator Jake Humphrey, who runs the Daily Mile with youngsters at Trowse primary school in Norwich, says: “I honestly don’t think parents are aware of how unfit their children are. Why weren’t we doing this 20 years ago?”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

That readiness is absolutely vital to securing a genuinely beneficial deal.We know that Civil Service mandarins want Brexit to fail.They’ve set up roadblock after roadblock in the hope we’ll be forced to cave in and change our minds on the whole exercise.That cannot be allowed to happen.Jacob Rees-Mogg is spot on when he says the PM needs to show some iron, and that Brussels won’t get the money they desperately need unless they play ball with Britain.

Some Italians told me unelected bankers and institutions in Brussels were being put first. They have a point.The EU and Italy’s President now need to tread incredibly carefully. The 5-Star Movement is already mobilising voters through street protests. The League party is calling on them to vent their frustration at the banks and financial markets.Yesterday, one EU official suggested the financial markets would teach Italian voters a lesson by withdrawing investment from the country. This will only pour gasoline on the populist fire.So, what happens next? The populists will almost certainly sweep to another victory at fresh elections, possibly triggering a new financial crisis and creating another major headache in Brussels. One of the parties might also propose a referendum on Italy’s euro membership.It seems very likely this chaos is not going anywhere anytime soon and the EU will soon be presented with yet another crisis.The events in Italy have clear implications for the Brexit debate. The EU has struggled to make sense of why Leavers opted for Brexit, just as today they are struggling to make sense of the mood in Italy.Many Leavers voted for Brexit because they felt the EU was not able to manage its own affairs, and they will see Italy as further evidence of that.But also many Leavers were anxious that the European Union allows very little room for other political views and they will see that as well in the Italy crisis.While the president was acting in the remit of his constitutional office, the problem is that many Italians and Europeans feel this is an example of Europe’s inability to accept any opposition to the euro single currency.It seems difficult to see how this crisis can be resolved without a more openly Eurosceptic Italy — and without a populist government at the head of the eurozone’s third largest economy.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

with infestations up by 150 per cent in just two months.Experts are blaming the explosion on warmer weather in April and May after Brits basked in 29C heat.Pest controllers at Rentokil say 50billion more flying ants - 1,000 for each Brit - could sweep the UK causing grief for homeowners.A spokesman said: Experts believe the rise could be attributed to the unseasonably warm start to the Spring - after Brits experienced record-breaking warm weather in April.Last month’s period of clear skies and the hottest April day since 1949 may explain the surge in activity, as ants are typically more active in higher temperatures and colonies use sunlight to navigate.This happens on Flying Ant Day when swarms take to the skies and breed mid-air.The most common type of flying ant is the black garden variety (the Lasius niger), whose nests have a single queen and anything from 5,000 to 15,000 workers.Flying ants are not dangerous insects and are unlikely to bite.Even though theyre harmless, flying ants are still annoying - but fortunately, there are many household items which can be used to get rid once and for all.Spraying with dish-washing soap mixed with water can dehydrate the ants.Asparteme-based sweeter is said to be effective.Combining this with juice to form a paste means the critters will carry it back to their colony - killing off some of the ant population in the process.Distributing some insecticidal powder around window and door openings can also prevent the ants from entering your home.Rentokil also says to clean up after yourself and keep food and rubbish bags sealed tightly.The surge also means Flying Ant Day - when the creatures search for a mate - could be bumped from July to as early as June.The day marks the start of the insects mating season, when millions of the horny critters take to the skies to breed mid-air.But it lasts for much longer than a day - usually lasting for around two weeks.David Cross, head of the technical training academy at Rentokil Pest Control, said: Last month we saw reported ant infestations rise to levels we wouldn’t usually expect until June or July.It’s rare to see ant infestations in cold or overcast weather, and while the ‘Beast from the East’ may have caused them to remain dormant in March, the sudden change in temperature has since brought them out in their droves.This trend could be set to continue throughout the rest of the summer.It comes after Brits were warned of a summer explosion of Asian hornets after reports of the striped terrors turning up in the West Country."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict0003779809841.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"more than two thirds of brits are united in the view that immigration has divided communities according to new poll","story":"The negative view of immigration was one of the few unifying factors in the study which also suggests people in the UK are strongly nostalgic for the past.The poll by Demos for Sky News saw 63 per cent of those asked say they think life in Britain was better in a bygone age, and the same amount think Britains status on the world stage has declined since their youth.It showed 71 per cent of people thought immigration had been divisive in areas that have seen migrants arrive, rising to 78 per cent for people living in those multicultural communities.And more than half of those polled did not believe the Government is doing enough to promote traditional British values.Also, almost half of those polled believed that British values should be favoured over multiculturalism, rising to 76 per cent among those who voted Leave in the EU referendum.In contrast just over a third of citizens felt welcoming different cultures was more important.Harking back to the past is not just a British thing, the report found, with similar views found in France and Germany.The French are especially worried about national decline, while the Germans are still tremendously economically, politically, and ideologically divided between the East and the West.However, despite nostalgia being widespread, the word itself remains pejorative and taboo, the report found, adding that despite the widespread critiques of contemporary British society, and anxieties about the future, many citizens remain both resilient and begrudgingly optimistic - a point that sets them apart from participants in our French and German focus groups”.The report’s author Sophie Gaston, Demos deputy director, said: There is nothing to be gained in denigrating a longing for the past, when we consider how much it reveals about peoples attitudes to the present and fears of the future.Nonetheless, there is a huge cost to governance when such a large proportion of citizens become resistant to change, when our communities become so divided and the sense of social competition so acute.It is the responsibility of politicians to listen to and address these concerns, and draw a convincing, empowering narrative to guide citizens through the change that lies ahead.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

and flooded peoples inboxes with emails asking for permission to use their information.Mr Ross claimed the law - which has been passed onto the UK statute book and will stay in effect after Brexit - is set to have a chilling effect on trade.Writing in the Financial Times, he said: GDPR’s implementation could significantly interrupt transatlantic co-operation and create unnecessary barriers to trade, not only for the US, but for everyone outside the EU.The official added that US companies and government agencies are worried about being fined by the EU if they accidentally break the rules.He said GDPR could disrupt initiatives working on financial regulation, medical research, emergency management co-ordination, and important commerce.Mr Ross wrote: Pharmaceutical companies may not be able to submit medical data from drug trials involving European patients to US authorities, which could delay the approval of new life-saving drugs.And he described how the EU rules could make it harder for the authorities to access data on the true identity of people who carry out crimes online.He concluded: That could stop law enforcement from ascertaining who is behind websites that propagate terrorist information, sponsor malicious botnets or steal IP addresses.Mr Ross called on the EU to take urgent action to make sure companies understand what they are and arent allowed to do with Europeans data.GDPR tightens up the rules on data so that individuals must give consent for their personal information to be used by firms or organisations.Those who violate the law face a fine of up to £18million -

1,000 for each Brit - could sweep the UK causing grief for homeowners.A spokesman said: Experts believe the rise could be attributed to the unseasonably warm start to the Spring - after Brits experienced record-breaking warm weather in April.Last month’s period of clear skies and the hottest April day since 1949 may explain the surge in activity, as ants are typically more active in higher temperatures and colonies use sunlight to navigate.The most common type of flying ant is the black garden variety (the Lasius niger), whose nests have a single queen and anything from 5,000 to 15,000 workers.Workers are the ants you see during most of the year, collecting food.While workers, who are all female, live for around a month, queens can live for over 10 years.They spend most of their lives in their nest - only leaving for the nuptial flight as immature queens to mate and ultimately found their own colony.After mating, the queens lose their wings - and those pesky larger ants you see walking around alone are in fact new queens hunting for somewhere to set up their nest.Flying ants are not dangerous insects and are unlikely to bite.Unfortunately, nature is unpredictable - and flying ants are no exception.However, scientists from the Royal Society of Biology are investigating why Flying Ant Day occurs - and are looking into the effects of certain weather conditions.Its thought that the phenomenon is provoked by wet weather followed by hot, humid conditions - but boffins have suggested it might not be as predictable as first thought.In 2018, experts warned Brits to be ready for the biggest ever invasion of flying ants.Rentokil pest controllers say 50billion more flying ants could sweep the UK - attributing the potential increase to the unseasonably warm weather.According to the RSPB, flying ants are like M\u0026ampMs to seagulls.They contain formic acid which causes seagulls to appear drunk and exhibit unusual and dangerous behaviours, including flying into cars and aggressively hunt for food.The RSPBs Tony Whitehead said: “The gulls are mad for them.There has been a massive emergence of the ants over the last three days and they are like little treats for the gulls.They go to wherever they are.So, theres nothing much to worry about regarding the ants themselves -

The last few years have been tough with everything my body has been through. But I’m happy it’s over and am excited about becoming a teenager.”Dental receptionist Lorraine added: “I always told Sophie people are going to stare. Boys at school called her a giraffe.

Your garden or local park can host just as much fun and help you keep costs down too. The trick is keeping everyone busy so the laughter flows and you all finish the weekend happy and re-energised. \u2028We’ve teamed up with Halfords to share some exciting ideas for what you can get up to – without breaking the bank. Get out into the garden  The key for any bank holiday weekend or half term is going to be fending off the inevitable boredom that can grip children – so why not put them in charge? They get to set the agenda, arrange the football tournament and decide if there\u0027s a water fight or not (there will be, so hide the garden hosepipe if you want to stay dry). To help them run the show, get them to help put up a tent to base themselves in.  The Secret Garden kids play tent and Rocket kids play tent are both ideal for getting their imaginations going. You\u0027ll also want to get the little’uns something to sit on, as they lay down the law of the garden. There’s even a Rocket folding kids chair and Secret Garden folding kids chair to match their tents.  Tents and a whole range of other camping gear are half price at Halfords for the bank holiday. Set up a grown-up place to chill  If the sun shows up for the weekend then you\u0027ll want to be able to find some cooling shade. \u2028While the kids are putting up their play tents, the adults can be busy erecting a sanctuary of their own – or kicking back in a Urban Escape King Size Moonchair, above. \u2028Take a look at the Halfords Gazebo with two side panels. Offering a UV rating of 50+ means not only will it offer shade, but it will also help keep you protected from the sun. \u2028\u2028  And if it rains? Don\u0027t worry, the gazebo is waterproof too. \u2028\u2028 A range of gazebos currently have 20% off at Halfords – check them out here.  Pack up a picnic lunch using a Halfords 40 litre coolbox – you can connect it to the mains or keep it charged in your car until you\u0027re ready, and then it will keep your food and drink nice and cool. It has wheels too, so no need to worry about getting it to your destination. And right now there’s 20 per cent off. You\u0027ll need cutlery, plates and something to drink out of too. The good news is Halfords has a four-piece set of acrylic wine glasses (it\u0027s your holiday too!) for just \u0026pound5. Rainbow plates and cutlery are also half price too, so grab the full set and make your park picnic bright and summery. Scoot to the park \u2028The kids can scoot on the Mongoose Stance Stunt Scooter, which is great for all wannabe daredevils. It\u0027s also down to just \u0026pound45 (save \u0026pound18), for the holiday weekend.  Or they can jump on the Slipstream Go Kart, a safe, fast and fun steel-frame go kart featuring wide pneumatic tyres for stability and a handbrake. The go kart, which also has a free wheel to stop pedals turning when going downhill, is now half price at \u0026pound70. Selected ride-ons at Halfords are currently half price.

This week I challenged Jacob Rees-Mogg live on the radio because he is making misleading claims about what leaving the Single Market and the Customs Union will mean for small business owners like me.  For the last twelve years I have established my own European Express Transport Business, mainly transporting for “just in time” supply chains. This includes collecting components for the automotive industry all over Europe and delivering them to 24-hour production lines back in the UK.  Some of my customers include Ford in Dagenham and Bridgend, Jaguar Land Rover in the Midlands, BMW Mini in Oxford and Nissan in Sunderland, as well as Rolls-Royce on the south coast. All these car makers rely on the express movements of goods to assist in the smooth operation of their production lines, as they do not have the space to stockpile. Prompt collection is absolutely vital.  Most of the jobs I work on are only made possible by being inside the Single Market, which gives me access to the goods, whilst being in the Customs Union means no physical border to clear them.  Politicians like Jacob Rees-Mogg and Kate Hoey talk a lot about Switzerland being a possible model for how the UK could operate outside the EU and outside the Customs Union.  Well I’ve got actual experience of delivering goods from the EU into Switzerland and there are huge amounts of checks and paperwork and costs and delays involved. Believe me, it is very far from frictionless. When I was delivering goods for an exhibition there, I had to get an invoice of the goods in advance from the client, pay an upfront cost (to be claimed back later), contact a customs agent at Dover to let him know what was I delivering, wait hours in a car park whilst the paperwork was being cleared, drive to Switzerland and then clear customs again at the Swiss border. None of this is necessary if you’re in the Customs Union. Norway is another model that sometimes gets brought up, even though Norway is in the Single Market which the UK Government wants to leave (although like Switzerland, Norway is not in the Customs Union). Again, I’ve delivered goods across the Norway border and it’s not as straightforward as we are being told by the politicians. Due to the nature of the goods I was delivering, I was advised to get a carnet - a passport for goods.

A Mirror investigation has uncovered hundreds of safety reports showing rookie medics left in charge of up to 90 patients. It follows a global report which found the NHS has among the lowest numbers of doctors out of 21 developed nations. Junior doctors who have filed “exception reports” lay bare the extent of unsafe wards after \u0026shysickness and workloads drag more senior medics away. Freedom of Information responses from 55 hospital trusts have uncovered 551 reports lodged in the first year after their introduction.  When the 95 trusts which refused to reveal their reports are factored in, the number is likely to be more than 1,500 reports on safety breaches. Dr Jeeves Wijesuriya, chair of the BMA’s junior doctor committee, said: “These reports highlight where staff are being overstretched.  “Trusts have a duty to take action to ensure staff and patients are safe.” “A report by the respected King’s Fund revealed last month Britain has 2.8 doctors per 1,000 people, below the average of 3.6 and barely half the number in Austria of 5.1. The figures come as the Government faces fresh calls from the British Medical Journal to remove visa curbs preventing international doctors from working in the UK.  Exception reports note unsafe working hours negotiated by the British Medical Association in 2016 for junior doctors. The rookies report being treated like “cattle”, with no time to eat or go to the toilet during nights shifts. One at Colchester Hospital NHS Trust said: “I was made to cover almost 90 patients. If a handful of patients fell sick I wouldn’t be able to treat them properly. At Derby Teaching Hospital one medic said: “I was left unsupervised. This was my first day on the ward.

The Muslim Council of Britain (MCB) has written to party chairman Brandon Lewis, highlighting a string of incidents by Tory candidates and other representatives. In the open letter, MCB general secretary Harun Khan said they were more than weekly occurrences of Islamophobia in April. They ranged from allegedly offensive tweets to accusations of links to far-right figures.   Mr Khan also highlighted the campaign run by Zac Goldsmith in his unsuccessful bid to beat Labour\u0027s Sadiq Khan to become Mayor of London in 2016, saying there had been no action taken against those responsible for shocking Islamophobia during the campaign.  Mr Khan added: We want all political parties to ensure that they are firm in their commitment against all forms of bigotry and discrimination. Our democracy should not be overshadowed by a divisive culture within political parties that scapegoats minorities and alienates some who share similar political positions.   Former Tory cabinet minister Baroness Warsi told the Independent a review was long overdue. Lady Warsi, who earlier this year told MPs Islamophobia was widespread in the UK, said: I have raised my concerns about Islamophobic comments and campaigning for more than two years and have done so formally and informally including a letter to the Prime Minister.

Senior Tory sources said the Party has engaged the services of UK Policy Group, a private ‘dark arts’ firm to carry out opposition research.  UK Policy Group is the UK arm of a notorious American political attack organisation, which has worked for Donald Trump’s administration and has aggressively targeted his critics.  Two former Number 10 officials are advising the firm. Employees of the company dig into the personal histories, online videos and posts of Labour candidates, collecting dossiers to be handed to the Tory party, according to sources. It\u0027s understood information is then handed to right-wing websites and newspapers to back up negative articles. The Conservative Party failed to respond to six calls and an email inviting them to comment. UK Policy Group Ltd declined to comment. Outsourcing opposition research  It’s believed to be the first time a major British political party has been accused of ‘outsourcing’ its attack research to a private company, a tactic frequently used in US elections. A string of former Tory high flyers now work for the firm, which was launched in London last January, including former Number 10 staffers and ex-party researchers.  The firm’s UK Vice President is Andrew Goodfellow , a ‘super sleuth’ who was formerly the Conservative Party’s Director of Policy and Research.  Mr Goodfellow did not respond to a request for comment. Staff working out of the firm’s plush Victoria Street offices, just a stone’s throw from Westminster, also include the Tory party’s former head of media monitoring and a former member of George Osborne’s communications team.   Official documents reveal David Cameron ’s former director of strategy, Ameetpal Gill, was given permission by parliamentary authorities to accept a contract advising the firm through his political strategy company Hanbury Strategy.   And Chris Brannigan , Theresa May’s former Director of Government Relations is a member of the group’s advisory board, though he told the Mirror his role does not involve carrying out opposition research.  He said: “I advise them on the strategic political scene and interpretation of political activities. Dull stuff.” A senior Tory source told the Mirror: “It isn’t surprising that under Theresa May the party has to outsource its ideas.” Links to Donald Trump and the Republican attack machine  UK Policy Group is the London branch of Definers Public Affairs , an elite American opposition research firm set up by two senior Republicans, Matt Rhoades , who ran Mitt Romney’s 2012 bid for the White House, and Joe Pounder the former head of research for the Republican Party.  Mr Rhoades and Mr Pounder were also founders of America Rising, a notorious Political Action Committee which solely exists to attack Democrats and opponents of Donald Trump.  Last year, lawyers working with America Rising embarked on a “witch hunt” of US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) employees who had criticised Donald Trump or his EPA director Scott Pruitt, according to the New York Times.  The lawyers requested copies of all emails sent by staff mentioning the President or Pruitt, sending a “wave of fear” through the staff that they faced public retribution for speaking out against the Trump administration’s watering down of environmental protections. “This is a witch hunt against E.P.A. employees who are only trying to protect human health and the environment,” Gary Morton, an E.P.A. employee in Philadelphia told the New York Times in December.  Raj Shah , a co-founder of America Rising LLC joined the Trump White House as Deputy Assistant to the President and Deputy Communications Director and Research Director in January 2017.   And Trump’s Special Counsel, Ann Donaldson formerly provided legal services to America Rising.   When UK Policy Group was first founded in January 2017, it was registered with Companies House under the name UK Rising Ltd, according to official documents.   Mr Pounder boasted to Time Magazine in 2016 that their file on Hillary Clinton ran to “over 7,000 pages of distilled research” and more than 10,000 videos.  Their tactics are said to include sending dozens of \u0027trackers\u0027 to follow Democratic candidates and politicians around with video cameras in the hope of capturing unflattering footage. In 2015 alone, their operatives reportedly attended around 3,500 Democratic Party events. \u0027Campaign style research dossiers\u0027 "},{"url":null,"title":"tory mp keeps asking ministers","story":"NewsThis Tory MP keeps asking Ministers what would happen if Theresa May is \u0027incapacitated\u0027Arch Brexiteer Peter Bone has a particular morbid fascination in the Prime Minister\u0027s unexpected demise\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByMikey SmithPolitical reporter17:41, 30 MAY 2018Updated18:03, 30 MAY 2018News (Image: Newcastle Chronicle)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet politics updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailTory MP Peter Bone has raised eyebrows by tabling a \u0027creepy\u0027 written question in the House of Commons, asking what arrangements are in place in case Theresa May is “incapacitated.” And it\u0027s not even the first time he\u0027s asked.  The keen Brexiteer asked Cabinet Office minister David Lidington “with whom he would plan to co-ordinate the delivery of Government objectives in the event that the Prime Minister was temporarily or permanently incapacitated.”  Constitution minister Chloe Smith answered the question, noting that in cabinet meetings the next most senior person would take charge. But she added: “In the event of the permanent incapacity of the Prime Minister, the appointment of a new Prime Minister is a matter for Her Majesty The Queen acting under the Royal Prerogative.”  Mr Bone has asked the same question of successive Prime Ministers and their deputies a total of ten times since he was elected to the Commons in 2010.  He asked a similar question of then Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg in the Commons in 2011 and of David Cameron in writing in 2015.  Mr Bone has also repeatedly tabled Private Members’ Bills which would, if passed, write a strict line of succession into British Law. The latest version of Bone’s law of succession is due for its second reading in the House of Commons in January.

But the widow of one Cold War pilot has blown that claim apart after obtaining secret documents that show he was used in a deadly experiment as he was ordered to fly through the cloud of a thermonuclear explosion. And Shirley Denson, 83, said husband Eric had such a massive dose of radiation to his head in the 1958 flight that it caused \u0026shycrippling headaches so bad that he later killed himself saying he couldn\u0027t stand the pain. Two of their four daughters were born with abnormalities as were some grandchildren and great-grandchildren. The papers show Eric, 24 at the time, had his head alone exposed to 65 years’ worth of normal \u0026shybackground \u0026shyradiation - the same as 17,500 dental X-rays - during just six minutes spent flying through the cloud at Christmas Island in the South Pacific.  Shirley said of the \u0026shydocuments – which chillingly show the Tory government of the day knew there was a risk to the men’s children: “It’s \u0026shyabsolutely wicked. It’s evil. To see it in black and white after all these years took my breath away. It seems our government used and abused its own men. “It makes me furious to think it was done on purpose, that my Eric mattered so little to them.” British Nuclear Test Veterans’ Association chairman Alan Owen said: “This is the first time in all our years of campaigning we have ever found evidence this strong. “Our members always believed they were guinea pigs and this appears to prove some of them were, at best, collateral damage in horrifying experiments. We need to know \u0026shyeverything - now.” Deputy Labour leader Tom Watson, who is backing the Mirror campaign to give a medal to the veterans of the nuclear tests, which lasted from 1952 until 1967, added: “This is a shocking document the MoD cannot wriggle out of.  “We need answers about what experiments were conducted, and how many of the 22,000 nuke vets were involved in them. “The Defence Secretary should come to the Commons and issue an unqualified apology to Mrs Denson.” Shadow Defence \u0026shySecretary Nia Griffith said: “These are deeply worrying revelations which must be \u0026shyinvestigated by the MoD.” Shadow Health Secretary \u0026shyJonathan Ashworth added: “This is an \u0026shyabsolute scandal.” Shirley, of Morden, south London, was handed the papers by the MoD during research about her husband\u0027s service. Eric flew his converted Canberra B6 bomber into the mushroom cloud of a 2.8 megaton nuclear explosion on April 28, with X-ray badges on his seat to measure radiation. They were placed behind the head, on both arm rests, and in the seat pan for each member of the aircrew.  The bomb, codenamed Operation Grapple Y, was the most deadly weapon Britain has ever fired. The papers said “care was taken to ensure as little shielding effect as possible” was given to the badges – and thus the crew. Immediately after the tests, Eric suffered vomiting and a rash, common symptoms of radiation poisoning. But within 48 hours he was ordered to fly the plane again. Veteran Joe Pasquini, who was a navigator in the same squadron, has a copy of Eric\u0027s pilot logbook which shows he returned to the air in the same plane on May 30 for a 75-minute radar calibration and formation flight. The paper - written by scientists running the tests - states those who received a dose of radiation between 10 Roentgen and 25 must not be exposed again for three years. Eric’s dose of 18.8R meant he should have been protected. His was the worst of the three-man crew.  One of the badges was placed near his groin. It recorded a dose of 8.8R, or around 30 years\u0027 worth of normal background radiation. The \u0026shydocument added: “Testicular badges: The very significantly lower levels are of interest and cheer in relation to the possibility of genetic damage.” Eric and Shirley had already had one healthy daughter before the nuclear experiments. The Mirror found birth defects or unexplained medal conditions in 37% of their descendants, including skull deformities, missing and extra teeth, and spinal problems. Eric killed himself in 1976. Shirley also backed the Mirror’s call for medals.  She said: “It’s the very least they could do. I was left a widow with four children to raise.” The document was an AWRE health physics paper looking at ways of testing the film badges to be sure they were accurate. But the MoD said: “It is not true to say these men were subject to an experiment to look at the effects of radiation. “The British nuclear testing programme contributed towards keeping our country secure during the Cold War and regular health checks were conducted throughout. “The National Radiological Protection Board has carried out three studies of nuclear test veterans and found no valid evidence to link this programme to ill health.” "},{"url":null,"title":"british man who spent four","story":"NewsBritish man who spent four years on death row in Ethiopia \u0027overwhelmed\u0027 after his releaseAndy Tsege was held for four years before his release on Tuesday and was shocked to greeted by huge crowds at his family home in Addis Ababa\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByElaine McCahill23:06, 30 MAY 2018NewsAndy Tsege spent four years on death row before his release (Image: PA)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet politics updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA Brit who spent four years on death row in Ethiopia has said he is overwhelmed after his release.

The image of the newlyweds sits proudly on display in Buckingham Palace\u0027s Audience Room, where the Queen greets guests and dignitaries on a weekly basis. Perched alongside a clock, a gold box and some paperwork underneath a pair of glasses, the image of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex appeared to have replaced one of Princess Anne and her husband Timothy Lawrence. The portrait of the Queen\u0027s daughter Princess Anne and Timothy dressed in Navy uniforms was last seen in April to the right hand side of the lamp. Now, it seems Harry and Meghan have taken their spot and the image of Anne and Timothy has been moved to the other side of the table.  The photo shift was spotted as the Queen greeted Honourable George Brandis, the Australian High Commissioner to the UK. Buckingham Palace\u0027s Audience Room is filled with personal touches by the Queen, giving the public a rare insight into her personal life. And while the room is decorated with touching images of the Queen\u0027s nearest and dearest, it\u0027s also adorned with some pricey ornamental pieces. Placed on either end of the mantlepiece are two 18th Century English porcelain pheasants, reportedly valued at \u0026pound20,000, reports the Mail Online .  The white marble clock in the centre of the mantlepiece is believed to be valued at \u0026pound4,000, while the mirror is reportedly worth \u0026pound30,000. Harry and Meghan appear to be posing for the picture, which could have been taken as part of their engagement shoot by fashion photographer Alexi Lubomirski. The couple captured the world\u0027s heart with their stunning engagement shots, as Meghan opted for a partly sheer dress. They went on to choose Alexi Lubomirski as the official photographer for their wedding on May 19.

The feminist academic and author insisted some rapes are just bad sex and said society should not view it as a spectacularly violent crime. She suggested rapists should be given community service or a visible R tattoo on their hand or cheek to shame them. The controversial 79-year-old Australian also scoffed at a study that says a majority of victims have suffered post-traumatic stress. Greer has been criticised and called a rape apologist after her comments at a Hay literary festival event stunned audience members and caused an uproar online.  Safer London CEO Sherry Peck told how she was so upset that she walked out. She tweeted: Dreadful ramblings by Germaine Greer. I’m usually happy to listen to opinions different to my own but today after around 20 mins I had to walk out. Anita Singh, the Daily \u0027s arts and entertainment editor, wrote on Twitter: Had the misfortune to listen to Germaine Greer yesterday. She seemed to be making it up as she went along. Greer told the crowd that most rapes don\u0027t involve any injury whatsoever and said the notion that it is one of the most violent crimes is bulls***.  She added: “Most rape is just lazy, just careless, insensitive. Every time a man rolls over on his exhausted wife and insists on enjoying his conjugal rights he is raping her. It will never end up in a court of law. “Instead of thinking of rape as a spectacularly violent crime, and some rapes are, think about it as non consensual … that is bad sex. Sex where there is no communication, no tenderness, no mention of love.” Greer said rape is so rampant in society that the legal system cannot cope with it, and victims become bits of evidence in court due to the issue of consent. She called for a radical change to the way rape is prosecuted and punished, claiming many trials were not ending in convictions due to systemic failures.  She said a fitting punishment for rape would be 200 hours of community service, adding: I have suggested maybe a little tattoo would be a good thing, maybe an \u0027R\u0027 on your hand. I\u0027d prefer it on the cheek, really. She argued that the courts should focus on the violence and sentence offenders according to the gravity of the violence, and avoid long, humiliating trials for victims. Greer also said she doubted figures which suggest 70 per cent of rape victims have suffered post-traumatic stress disorder compared with 20 per cent of war veterans. She added: “What the hell are you saying? Something that leaves no sign, no injury, no nothing is more damaging to a woman than seeing your best friend blown up by an IED is to a veteran? The author said women haven\u0027t been destroyed by rape as society suggests, adding: We’ve been bloody annoyed is what we’ve been.” Related video: Eamon Holmes accuses Germaine Greer of being the wicked witch "},{"url":null,"title":"first picture car mad boy","story":"NewsFirst picture of car-mad boy, 15, stabbed to death yards from his grandfather\u0027s homeKeelan Wilson was stabbed multiple times in the Merry Mill suburb of Wolverhampton and was rushed to hospital but could not be saved\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByTom DavidsonOnline Reporter17:16, 30 MAY 2018Updated17:46, 30 MAY 2018NewsKeelan Wilson with his mother Kelly (Image: SWNS)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email This is the touching photo of a devastated mum with her son who was stabbed to death in Wolverhampton last night - just yards from his grandfather\u0027s home.   Keelan Wilson, 15, was knifed multiple times in the Merry Mill suburb of the city and was rushed to hospital but could not be saved.  West Midlands Police were called to a disturbance in the area at roughly 11pm yesterday and emergency responders found car-mad Keelan critically injured. Mum Kelly this afternoon changed her profile picture on Facebook to one of her and Keelan. Speaking outside the family home, George Ellitts also described his grandson as an angel and said the family were due to fly on holiday to Egypt next week.  He added: He\u0027s lived with me all my life. He raised a few hundred pounds for Great Ormond Street Hospital a few years back, he had his hair cut, he had the lot off. According to the Justgiving page at the time Keelan raised a total of \u0026pound243 which was donated by 22 people when he was aged just 10. Another neighbour, who didn\u0027t want to be named, added: We heard about it when we saw the paramedics last night. We speak to our neighbours when we see them but we keep ourselves to ourselves. My daughter would recognise Keelan - they went to the same school, Smestow School in Wolverhampton. It\u0027s a shock that this happened here. We have never had anything like this happen before. Resident Christina McIntosh-Smith, 20, said: We heard about it this morning. We saw the tents set up. We didn\u0027t personally know him.  It\u0027s definitely a shock - he was so young. Nothing like this has happened this close before. There will be a sad atmosphere in the street. It would be sad no matter who it was. Part of a nearby road has been cordoned off while investigations are carried out and door to door enquiries are taking place. Officers are also reviewing CCTV from the scene. Lily Thompson, 81,who has lived in the road for 39 years, said: I heard about it this morning. It was Keelan Wilson. I have known him for nearly 16 years. He wasn\u0027t a bad lad. He wasn\u0027t rude to you. He always spoke to me well, I never had any cheek off him.  He would always come out and put his hand round you and say \u0027hello Mrs T\u0027 . I always found him a nice lad.  I was quite shocked when I heard it was him, especially when you have grandkids of your own the same age. We have had a bit of trouble round here before - somebody selling drugs. There have been cars broken into, windows broken but it\u0027s only lately we have had this trouble. I never knew Keelan to be involved in that. A blue covering has been pulled over a car, believed to be a taxi, parked on the pavement of the street. The driver of the taxi described being attacked by a group of youths after he stopped to pick up a fare.  The man, who did not want to be named, said: I saw these two guys trying to jump start a car. They had a car outside but it would not start. I told them if they wanted to come, then come if not I will go. And suddenly they try to come in the car. There was another group of about four to five of them. They had a knife and they attacked me as well. I think the two groups were fighting. I injured my hand, I went hospital but did not need stitches. I was cut with a knife. My car was damaged, with what I think was a metal bar. I didn\u0027t see exactly what happened as I just tried to drive off quickly.  A man told BirminghamLive he looked out his bedroom window after hearing noises at 11pm and saw a teenager lying in the road, covered in blood. The man, who does not wish to be named said he rushed out into the street to save him. Keelan had suffered stab wounds \u0027all over his body\u0027. The resident said: “When I got to him he wasn’t talking or nothing, just mumbling in pain on the floor. “We were on the phone to the ambulance saying ‘hurry up, quick as you can, there’s blood everywhere’. “It was around 5-10 minutes later, there was four of us outside by then when the ambulance turned up.  Detective Chief Inspector Chris Mallett, from West Midlands Police Force CID, said: A young boy has tragically been killed and we are determined to find out why this has happened. We are talking about the terrible loss of a 15-year-old boy, someone who had their life to live, and we will be working round the clock to find who was responsible. We are following a number of active lines of enquiry and would urge anyone with information which could assist our enquiries to call us as soon as possible. Next of kin have been informed, the force said. A shocked local said: We heard it about 11pm. To us it sounded like someone breaking into our car.  Banging and smashing, so we looked out the window to see what was going on. My wife called police straight away. Around 5-10 minutes later the emergency services turned up. They got the victim into an ambulance and I don’t know what happened after that.

The crooks posed as the fraud department from a high street bank to snare their victims. They make hundreds of calls like this every day and most of them thankfully fail. But every so often they’ll get a bite, often when they catch their intended victim in a moment of weakness. That certainly describes John Williams, who could think of little else but his wife Carol, suffering from late-stage lung cancer, and their plans to buy a small \u0026shyapartment to spend their final days together by the sea. It was around 7pm on a weekday. John had put Carol to bed and was having a little time to himself when their landline rang. According to the phone’s caller ID, the call was from Santander.  John had no idea that the more sophisticated of these gangs use “spoofing” techniques to mimic calls from other numbers, the technology didn\u0027t exist when he was in work as a phone engineer. The caller used the name \u0026shyChristopher and is described by John as well-spoken and Asian. He asked some basic security questions including date of birth and the last four digits on his bank card, which John answered, assuming that he was talking to Santander. “Christopher” told John that there had been an unusual transaction and a payment of \u0026pound15,000 would leave his account first thing in the morning if action was not taken, followed by two other payments totalling \u0026pound38,000. Smooth-talking Christopher asked for remote access to John’s computer and helped him set up a supposed safe account, where his savings could be kept until the issue was resolved. “I was a little panicked at the time so I allowed them to do it,” says John, from Newbridge in Caerphilly, South Wales. “However, I became \u0026shysuspicious and called Santander customer services on my mobile, using the number that was showing on the laptop. “Unbeknown to me this was a false page that the scammers had produced once they took control of my laptop, so I spoke to his \u0026shyaccomplice.” "},{"url":null,"title":"im not ready say goodbye","story":"News\"I\u0027m not ready to say goodbye to my children\": Mum-of-three left fighting for her life every 28 DAYSLesley Kennedy must raise £1,000 every month to be in with a chance of beating breast cancer - after being told that there is no more treatment available on the NHS\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByJilly Beattie09:09, 31 MAY 2018Updated09:10, 31 MAY 2018NewsLesley Kennedy is determined to watch her children grow up (Image: Belfast Live WS)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA mum-of-three battling aggressive breast cancer is fighting for her life one month at a time. Lesley Kennedy needs to raise \u0026pound1,000 every 28 days to pay for special treatment not available to her on the NHS. Doctors told that there is no more treatment they can give her because of the disease in her liver, lungs and bones. But the 35-year-old says she\u0027s not ready to say goodbye to her children - and is undergoing special treatment privately.  It\u0027s costing her \u0026pound1,000 every month to pay for her medication, Belfast Live reports.  Lesley is determined to carry on fighting for her children Ben, 14, Jake, 11 and eight-year-old Corey.  But Lesley from Eglington is not alone. Her husband Lee, and three sons, have been joined by friends and relatives, and strangers who have become friends, as everyone rallies to raise money to pay for medication. After being diagnosed aged 32 in 2015 with stage 2 breast cancer she underwent a mastectomy, chemotherapy and radiotherapy. The following year she was told she had stage 4 cancer and it had spread to her liver, lungs and bones. Then 13 months ago Lesley was advised there was no more medical care to help her.  She said: If I\u0027d given up then and agreed that nothing else could help me, then we might be in a very different place. But we pushed on and I got treatment privately and the last year has been exceptional. Every day with my boys and my husband, every moment has been special. If I had listened to what I was being told in some areas I might not have had that time or those experiences - and they have been precious for all of us. Now a chance meeting in a caravan park means Lesley has even more support and the chance of more money raised for her medication. Jennifer Howell and Lesley met at a caravan park in Benone, Limavady, last year and became firm friends.    And now Jennifer is taking an extraordinary step to help Lesley access the drug Palbociclib that suppresses the hormones that are affecting the cancer she is living with.  With the help of Cloudstreet Paragliding Centre in Craigavon, Jennifer is planning jumping in a tandem paraglide from Benone Ridge in the first weekend in June. Jennifer said: I have only known Lesley for a little over a year but we just connected. It was as if our paths where suppose to cross. Lesley is a beautiful lady, filled with courage, strength and has positive outlook on life, you can probably say she has truly touched my heart. Lesley has now been given the chance to self fund a drug called Palbociclib although this drug is available to breast cancer patients on the NHS, it is not available to people who\u0027ve had previous hormone treatments - and Lesley has which means she isn\u0027t eligible for funding via the NHS. So I am helping raise money for her to have the treatment privately and I\u0027m hoping lots of people will help me along the way.  Lesley has now been on the treatment for two weeks and says she is feeling great. She explained: Of course there are good days and bad days but on the whole I feel good. I take the tablets orally and have injections once a month. I feel awkward asking for help but people have been so kind and I\u0027m very grateful. I\u0027m going to keep going as long and well as I can. I have learned that you have to trust yourself when bad news hits.

The 22-year-old fell from the 36-storey development The Heron Building in the City of London - where apartments can cost up to \u0026pound10million. Police have arrested a man and a woman on suspicion of murder. They have both since been bailed. Only days earlier Bethany-Maria had tweeted about a Lana Del Rey song.  The troubled singer tweeted a week ago today on May 24: If anyone wants to start to understand my mental issues and the reason ive (sic) tried to end my life multiple times, listen to @LanaDelRey Ultraviolence and it will explain everything.

Her family said in a statement: “Beth was a kind, funny, loyal, intelligent, talented and beautiful person who changed the lives of everyone fortunate enough to know her and lucky enough to be loved by her. “She had the brightest smile and the most beautiful singing voice. She was our songbird. “She had an amazing talent that, if it had been seen by the world, would have become known to millions. “She was more than a daughter, granddaughter, niece, cousin, step-sister, step-auntie, god-daughter or friend. She was the world to us all. “To say we will miss her does not come close to describing how we feel. Our world will never be as bright again now that our shining star has gone.”  A pal described Bethany-Maria as “insanely talented”. The former fellow student wrote online: “You were my friend on and off stage. Life will be so boring without your sparkle.” Another posted: “You were the most beautiful and wonderful soul I ever had the pleasure of knowing.” Bethany-Maria, who died on Saturday, was said to have had plans to travel to Ibiza.

John Bradburne was killed during missionary work in Zimbabwe, then Rhodesia, in 1979. Before he died, he said he had only three wishes — to help lepers, die a martyr and be buried in a habit of the Franciscan order. In September 1979, the poet and warden of Mutemwa leper colony in Zimbabwe, then Rhodesia, was caught up in the country’s civil war, the Rhodesian Bush War.  Friends told him to flee before arrival of the bloodthirsty ZANU-PF guerillas who thought he was an informer. But he insisted on remaining. The guerillas bound Bradburne’s hands, took him on a forced march and humiliated him. They made him dance and sing, got him to eat excrement and dangled young women in front of him, before interrogating him and subjecting him to a rigged trial. They offered him the chance to escape so long as he left the country and abandoned his beloved flock.  He refused and, when he knelt down to pray, they shot the 58-year-old in the back with a Kalashnikov, leaving him half-naked by the side of the road. Now, nearly 40 years after his brutal murder, Bradburne is on the verge of becoming a saint — the first British saint since 1970, when Pope Paul VI canonised Cuthbert Mayne and 39 British companions — The 40 Martyrs of England and Wales. They were executed for treason between 1535 and 1679, and the Scottish Catholic martyr John Ogilvie, canonised in 1976. Campaigners, including Bradburne’s niece Celia Brigstocke, are convinced of Bradburne’s power to perform miracles.  Mourners at his funeral said they saw drops of blood beneath his coffin, even though no blood was found inside when it was opened. Others claim that, a decade ago, a man was cured of a brain tumour by praying to Bradburne. Now, with the support of the Archbishop of Harare they have raised the money to fund a Vatican investigation to justify his canonisation. Bradburne was born in Westmorland in 1921, he was the son of an Anglican rector. He fought in World War II with the 9th Gurkha Rifles, escaping Singapore when it was invaded by the Japanese in 1942 and was recommended for the Military Cross.  He took a boat to try to reach British-controlled territory, but was shipwrecked. He eventually made it to India, and then returned to fight in Burma for the Chindits, After the war and wandered the world for 16 years, trying his hand at teaching and forestry, and as a stoker on a steam ship. His only worldly belonging was a single Gladstone bag. At one stage, he walked hundreds of miles to Rome and lived for a year in the organ loft of a church in an Italian mountain village. In 1956, he joined the Franciscan Order as a layman. Bradburne asked a Gurkha comrade John Dove if he knew of any African caves where he might pray.

She spent hours outside scrubbing to get it all ready for the summer, but when she came back inside she realised she had missed a spot on her back where her t-shirt had pulled up. She was bright red and in a lot of pain, so decided to go and see her GP. He told her the sunburn wasn\u0027t anything to worry about, but he was concerned about a mole on her back and sent her to the hospital for tests. After several tests and biopsies Lauryn, who lives in south Wales, was given the devastating news that it was skin cancer.  She said: My whole life just turned upside down. I cried for days. I was thinking I\u0027m 29, I don\u0027t have kids, I haven\u0027t even started my life yet and I\u0027m going to lose it. It was really really hard for quite a long time. She said:  However she was surprised by the response when she started telling people she had cancer, and she\u0027s worried people don\u0027t take it seriously. She said: People were like \u0027oh well, you\u0027ve got skin cancer, you\u0027ll be alright\u0027. People look at my scars and say \u0027is that is?\u0027. But what you see on the outside, it\u0027s five times bigger under the skin. They really need to know that it\u0027s serious.  Moles do change and people don\u0027t really pay attention. They\u0027re so scared to go to the doctor but if it\u0027s a bad result it\u0027s so much better to be in the hospital two or three months earlier. Sun burn actually saved my life. You don\u0027t look at your back much so you don\u0027t really notice them changing. That\u0027s why I\u0027m here and alive. I was extremely lucky. If you catch it early enough you can still have a life and do all the things you enjoy. In the eight years since her diagnoses Lauryn has received excellent support and care from a number of hospitals and charities.  But it\u0027s Macmillan which has really supported her and her family, so she was determined to give something back. She started running to release stress and before long she had completed in a number events. But she decided that just wasn\u0027t enough. She said: It just spiralled out of control. She set herself the challenge of doing 40 events before she turned 40, but it quickly escalated to the 52 in 52 Challenge - where you take on 52 events in a year.

Dubbed Vogue 25, the list is comprised of what the fashion publication says is an extraordinary cast of leaders defining - and redefining - the way we live now. But as most lists of these kind do, it\u0027s already dividing opinion and is notable for who isn\u0027t on it as much as who is. The Queen, Theresa May and Kate Middleton the most immediately glaring omissions.  The handpicked women vary in age from 22 (Lipa) to 73 (Baroness Hale, the President of the Supreme Court), and includes figures from the worlds of politics, the arts, fashion, media and sport, among others. Following her wedding to Prince Harry on May 19, Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, is hailed as a person who captured the public imagination like no other this year by Vogue.  The magazine says that Meghan - one of the most recognisable women in the world - has an influence that stretches far beyond the ceaseless coverage of her style - as a bi-racial campaigning feminist from America, she is helping to forge a new 21st Century identity for the monarchy. Ms Davidson is praised as a beacon, thanks to her relatable personality and progressive ideas among a sea of old-guard Tories by the magazine.  The publication also cites the openly gay politician\u0027s spectacular gains for her party in the last Scottish elections as a reason for her position on its list.  Lipa, who won two Brit Awards earlier this year after being the first woman to receive five nominations on one night, is described by Vogue as a culture definer.  Her hit New Rules, an anthem of female empowerment, laid out a blueprint for modern sex lives and has, to date, had more than a billion views on YouTube, the magazine says.  The list also includes Harry Potter author JK Rowling, human rights lawyer Amal Clooney, Black Panther actress Letitia Wright, fashion designer Stella McCartney, artistic director of the Royal Court Vicky Featherstone and models Edie Campbell and Adwoa Aboah. Music executive and Skepta\u0027s manager Grace Ladoja, writer and academic Sinead Burke and Collette Roche, the chief operating officer of Manchester United, also appear. The feature appears in the July issue of Vogue, on sale on Friday June 8.

A shocking video has emerged of the two women in a physical fight, with one of them being pushed onto the floor in the street as punches and kicks are launched. One calls the other a s**t during the bizarre altercation which has been viewed more than 1.5 million times in the last 24 hours after it was published on social media. The incident took place in Shildon, County Durham on Sunday afternoon and the footage was recorded by John Canty. One woman was arrested on suspicion of assault during the incident but released without charge, police confirmed. The clip begins with the two females known as \u0027Black Juicy\u0027 and Lizzie in the middle of an argument on the street.  The brunette woman, Black Juicy, stands at the door of her house shouting at the blonde female, Lizzie. Lizzie then lifts up her pink strapless playsuit to show her bottom to Black Juicy and mockingly twerks in front of her. In response to this, Black Juicy shouts at Lizzie and calls her a s**t, an utter s**t before picking up her mug of tea. Lizzie then hurls inaudible abuse at Black Juicy and pushes her with both of her hands into her house. Black Juicy retaliates and throws her mug of tea at Lizzie\u0027s face, who manages to kung-fu punch the cup away from her face.  This astonishing feat is shown in slow motion again in the video. The two women then return to physically fighting each other and slap each other in the face.. Black Juicy then grabs Lizzie by her pig-tails, putting her in a headlock whilst the two geordie lasses continue punching each other. As the incident continues, Lizzie falls dramatically onto the street and as she does this, Black Juicy briefly forgets about her and starts shouting at a neighbour saying I\u0027m sick of you. Lizzie exploits this momentary distraction and pushes Black Juicy so she falls face first onto the ground. Black Juicy starts to pick herself up and Lizzie screams go on before Black Juicy retaliates saying you stupid little s**g as she lifts up her trousers.

Mari Llewellyn, 24, originally from Wales, weighed 17st 5lb before she radically changed her lifestyle and started eating cleaner food. “I’ve learnt what food is nutritional for my body, she explained. I eat more than I did then and some people are surprised by how much I weigh but it’s because I’m tall and I’ve built muscle. Mari, who moved from Newport to New York, US, when she was 10 years old, took up weight lifting as well as adopting a disciplined diet.  She originally started eating a bodybuilder’s diet which was full of high protein food such as chicken and eggs, Wales Online reports. But now, she eats a diet that’s higher in fat. Today, the 5ft 11in fitness blogger weighs a healthy 12st and works out six days a week. In just over a year, she lost 170 pounds – or 5st 3lb. She shares her progress on Instagram, YouTube and her fitness blog, Mari Easy Fitness, and has attracted tens of thousands of followers. Mari said: “It all started when I was in my final year of university. “I struggled with depression and anxiety and I ended up having to drop out and move back home for a bit. That’s when I started to eat lots of pizzas and unhealthy food.  “I decided to make small changes, like eating cleaner food and my boyfriend was really into bodybuilding, so I started to get into the gym. “I went from hating the gym to loving it. Seeing my body change motivated me more.” She added: I taught myself a lot about the gym. I was doing a lot of the same exercises as my boyfriend but then I learnt how to do things that I wanted to do like tone my butt.” Mari, who recently completed her degree in fashion and retail in Philadelphia, has also released fitness programmes called Fit with Mari and a resistance band which sold out online. “It’s something I love doing and I’m doing it full time at the moment,” she continued.  “People think being a social media influencer is easy and all you have to do is post a few photos, but it’s hard work. “I’ve also used some of the things I learnt [at university] which I didn’t think I would do. I had to work on the sizes and the designs and work with prototypes.” Mari puts part of her social media success down to being an ordinary woman who has worked hard for her body. “When you go on Instagram, it can be scary because it’s just full of beautiful women,” she said. “But I think more people can relate to me because I did use to be overweight.

Nikolas Cruz laid out his plans before walking into the Stoneman Douglas School on February 14 and shooting dead 17 staff and students. I\u0027m gonna go take Uber in the afternoon before 2:40 (pm), he boasts. From there I\u0027ll go into, onto school campus, walk up the stairs, unload my bags and get my AR and shoot people down at the man, what is it? The main courtyard, wait, and people will die. In the footage, the eventual mass killer holds an assault-style rifle that is apparently the weapon he used to carry out the second deadliest mass shooting at a US school in modern history.  Investigators discovered the chilling videos on Cruz\u0027s phone, which was taken into evidence after the shooting. The clips are listed on the prosecution\u0027s discovery list, and were released by prosecutors on Wednesday. In another film he says: My name is Nick, and I\u0027m gonna be the next school shooter of 2018. Speaking directly into the camera, Cruz says My goal is to kill at least 20 people with an AR-15 and a couple tracer rounds, referring to the assault-style rifle he is seen holding in the footage.  When you see me on the news, you\u0027ll know who I am, he laughs. Brandishing the rifle, he says: You\u0027re all going to die. Pew, pew-pew, pew, pew, pew, pew. Ah yeah, can\u0027t wait. The 19-year-old carried out his bloody rampage killing 14 students and three teachers before he was taking into custody alive.  In another video found on the phone, Cruz plays the victim, saying he lives a life of seclusion and solitude. He says he\u0027s had enough of people telling him what to do. Today is the day, the day it all begins - the day of my massacre shall begin. All the kid in school will run in fear and hide. From the wrath of my power, they will know who I am. I am nothing, I am no one, my life is nothing and meaningless, he says.  The video selfies fail to shed any light on a possible motive for the attack, although they suggest Cruz felt he was treated as an outcast. In one video, the teen said his former classmates thought he was an idiot and a dumb ass. He also professed his love for a girl he mentioned only by first name, and said he hoped to see her in the afterlife. The gun seen in the video is apparently the rifle authorities say Cruz legally purchased from a gun dealer last year and ultimately used as the murder weapon.  The former student at Stoneman Douglas has confessed to the deadly shooting spree, authorities said. The video clips were part of an inventory of prosecution evidence recently shared with the defence team during the pre-trial discovery process, said Constance Jones-Simmons, a spokeswoman for the Broward County state attorney\u0027s office. The Miami Herald and other media outlets obtained copies through a public records request after seeing mention of the footage in court documents, she told Reuters. The three videos, none longer than 90 seconds in duration, are believed to have been made a short time before the Valentine\u0027s Day massacre, but Jones-Simmons said she did not know precisely when they were recorded.

Laura Watson claims the small child can be seen with his hand on her son’s shoulder in the creepy image. The family had been enjoying a picnic at the Plessey Woods Park last weekend when Laura took some pictures of her daughter Charlotte Hill, 15, and son Byrin Watson, nine, climbing a tree with their cousin Jack, 16. However, medical receptionist Laura was left “terrified” when she later discovered the face of another child had appeared behind Byrin, despite no one else being near them in the park at the time.   While originally sceptical of anything to do with ghosts and the paranormal, Laura says the picture has changed her mind as the boy is so clear.  She now wants to return to the woods as the figure has sparked her interest in ghosts but admits she hopes the apparition doesn\u0027t “follow them home”. Laura, from Newcastle, said: It\u0027s very unusual and everyone is really freaked out. Me and my daughter couldn\u0027t even go to sleep last night because we were so scared. My husband is on night shifts and I was alone and I was like \u0027oh God\u0027. I was terrified in case anything had followed us back.  I\u0027ve had people on our Facebook saying they are going to send me prayers.  I didn\u0027t believe in anything like that until I saw this for myself.  Laura had been enjoying the sun with her mum, dad and sister, along with her two children and her niece and nephew when they decided to walk the dogs after finishing their picnic.   On the way back the youngsters came across the large tree and began to climb it - prompting Laura to get out her camera. Laura said: There was no one behind the tree, my daughter or my nephew would have seen them. There was nobody there. There was only us there. It\u0027s very, very bizarre. When I got home I put the picture on the computer and when it zoomed in and I was able to see it closer, I thought what is that thing behind Byrin? When I zoomed in further I could see a face. But I was like \u0027but there was nobody there!\u0027 It looks like a child to me, I don\u0027t know if it\u0027s a girl or a boy. But I can see this face and it looks like the hand is on my son\u0027s shoulder, which is very bizarre. Some people have said I must have Photoshopped it as they can\u0027t believe it. But I\u0027ve explained that I wouldn\u0027t even have a clue how to do anything like that.  It was literally taken on a phone. I\u0027m rubbish with technology and I\u0027m just not the kind of person to do that. There\u0027s no way that is anything but what it is - you can basically see a face. For someone to be that close to my son, if it was another child, he would have noticed them. I would have seen them and I wouldn\u0027t have taken a picture with another kid behind him. Many have speculated what the figure could be with some suggesting it might be the spirit of a boy who drowned in the woods years ago. Laura said: I don\u0027t know much about the history of the woods but some people are saying that many moons ago a young boy drowned in the river. You don\u0027t know if it\u0027s just hearsay. People are asking if Byrin had a twin and if he died but he had nothing like that. I\u0027ve not had any kids die in my family so it couldn\u0027t be anyone that I know. It certainly isn\u0027t something that I\u0027m familiar with. I\u0027ve never, ever experienced anything like it in my life. It was just a normal day. It was lovely hot day and we were just having fun.

UK tourists have told of their horror after watching the man fall to his death at Dalaman Airport as they prepared to fly home following beach holidays. A holidaymaker said the dying man, named by his devastated family as Andrew Westlake, 30, from Annfield Plain in Co Durham, told a Thomas Cook Airlines worker, who rushed to his aid, that he just wanted it to end. Andrew had reportedly been waiting three days for a flight home after losing his ticket, and had allegedly been removed from a Jet2 plane shortly before the incident. He had been on holiday in south-western Turkey with his girlfriend and one-year-old daughter - their first family holiday together - and members of his partner\u0027s family, but was alone when he fell.  His aunt, Pauline Butler, told ChronicleLive that her family was notified of Andrew\u0027s death by Durham police on Tuesday, but they haven\u0027t been told exactly how he died. She said Andrew\u0027s grief-stricken mother June, 54, is heartbroken and can barely speak. Family members had been reading news reports and contacting witnesses who wrote about the incident on Facebook to learn more. Multiple witnesses told  that initial Turkish media reports - that Andrew died after falling from a plane\u0027s exit onto the tarmac - were not true. A 29-year-old woman from Watford, who was flying back to the UK with her 34-year-old partner and their three children, aged two, four and six, said the incident happened inside the terminal around 3.30am local time on Tuesday. The family were among dozens of Britons queuing to check in for flights to Stansted Airport in Essex and Birmingham when they heard a loud noise as the man apparently ran and crashed into a glass barrier of a balcony.  The woman, who was preparing for a delayed Thomas Cook Airlines flight to Stansted, said they turned around and saw the man on the floor near the barrier just behind them. She added: My partner said \u0027Are you OK\u0027 and tried to give him a hand, but he didn\u0027t speak. My partner watched him stand back up and he backed away from the barrier and then just ran for it and hopped over straight down onto the floor below. Initially, I think he tried to do it before but he hit the glass barrier - the noise that we heard - and fell, and then tried again. When my partner helped him up he looked so sad and lost. The image that my partner still has in his head is the man looking so desperate. She called out to him and alerted airline staff as he lay on the floor about 50ft below and people rushed to help him. The woman also called out to airport staff, but it appeared they didn\u0027t understand English, she added. She said of the Brit who fell: He was looking up at me and ... he was talking but I couldn\u0027t hear what he was saying. He was too far down to hear anything. Everyone was in shock.  She said the man had his passport but he was not carrying any luggage. A doctor eventually arrived to help the man and paramedics later took him away in an ambulance, she added. An image posted online and verified by witnesses shows the moment Andrew went over the glass barrier. A 23-year-old woman from Hertfordshire told  that her 24-year-old boyfriend was one of the first to reach the Brit after he plunged from a ledge inside the terminal. The woman, who was also preparing for the flight to Stansted, said: Everybody was queued up and just behind us was a ledge, with a glass wall, going down to the floor. He jumped over the ledge. My partner went down there with someone else to see if he was OK.  He was still conscious when they got down there, he was still moving and he was responding to them, but he was a bit out of it. The woman said a Thomas Cook Airlines worker appeared to be the first person to reach Andrew as he lay on the floor. The woman added: When we spoke to the airline representative who went down there, she said that he was saying to her that he just wanted it to end. She didn\u0027t know what he meant by it. She added: It was very traumatising for everyone that was there, especially my partner. Everyone was so in shock. The airline worker was great, she was down there super quick. The airport security, all of them were just standing there. No one else responded to it quickly. After falling from the ledge, Andrew was treated at the scene and rushed to a private hospital, where he died of his injuries, it was said. Turkish media reported that he had lost his ticket and spent three days at the airport waiting for a flight back to the UK.  When he was finally due to fly home, he was removed from a plane over flight safety concerns and prevented from travelling, the reports added. Andrew had boarded the flight around 3am but was ordered off the plane after he got into an argument with cabin crew, according to reports. Witnesses said his unkempt appearance suggested he may have been at the airport for some time. The holidaymaker from Hertfordshire added: He didn\u0027t look in the best of ways. His clothes were quite dirty. The woman from Watford added: He was dirty. There was another lady there that said he had lost his ticket and was trying to get home. She said he walked past her and ... he might have been sleeping rough. Andrew\u0027s Facebook page stated that he had previously worked as a roofer and at Clayton Glass in Annfield Plain, where he grew up with four siblings. His aunt Pauline, 67, said relatives are still in the dark over how he died. She added: We really don’t know what to think. His mum is absolutely devastated. They were very close.

The youngsters often jumped into her bed in the middle of the night. And when they didn\u0027t, they would leap into each other\u0027s beds. So when they came into Vanessa\u0027s room, crying, and climbed into bed with her eight years ago today, she comforted them with cuddles. They all then drifted back off to sleep. But heartbreakingly, Chase and Tyler never woke up. Their mum, 37, did awake - but felt agonising pain and experienced every parent\u0027s worst nightmare as she looked across at her sons. I saw my children lying on my bed and knew something was terribly wrong, Vanessa, from Victoria, Australia, told .  Confused and barely able to move, she managed to call an ambulance and her ex-husband before paramedics attended the scene. It was only later, while in hospital, that she found out Chase and Tyler had died from accidental carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning. A gas heater in another room of her rental house had leaked the colourless and odourless gas, which she and the boys had inhaled. While her sons lost their lives, Vanessa suffered acute CO poisoning and rhabdomyolysis, where damaged skeletal muscle breaks down. She also had hypoxia and a dislocated shoulder. They say that this was due to lying on the arm for so long being unconscious, she told us. Now, exactly eight years on from the tragedy on May 30, 2010, the brave mum is fighting to raise vital awareness of accidental CO poisoning.  She has set up The Chase and Tyler Foundation , an independent charitable organisation that works to prevent such poisoning.   The accident still feels like yesterday to me, she said. After the accident, people would say things to me and not realise their words were insensitive, such as \u0027You can have more children\u0027, \u0027At least they went quietly\u0027, \u0027They are with God now\u0027... People don’t know what to say and they also want to see people fixed straight away and not suffering. As a bereaved parent, you are never fixed and there is no such thing as closure or moving on. Little Chase and Tyler, who adored each other, enjoyed football, riding mini motorbikes, playing on scooters and watching TV. They were pretty cheeky boys who were always together and typically like boys, always fighting between each other, said Vanessa. She added: Tyler was a little shier than Chase and he adored his older brother when Chase wasn’t tormenting him.  The day before the boys\u0027 deaths, Vanessa believes they were all watching films together - although she struggles to remember. I have memory problems from the accident, she explained. It was in the early hours of the next day that Chase and Tyler climbed into her bed, in tears, before they all fell asleep together. Chase and Tyler were always jumping into my bed. If they weren’t in my bed, they were always jumping in each other’s beds, she said. I can’t remember what I said to Chase and Tyler. I just know they climbed into my bed as they were crying - obviously due to the CO poisoning - and that we were all together and went back to sleep. They never woke up. Vanessa found out her beautiful sons had passed away while in hospital. I didn’t really know until after I woke up in hospital, she said. I don’t know if anyone told me prior to this, but due to the acute CO poisoning, I was not in a position to comprehend.  She added: I was hospitalised for a month and a half and then had a long time recovering from my injuries. I struggled to walk initially and couldn’t use my left arm or hand for quite some time... I needed help to dress me. The long-term damage is memory damage due to hypoxia and severe nerve damage to my left shoulder, arm and hand.  I take a fair bit of painkillers every day. The emotional scars are the worst wounds of all, which will never heal.   When she was eventually discharged from hospital, Vanessa, who works in medical administration, moved in with her mum. I had no home, my children were dead, and I couldn’t look after myself due to my injuries, so I had to move into my mother’s home, she said. I was heavily sedated due to the physical injuries, as well as suffering post traumatic shock which was a blessing in disguise. If I had to face my new reality with full comprehension - which took over a year if not more - I feel I could not have survived.  She added that there wasn\u0027t a carbon monoxide alarm fitted at her home in Mooroopna, north of Melbourne, when the leak happened. The only time I had ever heard of carbon monoxide poisoning was via movies when people died from intentional exposure within their vehicles, she said. She had no idea that people like her sons could suffer carbon monoxide poisoning from their gas or fuel burning appliances. Determined to save the lives of others, Vanessa set up The Chase and Tyler Foundation and Carbon Monoxide Awareness Week. She also began lobbying Australian parliament for mandatory gas appliance servicing and CO alarms, and publicly campaigning. I knew that if I didn’t do anything, this prevalent issue within our community would soon become old news and nothing would change, and more people would die, she said. I couldn’t let that happen.

Bill Browder told  he believes the Russian president is abusing international law in a desperate attempt to kill him.  He found himself at the centre of an international storm this morning when he was taken into custody, amid fears he could be extradited to Russia - where he believes he would be murdered.  The hedge fund manager has successfully lobbied for tough sanctions against Russia following the death of his lawyer, Sergei Magnitsky, in a Russian prison in 2009. Mr Magnitsky exposed a \u0026pound174 million corruption ring involving senior officials - allegedly including Putin himself - and was reportedly tortured before he died. Since his death, Mr Browder has lobbied countries across the world to bring in sanctions against those involved - and defiantly said Putin\u0027s strong-arm tactics will not intimidate him.  Mr Browder said Putin is desperate to silence him - and the Russian leader has in the past even gone as far as accusing him of being a \u0027serial killer\u0027. The businessman, 54, one of the Kremlin\u0027s most high-profile public enemies, was released this morning, less than two hours after his arrest. After returning to London he told : It is clear that Russia is abusing Interpol and using all their tools to get me back to Russia to kill me. He had been due to meet a Spanish prosecutor to discuss Russian corruption when the manager at the hotel he was staying in and two cops appeared at his door. The businessman recounted: I wasn\u0027t 100% sure they were police officers, they didn\u0027t show me any ID, and when I said can I call my lawyer they said no. I thought I was being kidnapped. After quickly gathering his belongings, Mr Browder was put in the back of a police car, fearing for his life. Convinced he was in danger, he tweeted a picture from the back of the car, alongside the words: In the back of the Spanish police car going to the station on the Russian arrest warrant. They won’t tell me which station.  The officers, who spoke little English, initially tried to stop outside a building which wasn\u0027t a police station, he said, telling him it was procedure to see a doctor first. We had a standoff and they eventually took me to a police station, he stated. It was only when I got there that I realised it wasn\u0027t a kidnapping, I was relieved. He added: I thought I\u0027d been very careful about avoiding these situations, but they\u0027d finally got me. When he arrived at the Madrid police station, he was finally shown an Interpol warrant saying he was accused of fraud in Russia. But, he said, he was allowed to leave after senior figures within Interpol confirmed to local police that the warrant was not valid.  When it got to the higher levels of Interpol, I was allowed to leave, he said. And he believes it is part of a concerted effort to intimidate him. Every time a Magnitsky Act gets passed, Russia puts me on the Interpol list, he stated. Mr Browder received a phone call from British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson in the aftermath, with Mr Johnson expressing his relief at his release.  The cabinet member later tweeted: Just spoken to Bill Browder – very glad that he has now been released. Moscow should concentrate on bringing those responsible for the murder of Magnitsky  to justice.  Mr Browder has been sentenced to 18 years in prison in his absence on fraud charges by a Russian court - charges which he dismisses as ludicrous. He said: I assume it\u0027s the same allegation, but it could be new allegations, there\u0027s no shortage of creativity in the Russian police.  They want to get me into a Russian prison. Killing me in the west would create a huge backlash, but they could do it quietly in a Russian prison and have plausible deniability. Mr Browder said: Putin is very angry with me, he doesn\u0027t like people who find ways of creating consequences for him. Mr Magnitsky was allegedly tortured in prison after reportedly being convicted on false charges. In 2012 US President Barack Obama signed the Magnitsky Act, a law to punish Russian human rights violators, into law after lobbying by Mr Browder. And two years later the European Parliament voted in favour of sanctions against 30 Russians alleged to be involved in the Magnitsky case.  There are now seven countries with Magnitsky laws in place, including the UK, with sanctions on Russian oligarchs given royal assent last week. And Mr Browder alleged that Putin is personally affected each time a Magnitsky Act is passed. He is an an extremely rich man, he has a fortune of around $200 million which he keeps in the west, he said. Each time an act is passed, it puts his own fortune at risk. He personally sent an emissary to Trump Tower (calling for the act to be repealed), this shows how he feels about it. We know he was a recipient in the crime which Sergei was killed over.  Despite fears for his own safety, Mr Browder remains defiant, stating: I\u0027m single-mindedly dedicating my life to getting justice for Sergei, I\u0027m not going to let them get away with it. It won\u0027t affect me in any way, I\u0027m carrying on. He is due to address the Danish parliament next week, and is confident that Magnitsky Act laws can be passed in seven more countries. I think talking about this so publicly is my biggest security, he said. People who are unknown and enemies of the Putin regime are dying in great numbers.

The star continued her attack on Barack Obama’s former aide, Valerie Jarrett, despite reissuing an apology. Barr, 65, sparked a huge backlash on Monday when she called Jarrett an “ape”, in a tweet she later deleted. On Tuesday, she announced she was quitting Twitter. But on Wednesday she returned to the site, reposting her initial remarks, including an image of Jarrett’s face next to a character from Planet of the Apes. She added a fake tweet claiming Jarrett had said she wanted to make America more Islamic.  Barr’s initial post read: “Muslim brotherhood \u0026amp planet of the apes had a baby = vj.” Producers and stars of her sitcom, Roseanne, quickly condemned her remarks. US network ABC scrapped the successful relaunch of her hit 90s show, which was popular on Channel 4 here. Reruns of the original sitcom were also pulled by US broadcaster Viacom. Barr later blamed her rant on the sleeping pill Ambien. She wrote: “It was 2 in the morning and I was Ambien tweeting. I went 2 far \u0026amp do not want it defended.”  Yesterday, Ambien’s manufacturer, Sanofi, said: “Racism is not a known side effect of any Sanofi medication.” Barr yesterday insisted: “I’m not a racist, I never was \u0026amp I never will be. One stupid joke in a lifetime of fighting 4 civil rights.” US President Donald Trump – who Barr is a vocal supporter of – waded in. He wrote on Twitter: “Bob Iger of ABC called Valerie Jarrett to let her know that ‘ABC does not tolerate comments like those’ made by Roseanne Barr.

He was obviously an attacking player and I think he scored a few goals but he never played right up front.“That might have been because he was young and, when he first arrived, Aberdeen just wanted him getting games. Because we had Martin Bavidge as the main striker, he wasn’t going to get in the team right up top.“Saying that, I’m pretty sure Nicky regarded himself as a midfielder back then and I don’t think there was any thought of moving him forward.”After two seasons and eight goals, Clark moved on from the Blue Toon to Queen of the South in 2011 and, in terms of goals, has never looked back.Whether it was having former Rangers and Hearts front man Sandy as his father, or the foresight of someone at Palmerston, Bobby acknowledged the decision to make him into a striker was a masterstroke.“His dad has obviously had an influence on his career and he might have pushed for him to go up front, or maybe it was just something someone else saw in him that made them think they should give it a try. Either way, it was a great move for him and a player that gets the goals he does is probably just what United need right now.”The fact Clark is a player who knows the Championship well, having played there for Queens, Rangers and now Dunfermline, is a big plus.United now have a few members of their squad who are used to the rigours of the second tier and, for Bobby, that’s the way to go.“When I played in the lower divisions, the teams who were successful were usually ones who had players who knew the league.“United have brought in Nicky and, assuming he’s back fit for next season, they’ll have James Keatings just behind the main striker.“I thought he was a very good signing when he joined up last summer but the season was ruined by injuries. If he’s back, though, you are talking about a player who’s got goals at that level for quite a few clubs now.“These are the type you want – once you go up you worry about a team for the league above.“If you build a team for the league you’re in and get out of it, you find a few of the boys you did bring in are capable of doing well at a higher level.“Some won’t be and will have to be replaced but you are always going to want to freshen the squad each year.“With Nicky, only time will tell how he does if United get back to the Premiership, but he’s a proven scorer in the Championship and, right now, that’s the most important thing.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/03/5abe00fa671c1-848x564.jpg ","title":"confirmed

I would imagine that should the move to ‘Nou Campy’ (the club’s proposed new stadium) happen, that will also follow suit with a stadium sponsor.”Fellow fan Garry Joiner, of Dunfermline, wrote: “Football is no longer a sport, it is a business and needs to operate as one.“A name change will have no fundamental impact on Dens Park to those who have always known it as Dens Park.”Richard Gennies, who’s based in Jakarta, backed sponsorship but insisted the stadium would “always be known as Dens Park no matter what the sign says”.Another fan who also backs the move wrote: “If the name change brings in ongoing cash investment it must be a good thing for the club.“It would be good to retain Dens in the name.”One supporter suggested the name “Kilmac Dens Park” and others said they would support the move if “Dens” was incorporated.However, others hit out at the sponsorship idea.One fan wrote: “What good would changing the name do? All it would do is annoy the loyal fans who go to Dens week in, week out.”Jasen Niblo, from Birkhill, said he didn’t like the fact the move was “all about money” and urged the club to keep the name.Another fan cautioned the club against inviting any food-related sponsors, saying: “As long as it doesn’t sound as bad as the Tony Macaroni Arena (in Livingston) we might live with it.”Graham Pert, from Whitfield, added: “I’m all up for things that will be great for the club but at this stage I think it would be sad to see the name changed from Dens Park.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/5b0e84b99ec1c-846x564.jpg ","title":"school donates fun run cash for mnd in honour of popular local teacher","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA former teacher battling motor neurone disease (MND) took to the start line of an Angus 10k in the latest challenge of a personal crusade to raise funds for research into the condition.Donald Grewar joined a field of about 150 athletes to take on the scenic coastal run organised by Monifieth High School.The keen runner completed his fifth marathon just weeks before experiencing the first symptoms of MND in 2013.His determination has touched the Angus secondary to such an extent that funds from the run, which normally go to support the school, will instead be given to an Edinburgh University centre leading research into the condition.Donald, from Dairsie, contacted the school to submit his entry for the run, telling them he was keen to take on the 10k in his powered wheelchair.Monifieth High head teacher MC McInally said: “We normally hold the 10k to raise funds for pupils in the school but, after receiving Donald’s request, decided that all monies will go to the Euan MacDonald Centre which he is raising money for.“When word got out about what we were doing a couple of our younger children took it upon themselves to make cakes and they raised £63, which was a marvellous effort from them.”Donald set off ahead of the main event, accompanied by supporters and some senior pupils from the school, completing the challenge around the same time as overall winner Craig Earl.Monifieth councillor Craig Fotheringham, who started the 10k run, said Donald’s participation was a heartwarming show of determination.“This is always a popular run and as a former pupil of Monifieth High I’m very supportive of it, but especially this year when it will be raising such vital funds for MND,” he said.Donald said: “I was a keen sportsman and in April 2013 ran my fifth marathon in France.“Two months later, symptoms began and I was diagnosed with MND in January 2014.”The focus of Donald’s fundraising is the Euan MacDonald Centre, based at Edinburgh University, which involves about 30 researchers from across Scotland working to improve the lives of patients living with MND.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/5b0e84ccaf31b-752x564.jpg ","title":"work starts on state of the art ryze trampoline and obstacle park in dundee","story":"\t\t\t\t\tWork has started on the creation of Dundee’s first trampoline park.The £1.5 million Ryze attraction will be based at Soccerworld on Old Glamis Road and is expected to create up to 80 jobs.Workers have shared images of the first spades going into the ground at the development, which will replace four five-a-side pitches.The 37,000 sq ft park will also include an aerial ninja obstacle course, super trampolines, foam pits, dodgeball and hanging bags.It will be Ryze UK’s third Scottish venue alongside its centres in Glasgow and Edinburgh.Scott Fairgrieve, the firm’s managing director, said: “We are delighted to be here in Dundee and finally get work under way on what is set to be one of the most state-of-the-art extreme air sports parks in the UK.”A spokesman for the company added: “We’ve got out the golden shovel and broken some ground today getting the works under way to bring Ryze to the wonderful city of Dundee.”Mr Fairgrieve previously said he was looking forward to“exciting times” as he prepared to bring the park to the city.Previous plans to base the facility at Claverhouse Industrial Estate were rejected by the local authority – but Mr Fairgrieve said he had been “determined” to bring the Ryze experience to Dundee.He said: “We were offered parks in other areas, but Dundee is where we want to be.“With our three locations in Edinburgh, Glasgow and Dundee we can reach 90% of communities in Scotland.“We were disappointed not to get the site at Claverhouse, but the local council has been extremely cooperative throughout the whole process.“With the new site, we are hoping we can accommodate 180 to 210 people at any given time.

Public consultation followed with 328 nearby addresses contacted, prompting 104 formal responses.The report to the committee stressed that the brief \"does not seek to create competition between the two locations\".Stratton, it stated, \"has opportunity for larger footprint retail and community buildings whereas Ashton provides opportunity for education, park and higher density residential development\".The focus of development would be \"east Ashton\". The owners of the adjacent western part of Ashton Farm do not intend selling for development but to continue farming the land.Opportunities have been identified for improving public transport links, particularly for Inverness Campus users. Transport agency HiTrans will consider the provision of a new rail station at Seafield, the campus or Stratton.Discussions are underway with the college and Highlands and Islands Enterprise on the \"early delivery\" of sports facilities at the campus. A least one pitch plus associated buildings could cost \u0026pound4.7 million.The expansion also promises to include an upgrade to the busy Inshes roundabout layout.Planning officials are discussing road widening proposals with landowners. Council representatives will attend community council meetings in the coming months to assess local requirements.A 500-space park-and-ride facility was consented as part of the Stratton scheme.The report references a landowner who argued that the brief contradicts an existing development plan and \"fails to recognise Stratton and only refers to potential future development at Ashton Farm\".They also complained that the \"vision map does not reflect the original permission\u0027 town centre at Stratton or the development plan support for it\".Another considers \"Ashton centre\" to be \"an unreasonable competitor location to Stratton\" that \"undermines\" Stratton.It is unclear from the report what long-term employment would be created in the area \u0026ndash an issue raised historically by numerous city councillors who questioned council officials\u0026rsquo aspirations for growth.The report stated: \"Analysis identified that the optimum location for a new centre is at east Ashton.\"This location is, therefore, identified as the core area for new and existing communities to visit as a destination that has footfall generating uses including a new district park, high school and mixed-use centre that includes high-density residential uses.\"It emphasised that the Stratton site does not include provision for a district park or high school with community facilities like those at Inverness Royal Academy.The brief \"does not seek to create competition between Stratton and Ashton\", according to the development planning team.Public feedback has already established an aversion to more development in the area with calls for the focus to instead be on the city centre and brownfield sites, and concern that the recent demand for new homes could stall, leaving a surplus of residential properties.Other responses included a plea that \"pubs should not be allowed\".Smithton and Culloden Community Council chairman David McGrath welcomed the document, with a caveat that it improves access to the nearby Inverness Shopping Park with a short cut for existing residents.A spokesman for the Stratton developer Hazledene said: \"We don\u0026rsquot think it\u0027 appropriate that a competitor town centre should be introduced, as this would add uncertainty and confusion.\"These [Ashton] proposals are early stage proposals and we believe should not be given the same weight as the Stratton permissions already granted.

He pinpointed Neale and insisted he was an “outstanding” player who could walk into any top team in Europe.Still a teenager, Neale proved that in Munich.Willie said: “I have so many happy football memories of Neale, but also so many other great memories because he was such a great guy.”Neale made his Aberdeen first team debut on October 11 1980 in a 2-0 defeat of Kilmarnock at Pittodrie.He partnered Willie at centre-back in that game because Alex McLeish was out injured at the time.Willie said: “Neale broke through very early in his career and was just a wee lad.“He always had that talent and I think he had the eye on the sweeper’s position but I had to persuade him to move into midfield.“Neale and Neil Simpson were an absolutely magnificent combination.“Neale was an Aberdeen boy brought through and developed by the club and given the big chance to shine.“And he certainly did that.”Following that debut, Neale would go on to win two league titles, four Scottish Cups and the League Cup domestically.“Tattie” would add the European Cup Winners’ Cup and Super Cup in 1983 as an integral part of the only Scottish team to win two European trophies.His first trophy success came in 1982 with a 4-1 Scottish Cup win over Rangers after extra-time.With the Reds 3-1 up at Hampden, Neale, just 18, scored an iconic goal.He smashed a shot into an open net in front of the Rangers end, before punching the air \u0026#8230 and then doing a forward roll.Neale made 220 appearances for Aberdeen, scoring 10 goals, before transferring to top flight Aston Villa in 1986.He would go on to play for Rangers, Reading, Dunfermline Athletic and Ross County.In a successful managerial career, Neale guided Ross County through two successive promotions.As manager of Hartlepool he took the side to the play-offs for the second tier.Neale would also go on to manage Gillingham and Peterhead before returning to Hartlepool in the 2011-12 season.His final trophy success with Aberdeen was the Scottish Cup in 1986 – a 3-0 win over Hearts at Hampden.Fellow midfielder Jim Bett played alongside Neale in that cup final win.Jim, speaking from his home in Iceland, said: “Neale was a great guy to have in the dressing room as he was always upbeat and telling jokes.“He was a great footballer and also a great guy.“We played together in the Aberdeen team that won the Scottish Cup in 1986.“Alex Ferguson left the following season and that was the start of the team beginning to break up.“The boys who had played under Sir Alex had won everything and perhaps needed a new challenge.“Neale went down to Aston Villa and one or two others went elsewhere.“He played for a few other clubs but his heart was always in Aberdeen.”Neale signed schoolboy forms with Aberdeen under Billy McNeill in the 1977-78 season.He was such an exciting talent Neale made his debut for the Aberdeen reserves at the age of just 14.On turning 16, Neale was secured on a full-time contract at Pittodrie by Sir Alex Ferguson.He would go on to conquer Europe before he was out of his teens.Jim said: “It was some achievement for a player to come through the youth ranks at Aberdeen and then win European trophies.“Neale won everything domestically with Aberdeen and was a key part of that side that won two European trophies.“Alex Ferguson was a manager who gave young players a chance and at that time there were a few of them coming through at Pittodrie.“That was very fortunate for Aberdeen.“Neale went on to reach the heights with Aberdeen and lift European trophies.“It was fantastic to see a young player from the city go on to have so much success.“Neale achieved so much during his career.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"19 aberdeen schools targeted by vandals in one month","story":"\t\t\t\t\tVandals covered a school playground in oil and daubed graffiti around another, a new report shows.There were 19 vandal attacks at Aberdeen schools in April – and two schools were each targeted four times.There were a total of 17 broken windows, which cost at least £100 each to repair – and the actual cost could be thousands more when the price of glazier hire and boarding up the windows is taken into account.The Aberdeen City Council report said vandals struck at Cornhill Primary School on April 2, April 6 and twice on April 27. They smashed four windows, damaged a roof and broke guttering.St Machar Academy was damaged four times between April 16 and April 25. A fire alarm box was ripped off, two storage containers broken, a library door damaged and two windows smashed.Intruders got into Aberdeen Grammar School on April 16 and April 24 and daubed graffiti on the girls’ toilets walls.In another incident, an oil drum was pushed over at Kingswells School, sending oil over the car park.Windows were smashed at Torry Academy on April 3 and April 9. A window was damaged at Oldmachar Academy on April 16 and a window was broken at Rubislaw Pavillion on the same day.Damage was caused to toilets at Bridge of Don Academy on April 26.The report also detailed an incident at Harlaw Academy in which trees were covered with toilet paper, leaving a mess.There were 33 incidents in April 2017.Councillor Alan Donnelly, who is on the council’s education operational delivery committee, said: “The year-on-year reduction is pleasing, particularly as the council is allocating resources to securing schools, but even one incident of vandalism is too many.“We would ask people living near to schools to be vigilant and would also ask parents to be aware of where their own children are, as some of those responsible for the vandalism are children.“Not only does the cost of repair go to the taxpayer, but, in some cases, vandalism means classrooms have to be taken out of use and that is bad for children.”\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/05/roadmap-632x564.jpg ","title":"aberdeen passengers horror as plane aborts two landing attempts1","story":"\t\t\t\t\tPassengers today told of a “frightening” plane drama after a pilot abandoned two landing attempts and then gave up on a third.More than 150 people were on an easyJet flight from London when it encountered problems landing at Aberdeen International Airport.After leaving Gatwick at 9.15pm on Monday – almost three hours late – the full 156-seater plane tried to land at Dyce and had to quickly ascend due to thick fog – and the same happened when it tried again.The pilot then prepared a third landing attempt from a different direction – but then diverted to Glasgow.The aircraft landed around midnight and passengers were taken by coach and taxi back to Aberdeen.Some arrived home at 5.30am yesterday, including Linda McGillivray, 25, of Northfield, who described the delay, the failed landing attempts and the diversion as “quite a disaster”.Describing the first landing attempt, she said: “We descended fairly quickly and it became apparent by the quick descent something was wrong.“The very quick ascending of the plane was fairly frightening, especially when we could see that the weather was bad.”Apology from easyJet bosses as Aberdeen-bound plane diverts to GlasgowLinda was returning from the Creamfields Steel Yard Weekender music festival in Finsbury Park, London, with three pals, including Tessa Clark, 27, of Torry, who said: “We could feel a big descent and could see the lights below.“The lights of the runway were visible. I felt the plane speed up and rise again fast – and that happened twice. Then we diverted to Glasgow. The whole experience was horrible.”Colin Bell, 25, of Berryden, said: “At Glasgow Airport, everything descended into chaos. I didn’t get in the taxi until 3.30am. I got home at 5.40am and had work at 8am.”Ms Clark praised Glasgow Airport staff for staying late to attend to passengers.An Aberdeen International Airport spokesman said: “I can confirm the delayed easyJet London Gatwick flight was unable to land at Aberdeen due to low visibility.“Arrangements were made by the handling agent for easyJet at Glasgow to provide ground transport to Aberdeen for the passengers on the inbound flight.The passengers arrived by bus at the airport at approximately 4am yesterday.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2017/10/59e5aebf3e38d-848x564.jpg ","title":"colourful mural to reflect history of popular park","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA mural is set to deliver a splash of colour – and a dose of history – to a popular Aberdeen park.A new community group has been created to paint the artwork on the Gardener’s Bothy in Seaton Park and work has now started.It is being carried out in collaboration with Friends of Seaton Park and the Seaton Community Centre Art History Group.The project became a reality after the community centre received participatory budget funding from Aberdeen City Council.It is hoped the finished mural will capture scenes from the popular park, including the family favourite train attraction Mr Therm.The group meets every Monday from 1.30pm, weather permitting, to work on the bothy.Sheila Gordon, chairwoman of Friends of Seaton Park, said: “It was a suggestion that was made a long time ago, I’ve been trying to get it done for years.“There’s an artist in residence at the community centre, so he’ll be taking the classes.

Banchory to skate, it’s already in the middle of a very popular park, and the parents can go off into the community, and visit the shops, or buy an ice cream, or whatever they want to do.“It’s not a tourist attraction, but it will do no harm to have an extra thing in the community.”Banchory and Mid-Deeside councillor Eileen Durno is also hopeful the plan will benefit the area.She said: “Hopefully people will come to Banchory to use the skatepark, and maybe visit other places in the town as well.”Plan for new north-east skatepark backed by council officersCouncillors handed the plans for the skatepark a major boost last week, as the Marr area committee offered its support to BSG to pursue a lease for the land.On the committee vote, Russ said: “We’re absolutely delighted.“This is a major step forward for us.”The land is listed as “for the common good”, meaning that it is not owned by any party.Due to this, the BSG will have to seek permission from a sheriff to gain the lease, which requires a community consultation to be undertaken, and then to seek planning permission from Aberdeenshire Council.Russ, who has lived in Banchory for 10 years and has three children who all use the

squad.Shinnie, 26, earned a debut cap in Scotland’s 2-0 friendly loss to World Cup-bound Peru.Pittodrie captain Shinnie is in contention to face Mexico at the 87,000 sell-out Azteca Stadium on Sunday morning.Scotland begin the bid to reach Euro 2020 later this year with Nations League ties against Albania and Israel in September.Scotland legend Willie Miller believes Shinnie has the pressing game needed for those clashes.Reds’ defender Scott McKenna secured his third straight cap in starting in Lima but his handball led to the penalty for Peru’s opening goal.Miller said: “Shinnie can play in competitive games like Euro qualifiers.“He plays in an area where Scotland have a lot of players (midfield).“However, Shinnie brings a different dynamic to the midfield in terms of the way he plays.“He leads that pressing pack for Aberdeen and is the first one to try to win the ball back which is an important element of the modern-day game.“Particularly if you are looking to press the game and win the ball back early.“There are two games coming up against Israel and Albania where Scotland should be desperate to get the ball and have as much possession as they can.“Shinnie adds that dynamic of physical enthusiasm to the midfield that would serve Alex McLeish and Scotland well in top competitions.“He has plenty of experience as well.“The manager can only give him a chance and he has the experience so there is no reason why he cannot take it.”Shinnie was introduced as a second-half substitute for Hibs’ Dylan McGeouch with 15 minutes remaining.Shinnie had been in previous Scotland squads but had yet to be capped. He was an unused substitute in the 1-0 friendly loss to Holland at Pittodrie last November under then interim boss Malky Mackay.Dons great Miller, capped 65 times, said: “I am delighted that Shinnie has been given a chance as I see what he gives to Aberdeen.“He has been outstanding and is someone that leads by example.“You are talking about the captain of the team that have finished second in the Premiership in recent seasons and has played in cup finals.“Shinnie has also lifted the Scottish Cup with Inverness Caley Thistle.“You are not talking about an untested player and he deserves the opportunity to show he is good enough at international level.“Shinnie merits it for the station he holds within Scottish football and on performances.“He is definitely of a high enough standard.”Shinnie was one of seven players securing a debut Scotland cap in Lima. Peru extended their record unbeaten run to 13 games courtesy of goals either side of half-time from Christian Cueva and Jefferson Farfan.Dons defender McKenna played for 90 minutes. The 21-year-old’s hand ball conceded a penalty for the opener.It came from a blunder from debut keeper Jordan Archer where Farfan’s shot struck the Don’s elbow.Miller said: “The standard McKenna has set himself for a young lad is incredible.“He is still young and still learning the game.“Yet out of nowhere he has burst on to the international scene and looks as if he has been playing there for years.”Former Aberdeen midfielder Kenny McLean, who will return to parent club Norwich this summer, earned a fourth cap.Boss Alex McLeish praised the seven new caps for coping with the conditions.McLeish said: “I’m proud of the mentality they showed in a cauldron of a place.“They embraced it.“Bringing these guys into the team for the first time, they handled it really well.“It’s a squad where everybody deserves a cap.“It was hot out on the surface, especially when you’re doing a lot of chasing, which the Peruvians made us do.“Peru are a super team, they move it about well and know each other inside out.”McLeish’s depleted squad are set to be reduced further with some players leaving ahead of the friendly against Mexico.He said: “We’re going to lose a couple of players now.“Lewis Stevenson is going away.“We had an agreement with him to play the first game.“Matt Phillips is going back to England for an engagement there, which we agreed a couple of months ago.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 18","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 06/05/18, 11:38 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Sir,According to a report that appeared in your edition of April 27, a traffic accident occurred on the A83 near Lochgair at 2.30pm on Saturday April 21.It is further reported that the A83 between Lochgilphead and Inveraray was closed to traffic \u0026#8216while investigations were carried out\u0026#8217 \u0026#8211 before re-opening \u0026#8216in the early hours of Sunday April 22\u0026#8217.Even if the early hours is taken to mean, say, 1am on the Sunday morning, this suggests the principal route for access to and egress from Mid Argyll and Kintyre \u0026#8211 as well as the  ferries \u0026#8211 was arbitrarily closed by police for some eleven and a half hours.I would like Police Scotland to explain why this was necessary.I well remember a retired police officer telling me that, in the days prior to Argyll entering the stranglehold of Strathclyde Police, the local superintendent would want to know the reason why if the scene of an accident was not re-opened to traffic within about 30 minutes.Police Scotland should understand that (a) the usual excuse (lengthy closures are necessary in order to gather information thought useful in prevention of similar accidents in the future) will not wash (b) perusal of any half-decent road map will reveal to Police Scotland that, unlike the central belt, Argyll does not have a multiplicity of short alternative routes suitable for use as diversions and (c) their one-size-fits-all approach is a negation of management.If Police Scotland is so keen to glean evidence relative to a traffic accident they might also look at actual or potential accidents resulting from these enormous diversions \u0026#8211 fatigued drivers \u0026#8211 drivers unfamiliar with diverted routes \u0026#8211 difficulties finding overnight accommodation \u0026#8211 insufficient fuel \u0026#8211 appointments missed and so on and so on.Eric Box, XxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxSir,You may recall that I incurred a ruined tyre while driving through the roadworks at Strone Point on the A83 back in February.I claimed for £270, which was the cost of the rescue and renewing the tyre, against the trunk road maintenance contractor, BEAR Scotland, who had let the road deteriorate to such a dreadful state while road improvements were going on.While they haven\u0026#8217t admitted liability or anything as rash as that, they have, on the other hand, offered to pay me £250, most of the expense I incurred.I have accepted this offer and I thought you might publish this as an encouragement to others who have suffered expense for similar reasons.It pays to complain.Graham Thomas, St CatherinesSir,Having held a successful evening of music at the Argyll Inn in Lochgilphead on Friday April 27, the Easy Club would like to thank a number of people and organisations.Thanks to the ownership/management/staff of the Argyll Inn and the donators to the prize draw the Co-op, Danny\u0026#8217s, Dalriada DIY, the Smiddy, Fyne Living, ABC Bookshop, the Archway and Marmalade Deli.Also all the helpers and carers, and the many musicians, and the enthusiastic audience who came along to enjoy the evening.As we start to plan workshops for the coming months we would be very happy to welcome new participants.

There are no rules or limits to the imagination – they may want to be a wizard or superhero.If a child does not know what they want to be they can decorate their hat with something they are passionate about such as a sport, graffiti art, dancing shoes, or musical instrument.The idea behind the fun is to raise money for the UK’s leading children\u0026#8217s charity to help give thousands of disadvantaged children a better future. When they go into school, nursery or playgroup on May 18, parents and carers can make a voluntary donation of £1 to £2 to Barnardo\u0026#8217s Scotland.Children are full of surprises, and this is a fun way of allowing their imaginations to run wild in a way that will be inspiring, educational and raise money to help transform the lives of children who desperately need our support.It is easy to sign up on our website where you\u0026#8217ll find lots of resources and ideas to ensure your fundraising Hat Day will be a huge success and help support the children and young people we support in your local community.To register, visit www.barnardos.org.uk/hatday.

It was padlocked with a security lock.What a disappointment and what a waste of something worth sharing.I thought of how blessed we are in Argyll to be able to leave doors unlocked.Most of our churches are open day and night to extend a welcome to visitors.Jesus once said that he was \u0026#8216the door\u0026#8217 \u0026#8211 the door to life.The way to Jesus is never locked or barricaded.In his company, when we are stressed or worried, we can find that oasis of calm to refresh and renew our flagging souls.There is no key to this door, for it is always open, always welcoming.It\u0026#8217s a door that leads to a journey – the journey of a lifetime.It was a journey begun long, long ago and continues now and into the future.There will be companions on the way and it will never be dull.Different people will bring different talents and sing different songs, but we will all have the same destination.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column 24","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 17/05/18, 11:31 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.We heartily agree with the decision of the Lord Lieutenant to nominate Betty Rhodick to attend the royal wedding.As far as we are aware, no one works harder for Lochgilphead  \u0026#8211 and once Betty puts her mind to something\u0026#8230Betty and Geordie have been the figureheads for the Lochgilphead Armed Forces Day commemorations since they started, but she deserves this recognition not just for this one annual event, but for all she does on our behalf.Enjoy yourself, Betty and Kelly.The renovated Kilmartin Museum is now almost within reach.This is sure to be of great economic benefit to the region when it opens in two years and it is an exciting prospect that will enable the unique heritage of Mid Argyll to be properly showcased.Just what was last weekend\u0026#8217s Scapa festival at Ardkinglas?The answer is probably unique to every individual who attended.

At times when the builders are working the gulls understandably leave the site but then return during the evenings and at weekends. Several birds were again sitting on apparent nests as recently as May 4, however it looks like many others may have moved elsewhere.Measures have since been taken by the builders to encourage the birds to leave the area prior to laying their eggs and to give them a chance of nesting elsewhere soon. Recently I had a meeting with SNH (Scottish Natural Heritage) and the RSPB and both were sympathetic and understanding of the situation.I also plan to meet with the Scottish Canals environmental scientist soon in the hope that perhaps provision can be made, within the scope of the hub project, to allow for a nesting area for the Common Gulls in future years at the site.This could give rise to an exciting opportunity enabling the public and visitors to the new heritage centre to view these gulls raise their chicks, for which is effectively the rarest colony of nesting birds in the Crinan Canal corridor.Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,This week Allt Dearg Wind Farm distributed over £135,000 to the Ardrishaig Community Trust, which holds the village\u0026#8217s share in this locally owned wind farm.Combined with the recent payments to the Tighnabruaich and Tarbert Trusts which hold similar shares in the neighbouring Sròndoire Wind Farm, together with the wind farms\u0026#8217 contributions to the local educational trust, this brings the total direct community benefit payments from these projects to well over £ 1 million.This is a significant milestone for the projects, and highlights the socio-economic advantages of local ownership in wind power. Despite its relatively small capacity Allt Dearg is the single largest contributor of community benefit payments in Argyll.This week the UK Government published the results of its latest tracking survey of public attitudes to energy and climate change. This shows continued growth in support for on-shore wind, and eight in ten agreed that renewable energy developments should provide direct benefits to the communities in which they are located.Some objections to wind farms remain, and our turbines remain visible in the distance. We hope that the views of Allt Dearg and Sròndoire might remind such objectors that we are economically dependent on what we can produce from the limited options available to us in remote rural areas. That our particular wind farms are able to make a significant contribution to local employment and deliver funding direct to our neighbouring communities, whilst supplying around 20 per cent of Argyll and Bute’s annual domestic electricity requirements from a clean renewable resource, is very satisfying.We would like to thank all those who have made these projects the successes they are, and in particular thank those local community councillors and trust members who have given so much of their time in recent years to make this all happen. For our part, we will continue our efforts to grow the industry and economic activity that provides secure employment and opportunity for our local community.We look forward to our community partners being able to invest the fruits of these wind farms into exciting local projects.Mary Broadfoot of Stronachullin and James F Lithgow of OrmsarySir,Loneliness is a major issue in society and affects everyone from all walks of life, regardless of age or ability.That’s why we’re pleased the Scottish Government is looking at the development of a new approach to tackling the issues of loneliness and social isolation – something we have first-hand experience of and how it affects many of the people we support in Scotland.Following a recent survey of over 150 service users of our homecare services in Stirling, Falkirk, Perth and Kinross, and Angus which focused solely on loneliness and social isolation, it was revealed that loneliest people receive far fewer visitors each week. While this is hardly surprising, we did find that those who either lived with family or had family close by were less at risk of loneliness and the negative health impacts associated. Our research also highlighted that respondents, in most cases, simply wanted a chat over a cuppa with someone their own age.Social interactions are something the vast majority of us take for granted as we all lead such busy lives, but for someone who is alone, watching time go by very slowly, it’s incredibly painful for them to sit at home day after day with no communication from the outside world.Charities such as Sue Ryder regularly arrange social events for our service users and their families.But if, as a nation, we’re serious about tackling loneliness as a public health issue then we need to be resourcing our local authorities to put in place services or to commission them from the third sector to ensure that no one feels alone and isolated in Scotland.Pamela Mackenzie, director of neurological services and Scotland, Sue Ryder, StirlingSir,This spring we hope your readers will celebrate the royal wedding with their very own Right Royal Tea Party in aid of Meningitis Now.Putting on a spread fit for a royal wedding is a piece of cake with our free fundraising pack and, as Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have requested charity donations rather than wedding presents, you can fulfil their wishes whilst helping families affected by this devastating disease.A royal-themed Time4Tea can be held anytime, not just on Saturday May 19, the date of the Royal Wedding. And it can take place anywhere – at home, at work, at school.Just pop the kettle on, slice up a cake or two, homemade or bought (you have to have cake at a wedding) and invite friends, relatives and colleagues to enjoy a cuppa or perhaps even a glass of champagne.The serious point is that you’ll be helping to fight meningitis and move us one step closer to our vision of a future where no one in the UK dies from meningitis \u0026#8211 and everyone affected gets the support they need to rebuild their life.Sadly, despite developments in vaccines, meningitis and septicaemia continue to affect thousands every year and kill more under-fives than any other infectious disease. Help us fight back on all fronts by funding research to eradicate the disease, raising awareness and supporting survivors.That would be the perfect wedding present.Find out more at www.MeningitisNow.org and search for Time 4 Tea.Elaine Close, community fundraiser, Meningitis NowSir,Please would the parents of the young girl who may have witnessed a recent incident with a man and dog in Inveraray Main Street be kind enough to contact my husband and I through this newspaper?We saw a man who, we believe, mistreated a dog in the street at 8.30pm on Sunday April 29, and his movements in the immediate aftermath.We are both keen to know that this young person is alright as she appeared to be terribly frightened, running off at speed with her two dogs as he headed straight for her.Knowing she was now fine would put our minds at rest.

Moore took the free-kick, but his curling effort from 27 yards lacked power.Moore, however, was not to be denied his hat-trick and 60 seconds later  steered a good low finish past Scott Urquhart\u0026#8217s left hand.The early first-half jitters returned to the League defence just after the hour mark when hesitation in the box allowed Nikki MacDougall, of host club Tarbert, to nip in and force the ball past Urquhart from nine yards to add a fifth goal for Argyll.A flurry of changes from both sides with 16 minutes remaining saw Scott Soudan and Lewis MacNaughton replace MacDougall and McCallum for Argyll.The league adjusted quicker to the changes and Kyle Reid and Robbie Martin combined well for Martin to pull a goal back in the 77th minute.With five minutes remaining, Soudan\u0026#8217s tenacity in the box robbed Daniel Smith on the six yard line and left him one-on-one with Urquhart.Soudan\u0026#8217s stabbed effort was stopped by Urquhart\u0026#8217s outstretched right foot but, typical of his luck on the day, the rebound fell kindly for the Campbeltown Pupils\u0026#8217 striker who rounded the prostrate Urquhart and walked the ball into the empty net.The full-time whistle ended an entertaining encounter with the players and officials retiring to the Islay Frigate Hotel for the presentation ceremony.The Duncan MacDougall man of the match award was given to Red Star\u0026#8217s Kieran Moore.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"sun brings out the best in lochgilphead golfers","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 17/05/18, 2:24 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowOn a lovely sunny Sunday the gents competed to gain a place to play in this year\u0026#8217s match and knockout competition.Jim Hunter was excited to return a nett score of 58, six strokes below par.

It was a gamble \u0026#8211 but one that paid off, with the business now turning over millions each year.He left the business \u0026#8216at least 10 years ago\u0026#8217, but was a very interested visitor at last week\u0026#8217s \u0026#8216Fyne at 40\u0026#8217 celebrations \u0026#8211 more on pages 16 and 17 \u0026#8211 to mark the company\u0026#8217s four decades in business.\u0026#8216Looking back, I feel quite astonished really,\u0026#8217 he told the Advertiser.\u0026#8216I mean, away back we had a wooden hut, but before that there was a fish box and an umbrella. We were growing shellfish, cooking prawns and smoking a bit of fish.\u0026#8216The restaurant as we see it today was an old farm steading \u0026#8211 well, it was a midden, really. But we slowly evolved within it.\u0026#8216It was open to the slates and the wind used to go straight up the length of the oyster bar. We had a hessian sack to keep down the draught, and it used to stand out at about 45 degrees a lot of the time. It was very primitive for many years, because we were skint.\u0026#8216People sat in their overcoats, but they liked the style. All of a sudden they could get local shellfish, and it just developed from there.\u0026#8217He continued: \u0026#8216Since my time the whole place has had a re-make and it is really, really nice.\u0026#8216It\u0026#8217s been driven by the volume of people wanting to dine here. I mean, you couldn\u0026#8217t keep up that slightly rustic look. It\u0026#8217s a cracking place now. Just superb.\u0026#8217Johnny Noble sadly died in 2002, aged just 66.\u0026#8216He was an inspiring, lovely man, said Mr Lane. \u0026#8216No matter what disaster befell us no matter what cock-up happened, he was ever-optimistic and just kept us going.\u0026#8216We would have our business meetings in the billiard room at [Johnny\u0026#8217s home] Ardkinglas House, and there would be a bottle of something. That just keeps the morale going.\u0026#8216He was a great man, and wonderful entertainment.\u0026#8217The stories of Johnny Noble are legion, and most are true.Andy Lane recalled: \u0026#8216In the days of the Oyster Bar in our old draughty building, everyone had to muck in. Johnny would go round being the wine waiter for a while. Until, that is, someone would choose an inappropriate wine. At that point he\u0026#8217d start a sort of genial argument with them. In the end he\u0026#8217d sit down with them and you\u0026#8217d never see him again for the rest of the evening.\u0026#8216I don\u0026#8217t think we realised just how important he was for the business until he was gone.\u0026#8217Now living a quieter life in Cornwall with his Dexters, Mr Lane concluded: \u0026#8216My wife and I changed tack in life, really, and it keeps us busy.

Therefore, we support separating pedestrians, cyclists and motorists through an expansion of the network of walking and cycling paths across Scotland.We would like to stress, however, that measures like these will not single-handedly lead to safer roads. The road mentality in Scotland still favours the motorist over more vulnerable road users, which presents a huge barrier to more people taking up active lifestyles.More needs to be done to change our road culture for people in Scotland to feel safer regardless of their means of transportation, ultimately empowering them to lead healthier and more active lifestyles.Perhaps it is time we started to beat the ‘presumed liability’ drum once again?Brenda Mitchell, Road Traffic Accident Law (Scotland) LLP, Edinburgh.Sir,Some people have difficulty getting up and down the steps on the Glasgow bus. We asked West Coast Motors about this and they gave us the answer we wanted.All Citylink buses are fitted with an access ramp, worked by the driver. A platform comes out on to the pavement, with a holding bar, and is then raised up to floor level. This is designed as a wheelchair lift, where two seats at the front have to be arranged to be taken out, to give plenty of room.It was agreed, however, that if someone felt nervous about climbing up or down the stairs, they could also use the access platform. Once they have paid their ticket, they can walk to a seat.West Coast Motors asks anyone wanting this service to please remember two things.Firstly, book your single or return tickets by phone or on the Citylink website.Then, 48 hours before your journey, phone Citylink and tell them the times and details of the booking you have made and let them know you will be using the access ramp. The telephone number is 08712 663333.Kirsty McCuaig and Patricia Crawford, Mid Argyll Buddies.Sir,The ongoing effects of weather, bureaucracy and concern for the future continue to put our countryside under pressure, with few avenues to turn to for support.This can have dramatic consequences for the rural economy and the people who live and work there.The Prince’s Countryside Fund is committed to supporting community-led projects that will re-invigorate and sustain farming networks and the countryside by providing services and amenities through its grant programme.Open for applications until June 14, grants are available for up to £50,000. If you are involved in a community-run or farming support project and think your organisation may benefit – or if you know someone who might –  visit  www.princescountrysidefund. org.uk/grants.The fund has supported a diverse range of projects, including a community transport app in Argyll and projects on Barra, Orkney and Shetland. We are proud to have distributed more than £9 million since 2010 to more than 250 projects led by these grassroots organisations.It is crucial we help rural areas during these times of change to retain a thriving countryside and encourage a sustainable farming sector in the UK and would encourage people to apply for our funding.Claire Saunders, director, The Prince’s Countryside Fund.Sir,At first sight, it seems odd that the controversy over the reported disturbance to common gulls, oystercatchers and black guillemots at the old oil depot in Ardrishaig is focused on a breeding colony of common gulls.I’m no bird expert and hadn’t realised common gulls are less common than the bigger varieties or that they’re a declining species.But among the reasons given for this are predation by mink and the loss of open rubbish dumps and both might be contributing factors in Mid Argyll.It’s surely hardly surprising that the only breeding colony along the canal is at the Ardrishaig end, where the urbanisation around the tidal flats of Loch Gilp and the Lingerton dump offer prime scavenging opportunities.I don’t know whether they lose out to the bigger gull species when it comes to local island nesting sites, or whether the old Gleaner site might offer other advantages, for example, maybe less vulnerable to mink predation – but could it be the gulls are there primarily because of man-made feeding opportunities and that they’ll find an alternative site that’s similarly convenient?Likewise, the smaller populations of oystercatchers and black guillemots, however, although they’re also both amber listed they don’t scavenge and seem to be more dependent on the sea and shore for their livelihoods.Their decline might be of more concern but they’re hopefully less swayed towards easy pickings around Loch Gilp and more evenly distributed to Loch Crinan.Perhaps Jim Dickson and Andrew Tongue can enlighten us further on just how endangered the populations of these three species are in Mid Argyll.Robert Wakeham, Lochgilphead.Sir,Please would the parents of the young girl who may have witnessed a recent incident with a man and dog in Inveraray Main Street contact my husband and I through this newspaper?We saw a man who, we believe, mistreated a dog in the street at 8.30pm on Sunday April 29.We are both keen to know this young person is alright as she appeared to be frightened, running off at speed with her two dogs.Knowing she was fine would put our minds at rest.

Beyond our concerns for public safety, this systematic under-investment is slowing our economy and costing local councils a fortune in compensation for car owners.We recognise the importance of well-maintained roads and we are willing to invest in it.The SNP has consistently neglected Scotland’s roads and the results are obvious for everyone to see.Councillor Alastair Redman, Islay.On Monday May 14, I spotted six swallows over the rear of Meadows Place, hopefully heralding a decent summer.First seen this year.Mike Power, Lochgilphead.Sir,During this week\u0026#8217s Holyrood vote on the UK Government’s Withdrawal Bill, Labour, the Greens and LibDems joined the SNP in an overwhelming rejection of the UK Government’s currently-drafted Brexit plans, voting 93 to 30 against the bill.While the Scottish Government agrees in the need for UK-wide frameworks, it has described the retention of the overall control of agriculture, fisheries, food labelling and public procurement as a power grab.The Scottish Parliament has spoken loudly and clearly, and if the UK Government wants us to believe they value Scotland and devolution, they must respect the vote and remove the proposed power grab.Any constraints placed on the existing powers of the Scottish Parliament without consent would be a democratic outrage.During Prime Minister\u0026#8217s Questions, Theresa May failed to reassure us she will respect the decision of the Scottish Parliament. If she does choose to ignore the vote and force through this legislation, she will be breaking the conventions of the 20-year-old devolution settlement and imposing a power grab upon Scotland against our will.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"science matters natures patterns","story":"\t\tDorothy H CrawfordUpdated: 20/05/18, 11:47 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe natural world abounds in beautiful patterns, each evolved to enhance survival of a species \u0026#8211 the extravagant, iridescent peacock’s tail, which serves to attract a mate, while intricate orchid flowers entice pollinators and tigers’ stripes provide camouflage.But not all nature’s patterns are quite as showy it is the mathematical symmetries that I find most intriguing.Italian mathematician Leonardo Fibonacci lived in 12th century Algeria when Indian numerals were introduced to the West via the Middle East.  In his book, Liber Abaci (published in 1202), he describes a numerical sequence, now called the Fibonacci sequence, in which each number is the sum of the previous two digits: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 ad infinitum. He formulated this recurrence in relation to rabbit breeding, but it turns out to be exceedingly wide-spread in nature, from tree branching to mollusc shell growth to bee reproduction.Plant leaves are like solar panels, absorbing sunlight to power energy-providing photosynthesis.  Thus, leaves appear in a spiral around the stem, each positioned to optimise sunlight capture.  The ratio of leaves to turns is always a ration of Fibonacci numbers 3 leaves to 1 turn for hazel, 8/3 for pear and 13/5 for almond trees.  The angle between consecutive leaves is always close to 137.5o, called ‘the golden angle’ – perfect for maximising energy production.The number of petals in most flowers also follows the Fibonacci sequence: lilies have 3, buttercups 5, delphinium 8, common marigolds 13, asters 21.  But even more striking are the complex spirals of seed-heads of sunflowers, fir cones and pineapples.  In each case new seeds forming in the centre of the flower push older seeds out into mesmerising patterns of interlocking, clockwise and anticlockwise spirals.The numbers of spirals in both directions are consecutive Fibonacci numbers with 5 and 8 or 8 and 13 in pineapples, 8 and 13 in fir cones, and numbers as high as 144 and 233 recorded in sunflower heads.Why? Because these configurations pack in the most seeds.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 21/05/18, 3:33 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Some would argue it has been an eyesore that should have been knocked down long before now and replaced with a more modern building.But it\u0026#8217s sad to see the old Inveraray Community Hall crumble and rot with neglect.What makes the building\u0026#8217s current predicament all the more galling is that there was the chance, according to Inspire Inveraray, to make the building safe six years ago.

As with other gull species which are opportunist in diet, junk food and bits of plastic provided by us humans can be inadvertently consumed.Over many years the Gleaner oil depot, which has a concrete bund in case of oil spillage, has provided a safe nesting site for around 20 pairs. The suggestion that this colony could easily find an alternative site is perhaps wishful thinking as suitable sites nearby in Mid Argyll are already occupied by other gull species or don’t have the required habitat features.Thankfully, however, this should not prove necessary. Following a productive on-site meeting last week with the Scottish Canals\u0026#8217 environmental scientist, the project architect and TSL contractors we noted 10-15 birds sitting on eggs and unaffected by the work going on around them.Planned works over the coming weeks should not affect these gulls, Oystercatchers or Black Guillemots from nesting and will also not impede the building work which is scheduled to be completed by next spring.The Mid Argyll hub project and new canal museum will largely reflect the social and cultural heritage of the Crinan Canal, but should also encompass the important and often decreasing natural history of the Crinan Canal corridor. These breeding birds are also a part of this and should not just be something to ‘chase off’ to somewhere else.Excellent viewing and educational opportunities from the new build will be possible to watch this colony raise their chicks as well as providing a point to lookout for other wildlife on the loch.Nearby, the tidal estuary of Loch Gilp provides us with an often highly under-valued unofficial nature reserve that links Ardrishaig with Lochgilphead, which in winter hosts important numbers of duck and waders, in summer includes breeding Eider ducks and Common Terns and during migration is a vital stopping off point during adverse weather for passage Whooper swans, Brent geese and Black-tailed Godwits to name a few.Increasingly good work is being undertaken by locals and the Phoenix Trust to help clear up some of the increasing amounts of shoreline rubbish.Keep up the good work!Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,I have been out and about Islay the past week speaking to my constituents, visiting local businesses and monitoring the roads department\u0026#8217s progress with road repairs.Unfortunately CalMac management\u0026#8217s shocking handling of our local ferry service is really taking it\u0026#8217s toll on many local businesses that depend heavily of Islay\u0026#8217s growing tourist trade. We simply cannot allow CalMac to continue to make the same errors every year without consequences.On another subject, I have been unimpressed with our local roads department management\u0026#8217s sluggish response to a large number of complaints from local residents and myself about the plague of potholes scattered across Islay.There are many roads across Islay that have some potholes marked to be filled while others remain unmarked despite them in many cases being side by side. This scattershot approach to pothole repairs is as random as it is ineffective.In the future we will need to see a more long term resurfacing solution to our local roads with less short term, random and piecemeal patchwork.Cllr Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,In the run up to National Volunteering Week (June 1- 7), Cats Protection would like to extend our thanks to the many thousands of volunteers throughout the country who offer their time and expertise to help cats and kittens across the UK.In 2017, our 10,200-strong volunteer network contributed an incredible 5.5 million hours, each volunteer gifting a wealth of expertise and immeasurable passion to the charity. Their dedication enabled Cats Protection to help around 200,000 cats and kittens nationwide.Cats Protection is always on the lookout for new volunteers to join the UK’s biggest cat community. Though a large part of our work is helping cats, through fostering and rehoming, our volunteers have the opportunity to become involved with a range of interesting activities such as organising fundraising events, helping with publicity or managing funds and resources to benefit the greatest amount of cats.Volunteering can offer the chance to develop skills such as time management, interpersonal skills and teamwork, making CVs much more attractive and, of course, helping cats.Anyone who is interested in becoming a volunteer can go to our website www.cats.org.uk/get- involved/volunteering  to find out more.Julie Meredith, head of volunteering development, Cats Protection,Sir,I really love being active, especially the feeling after and that’s why I’m supporting Bowel Cancer UK and Beating Bowel Cancer’s latest fundraising campaign to get sponsored to do 30 minutes of physical activity for 30 days in June.Step up for 30 is a fantastic way for you to be more physically active to reduce your risk of bowel cancer – the UK’s second biggest cancer killer.

valued at £2 billion every year and recent research found that Scotland’s young people are particularly engaged, with participation now at 52 per cent \u0026#8211 nearly double the adult figure of 27

Whitletts has landed an unenviable spot in the country’s top 10 road tests to avoid. The list, published by recovery firm 24/7 Vehicle Rescue, claims the “nerve-jangling lottery” has put Ayr on the map for all the wrong reasons. It follows a \u0026pound3.5m scheme to increase lanes and install traffic lights on the roundabout in 2006, which has sparked trouble for many trying to negotiate its contours ever since. Transport Scotland held a safety review in 2015 after stats showed Whitletts was more dangerous than the giant M8 roundabout at Hermiston Gait near Edinburgh.  Ranjen Gohri, spokesman for 24/7 Vehicle Rescue, said: “Britain is famed for its roundabouts, and being able to safely negotiate them is a major part of driving in this country. “Unfortunately, many motorists are terrified of them. “This is not helped by some of the cases we’ve gathered that have a fearsome reputation and seem to almost unnerve drivers before they even get to them. “With the volume of traffic and unavoidable problems such as breakdowns, driving in the UK is difficult enough without having to attempt some of these roundabouts from hell.” Also making the top ten is Sheriffhall, which sits on Edinburgh’s city bypass, and Haudagain in Aberdeen, which is due for a \u0026pound30m redesign later this year.

A shiny, newly constructed bus terminal would be half a mile across town to Burns Statue Square. And the historic train station would be prised apart from the Station Hotel and rebuilt as a modern standalone hub. The dramatic vision, which is only one of the options being considered, would also see a chunk of the hotel knocked down and the remainder converted to homes. The multi-million pound makeover of the town’s transport infrastructure depends on businesses such as Stagecoach and ScotRail buying into the idea. Parkhouse Street, which is home to a number of high-profile estate agents, would be pedestrianised in one option.  And the dual carriageway A70 leading from the Market Inn roundabout into the town could become single lane in either direction. Folk had the chance to see the ideas from Ayr Renaissance at a public exhibition in the Town Hall last week. Ayr Renaissance chair James Knox said: “We want to give everyone the chance to have their say on the masterplan for Burns Statue Square. “Nothing is written in stone. We have just begun the consultation process.” A council spokesman said: “We’re at the start of a process looking at options to regenerate Burns Statue Square and the Affleck’s block site, one of Ayr’s hidden gems behind the town hall. Some initial options were pulled together for the consultation last week, however we’re keen to hear more ideas from the public, so we’re looking at additional exhibitions in the near future.”  Depute council leader Brian McGinley said: “This is a good opportunity to get on and regenerate Ayr town centre, which is badly needed. There are multiple issues that need to be addressed and we need all stakeholders to put the interests of Ayr first and foremost. “These are ideas that we can work with and shape to make Ayr better. But these improvements will only happen if we all pull together.” Consultants Ironside Farrar have been working on designs. Concerns have been mounting over the future of Ayr’s railway presence as the state of the Station Hotel continues to deteriorate.  The hotel owners have been told to carry out essential maintenance by the council and were slapped with a dangerous building notice. There are still question marks over the future of the Odeon amid speculation it could move to another location in the town. Office building Burns House has been labelled as not fit for purpose and is due to be demolished. But the new replacement building plans for the bottom of the town have been knocked back – throwing the office relocation timescale off. The timeline and budget for the Burns Statue Square makeover has not been released. Stagecoach and Network Rail did not reply to Ayrshire Post requests for comment before our deadline.

Shankland, 22, told the Ayrshire Post: “It’s a great club to be a part of. The main thing for this decision is that I am enjoying my football. The gaffer has been great with me and that’s why I came here. He gave me a chance to get back into football. I am happy and I don’t think there’s any amount of money that beats happiness.

Boss Ian McCall said: Lawrence could have doubled his money elsewhere and had offers from the Premiership up here and League One down in England. But the affection he has had from our supporters has played a huge part in his decision. It’s a huge piece of business for this club. Be in no doubt that Lawrence could easily have gone, but he has made a footballing decision.

The pair are both from Kilmarnock. “We met in the Brass \u0026amp Granite in 2010 at a pub quiz,” said Erin. “I worked part time in Tesco while studying and Stuart would come in and chat to me on a Sunday when he wasn’t offshore. “It wasn’t until 2015 when my gran met Stuart at a wedding and told him that I was single that he finally plucked up the courage to ask me on a date! “Stuart invited me to his house where he cooked me a lovely meal and the romance started. We moved in together early 2016 and then Stuart proposed whilst we were on holiday in Dubai in September 2016. “He bought me a pair of Valentino shoes and got down on one knee to put them on for me before pulling out my beautiful engagement ring that he’d designed himself and had made by a jeweller in Dubai.  The couple tied the knot on Saturday, February 24 this year, with the ceremony held at Glasgow University Memorial Chapel and the reception at Boclair House in Bearsden. Erin said: “It was a nice contrast of traditional and modern glam. “We were so lucky getting a beautiful crisp sunny day - right before the Beast from the East came later that week. “Stuart and I wrote our own ceremony and personalised vows. “We ended the night with [I want to spend my] Life with You by The Proclaimers. “It really was a perfect day and more than we could of dreamed of! The bride wore Everlasting by Caroline Castigliano, from The Bridal Garden in Glasgow, with her bridesmaids wearing customised blush Haley Paige dresses from Anne Priscilla, Glasgow.  Groom Stuart wore an Arran Mist kilt and plaid with matching navy jacket and gold tie. And the groomsmen wore Arran Mist tartan kilts with charcoal jackets and gold ties - exclusive to MacGregor \u0026amp MacDuff in Prestwick. The bridal party consisted of chief bridesmaid Eilidh McKenzie and bridesmaids Lynsey Ross, Raina Purba and Kirsteen Havlin. Making up the rest of the wedding party were best man Craig Marshall, ushers Les Lawrie, Dean Wear and Torin McKenzie, mother of the bride Una McKenzie and parents of the groom Yvonne and Fraser Murray. The couple celebrated being newlyweds with a trip to the sunshine. Erin said: “We squeezed in 10 nights in at the Centara Ras Fushi resort in the Maldives before Stuart went offshore again. “It was paradise! Our villa was right on the beach so it was perfect for watching the sunset.  Thistle \u0026amp Blink Photography from Kilmarnock captured the couple’s big day, leaving them with fond memories to relive. Emma Lawson of Betty Bluebell, based in East Kilbride, pieced together the bouquets with Ashley Nimmo, Ellis Dewhurst and Jett Paterson of Allure in Kilmarnock creating the hair and beauty looks for the day. As for their cake, the couple opted for four-tiers with all their favourite flavours, including red velvet. A local lady called Gianna made the cake, completed with a handmade topper by friend Rachel Currie.

Neighbours have slammed fast motorists in the Heathfield area and also in Whitletts Road. One resident claims an existing speed camera on Whitletts Road currently isn’t in operation and insist vehicles are zooming past her home at speeds of up to 50mph. She is calling for a speed camera further along the road to curb fast drivers. The concerned woman has called for the camera between Whitletts Road and Mainholm Road. Speaking at this month’s North Ayr Community Council, she said: “I am convinced the speed camera in Whitletts Road is not switched on. “I can hear cars at 6am or 7am travelling at more than 30mph coming into the town and the same going out.  “We need a speed camera.” Councillor Ian David said: “I am waiting for a response from the Partnership Panel as speeding in Whitletts Road was mentioned and it will be taken up with the police.” Speeding was also a hot topic discussed at last month’s Newton and Heathfield Community Council held in Newton Pavilion. Community councillors highlighted problems with speeding cars in Alderston Avenue and Northfield Avenue, and the problem of these streets being used by drivers as rat run to avoid the traffic lights in Prestwick Road. One woman said: “(There is) speeding in Alderston Avenue and there are a few children who stay in that street at the corner and the cars are turning right on to Northfield Avenue.” Police attending the meeting said they would do their best to monitor the situation. A council spokesman said Police Scotland/Safety Cameras Scotland administer speed cameras: “Safety cameras in Scotland are operated under the rules and guidelines of the Scottish Safety Camera Programme.”  A Police Scotland spokesman said: “The speed detection cameras are rotated around camera housing sites and have the ability to be used at any time. “You can find more information on the Scottish Safety Camera Programme and the location of camera sites by visiting www.safetycameras.gov.scot” In March, the Post reported that more than 13,000 speed offences have been captured on Ayrshire’s roads over the past three years Fast drivers were caught 13,103 times racing through the streets at breakneck speeds across the county from 2015 to 2017. And the highest clocked by a speed camera during that period was in 2016 at 140mph. Over last three years, a total of 715 speeding offences were detected in Ayr, 227 in Troon, 116 Prestwick, 32 in Maybole, 105 in Girvan and 88 in Cumnock.

Calls are mounting for civic head, Helen Moonie, to hold a bash at County Buildings, following Ayr’s first league title in 21 years. But the request could be snubbed in favour of a joint sporting celebration, the Post understands. A request for the engagement, lodged in the aftermath of Ayr’s success, is being considered by officials. Former cop Alasdair Malcolm, now a volunteer at Somerset Park, has called for the recognition. He said: “Every effort should be made to mark this fantastic achievement. “Ayr United are an integral part of the local community and, particularly through their Academy programme, have close working relationships throughout local schools and community groups. “The club, which has been a feature of the town since 1910, have had an outstanding season.” Ayr became the first club in the UK to score 100 goals in domestic competition en route to their title.  And their championship was the first to be clinched on home soil for 90 years. Mr Malcolm, secretary of the Ayrshire Golf Association, said: “It would be fitting if the local authority, by way of a civic reception or similar event, would mark the achievement of the management, players, officials and staff.” South Ayrshire Tory leader, Martin Dowey, added: “It is a wonderful achievement and one that is worthy of a civic reception. “A prosperous Ayr United is good for the town and we will be calling on all councillors to recognise the title win.” However, it’s believed there may be other invites on the guest list of any civic celebration. Carrick Rugby Club, three-time winners of the BT National Shield, and Commonwealth gold medallist Paul Foster, are among those in their thoughts. A council spokesman said: “A request has been received and will be considered in line with our civic hospitality guidelines.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"win a summer shopping spree","story":"NewsWin a summer shopping spreeTo help you get fashion and beauty- ready for summer, Debenhams at Ayr Central are hosting a fabulous VIP shopping event on Thursday June 7.\u0026nbspShareByAyrshire Post10:35, 30 MAY 2018Updated10:36, 30 MAY 2018NewsGet ready for summer and be in with a chance of winning a shopping spree\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailWIN A SUMMER SHOPPING SPREE!

Wren Kitchens will move into a 10,000sq ft unit at Heathfield this September, the Post can reveal. The firm, based in Lincolnshire, will make its first foray into Ayrshire when the store opens its doors. Its nearest outlet is currently more than 40 miles away at Abbotsinch, near Paisley. The addition comes as a welcome boost for park bosses, who are set to lose three retailers this year. Homebase will bow out on June 24, joining Carpetright and Maplin on the casualty list. The departures will see 50,000sq ft of trading space lost. However, Alastair Dickie, director at Heathfield’s developers Ediston Properties, said: “This is a positive piece of business. “Wren are an expanding company and this represents their first store in Ayrshire.  “They clearly view Ayr as a place to be and we are happy to have them on board. “It will mean jobs, not only in store but indirectly for fitters.” Wren will move into the unit vacated by the former PC World. The firm, which was founded in 2009, employs more than 4000 staff. It comes as park bosses prepare to seal a deal with another new name on site. Mr Dickie added: “Since acquiring the park we’ve let out ten units and don’t anticipate stopping there.” Ediston bought Heathfield in 2011 in a deal worth \u0026pound31.8 million. Retail giants such as M\u0026ampS, DFS and Costa have all moved in as part of the park’s overhaul in the intervening years.

of popular Boracay Island, whose waters President Rodrigo Duterte described as a \u0026ldquocesspool.\nVenice, the famed Italian lagoon city that lives off tourism, installed gates at two access

Phi Tourist Business Association, Watrapol Jantharo, said he was surprised when the closure was announced in March.\nHe said locals were under the impression that Maya Bay would only be closed to boats, while visitors would still be able to walk to the bay from the other side of the island.\n\u0026ldquoWe are not against protecting our environment, he said. \u0026ldquoWe know full well that Maya Bay is our important resource, like a rice field to a farmer, but we wish there are more communications about the government\u0026rsquos plan before the decision was made.\nThe government has set a limit of 2,000 tourists a day when the bay reopens \u0026mdash about half the current cap.
