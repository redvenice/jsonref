But it has been estimated that as few as ten will take off on each day.BA insists the ‘vast majority’ of the passengers due to travel had been rebooked with rival airlines. Others have been forced to accept refunds or fly at a later date.

The airline is threatening to strip striking pilots of key perks, including discounted flights. Similar tactics were used to punish striking cabin crew members.Mr Strutton said: ‘It is absolutely not correct to say we are seeking more than we previously did. \u0027We have compromised. We are seeking meaningful discussions, not acceptance by BA.‘BA has made no proposals for resolution but Balpa has.’The union had announced a return to the negotiating table hours after the Mail last week published pictures of Mr Strutton, who embarked on a luxury cruise the morning after announcing that BA pilots would go on strike. Images of the £141,000-a-year union boss strolling with his wife in Sardinia angered passengers whose travel plans have been left in disarray.Although the affected 450,000 passengers were offered a refund or a flight with a different airline, many have been forced to abandon their holidays. The disarray was compounded by a gaffe by the airline, which emailed many passengers telling them their flight had been cancelled and that ‘it is likely that you will not be able to travel’. BA was forced to send a follow-up email to many passengers telling them that, in fact, their flight would go ahead as planned.But by then holidaymakers and business travellers had acted on the first email and booked another flight.Adam French, consumer rights expert at Which?, said: ‘BA must do right by its passengers and ensure that anyone whose flight is cancelled is rerouted – with a rival airline if necessary – or refunded.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"Duchess alarms Buckingham Palace staff keeping agent lawyer manager acting days","story":"Share this articleMeghan Markle upsets royals by keeping secret Hollywood agent to run her career – The Sun"},{"url":null,"title":"Met Office teams Dutch weather officials batch storms","story":"Share this article Fortunately, there will be some more familiar ones too, however, including Dennis, Jan and Olivia.It is the fifth year the Met Office and Ireland’s Met Eireann have run the Name Our Storms campaign to raise awareness of severe weather before it hits.

I have covered the humanitarian consequences of war for three decades, but the sheer horror I witnessed during this conflict felt different.There was no end to the cruelty. The stream of suicide bombs, grenades, car bombs, and snipers was relentless. People were forced to watch their loved ones die in front of them. And when civilians did reach the point of escape, Isis would use them as human shields.But what really ripped at my heart was the plight of Isis children whose parents had been suicide bombers for the caliphate. I met one little girl called Khadija who was calling out for her mother, not realising that the burns all over her body were caused by her mother’s suicide bomb. As a mother, I will never understand an ideology that would induce you to hurt your own.The photo was taken near the ruins of the Great Mosque of al-Nuri, where Isis first proclaimed the caliphate in 2014. It was like Armageddon: buildings were smoking, bombs were dropping and there was sniper fire from all angles. When people fled, they were first checked for suicide bombs by Iraqi soldiers, men had to remove their shirts, and their names were checked for recorded Isis affiliation. Then they moved on to the trauma stabilisation point for emergency medical care, which was where I spent most of my time taking photographs.This little girl had fled with a group of women and children. She paused here momentarily. My fixer had gone missing so I couldn’t speak to her but I knew I had to take the shot. It was the picture of innocence amid war, a tragic juxtaposition of this tiny girl who should have been enjoying her childhood trapped in the middle of this catastrophic battle. She only stayed briefly. She looked to me as though she was in shock and she rejoined the group of women and children only a few moments later. This piece of rubble was the only place she could rest.I wanted my work in Mosul to help viewers to see these people as iniduals. It’s really hard when you talk about war and statistics and the numbers dying to remember the humanity behind the numbers. But when you focus on inidual faces, or a little girl sitting in debris with her head in her hands, it touches people on a universal emotional level, and gives viewers the possibility to connect. That’s always been my goal.Isis may have been defeated, but the ideology has not been eradicated. Some of the children I met already knew the meaning of martyrdom because their parents indoctrinated them from birth. I don’t know what happens to those kids.Hope is something I always look for, even within the worst devastation and despair. I didn’t see much of it in Mosul. Perhaps the closest thing came from the medics. They saved countless lives, and I know they were frustrated – the Iraqi government would not let them any nearer to the frontline, so they were forced to watch people die who they probably could have saved had they had just a couple more minutes. To me, they were angels amid the misery.Photojournalism is never about us, we’re just the link to the narratives of others. You have to feel something when you see things like this, but empathy can be as much of a curse as it is a blessing. I have always tried to be open about the trauma I’ve experienced, the PTSD, the meltdowns, but I think the thing that saves my sanity is my understanding that what I have experienced is nothing compared with what the people in my pictures have lived through.Training: Associate’s degree in applied science for photography, Art Institute of Fort Lauderdale.High point: “When I was asked to be godmother to a girl I had photographed during the Sierra Leone civil war.”Low point: “Losing my mother, sister and dearest friend, then losing my job at the Washington Post.

During probably the most important Commons debate in modern history, Rees-Mogg could be seen lolling insolently on the front benches like Kevin the Teenager, if Kevin the Teenager wore double-breasted suits at least 18 sizes too big for him. When challenged on his slouching by Caroline Lucas – who called his body language “contemptuous” – the MP did not sit up but smirked and adjusted his glasses, because, folks, that’s just the kind of guy he is.It’s true that politicians sometimes lean back on the benches to listen to the speakers positioned at the end of the row, but the House was not at all noisy when Rees-Mogg was smeared across the seat like a stain. The picture quickly went viral and his disrespectful reclining may well come to be a defining image of this tumultuous and, in certain respects, unprecedented period in Britain’s politics.The reclining figure is, of course, an acknowledged motif in art (particularly nude white women – more on this later), and this is why it was so easy for people to photoshop Rees-Mogg into various works. Here’s a rundown of some of the best or most iconic recliners in art, whether painting, sculpture or photography.I could have picked multiple Modigliani reclining nudes because there are many, but my personal favourite is the one most often referred to as Reclining Nude 3, which may or may not hang above my bed. The original (which does not hang above my bed) was sold for $170.4m in 2015. Pretty much all of them are just called Reclining Nude, which is confusing.Modigliani has come in for a lot of feminist criticism, because of the exaggerated way he painted the bodies of women. Whereas my take is that in this era of body positivity, why are we shaming his models for their brachiosaurus necks and hips like the crashing waves of surfers’ dreams? He also included pubic and underarm hair in his paintings, which was subversive and shocking at the time.Henri Matisse’s Odalisque Couchée aux Magnolias was once owned by David and Peggy Rockefeller before selling for around $80m in 2018, when the Rockefellers notoriously fell on hard times*. An odalisque was a concubine, and a popular subject for artists, who essentially exploited them by making them pose on the couch every single time they entered a room with a couch in it. Essentially, the odalisque nude is one of the most misogynist – and one of the most popular – tropes in art.(*The Rockefellers have not fallen on hard times.)Joel Goodman’s photograph of 2015 New Year’s Eve revelations in Manchester went viral and was compared to a Renaissance painting with the golden ratio typical of Leonardo Da Vinci’s work superimposed on it to prove the point. The star of the picture was the gentleman reclining drunkenly in the street, who was then Photoshopped into various famous art works and humorous settings. This remains a key example of the internet at its best.Goodman was humble about his blockbuster shot, telling the Manchester Evening News: “Mostly, a shot like that is just about being in the right place at the right time. I just happened to be in the right spot.”Seydou Keïta was a Malian photographer who developed an interest in photography when his furniture-maker father gave him a Kodak box camera with just eight snaps left on the roll. His work through the 1940s and 60s documents Malian society, and his rich portraiture of everyone from shopkeepers to politicians has resulted in posthumous recognition, including at the Met and Guggenheim. Nudes of white women dominate in art (you may have noticed) but Keïta’s subject is fully clothed, with a focused look and bold clashing patterns, which mirrors the pose West African women often adopt when comfortable and entertaining friends at home.One of his most well-known paintings, Lucian Freud’s Benefits Supervisor Sleeping shows Sue Tilley “sleeping”. Tilley is an exceptionally interesting person who spent the 1980s partying hard at infamous club night Taboo. She was in her 30s when Freud painted her in 1995 and she features in other works by him. Art dealer Brett Gorvy described Benefits Supervisor Sleeping as: “Recognised internationally as Freud’s masterpiece and proclaims him as one of the greatest painters of the human form in history, alongside Rembrandt and Rubens.”Oscar Wilde was a keen recliner, as perhaps the most famous photograph of him attests. As such, the rather quirky statute of him in Merrion Square, Dublin, has him leaning back on a rock, dressed in his best. (It’s part of a number of sculptures in the square designed by Danny Osborne in 1997.) It’s arguable that the smug look on Wilde’s face rivals that of Rees-Mogg’s in the Commons.Finally, perhaps the most famous example of a reclining figure in art is Adam lying back and touching the hand of God in the famous fresco on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. Michelangelo’s The Creation of Adam took four years to complete between 1508 and 1512 and depicts the narrative of the Book of Genesis. It is one of the most replicated images in the world and very available on cushions, mugs and key rings on Etsy. Adam’s position here is also very similar to when you can’t be arsed getting up, so you ask your dad to pass you your phone."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/303ba1db6d9e2500e60e208174beb4e25b9989bb/0_0_1889_1133/master/1889.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6764aed24cf7ea617e8453378d13b465","title":"british airways spurns olive branch from pilots union","story":"Balpa offers to call off strikes on 9 and 10 September but airline rejects proposal as ‘cynical’British Airways has rejected an olive branch from pilots’ union Balpa to hold talks and call off next week’s strikes, describing the offer as a “cynical” proposal that would cost the airline an additional £50m.Most of BA’s 4,300 pilots based at Heathrow and Gatwick are due to go on strike on Monday and Tuesday over pay and conditions for the first time in the airline’s history. While BA has not confirmed the number of cancellations, it is expected that only a small number of its more than 800 daily flights will take off.The union said it would call off the strikes on 9 and 10 September if BA would hold meaningful talks. A further strike is scheduled for 27 September, and more dates could follow. General secretary, Brian Strutton, said: “Our members’ resolve is very strong and they remain very angry with BA, but they also want to leave no stone unturned in trying to find a resolution to their dispute.”He said the new offer showed that pilots were “willing to be flexible but still stand united in getting a better deal”. However, BA rejected the proposal as too late and expensive. In a statement, the airline said: “We remain open to constructive talks with Balpa to resolve the pay negotiations, but we do not believe the union is acting in good faith by making an 11th-hour inflated proposal which would cost an additional £50m.“We at BA have acted with integrity through many months of negotiations. We and the union’s leaders agreed and shook on a deal on Monday 12 August only for the union to backtrack on that agreement and return with new and unrealistic demands.”Strutton and Balpa have denied shaking on a deal. Union rules would only allow negotiators to take proposals to a committee for recommendation, and then to a vote by pilots.The airline continued: “Balpa has cynically waited until we have helped the vast majority of customers with alternative travel arrangements, and our planning for a strike has reached a critical stage. Our customers need the certainty that Balpa will call off the strikes for good, not just for two days next week.”A small number of BA-operated flights are due to go ahead next week, with non-unionised pilots in management positions in the cockpit. BA has said it would also hire planes with pilots and crew to cover certain departures. Codeshare flights with other airlines may also operate with bigger planes and accommodate some passengers.However, the majority of passengers due to travel are believed to have had their travel plans altered. The airline suffered further embarrassment when contacting some people in error last month, while customers complained of being unable to confirm whether their flight was correctly cancelled or not."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ca47f9ce805612ef535a103a677fdc5a8d9acc69/0_284_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c4cf659d4f19600f9d683436c2d26d4e","title":"events dear boy events how politics is making markets volatile","story":"The goings-on in the White House and Westminster are having as much effect as economic indicatorsPolitical events have always had an impact on the world’s financial markets but rarely have they mattered quite so much as they do now.Take two current examples. The latest news from Germany on Thursday was dire, with a plunge in factory orders adding to the risk of a technical recession – two successive quarters of negative growth. Normally, this would be a reason to sell German shares but the Frankfurt stock market was up.Why? Because trade tensions between the US and China appear to have eased. Hopes of a deal when top-level talks resume in Washington next month boosted share prices on most bourses. Germany, an export-dependent economy, has more than most to gain from a trade truce.The London Stock Exchange was one market not to join in the party. That’s because the leading index of shares – the FTSE 100 – is dominated by companies that do most of their business overseas and whose sterling earnings rise as the pound goes down.Sterling is currently on the rise, not because there has been any good economic news but because investors think the government’s defeats in a series of parliamentary votes has reduced the chances of a no-deal Brexit. There was even a spike in the pound’s value when Jo Johnson, the prime minister’s brother, announced he was quitting. Sterling has become a barometer of Brexit.That’s not to say nothing else matters. Share prices are being supported by the belief that the US Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank are going to cut interest rates this month.But tweets from the White House and the numbers going through the ision lobbies at Westminster currently matter more. And that should be a reason for caution because Donald Trump is likely to take a tough line with China until the 2020 presidential election in November next year and Britain is heading for a general election, the outcome of which is impossible to predict. The sensitivity of financial markets to political events means they will remain volatile.Christine Lagarde looks to have got out of the International Monetary Fund just in time because an almighty storm is about to break over the financial assistance provided by the Washington-based organisation to troubled Argentina.The problems with the $57bn (£46bn) loan to shore up South America’s second-biggest economy are manifold. For a start, under its own rules the fund is not supposed to lend to countries with unsustainable debts unless a restructuring happens first. It broke that rule in Argentina’s case.As is usual, Argentina had to abide by strict conditions in order to qualify for IMF assistance. When these terms were not met, the IMF eased the conditions and lent more money to the government of president Mauricio Macri.The point of an IMF loan is to put struggling economies back on track. In Argentina’s case, much of it went to hedge funds that had previously lent recklessly to the country. Macri was a president the IMF liked the look of: a fiscal conservative and an inflation hawk. But he has not delivered. Inflation is rampant the economy is contracting and foreign debt is soaring. The size of the loan and the speed with which it has been disbursed raises the suspicion that the IMF is doing its best to keep its man in Buenos Aires in place.But Macri’s grip on power is loosening and in an attempt to stave off defeat in next month’s presidential election he has raised public sector salaries and cut taxes on consumption. Under the terms of the agreement with the IMF, Macri is supposed to be reducing Argentina’s budget deficit not increasing it.What does all this mean? It means Argentina is heading for a political crisis, an economic crisis and a debt crisis. It means that Argentina is heading for a default when it ought to have had its debt restructured. It means that the Fund has failed to learn from its mistakes. And it means that Lagarde’s successor – Kristalina Georgieva – will have questions to answer.Well, who would have thought it? Reports from the US suggest that the office rental company WeWork will have a price tag of $20bn rather than the $47bn previously mooted when it is floated on Wall Street.Potential investors have gleaned that WeWork is not an Uber or an Amazon with a disruptive business model. It is a real estate company that has lost the thick end of $3bn in the past three years."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f8127e1305f735a8ea5f16868dd912b0f635c0ff/483_28_1872_1123/master/1872.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bd4475449544654cc16ac1035e5a4046","title":"has the age of austerity really come to an end sajid javid","story":"Sajid Javid’s pledge to ‘bring about a decade of renewal’ comes under scrutinyDay-to-day spending on public services will grow by about £13.8bn between 2019−20 and 2020−21.

Javid rightly said the increase represented the largest increase in at least 15 years and was a turning point after years of spending cuts. He also topped up next year’s capital spending by £1.7bn. The financial crisis hurt British businesses and the financial sector. While the government used about £100bn of taxpayer funds to bail out banks (much of which has subsequently been recouped), the dramatic cuts in public spending meant ministers had reduced means to support households – the bedrock of spending in the economy – and the wider business community. At the time, Labour proposed maintaining public investment, arguing that with borrowing rates at historic lows in the post-crash period, there was an opportunity to improve the UK’s infrastructure on the cheap. With a Conservative-led government unprepared to step in, businesses remained nervous about the future and private investment failed to take off. Employment jumped to a record high, but without an increase in public or private investment, productivity stagnated and wages rose more slowly than inflation, leaving household incomes depressed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b543b76acfe24109c1164261c7d618c4f2bb3965/14_111_4744_2847/master/4744.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b8ea321220e3d50591811c8e998befc0","title":"londons 19 economic surge underlines divide with rest of england","story":"England and Wales GDP figures by ONS show West Midlands is second in growth leagueThe figures are likely to reinforce calls for the government to renew focus on its industrial strategy, which is struggling for impetus as Whitehall pours resources into Brexit preparations.Carys Roberts, chief economist at the IPPR thinktank and head of the Centre for Economic Justice, said: “The fact that growth from all regions of England has consistently lagged behind that from London is a clear indicator that something is wrong in the economy. Such regional inequalities hold back productivity, wages and people’s standard of living and quality of life.“We need a new industrial strategy act setting out clear goals that focus on putting this right. We should be building high-tech industrial clusters around our many world-leading research-based universities. And we should set up a new national investment bank to invest in infrastructure, innovation and business growth across England.”A flagging financial services sector was largely to blame for London’s zero growth rate , having been affected by Brexit uncertainty that has resulted in thousands of jobs leaving the capital’s financial district. According to the ONS data, London’s financial services sector has been in recession since the third quarter of 2017. London’s building industry has also proved sensitive to Brexit uncertainty, with a host of projects mothballed. However, the downturns in two key London industries have not reduced the sizeable gap with other parts of the country.The worst-affected region most recently, according to the new figures, was the south-west. Its economy shrank in the last three months of 2018 compared with a year earlier. The figures also show that the east and south-west of England suffered technical recessions, or two successive quarters of negative growth, last year.Representatives of the “northern powerhouse” in Manchester and the mayor of the West Midlands, Andy Street, have called for greater powers and more funds for infrastructure projects, including the much-delayed and overbudget HS2 railway line, which is intended to run from London to Birmingham, then Manchester and Leeds. However, the future of HS2 is in doubt after the government confirmed this week that the first phase of the line could be delayed by five years while the cost of the entire route has risen from £55.7bn to up to £88bn.The Welsh economy grew in the second half of 2018, despite fears that steelworks closures and threats to the livelihoods of sheep farmers would harm the country’s overall economic performance. Construction was the main driver of Wales’s economic performance, while manufacturing output fell.Economists expect the West Midlands to drop back this year as the dramatic fall in car purchases and production takes its toll on the vehicle industry. Much of the construction boom in Birmingham and the surrounding area has also followed government assurances that HS2 would be operational in the middle of the next decade.The car industry represents one of England’s biggest economic strengths outside of London, with Nissan operating a key site in Sunderland, Toyota having a presence in Derby, Mini running a plant in Oxford and Vauxhall operating sites in Ellesmere Port and Luton.The ONS said it planned to continue using VAT data to build a more comprehensive picture of economic growth in the UK, although Scotland and Northern Ireland produce their own data, using a different methodology."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b996e2145430486ed03aa6c573c0e33e8aab5fd9/0_45_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=422857530e5a7b96126c289c2671ada8","title":"wework shares ipo value halved","story":"WeWork, the fast-growing office rental company, is considering cutting the value of its upcoming share offering in half as it faces growing skepticism over its business model and corporate governance.The nine-year-old company has shaken up the office market by retooling office rentals by adding beer taps, more potted plants and foosball tables to buildings it now runs in 111 cities around the world.We Co, WeWork’s parent company, had been expected to go for an initial public offering (IPO) that valued the business at $47bn but according to multiple reports it is now considering a price tag of $20bn.We Co is the latest in a series of high profile and heavily loss-making companies to go public.

At the same time the company lost $2.9bn in the last three years.The prospectus also warned: “We have a history of losses and, especially if we continue to grow at an accelerated rate, we may be unable to achieve profitability at a company level … for the foreseeable future.”According to the Wall Street Journal, Neumann has cashed out more than $700m in shares and debt from the company, an unusual move for a founder ahead of a share sale.The IPO prospectus also revealed that Neumann was paid $5.9m for the use of the word we. Ahead of the IPO, WeWork rebranded itself as We Co, a move that led the company to pay the cash to We Holdings, a company controlled by the co-founder as “fair market value” for the trademark.This week the company disclosed Neumann had paid the company back, “at Adam’s direction”.“Adam also owned the rights to the ‘We’ trademark, which the firm decided they must own and paid the founderCEO $5.9 million for the rights. The rights to a name nearly identical to the name of the firm where he’s the founderCEO and largest shareholder. YOU. CAN’T. MAKE. THIS. S---. UP,” wrote Scott Galloway, a New York University marketing professor.Elson said there were a number of worrying factors in We Co’s IPO prospectus, not least its dual class share structure, which would allow the company’s founders to retain control despite having sold the majority of shares to investors. Such structures are common in tech IPOs.“These structures mean shareholders are powerless to deal with any kind of mismanagement,” said Elson. “At some point the market has to say enough.”We Co had been planning too debut in September and its shareholder roadshow could start as early as next week. It is unclear whether the company will push ahead with the IPO this month or decide to delay.We Co declined to comment.The property firm is the latest in a new generation of tech companies to run into problems as they seek to go public. Uber and Lyft also attracted sky-high valuations ahead of their IPOs only to see their share prices collapse as investors questioned their ability to overcome their huge losses.Uber’s share price hit an all-time low of $30.70 a share this week and its market value has fallen from $82bn to $55bn since its IPO in May."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aa3daf184563f57815dd9b833b093ae8f3ce9c47/0_158_4368_2621/master/4368.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=514165f950075c7864f6f5e47782fc2e","title":"the soul of perpignan how a gypsy community halted the bulldozers","story":"The French city wanted to demolish large portions of its St Jacques neighbourhood as part of a wider development plan. It had not reckoned with its residentsPhotography by Jesco DenzelNever schedule a demolition in St Jacques for the afternoon. Nothing much stirs in the morning in this mainly Gypsy neighbourhood of Perpignan, south-west France, but by 4pm on 27 July last year, when the diggers turned up at Place du Puig, the locals were up – and full of fire.Sixty of them, furious at what they saw as mystifying recent demolitions in other parts of the neighbourhood, and worried about a conspiracy to force the Gypsy community out of the heart of Perpignan, refused to let the workman pull another lever.Their leader was Alain Gimenez, 54, a former St Jacques bad boy with two nicknames. The first, Nounours (“Teddy Bear”), nods to his cuddly frame, but his fierce and deep-tanned face exudes the charismatic vehemence that fits his second, harder moniker: Lino.“We’ve told the supervisor that if they don’t stop, things are going to get nasty,” Gimenez said.Then, in November 2018, two buildings collapsed in the Noailles district of nearby Marseille, killing eight people and provoking international horror at poor housing conditions in major French cities. The Marseille disaster underlined the urgency in Perpignan, and the city pressed ahead with its plan to demolish 483 buildings in St Jacques by 2024, and build 240 new ones.It did not, it seems, reckon with the Gypsies.The assistant mayor Olivier Amiel, who until recently was in charge of the regeneration, calls them “the soul of Perpignan”. The medieval street grid of St Jacques is the Gypsies’ raucous enclave, where they make up roughly three-quarters of a population somewhere between 3,000 and 7,000, depending on who you ask: the census can’t accurately assess the neighbourhood.It is not till late afternoon that the streets of St Jacques come to life, shuttered premises opening up to reveal bars and corner shops, overspilling with chatter in the local dialect of gitan (a form of Catalan mixed with the Romani language caló). “It’s another universe up there,” a lifelong Perpignan resident tells me. “You have to switch off that western, inidualistic, orderly part of your brain.”Place du Puig, a lively square at the top of a hill, is the heart of the neighbourhood. The bulldozers were trained specifically on Ilot Puig (“the Puig block”), a clump of nine buildings that was already earmarked for the wrecking ball after the collapse of a social centre here in 2006, in which one person died and 13 children barely escaped.The locals had other ideas. They didn’t like the vagueness of the city’s regeneration plans – the fuzzy timelines, the lack of information about prospective rents, and above all the total lack of construction to date on 50 other buildings in St Jacques that had already been bulldozed. Was all the urbanism talk emanating from city hall of greater mixité (social mix) and “de-densification” really just a euphemism for de-Gypsification?Rooted in paranoia or not, the anger led to an unlikely coalition. Gypsy representatives teamed up with counterparts in the neighbourhood’s north African population, with whom there had previously been little love lost after a violent confrontation between members of the two communities in 2005. They were also joined by an assortment of local middle-class groups who are keen to preserve St Jacques’ ragtag architectural heritage and carnival atmosphere: the city is bidding for Unesco world heritage classification, a process that could not be seen to sideline the city’s Gypsies.So when the protesters blocked the bulldozers and barricaded the building site, the wider coalition quickly rallied in support. Spooked by the growing numbers, and by the prospect of full-blown riots, the city’s prefect froze demolition.Something significant had happened. For the first time, the normally apolitical, insular Gypsies had successfully campaigned and cooperated with outside groups. St Jacques was awake.The thing outsiders tend to focus on in St Jacques is the rubbish. It lines the gutters: broken bottles, ringpulls, chocolate-bar wrappers, plaster shards. But the neighbourhood overflows in other ways too. Laundry hangs off the balconies, rumba music courses out of the occasional top window. Names – Bombom, Peto, Elisabeth, Anais – are scrawled in permanent marker on doors and walls, giving them a veneer of love and friendship mementoes. Women pushing buggies look almost like orthodox Jews in full-length black shirts, except for the cardigans covered in sequinned slogans. Four-year-olds zip past on motorised minibikes. A cool-looking guy with a guitar says hello: a member of Perpignan Gypsy supergroup Tekameli.The area is incongruous, shambolic, exciting – and it is this unique ambiance that St Jacques’ defenders want to preserve. From its vantage point on the hill, you can look down over the rather gloomy historic centre of Perpignan, a raffish and secretive city caught between republican France and Catalonia. Generally marginalised and free from most multinational chain stores, it is only Visa Pour l’Image, the annual photojournalism festival, that puts the city on the international map.As well as the ambiance, the collective wants to preserve St Jacques’ built environment: its tumbledown stacks of rough-hewn townhouses, which prop each other up on 14th-century earth foundations.“What was built wasn’t exceptional – it’s not palaces or anything – but it has an overall sense of history, where every edifice has its own particularities,” says Jean-Bernard Mathon, head of the Association for the Preservation of Roussillon Artistic and Historic Heritage.Mathon’s group wants to see renovation, not demolition. It is aghast at the prospect of the brusque, Hausmannian overhaul proposed by the government, which is funding nearly half of the €100m, with the town hall and regional bodies providing much of the rest.The locals don’t trust the authorities either. At the end of the gully of Rue de Quinze Degrés, a series of concrete blocks shields a building site, with a matrix of wooden beams bracing the buildings on either side. An irate-looking pensioner on his porch shakes his walking stick at it: “It’s been like that for a year, and they do nothing.” Does he trust the municipality to renovate? “They’re bastards!”The problem for the heritage brigade is the Gypsy community’s own lack of unequivocal support. Whereas the wider collective want to see the decrepit buildings renovated instead of demolished, many Gypsies’ stance is less cut and dried. “Nick” Gimenez (real name Jean-François), the uncle of Alain Gimenez, is one of the community patriarchs. He says his community would be happy to accept demolition as long as new social housing replaces it as promised. “We’re not bothered about heritage,” he says. “The question for us if that, if they demolish, they rehouse us immediately.”This bet-hedging gives the impression that the Gypsy community sees the heritage campaigners as useful allies in a bigger battle: to keep control of the neighbourhood.It is undeniable that St Jacques is a refuge for Gypsies. And it has always been a place for the excluded. A Middle Ages leper colony, it became the Jewish ghetto after the expulsion of Jews from Spanish Roussillon in 1492. Some current inhabitants claim Gypsies have been on the hill, cresting where the turreted 13th-century Catholic church stands, for centuries. Recorded history suggests most families arrived in the 1940s after the Vichy regime banned nomadism.The community’s isolation truly began in the 1960s and 1970s, as the historic Gypsy trades – horse-breeding, scrap-metal-collecting, knife-sharpening – fell out of favour. A kind of underclass alienation started to creep in, cutting them off from other nearby Gypsy enclaves, as well as their ethnic heritage. “It’s not that joyful nomadic rootlessness,” emphasises David Cook, a music producer who lives in St Jacques. “Where you’re always free to move and discover something else.”Keeping them further locked into this dependency is their dysfunctional relationship with Perpignan officialdom. There has been a longstanding practice of hiring influential community members for key town-hall roles: Nick Gimenez, for instance, organised St Jacques street-cleaning for several decades.People across Perpignan allege that this electoral malpractice continued in less blatant form under Alduy’s son, Jean-Paul, mayor from 1993 to 2009. L’Express also reported how, following the 1995 municipal elections, St Jacques was awash in brand-new scooters and fridges offered in exchange for the community vote. Jean-Paul Alduy today dismisses the idea as “completely crazy” he says some Gypsies used their allocation de rentrée scolaire, a state benefit for the September return to school, to purchase these goods.“For them, public money doesn’t come from the state. It’s always something that comes from the town hall,” he says. That was, he says, the origin of the rumour it was the town hall who had bequeathed the new swag. “One has to admit that everybody has always practised clientelism here,” says Amiel.Some of the St Jacques Gypsies, without true democratic representation through which to improve living conditions, have sometimes bridled at this deal: in the 2014 municipal elections, Nick Gimenez abruptly switched his political endorsement to the far-right Front National, a party not exactly known for its love of Gypsy culture, allegedly over a dispute with Jean-Marc Pujol, the current mayor, regarding Gimenez’s annual party at the Visa Pour l’Image festival.This toxic interdependency of Perpignan’s political class and the Gypsy community has so far hindered true reform in the neighbourhood. Even over the Ilot Puig block, there were Machiavellian forces at play. The French alternative news site Mediapart reported that the local representative for the République En Marche party, Romain Grau, who is the current frontrunner for the city’s 2020 mayoral elections, had encouraged the St Jacques collective to protest.Olivier Amiel, the assistant mayor, is adamant that the pas de deux between city and Gypsies must come to an end. “If the community continues to participate in clientelism, it’s suicidal in view of the social and economic situation,” he says in the Café de la Loge, across the street from the 14th-century town hall. “And if we do it, it’s criminal: we’d be guilty of killing a community.”As head of urbanism, Amiel has been the figurehead of the regeneration plans. It has made him a pariah in St Jacques, but his determination is obvious. The protest “has become something partisan, political, clan-based and even family-based”, he says, sipping a café noisette.He is not afraid to name names: he accuses Alain Gimenez of rousing the community in revenge for being refused a job with the municipality. Gimenez rejects the accusation: he insists that far from wanting a job, he turned down several job offers at town hall that he says were offered to him after the protests to buy him off.The 40-year-old Amiel, spindly and debonair in a dark suit, grey hair threaded through his black curls, likes to present himself in the post-Blair progressive mould as the bright young reformer (though he has been recently stripped of his powers after announcing his intention to run for mayor next year.) On his Twitter account, he fanboyishly outs himself as “the only French politician supported by Bret Easton Ellis”. After visiting Detroit, another destitute city that tried to bounce back, he wrote a manifesto for “positive gentrification”.Judging by a video he produced for the municipality, his vision of St Jacques reborn is the stuff of regeneration projects Europe-wide: lots of sanitised, glass-balconied, medium-density flats. When asked about the lack of reconstruction so far in St Jacques, Amiel says the demolitions must happen first. He claims that renovating the entire neighbourhood would be too expensive, citing an average price of €3,000 per square metre to overhaul the social housing, which would be too much for Gypsy tenants living in poverty to recoup in rent. Demolition and reconstruction would be half the cost, he insists.Besides, he says, beyond preventing other Marseille-style house tragedies, he sees regeneration as a broader social project: a way of ending the ghettoisation of St Jacques and the permissive misrule that he thinks has spread in the neighbourhood.Amiel proposes greater mixité – mixing – as the solution. You wonder how feasible this is. The insularity of many Gypsies here, which is reinforced by the wider prejudice toward its population across southern Europe, has a powerful social gravity all of its own. Aspects of Gypsy culture don’t mix easily with mainstream French culture. For example, girls are often pulled out of school early to ensure they don’t mix with boys, preserving their virginity for marriage. Many of the St Jacques Gypsies say these practices are a part of a culture that nourishes them with an irreplaceable solidarity.“We have a way of life that, for us, is better than yours,” Alain Gimenez tells me. “I say this to French people: go to a retirement home and you’ll see no Gypsy in there. We keep our old people with us.”This insularity even manifests itself physically on the streets, in what David Cook calls the Gypsies’ “strange relationship between inside and outside. The insides are spick and . But all this rubbish must leave this clean space immediately – so out of the window!” The Gypsy community has established safe boundaries in the neighbourhood, hence the acute suspicion about the town hall’s intentions, particularly the idea of non-Gypsies moving into new apartments. “There’s a kind of critical mass of population that if they fall below it, if it becomes too diluted, their lifestyle is threatened,” says Cook.To break down this entrenchment, the Gypsy community will need to be convinced that the St Jacques plans will benefit them. That is where the town hall’s communication strategy comes in. The official documents are opaque, full of complex figures and acronyms that are difficult to understand for anyone. Beyond the number of rooms, there is little functional detail about the new housing to excite any future inhabitants. Amiel mentions a series of public consultations, but they have been poorly attended.Word of mouth remains the key medium, via community figureheads such as Gimenez and local evangelical pastors. But that leaves plenty of scope for misinterpretation and manipulation.Jean-Bernard Mathon, of the heritage brigade, is suspicious of Perpignan’s master regeneration plan.Renovation, he insists, is not being properly explored. He believes it can be done cheaper than the town hall’s estimates, and has asked for an independent evaluation. He also disputes the idea that his group is solely motivated by a middle-class preoccupation with preserving the past: “Beyond the questions of demolition or renovation, you have to take into account the psychological aspect – people are terrorised by demolition.”Pujol, the mayor, insists the city would prefer not to demolish, and instead to sell expropriated properties to people who would fix them up. “But there are no buyers,” he says. “The reality, which no one wants to recognise, is that no one wants to buy in St Jacques.”This may be changing. As Pujol admits, there is a small real-estate buzz at the neighbourhood’s edge a Paris property company is rumoured to be canvassing residents about selling their houses.What is more, nearly two-thirds of the 236 new buildings planned for St Jacques will be sold on the open market. The remaining 92 units are social housing, but many of the Gypsies believe that it in reality they are destined to be student accommodation: the University of Perpignan’s huge new Campus Mailly development is bringing 1,350 law students right next door to St Jacques in 2020. Amiel denies this, saying the floorplan of the proposed social housing is too large for student use.Whatever the truth, Perpignan’s stealth-gentrification conspiracy theory has taken hold: an insidious plan to raise property values in a dilapidated but historic section of Perpignan while slowly siphoning off its populace, with no one responsible but “the market”.Abruptly, in April this year, a kind of murky light broke over the Ilot Puig. The Office Public de L’Habitat Public (OPH), the French body responsible for social housing, announced that bids for Perpignan’s redevelopment had gone out to tender – and also said the option of renovation is back on the table.“We’ve won,” says Alain Gimenez at an outdoor cafe table at Place Cassanyes, St Jacques’ other major square. Nearby, Nasser, the main representative for the collective’s north Africans, is simultaneously sorting out Gimenez’s internet subscription on the phone and selling globe artichokes from a car boot.However, it also turns out that Gimenez and Nasser have been offered jobs with the OPH – and both accepted. Gimenez previously insisted he had refused multiple job offers during the campaign. Does this mean he has now been bought?No, he says, slapping the table – those who’ve suggested this have got it wrong. “They don’t know how we came to an agreement. We gave the town hall two conditions for the Ilot Puig: one, you renovate the houses there. And two, it’s us who’ll take care of the work and decide who gets to live there. I said to them: don’t try greasing my palms, or I’ll have the mayor for breakfast.” He waves to his grandchildren, who are passing by in a car.The OPH declined to comment on the circumstances and conditions of Gimenez and Nasser’s hiring. The town hall did not respond to questions on the matter.Whatever deal they agreed, if any, the fate of Ilot Puig remains uncertain the results of the tender will be announced in September. Gimenez never argued unequivocally for renovation: could he just be claiming it as a possibility now in order to declare a “victory” and save face with the rest of the collective? And what of the future of the rest of St Jacques? Gimenez claims he will not stop fighting the demolitions – “No, never. The fight will carry on until Pujol has left, and maybe under the next mayor” – but now that he’s working for a government housing agency intrinsically involved in the redevelopment, it’s hard to see how that would work.Let’s hope he means what he says. The Ilot Puig campaign looked like a shot at self-determination for the wider Gypsy community, not just those members who enjoy privileged access to power. If the leaders of the protest abandon it for preferential treatment, this brief window for civic engagement could quickly slam shut. Whether St Jacques is regenerated or renovated, the choice should be the Gypsies’, free from manipulation by ambitious politicians or from the short-term demands of the daily grind.For now, the informal nightlife economy continues to thrive in full view of the old police station, the town hall is still claiming it wants to save the Gypsies, and the mantra of the TV show The Wire continues to apply in Perpignan as it does in cities across the world: it’s all in the game.Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a81f6095b30c2b32191efe928aff6e91928ef53d/0_0_2000_2500/master/2000.jpg?width=480\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aee3e6e9cb4de5c29f98ce28922be1ce 480w","title":"the guardian view on testing four year olds wrong again","story":"Accountability in education is important. Politicians, acting on the public’s behalf, are right to seek evidence that schools are delivering a good service. So there is nothing wrong, in principle, with gathering information in order to track progress. The problem with the government’s new baseline assessment of four-year-olds – being trialled over the next six weeks in around half of English primary schools, and intended to replace the tests previously taken by seven-year-olds – is the idea’s execution.First, as campaigners have pointed out, the first few weeks of school are not the right time. Some children will only just have had their fourth birthday, hardly any have turned five, and those without older siblings are in a new setting for the first time. Teachers can give more rounded and informative pictures of children when they know them better, which is why many would prefer to stick to existing arrangements, whereby a less formal assessment is carried out towards the end of the reception year (and moderated by the local authority).Beyond such practical objections, the overriding impression is of a lack of imagination. Yes, literacy and numeracy are essential, but there must be more to 21st-century education than reading and counting, and more to assessment than yet more time-limited tests. When the crisis in teacher recruitment and retention and the damaging impact of budget cuts are both recognised at the highest level of government, and the achievement gap between advantaged and disadvantaged pupils remains stubbornly wide, it seems cack-handed at best for ministers to begin a new school year by setting yet more data-entry homework for staff. They, and the nation’s four-year-olds, deserve better."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/389c68006cbf8f9d86bbce718185fb3ea00ac124/528_114_3939_2364/master/3939.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=da1d92ab6e13a0147ca6d26d418ed339","title":"astronauts breast milk chewed gum being human in pictures","story":"Being Human, a new permanent gallery at Wellcome Collection in London, explores what it means to be human in the 21st century.

The best way to both preserve shareholder value in the transition and align with climate change goals will be to focus on low-cost projects that will deliver the highest returns,” Grant said.The report contradicts the public rhetoric of many oil executives who have claimed to support the Paris goals and vowed to invest in renewable energy projects.A spokesperson for Shell said: “We agree that the world is not moving fast enough to tackle climate change. As the energy system evolves, so is our business, to provide the mix of products that our customers need.”A report from the UN Environment Programme has revealed that global investment in renewable energy projects over the last decade is on track to reach $2.6tn by the end of this year.The investment boom has almost quadrupled the world’s total renewable energy capacity from 414GW at the end of 2009 to an expected total of 1,650GW by the end of this year.Inger Andersen, the executive director of the UN Environment Programme, said: “Investing in renewable energy is investing in a sustainable and profitable future, as the last decade of incredible growth in renewables has shown.”The report, co-authored by BloombergNEF, showed that solar power projects led the rise in renewables. Solar power attracted around half of the total investment in renewables over the last decade and has grown from 25GW at the beginning of 2010 to an expected 638GW by the close of 2019.Jon Moore, the chief executive of BloombergNEF, said the sharp falls in the cost of electricity from wind and solar over recent years has “transformed the choice facing policymakers”.“These technologies were always low carbon and relatively quick to build. Now, in many countries around the world, either wind or solar is the cheapest option for electricity generation,” he said.However, Andersen warned that governments cannot be complacent about the growth of renewable energy if they hope to meet the UN’s climate targets."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a6fa4232402b9309692236b262013d1eb33edde8/0_2437_4160_2495/master/4160.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d0500cc0a7374fce46312aa531b7fa4e","title":"statement earrings and blue lipstick street style from ghanas chale wote in pictures","story":"The annual festival of arts that took place in Accra last month puts self-expression at its heart.

Before Crazy Rich Asians, Lim worked in TV. Chiarelli has hit movies on his résumé including the 2009 Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds romcom The Proposal.Crazy Rich Asians, which made $238m at the box office, is credited with uncovering a new target audience. Its sequels will be based on two other books by Kevin Kwan, China Rich Girlfriend and Rich People Problems.Lim reportedly rejected an offer from Chiarelli to split his fee, voicing concern that producers viewed her ability to provide a distinct cultural sensibility as her only value to the screenplay.She said Chiarelli had been “incredibly gracious” but insisted her pay “shouldn’t be dependent on the generosity of the white guy writer”.The issue of pay gaps, often between genders, has been battering Hollywood.

There is some poignancy and dramatic edge to Smith’s disapproving mien.Before Downton and Gosford Park, there was this “country house” role for Maggie Smith, with John Banville’s adaptation of Elizabeth Bowen’s novel set in 1920s Ireland as the Anglo-Irish ascendancy becomes the descendancy. With subtle melancholy and restraint, Smith plays Lady Naylor, presiding over an estate in County Cork that feels increasingly embattled as Ireland prepares to break free of the British.Smith plays Charlotte Bartlett in Ruth Prawer Jhabvala’s adaptation of EM Forster’s novel, directed by James Ivory. It is a small, but rather potent part as the wary and disapproving chaperone to her yearning younger cousin Lucy Honeychurch (Helena Bonham Carter), as they tour primly around Italy, fetching up in Florence. Charlotte is annoyed that their rooms do not have a “view” of the Arno, and her character epitomises the ironic inability to see the passionate possibilities laid out before her.Based on the life of the great dramatist Sean O’Casey, this movie has the Australian star Rod Taylor as the man himself and Smith as the demure librarian who falls for him, inspires his creative and theatrical career and then selflessly lets him fly free of her. A conventional romantic turn.Very often, Smith finds herself in Werther’s Original movies in which she is condescendingly required to be a feisty oldster. This period drama is a cut above. Judi Dench and Smith play two sisters living on the Cornish coast in the 1930s who take in a mysterious Polish stranger. His handsome brooding looks unlock dormant emotions in them both. A strong, yet nuanced performance from Smith.A complex, unrelatable role for Smith in Jhabvala’s cool, measured adaptation of the Jean Rhys novel, directed by Ivory. She plays Lois, a painter in 1920s Paris, married to a handsome art dealer (Alan Bates), a philanderer who invites a beautiful penniless young woman (Isabelle Adjani) to stay with them – for the purposes of seducing her. Lois has to become resentfully complicit in this dysfunctional non-love triangle.An eccentric comedy from George Harrison’s Handmade Films is the first of two pairings for Smith and the film’s screenwriter-star Michael Palin. He is the unworldly clergyman tasked with setting up a mission for “fallen women” in Edwardian London’s East End. Smith is the sexually voracious Lady Isabel Ames, to whose wealthy husband the vicar must apply for charitable funding. Lady Isabel effectively promises to open her husband’s chequebook in return for a night of passion with the handsome vicar.A rare but special Shakespeare on screen for Smith, who plays the hated hunchback king’s mother, the Duchess of York, opposite Ian McKellen’s Richard in Richard Loncraine’s Mosleyite-fascist staging. In some ways, it is another grande dame outing, but Smith brings to it a fierce energy and alienated anger – with a style perhaps borrowed from Queen Mary of Teck.This was the film, adapted from Graham Greene and directed by George Cukor, in which Smith first established her Wilde-Wodehousian “aunt” persona: at just 38 years old, she is playing a formidable old lady of around twice that age. It is a wacky adventure mystery in which Alec McCowen plays a bewildered chap who finds himself finagled by his mysterious Aunt Augusta (Smith) into her plan to rescue her former lover from a kidnap plot. A broad comic performance.Smith held her own against one of the biggest alpha-gorillas of stage or screen, Laurence Olivier. In that distant age, he played Shakespeare’s Othello in blackface and with a rolling, booming bass voice, while Smith played his wronged love, Desdemona, with mellifluous dignity and grace.Smith gives one of her blue-chip “aunt” performances in this excellent, underrated and under-remembered Henry James adaptation, directed by Agnieszka Holland. She is the faintly daffy Aunt Lavinia, who derives a weirdly vicarious excitement from her niece’s gentleman caller, and who – as we might say now – lives for the drama.A little gem of a turn from Smith (paired Rod Taylor) in this ensemble movie, scripted by Terence Rattigan, directed by Anthony Asquith and set in the VIP lounge of an airport. She is the mousy-yet-devoted Miss Mead, secretly in love with her employer, troubled businessman Les Mangrum, and willing to take risks to help him out of a jam.Smith gave a witty and good-natured spin on her schoolmarmish persona with this commanding performance as the teacher Minerva McGonagall in the Harry Potter franchise – and it was in the first film that she was most conspicuous. She is Hogwarts’ deputy headmistress (later to be promoted), Gryffindor house head, transfiguration professor, quidditch enthusiast and member of the Order of the Phoenix, who is to play a decisive role in Harry’s final battle with the forces of darkness. Potter is what lasered Smith into the minds of children all over the world.This adaptation of the Brian Moore novel is a delicately detailed, beautifully acted drama in which Smith delivers a star performance. She is the tragic spinster in 1950s Dublin who imagines that the attentions being paid to her by Bob Hoskins’s brash businessman mean that she is on the verge of a great romance. Perhaps it doesn’t have the lightness and waspish asperity that we prize in a Smith performance, but this is fine work.There is a certain type of online debate among Smith fans as to which is the latest film in which she is conventionally fanciable. This topic – vulgar and irrelevant as it is – has found a consensus with A Private Function, written by Alan Bennett with Smith on fiercely charismatic form as Joyce, the demanding wife of shy, retiring chiropodist Gilbert, played by Palin. In the postwar era of rationing, they abduct a pig being secretly kept by grand townsfolk for a special civic feast to celebrate the wedding of Princess Elizabeth and Prince Philip. “Mrs Rhoades’s ingrowing toenail has turned the corner,” says Gilbert over supper. “Please Gilbert,” says Smith acidly, “please don’t bring feet to the table.”Smith gave one of her greatest late-period performances as herself in this glorious documentary: a kind of alpha-league “dame-off” with Judi Dench, Joan Plowright and Eileen Atkins. These great stars sit round a table and discuss life, love, the stage, the screen, the way the profession has developed for women over the years – and the appalling men they have had to deal with. Smith almost upstages everyone with the revelation that her delivery is modelled on Kenneth Williams.One of Smith’s funniest, most self-aware performances – which won her a best supporting actress Oscar – came in this portmanteau all-star movie, adapted by Neil Simon from his Broadway stage play. She is Diana, a British actress returning from a catastrophic awards ceremony, desolate about her career and her “lavender” marriage to Sidney, a closeted gay man played by Michael Caine: “I’ve aged Sidney. I’m getting lines in my face. I look like a brand-new steel-belted radial tyre.”This was the film that inspired the Downton Abbey TV spinoff and gave Smith the prototype for the smallscreen role that helped make her famous all over the world. In this country-house mystery, written by Julian Fellowes and directed by Robert Altman, she is the formidable Countess of Trentham, a visitor to the great house. (In Downton, she has more or less the same persona, but promoted to quasi-chatelaine status as the Dowager Countess of Grantham.) Smith’s character delivers weapons-grade putdowns and overwhelming patrician zingers.A colossal performance from Smith as Miss Shepherd, the elderly homeless lady who chivvied Alan Bennett into letting her live in a van parked outside his house in London. She deploys the classic piercing stare of disapproval, the pinched lips and bird-like head movements as Miss Shepherd assesses the deeply unsatisfactory nature of everything around her.This one really is the crème de la crème of Smith films. Give this film to a cinemagoer at an impressionable age, or any age, and he or she is Dame Maggie’s for life. It is her classic role, which she immortalised at the age of 35 and which won her the best actress Oscar: imperious, haughty, vulnerable, unworldly, romantic, intellectual and with a distinctive hold over men. The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie (the scansion of the title usually means the “Prime” and “Miss” are over emphasised really, the last three words should be hit equally hard) is adapted by Jay Presson Allen from her own stage-play version of the Muriel Spark novel. It is the story of a charismatic Edinburgh schoolmistress (“schoolteacher” really won’t do here) with unorthodox – and indeed worrying – views and a dominating personality. Successive generations have felt as if they were Brodie’s pupils, falling under her spell.Actors playing nightmarish versions of themselves in cinema - ranked!Michael Caine\u0027s best films - ranked!The 10 best Glenn Close movies - ranked!Tom Cruise - top 20 movies - ranked!Judi Dench - every film - ranked!Ryan Gosling movies - ranked!10 best Hugh Grant films - ranked!Nicole Kidman’s top 10 films - ranked!The best and the worst Jennifer Lopez films - ranked!All Helen Mirren\u0027s 61 movies - ranked!Robert Redford\u0027s greatest screen roles - ranked!Winona Ryder\u0027s 20 best films - ranked!Movie Santa Clauses - ranked!Maggie Smith\u0027s 20 best films – ranked!Jason Statham - every film - ranked!Emma Thompson\u0027s best films - ranked!Biopics trashed by families, friends and fans - ranked!Purr evil: cats in movies with hidden agendas - ranked!Dog weepie movies - ranked!Top 20 J-horror films - ranked!Movies that have grossed more than $1bn - ranked!Palme d\u0027Or winners - ranked!The scariest horror films ever - ranked!The best Shakespeare films - ranked!The 10 best movie shark performances - ranked!The best Stephen King movies\u0026nbsp - ranked!From Trolls to Transformers: toy films – ranked!Worst holidays in cinema - ranked!James Bond on film – 007\u0027s best and worst movies - ranked!The 20 best Marvel films - ranked!Top 10 Merchant Ivory films - ranked!Pixar - every film ever made - ranked!Planet of the Apes - the best and worst of the movies - ranked!Star Wars - every film - ranked!The 20 best music documentaries - ranked!The weirdest Brits performances - ranked!Game of Thrones - every episode - ranked!Oscar nominees - the weirdest ever - ranked!Oscar snubs - the 20 greatest ever - ranked!The biggest Rock \u0026amp Roll Hall of Fame snubs ever - ranked!Super Bowl half-time shows - the 10 greatest - ranked!The best X Factor finalists - ranked!From Niall Horan\u0027s toast to Russell Crowe’s jockstrap: celebrity auction items - ranked!All Abba\u0027s UK singles - ranked!Every one of Madonna\u0027s 78 singles - ranked!Kate Bush – every UK single - ranked!Missy Elliott\u0027s solo singles – ranked!Queen\u0027s 50 UK singles - ranked!Taylor Swift\u0027s singles - ranked!The Who: their UK singles - ranked!Black Sabbath - every album - ranked!David Byrne – (almost) all of his albums - ranked!Miles Davis\u0027s 20 greatest albums – ranked!Lil Wayne\u0027s albums - ranked!Every Mercury prize-winning album - ranked!Joni Mitchell\u0027s albums – ranked!The Rolling Stones – every album - ranked!10 best Paul Simon albums - ranked!Bruce Springsteen\u0027s albums - ranked!Kanye West – every album - ranked!Stevie Wonder\u0027s albums - ranked!20 greatest breakup songs ever - ranked!Aphex Twin\u0027s best songs - ranked!Barry Manilow – all his greatest songs - ranked!Cher\u0027s 30 greatest songs - ranked!The 30 greatest Disney songs –\u0026nbspranked!Elton John\u0027s 50 greatest songs - ranked!From Drake to Wet Wet Wet: songs with 10 weeks at No 1 - ranked!From MC5 to Jeff Mills: the greatest Detroit tracks ever - ranked!Giorgio Moroder\u0027s 20 greatest songs - ranked!Nirvana\u0027s 20 greatest songs - ranked!The best songs from teen movies - ranked!The best UK garage tracks - ranked!The greatest banned songs of all time - ranked!The greatest ever female rap tracks - ranked!The greatest pop music dance crazes - ranked!All 43 Spice Girls songs - ranked!"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/969503f1df33b0d2a59a594eb11573a9d66dd85c/0_175_2469_1481/master/2469.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=acc468eb5824ac77fbdeabff3d7b86e4","title":"why the third man is an essential primer for no deal brexit","story":"As the classic noir gets a 70th anniversary re-release, it’s hard to ignore the parallels between a shattered postwar Vienna teeming with spivs and the future the Brexiters have in mindWhat perfect timing for The Third Man to step back out of the shadows. Often hailed as the finest film Britain ever made, a 70th anniversary re-release will see it return to cinemas with the government much in the market for symbols of national grandeur. While Boris Johnson has named his favourite film as Dodgeball – for once, eerily believable – as the great British breakdown goes on it is easy to imagine him waving a tiny Union Jack at Carol Reed’s majestic noir.It is true, of course, that there could be no better moment for The Third Man to reappear – just not as a cosy patriotic treat. Rather, it is a cold premonition of no-deal Britain.In that, there is a certain poetry. We are where we are in no small part due to endless British war films convincing a generation born in the 1950s that they had lived through the Blitz and could only be happy back in it. But The Third Man is a postwar movie. American hack writer Holly Martins (Joseph Cotten) arrives in Vienna to meet, then mourn, his old friend Harry Lime (Orson Welles), but the city he finds tells a bitter truth about life after wartime. “Smashed and dreary,” the screenwriter, Graham Greene, wrote in the novella drafted as a treatment.Barring the unexpected, we may still live to see the resemblance. The cosplayers will sputter that Austria was on the losing side in the second world war, ignoring that Britain can’t help but lose the re-enactment, given we’re the only ones fighting it. With Europe declining to drive us into the shelters, no deal provides the solution by dropping a bomb on ourselves.Reed and Greene show us the future that follows. “The classic period of the black market,” the voiceover calls it, an ugly scuttle of murky characters and fraught borders, an impoverished place carved up by predatory powers. The screen fills with parallels between then and our soon-to-be now. Official versions of Harry’s death hum with organised disinformation his lover Anna is a refugee, terrified of being caught with the wrong papers malign Russian influence lurks.But most of all, there are the vultures. To the crooks Greene found at work in the Viennese debris, the godsend of war was allowing them room to get rich. No Deal will be the same: a once-in-a-lifetime chance to tip a whole country into a handful of pockets. Disaster capitalism is just the modern name. There must be a catastrophe – because only that upheaval can allow the firesale of public assets and small businesses, the accompanying wave of deregulation, Britain remade as an offshore hidey-hole that asks no questions (and where those who do ask regret it).Enter – in that deathless flash of nightlight – Harry Lime. Because what is Lime if not a pioneer disaster capitalist, grasping the opportunities presented by chaos with a stash of tainted penicillin? Now, near the endgame, the point of the past three years is obvious – making possible the feral economy in which business minds such as Harry thrive, stripped of “red tape”, profit its own unarguable logic. “Free of income tax, old man,” he twinkles.It almost feels too on-the-nose that his racket takes place in the ultimate captive market – medicine. When the film was first released, the NHS was a year old. Now, it survives as the grand prize in a US trade deal Britons are assured we are first in line for, an army of Harrys poised to sell us an opioid epidemic and health insurance bankruptcies.With his loathing of American empire, Greene would be unsurprised to find Big Pharma circling. Yet at first, his villain sprang from closer to home. In Greene’s original novella, Lime and Martins were not Americans, but British subjects, old pals from private school. Harry’s crimes in Vienna are, we discover, those of a charismatic English scoundrel educated to rig the system.Indeed. It would be interesting to know what the current prime minister makes of Harry Lime – a habitual liar, his moral failures stuffed behind rogueish affability, an amply scaled betrayer of women, a nihilist and narcissist bulldozing through life with a bone-deep conviction that, as the novella puts it, “his happiness will make the world’s day”. Greene knew the type. He knew the poison in our golf clubs and members bars. The spivs and grotesques now running the country might have stepped whole from his pages, whipping up nationalism while discreetly betting against the pound and arranging second passports.High on the ferris wheel at the ghostly Prater amusement park, Harry prices up the tiny lives below. “Would you really feel any pity if one of those dots stopped moving?” Now, the maths of no deal are only deranged if you value those dots above your investment fund. And we – car-factory workers, sheep farmers, research scientists, even film critics, all of us – wander below.The funny thing is that Britain’s greatest film was only ever part British anyway. Aside from the involvement of the Hollywood veteran David Selznick and the Anglo-Hungarian producer Alexander Korda, Greene learned of the real-life penicillin racket in Vienna from the Austrian journalist Peter Smolka. Our ruling ghoul squad would no doubt shriek that the continental influence explains the negativity. Others will see Smolka as a small but telling detail in pinning down how a 70-year-old film could map so closely on to our present debacle – an eyewitness to what happens once the rot sets in.How does it end? In 1949, American interests won the day: Greene was overruled by Selznick as to how to close the story. The mogul was proved right, refusing Greene’s original happy ending for a cynical parting note. For anyone who has never seen this cruelly brilliant film and wonders what it says about the road ahead, here is the spoiler warning. There is a funeral, a long solitary walk and then a fade to black.The Third Man screens at BFI Southbank 6-12 September and nationwide for one day only on 29 September, and is released on DVD and Blu-Ray later in the year."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/09665aa2d469ec6311fe8ebf39c7c6a7678214b4/302_376_4574_2745/master/4574.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bb08ffa6fa96cc1518862949a15a94f2","title":"canned applause why tinned food isnt just for brexit","story":"From the expensive delights of Spanish anchovies to Jamaica’s humbler ackee or callaloo, some things actually taste all the better for coming in a canOK, stockpiling jokes really aren’t funny any more, but the following thoughts have absolutely nothing to do with the political disgrace that engulfs us. It is purely by coincidence that I am thinking a lot about food that works in cans. That, and bodybags.There is a category of food that is denatured by the canning process yet still delicious – such as sweetcorn, which loses its bite and takes on an almost waxy texture that is charming, maybe nostalgically. It tastes of church fetes and train journeys, diets you went on in teenagehood before you heard of the glycemic index. Spaghetti hoops, likewise – nothing like spaghetti in any real sense (unnaturally soft, sauce like service station ketchup) but intensely pleasing in a toast context, a delinquent double-carb on a par with a chip butty. Baked beans are universally faultless I don’t even mind the low-salt and sugar versions. These are foods it is not possible to ruin.That is not what I am interested in, however not for the moment. I am interested in the chic, in the statement, in the can you could open and serve to your spouse’s boss if you were Samantha from Bewitched (Google that, millennials). I’m interested in the food that turns to silk, to spun gold.Obviously, fish: anchovies of any provenance will work as a flavour bomb, which is plainly because of the salt more than anything else. Your standard supermarket anchovy tastes like a fish-infused crystallised salt, and there’s nothing wrong with that. But if you want to make the anchovy the star – the classic means of doing so is with bread, butter an inch thick, fish and shallots – they have to come from Santoña, on the north coast of Spain, where they only catch them between March and June, to make sure they are young. The eye-wateringly expensive Don Bocarte brand is said to use less salt, but they don’t taste any less salty, just fleshier, softer, less harsh, more miraculous.The fullest possible range of fish you could put in a tin is displayed like a gallery in Sol e Pesca, a cafe in Lisbon, Portugal: elephant tuna and abalone, mussels (smoked and not), octopus, squid. Octopus and mussels stay closest to their fresh texture, although canned tuna has been legitimised with familiarity and nobody would want it to taste as it does fresh.You would think you could write off all vegetables, and most of them you can: anything prized for its crunch is out, and the best thing you could do with a tinned carrot is to mash it before you start, so you are not expecting anything. But wait: hearts of palm take on a beautiful and quite varied texture, almost melting in the middle and crunchy at the outside. They could never remind you of anything else. Vegetables that would have been stewed anyway adapt brilliantly to canned life. The worst thing you could say about most canned ratatouille is that it is under-seasoned.I could not name a more stylish can-based dish than ackee and callaloo, which is eaten for breakfast in Jamaica but is deeply savoury and thus adaptable. Ackee is a fruit, known for its beautiful pip like a conker but, when stewed and canned, it takes on the texture of scrambled egg honestly, it could almost be mistaken for egg. Callaloo is a deep-green leaf vegetable, also stewed depending on your recipe, it is the consistency of saag, and seems to have a buttery slickness without butter. Together, ackee and callaloo make quite a sloppy ensemble, but you wouldn’t want it any other way.Of meat, I remain sceptical meatballs and frankfurters taste like hospital food when you can them. Classic French stews often need something from a can or they will take you a month to prepare – confit duck legs for a cassoulet, maybe – and those retain their integrity fine, if you can swallow their wowsome expense (though it would be rich of me to complain, after those anchovies).Cheese has been the canning surprise of this investigation I mean, I would not count stilton in a pot and nor would I entertain a tinned cheddar, even if I had ever seen one. But there is a Turkish manufacturer, Gazi, that does a range of cured sheep and goats’ milk cheeses that are grouped together as “nomad’s cheese” because, before cans were invented, they were cured and wrapped in animal skin to preserve them. Canned, they have an extraordinary shelf life of two years or so. They do not taste like classic feta they are a bit drier and crumblier despite their brine and have a more delicate flavour. If anything, they taste like cheeses from Georgia, almost neutral unless you concentrate, and then incredibly complex. You could do anything with these cheeses – salad, pastries, chop them into chickpeas. They are wonderful, with beautiful graphics featuring a surprised goat. Or sheep.I pass this on only in case of impromptu entertaining. No other reason, none at all."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/46c5d8de92898a3b19ee752c12d918cf430984b7/94_0_2813_1688/master/2813.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0785252b8fd05fb8e4d3439804bdf8ba","title":"food vegetables fast food texas healthy eating","story":"I grew up in Texas, where food is fast and portions are vast. It’s time to ditch the chicken and waffles and embrace the greensSeptember marks the end of summer and the start of a new school year for US students. Parents and caregivers will soon begin packing school lunches or dispensing money into their children’s lunch accounts, leaving them at the mercy of the government for sustenance.My parents decided to go with the latter. They tried meal prepping before the term was even coined, but a kid can only eat so many Lunchables and peanut butter-and-jelly sandwiches. It was therefore agreed that my siblings and I would eat the standard cafeteria food at our school.Maybe that’s where my problems began.Fast forward 15 years. I am now 24. It’s 7pm and I’m starving. I pull myself up three flights of stairs to my apartment. The day has flown by, and I’m feeling a little faint.My eyes scan the kitchen for something to eat. I open and close the cabinets and refrigerator door several times before deciding on … Cheetos. I eat about half the bag for dinner and watch season three of Stranger Things until I fall asleep on the couch. I wish Cheetos were carrots, I really do. I wish carrots tasted like Cheetos, but they taste like water and tree bark. And don’t even get me started on green vegetables.To be clear, this is not a junk food propaganda piece. I agree that most fast food is artificial (and probably carcinogenic). I try to limit myself to eating absolute garbage to just once a week, but considering I hate vegetables, that can be tricky.I suspect my hate affair with veggies can be traced to my Texas upbringing. I grew up in Houston, where we have the best tacos in the nation – not to mention the honey-butter chicken biscuit. The state-mandated fruit and vegetable requirement for public school cafeterias is three pieces of lettuce swimming in ranch dressing and a peach cobbler. And when I met up with friends after school, we’d go to Whataburger.My mother was a high school English teacher who went to college at night to complete her PhD. My dad was a traditionalist who came home from work at 7.30pm every night. I still don’t know what his job was (Finance? Consulting? The mafia?) but I knew the time he came home, because that’s when my brother and I would turn off the TV and run to the kitchen to hide our tortilla chips and ramen noodles. The sound of a garage door opening still strikes fear into my soul.My parents did not encourage junk food. In fact, when I would bring home Tastykakes or Flamin’ Hot Cheetos, I’d find them in the trash the next day. My mom was watching her weight and didn’t want to be tempted: she lost 60lb over the course of my middle school years. She never found my drawer of hidden snacks.Dinner was whatever my mom had made the previous night and left in the freezer. Sometimes it was lasagne, sometimes biryani. She made spinach and eggplant dishes quite often, but with no one to look over my shoulder when I was eating, I left it untouched. My father would eat on his chair in the living room while watching soccer or The West Wing while I ate in the kitchen, hogging the phone line talking to Kelly or Nicole about Kyle or Chad. (I lived in a very white suburb.)On the days my mom slaved over her dissertation on American syncretism, my dad would bring home McDonald’s or Chick-fil-A. Needless to say, I lived for those days. I felt like I would rather starve than eat another helping of rice, daal or cauliflower.College was another deterrent to living healthily. Though I worked out all the time with my fitness-crazed roommate, I lived above a Taco Bell and down the street from an establishment called the Potato Shack. A coffee, a beer or pretzels was considered a meal.For many Americans, this isn’t out of the ordinary. Food deserts form the tapestry of American cuisine,and most suburbs have a McDonald’s or a Burger King lurking nearby. Drive-thrus serving burgers, fries and milkshakes are common, but drive-thrus serving salads are rare gems, if any exist at all. Time and accessibility are factors that determine what the average American family decides to eat for dinner.You might envision me as a whale of a woman hunched over her laptop typing this with Cheeto-stained fingertips. While I’m not there (yet), my future is not bright if I continue on this path. No longer can I eat a family-size bag of Orville Redenbacher buttery popcorn and maintain my figure. I’m getting older and my hips don’t lie. Neither does my cholesterol.I’ve decided I’m better than that. I’m a grown woman living in New York who needs to suck it up and chow down on a salad. I’ve been experimenting with tricking myself into eating healthier – yes, like a toddler – so I grow into the habit.I’ve started eating zucchini noodles, which really do taste like spaghetti if you close your eyes and gulp them down. I discovered I love butternut squash soup. Granted, these are often preludes to a burger or ice cream, but I’m getting there. I’m also really into baba ganoush.I still enjoy working out, but as my best friend reminds me, abs are (allegedly) made in the kitchen. I know it’s time to abandon the Texas way and adopt a new lifestyle. I’m also sick of my judgmental colleagues, who sound like paid spokespeople for Michelle Obama’s Let’s Move! campaign. They never fail to mention they grow vegetables on the window sills of their Brooklyn apartments and how delicious they find kale. (Liars!) I won’t lie – my new health kick is partially due to my desire to not feel sluggish, but it’s mostly to get these annoying colleagues off my back.If you’re struggling to maintain a healthy lifestyle, just know you are not alone. Let’s make a pledge to stop eating monochromatic meals of brown and yellow starches and incorporate some color on to our plate. It won’t happen overnight. But I’ll be damned if one more person shames me for eating a cheesy gordita crunch for lunch again."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b69056f09a656fb5df42102b0c17f4a0ed9fa501/0_213_5399_3239/master/5399.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e028b84a58b1b924f79567d7772190ea","title":"alex oxlade chamberlain winner euro 2020 england pub fans","story":"On a summer’s evening in June 2018 Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain headed to Boxpark in London’s Shoreditch to watch England’s World Cup defeat by Belgium. His attempt to go incognito in hat and spectacles was swiftly rumbled by eagle-eyed hipsters and, watching the game unfold in Kaliningrad, he came to feel part of an England crowd for the first time. And to realise the magnitude of what he had lost.For a player who has missed England’s last three tournaments through injury – the last one a horrendous knee injury that cost him a year of his career and a planned starting role in Russia – Oxlade-Chamberlain exudes remarkable positivity and refreshing perspective. Visits to Zoë’s Place, a baby hospice in Liverpool, and having friends with similar knee problems but without “the luxury of having doctors, physios and specialists on-call day and night as I had” ensured the lowest moments of his latest rehabilitation were fleeting.But that night in Shoreditch, powerless to respond to Adnan Januzaj’s winner and transfixed by the power of the World Cup, the Liverpool midfielder allowed himself a moment’s regret.“That was the first time I’ve ever watched a match with fans of my team, if that makes sense,” Oxlade-Chamberlain says. “I’m either always in the stadium or at home. I was shocked. I’ve never been to a pub where there’s a bunch of Liverpool fans or Arsenal fans and watched it with them, never been to a pub with England fans to see what it means to them and it was surreal. I could see my mates on the screen doing what I usually do and how everyone around them was reacting. I was almost idolising them as well. Just seeing what they were doing and what that created around me I was like, ‘Oh my God, do I really do that?’“What it created was special. To see that first hand, in that environment, wasn’t what I expected. It was a moment where I realised – I can’t swear – I’ve missed out on something big here. Seeing what it meant to people. People rushing in from work with their shirts and ties on, it was like the whole nation was watching. I met a couple of doctors there, a couple of boys from the city, a couple of plumbers all came into Boxpark. It was just mayhem and meant so much to everyone. I’d never seen that first hand, so it was really special and a reminder of what it means to play for England and how special that is.”It is a scene that will be replayed again next summer should Gareth Southgate’s team secure their place at Euro 2020. They are on course to do so with two victories from two qualifiers plus Bulgaria and Kosovo to come at home on Saturday and on Tuesday respectively. “That would be great,” Oxlade-Chamberlain says. “And I think the boys did themselves proud to create the environment where people have more belief and more of a connection with this young set of players. But we’ve got to make sure we get there first because that would be a bit of a party ruiner, wouldn’t it? That’s the main thing we’ve got to do and then … ” Win it? “Yes, exactly.”Oxlade-Chamberlain hopes to be in the box seat for England next summer, not Boxpark. His return to Southgate’s squad has come quickly, having made only two starts for Liverpool this season, but with the England manager in regular contact throughout his 12 months out the midfielder was reassured he was not forgotten. Oxlade-Chamberlain’s first competitive start for Liverpool – in the Super Cup against Chelsea –came 477 days after his last, when he damaged cruciate and medial knee ligaments, plus the tendons to his hamstring, in the Champions League semi-final victory over Roma.The 26-year-old kept the severity of the injury from most of the Liverpool squad and the public to avoid distracting from the final in Kiev. It was only after the defeat by Real Madrid that emotions got the better of him. Yet missing the World Cup later that summer, having also been sidelined from Euro 2016 and the 2014 World Cup by knee injuries, has not left Oxlade-Chamberlain cursing his misfortune.Oxlade-Chamberlain admits he used to have his career all mapped out in stages. “By 24 I wanted to have won the Champions League and be scoring 10-15 goals a season,” he says. “But sometimes things just don’t go the way you want them to.” That is not said with any trace of self-pity. Back in the Liverpool frame, with a new contract until 2023, and back on the England scene with a young, exciting squad, this feels a fresh start rather than a time to dwell on the past.“I’ll worry about that when I’m 50 and I’ve got a big belly like my dad,” he says, laughing. “Then I’ll think ‘What if? I could have done that.’ It hasn’t all been roses but one thing I would say and why I remain proud of myself is that even when things haven’t gone as I wanted them to I still make sure I come back with the same optimism to improve and to do more.“I would say I have enjoyed every minute of my career up until this point because it has shaped me to be who I am both on and off the pitch. By no means I am sat here looking back at what could have been. For now I’m just looking forward.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f7fff1ed54eddb5d608cc64701efd8c90e44d898/0_131_3294_1976/master/3294.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=44ef0739d9a1feec9c45c6943ff251ad","title":"womens super league high profile signings manchester united","story":"The Women’s Super League starts this weekend in explosive style, with a Manchester derby at the Etihad Stadium, a London derby at Stamford Bridge and clear ambition to carry on the momentum from the World Cup. Scheduling big games in big stadiums shows it is not just words – everything is being put in place to help the domestic game capitalise on the extraordinary interest attracted over the summer. The FA Player, which will broadcast every game of the WSL season for free, and deals to show matches on TV in Mexico and Scandinavia, show a more professional, commercial outlook which should help women’s football in the UK progress even further in the coming years.With men’s football on an international break, there should be plenty of attention on the season’s first games on Saturday afternoon, including the match between Manchester City and a newly promoted Manchester United. Both teams have had busy summers in the transfer market, with United’s business particularly important before their first season in the top flight. Their most eye-catching signings have been the Dutch midfielder Jackie Groenen, a top player who attracted a lot of interest from clubs across Europe, and the defender Abbie McManus from City. They were two strong statements, and though I’m not sure they can put up a genuine challenge for a place in the top three, with their improved squad they will fancy their chances of taking points off anyone. City meanwhile have bolstered their forward line with the England striker Ellen White, after her amazing World Cup, and Lee Geum-min. The Korean is not a player I know well, but she has plenty of international experience and in their recent past City have rarely signed players from outside the EU so Lee’s arrival suggests they feel she can add real value. But last year’s runners-up have also suffered a bit of an exodus, with Nikita Parris’s move to Lyon the most high profile, and it is hard to say that their squad looks stronger overall than it did a year ago.Chelsea, champions two years ago, have signed only one senior player, the Norwegian forward Guro Reiten. I am not particularly concerned by this: when their challenge faltered last season there was some talk about tiredness, as they combined their WSL efforts with a run to the Champions League semi‑finals. The absence of European competition could allow their squad to push that bit harder domestically and perhaps get over the line. Arsenal, last season’s runaway champions, are in exactly the opposite situation, having to cope with the Champions League after adding only a few players. I am sure after their absence from Europe they will be keen to do well, and they face an Italian rival of ours, Fiorentina, who finished second in last season’s Serie A, in the last 32 first leg on 12 September. They are boosted by the return of Jordan Nobbs after long-term injury, a top player who’s likely to play every game, but on the other hand have lost Danielle Carter, whose ACL injury in a pre-season friendly against Bayern Munich was heartbreaking to see.The Gunners still have an extremely strong squad, so I’m sure many would expect Joe Montemurro’s side to retain the title, but though I also make them favourites I don’t expect their progress to be so straightforward this time. I remember last summer Juventus played Arsenal in preseason: they thrashed us 5-0 and we barely touched the ball, we just didn’t have any possession at all. I was sure then that they would win the league, and they proceeded to score 42 goals and keep seven clean sheets in their first nine games to set the tone for an incredible season. They are still a fantastic side, but I don’t expect to be seeing those kinds of statistics this year, when there should be more close games, and a few more shocks.There are a couple of clubs – Reading, perhaps also United – who might fancy their chances of breaking into the top three, while Tottenham’s priority will be to establish themselves after their promotion – they provide Chelsea’s opposition this weekend, and will find it’s a big step up from the Championship to playing at a sold-out Stamford Bridge. Brighton, meanwhile, are in a similar situation in their second season in the top flight. I can see all these teams taking points off each other this season, making the ision a lot more interesting than it was last term when the eventual winners and losers were obvious from pretty early.If there’s one team I worry about it’s my hometown club, Birmingham. Player turnover there this summer has been massive, enough to make me wonder if their players don’t believe in the project, or if something has gone on behind the scenes. After losing their outstanding goalkeeper, Ann‑Katrin Berger, midway through last season they have also now lost their best striker, White, and probably their best defender in Aoife Mannion – both to City, where Mannion swiftly got her first England call-up – while their promising young forward Charlie Wellings has gone to Bristol City. They have been punching above their weight in recent seasons, but I really hope this is not the year they fall away. Last year they relied a lot upon their defence, but after Mannion’s departure that strength is no longer there and they face a big rebuilding job. Looking at the clubs’ business this summer, Birmingham is the one that sets the alarm bells ringing.A close title race and competitiveness throughout the ision would push the WSL on once again. After the summer the game has had, and the brilliant viewing figures we saw during the World Cup, this season will be a true test of the nation’s appetite for top-level women’s football. Kicking off with a couple of high-profile games in high-profile stadiums is a good way to start, but the proof of the clubs’ commitment will be when these are not just one-offs.I played for Juventus at a sold-out Allianz Stadium last season, but these matches need to happen more frequently, allowing the clubs’ fans to get into the habit of going to games and to get to know their players. We might have to wait for that, though hopefully not for long: a lot of positive work has been done off the field in recent months to raise awareness of the WSL in Britain and abroad, and now I’m fully expecting to see interest and attendances rising once again."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1c8b8f8fb791843fa960eed497b5809fd47d9a0f/1442_1230_4030_2418/master/4030.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=96cf237632d8aef0a8284b61e411f1f3","title":"bangladesh imposes mobile phone blackout in rohingya refugee camps","story":"Muslims who fled persecution in Myanmar face prospect of further isolation as government orders operators to shut down services Hundreds of thousands of Rohingya Muslims living in refugee camps in Bangladesh face a communications blackout after the government ordered a ban on mobile phone services and sim cards.The country’s telecommunications regulatory body cited security fears and illegal mobile use as it ordered operators to shut down services in the overcrowded camps in the south-eastern border district of Cox’s Bazar by next Sunday.Local sim cards are already effectively forbidden to Rohingya refugees, since only Bangladeshis with national identity cards are allowed to use them. However, the camp’s black market in cards means their use is widespread.Rights groups called on the Bangladeshi government not to further isolate the Rohingya, who fled to Bangladesh to escape ethnic cleansing in neighbouring Myanmar, by going ahead with the plan.“Access to sim cards has been a vital service for the Rohingya for years, and they have utilised them extremely effectively to raise awareness of their plight to the world” said Kyaw Win, the executive director of Burma Human Rights Network.Mobile internet services have already been disrupted in the camps, with a reduced signal at certain times of the day.The order, from the Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission, asks operators to submit reports to the government on the actions taken to shut down networks in the camps.“Many refugees are using mobile phones in the camp” Zakir Hossain Khan, a spokesman for the commission, told the AFP news agency. “We’ve asked the operators to stop it.”Until mobile phone services are halted, operators have been asked to suspend data and internet services between 5pm and 5am every day, Khan said.In recent months, more than 40 Rohingya have been killed, amid concerns that some refugees are involved in smuggling illegal drugs to Myanmar. Last month, there were violent anti-refugee protests by locals after police blamed Rohingya refugees for the murder of Omar Faruk, a ruling party official.Last weekend, police said a fourth Rohingya refugee was shot dead in the fallout over Faruk’s murder.There has been speculation the communications crackdown is linked to non-violent rallies in the camp on 25 August, the second anniversary of the forced displacement of the Rohingya people from Myanmar after a brutal military campaign of violence against them. The official who allowed the gathering has now been transferred elsewhere, the  understands.The Bangladeshi government has become increasingly frustrated over its failed efforts to repatriate Rohingya refugees back to Myanmar.A UN source, who did not want to be named, said the sim card crackdown would be “almost impossible” to implement.“Mobile phones are two a penny here and there is a black market in sim cards,” said the source. “It’s difficult to see how they are going to enforce it. A lot of refugees have still got Burmese sim cards and if they go into the hills, they can use them them there.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/45ccb9e20ecdab57671159f625bf51894eac0b97/0_190_5700_3420/master/5700.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9c6e7363c927b96a6b0f5d53b005880c","title":"tell us who do you share your home with","story":"As part of a new series in the ’s Weekend magazine we are looking for interesting pairs who live togetherWe’re looking for unusual partnerships – two people who live together in a way that shows the changing nature of the traditional household – for our new series that seeks to reflect how the place we call home can now include extended family, friends and even strangers.In the first piece in a series talking to pairs of people who live together we met the McPhersons, a grandmother and grandson living together who tell us their story.

He talks about the death of mainstream politics – and how he still believes in the good of common peopleJarvis Cocker has packed a lot into his 55 years. For 26 of them he fronted Pulp, who created one of the genuinely era-defining songs of the 1990s with Common People. He made seven albums with Pulp, has made two solo albums and written songs for the likes of Marianne Faithfull and Charlotte Gainsbourg. Other extra-curricular activities range from appearing on Question Time to starring in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. But it’s not enough.“My output isn’t as much as I would have hoped,” he says, softly. “I’ve always felt that.”We are in a small, darkened dressing room in Leith theatre, Edinburgh, where Cocker – outsize glasses, double corduroy and Yorkshire Tea – is adding another string to his bow fronting Jarv Is, the first new band he has formed since starting Arabicus Pulp in 1978 at school in Sheffield.From 2010 until 2017, Cocker was a BBC 6Music DJ. He loved being able to inflict on the general public the peculiar records from his basement that he normally played only to himself or friends. A new compilation – Music from Jarvis Cocker’s Sunday Service – brings some of them together. Sheffield electronic pioneers Cabaret Voltaire nestle alongside 1960s Leeds singer-songwriter Jake Thackray. Antony and the Johnsons’ haunting version of Beyoncé’s Crazy in Love appears alongside a Trinidadian steel band’s strangely mesmeric remake of Gary Numan’s Cars.“I half-jokingly said I wanted to bring the boredom back to Sunday afternoons,” he chuckles, but notes that he is old enough to remember when Sunday afternoons were boring and “you had to make your own entertainment, and really think about it”. So, he played “the sort of records that you’d never hear on the radio or anywhere really. Mellow music and spoken-word stuff people could let flow through their mind.”The problem was, he kept feeling an urge to make more music.“I’d hesitate to describe it as a calling or whatever,” he says, “But at the back of my mind I felt like I was moonlighting from what I should be doing.” So, in 2017, he pulled the plug on his DJing.First, he made an album with Canadian pianist Chilly Gonzales and worked on solo songs on a computer, but it wasn’t happening until he realised it was “blindingly obvious that having been in bands since I was 14, I needed to work with other people, get everybody in a room and say: ‘This is how it goes. Join in.’”Ironically, the Sunday Service led partly to the forming of Jarv Is. Cocker was diligently rooting through CDs to play on the radio when he came across one by harpist Serafina Steer. He really liked it, went to see her, produced an album for her and now she is in his band. Steer recommended her bandmate Emma Smith (violin) and before he knew it, Jarv Is were a six-piece.Cocker says the Jarv Is songs – which have been going down a storm at festivals – are different to Pulp’s. “In the past, there was a firm narrative,” he says, perhaps thinking of Common People’s tale of a rich girl slumming it or Sorted for E’s and Wizz’s askance look at rave culture (“Oh, is this the way the future’s meant to feel  Or just 20,000 people standing in a field?”). “I wanted to make them slightly more open-ended and allow people to make their own interpretations.”Thus, Am I Missing Something? (about “getting to a stage in life and thinking: ‘Is this it?’”) may or may not channel his own feelings of a lack of fulfilment. I Am Pharoah is “a song about tourism from the perspective of a human statue” at some gigs they have performed the track alongside one of the painted, motionless and silent street artists that Cocker approached on London’s South Bank, leaving notes with his phone number until one – who paints himself in diagonal stripes – finally responded. Performing alongside him is, Cocker says, “strangely calming”.Cocker has always firmly believed that being popular doesn’t mean you can’t be off-kilter. Writing a book about creativity – This Book is a Song, which is due out next autumn – made him think about where his ideas about pop music came from. “And really they were from having listened to the radio for as long as I can remember.”He describes recording his 2009 solo album Further Complications with Nirvanapunk producer Steve Albini, who was “aghast” when Cocker told him he loved pop. “He looked at me like it was the devil’s music. Cos obviously from his point of view it was everything that ruined music.” But Cocker loves the fact that “really strange records” such as Laurie Anderson’s O Superman, which, despite being unashamedly avant garde, got to No 2 in the UK in 1981, used to be able to “capture the public’s imagination and get in the charts by the democratic act of people ‘voting’ by buying them”.Cocker blames the death of the singles chart he loved on its late-90s manipulation by record companies, who would price CD singles at 99p on the week of release, then £3.99 thereafter: “Records would go in at No 1 and disappear the next week because nobody would pay full price.” He admits to being “totally out of touch with pop music – or what people call pop now” and says that streaming “has been an interesting thing to get my head around”. Initially, Jarv Is weren’t going to make records at all. They would be a live phenomenon, the idea being: “If people wanted to hear these songs, they would have to be there in the moment, because that’s it.” But they started selling their single Must I Evolve? (recorded live in a cave near Sheffield called the Devil’s Arse) at gigs and, gradually, Cocker has come around because: “The perfect recording of the perfect pop song is still my holy grail.”Live, Jarv Is throw in the odd Pulp rarity but having put the band to bed with a reunion tour in 2011 he is in no rush to trade on old glories. He quickly grew disillusioned with fame and excess (“a lot of stuff which was detrimental to actually being creative,” he says, drily) and refers to the band’s final years as “the bad old days”.One incident from the period has followed him around – the time he invaded the stage at the 1996 Brit Awards, wiggling his bottom in protest at Michael Jackson’s performance, in which the star adopted Christ-like poses and surrounded himself with children. I tell him that after the abuse allegations in Leaving Neverland, the incident seems eerily prophetic, but Cocker insists he didn’t watch the film and “really doesn’t want to talk about it”. Doesn’t he feel somehow vindicated? “I don’t, because I didn’t watch it.”He is more comfortable addressing how his 2006 song Cunts are Still Running the World has become a touchstone in the Jarv Is live set. Audiences bellow the chorus and each night he introduces it by noting “it feels even more relevant now”.“A strangely common aspect of people that get in power at the moment is that they’re these weird characters – ridiculous people in a way – but people seem to find entertainment in that. And that’s dangerous really. Politics has turned into Game of Thrones and they like all the skulduggery and stabbing people in the back. I can’t see it ending well.”As a vocal remainer from a city that narrowly voted leave, Brexit hurts him deeply. “The UK has always been ided but we’ve always got on,” he sighs. “But now, whatever happens, half the people are going to be kinda livid about it.”However, Cocker retains faith in, well, common people. He points out that Cunts Are Still Running the World now ends positively with the line “but not for long”, and on a recent trip to the US – “a country that, if you look through the prism of the media, you think ‘Jesus Christ’” – he was reminded that “most people are, you know, lovely. It’s the political landscape that needs to shift.”To this end, Jarv Is concerts feature an Extinction Rebellion stall, at Cocker’s request. “I hate to say this because I’ve voted Labour all my life, but both Conservative and Labour currently seem outmoded, in a way. They were born in a time when there was a big working class in factories, who were dying at 35. And they needed someone to stand up for them. Other people thought that was fine. But there’s the start of a different agenda. You’ve got people who want to rape and pillage the Earth and other people who say: ‘Let’s conserve it, otherwise we won’t have anywhere to live.’ So that’s the battle now.”There is a knock at the door. Cocker has a meal to eat, a gig to play, Extinction Rebellion to meet with. The last time we spoke, towards the end of Pulp, he was thoroughly fed up. Is he enjoying all this again?“I am,” he smiles as he gets up. “Of course, now that I’ve said that I’ll probably fall off stage.”Music From Jarvis Cocker’s Sunday Service is released on Ace Records on 27 September"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/760dc7d92c6d39a1bf7587cb1ebdeab0a2fef3cf/0_136_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f156c3f64be337c00aacbec875bfc9ba","title":"nick minaj retires claim twitter family life","story":"The 36-year-old New York musician tweeted that she’s ‘decided to retire’ from the business after a decade-long careerRap star Nicki Minaj has announced she’s leaving the music business because she wants to make family life her priority.The 36-year-old Trinidadian-born rapper, who grew up in New York and is known for her outlandish outfits, bizarre alter egos and fast flow, made the announcement in a tweet on Thursday morning.It’s not clear if Minaj is done with her career or merely taking a temporary rest. Over the course of her decade-long career, Minaj has been nominated for 10 Grammys, earned a Guinness World Record in 2017 for most Billboard Hot 100 entries by a solo female artist and hauled in five MTV Video Music Awards.Earlier this year Minaj was certified by the Recording Industry Association of America as the first female rapper to officially sell 100m albums and singles.After signing a music deal in 2009, Minaj released her first studio album, Pink Friday, a year later, peaking at No 1. Her second album, Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded also hit No 1.Several subsequent albums sold well and she also branched out into appearing in movies, including Ice Age: Continental Drift, and on television, where she was judge on American Idol.The New York Times once called Minaj “a sparkling rapper with a gift for comic accents and unexpected turns of phrase. She’s a walking exaggeration, outsize in sound, personality and look. And she’s a rapid evolver, discarding old modes as easily as adopting new ones”.But if Minaj is indeed hanging up her wigs and costumes, she’ll be remembered for her strange adoption of British cockney rhyming slang by way of Queens, New York.“When I started rapping, people were trying to make me like the typical New York rapper, but I’m not that. No disrespect to New York rappers, but I don’t want people to hear me and know exactly where I’m from,” she explained to Billboard.Her technique combined both rapping and singing as she incorporated her British alter ego, Roman Zolanski, and Japanese character, Harajuku Barbie, into her act.Before she incorporated craziness in her performances, she once explained, she was just “doing me.”“I was just doing regular-sounding rap that anyone could hear and identify with. But once I started doing all that weird shit – I’m not mad at it because it got everyone’s attention.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d047228f36cfa9dab23b1ee6e8b91a6b33fb430a/0_147_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=235487267fee9f640498b8b9239ed869","title":"back to school after a decade of austerity podcast","story":"As the chancellor, Sajid Javid, gears up for what could be a pre-election spending review, education correspondent Sally Weale tells Anushka Asthana how nearly 10 years of government cutbacks in school funding have fed through to the classroom.

If the government lost, it would be followed by a 14-day period during which MPs could seek to put together an alternative majority.As Corbyn proposed in the summer, he would then seek to lead a strictly time-limited government, which would simply request an extension from the EU27 for the purposes of holding a general election, and then dissolve itself.Corbyn told MPs in the House of Commons on Wednesday that he would be ready to support Johnson’s call for a general election once the backbench bill aimed at preventing a no-deal Brexit has passed.“Let this bill pass and gain royal assent, and then we will back an election so we do not crash out of the European Union with a no-deal exit,” the Labour leader said.But one shadow cabinet minister close to Corbyn said senior figures in the party had been “agonising” over the best course of action. Another said they had been increasingly won over to the idea of refusing Johnson’s choice of polling date, as his short-lived administration appears to stumble. “They are imploding – a further delay might help us.”John McDonnell acknowledged there were “different views” in Labour about the timing of a general election. “The problem that we have got is that we cannot at the moment have any confidence in Boris Johnson abiding by any commitment or deal that we could construct,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today.“That’s the truth of it. So, we are now consulting about whether it’s better to go long, therefore, rather than to go short.”However, the president of the TUC, a close ally of Corbyn, called for Labour to support a general election as soon as legislation halting a no-deal Brexit is imposed upon the government. Mark Serwotka also warned Labour MPs including deputy leader Tom Watson to fall in line behind their leader.Corbyn had faced a backlash after appearing to suggest he would back a 15 October general election without further conditions attached.Wes Streeting MP said: “Our No 1 priority is stopping a no-deal Brexit happening during a general election campaign through accident or design. We don’t trust Boris Johnson and nor should anyone else. Once we are confident that no deal is safely ruled out, we will all troop through to vote for a general election, which is now necessary, inevitable and desirable.”Fellow MP Andy Slaughter said he would vote against or abstain in a second government vote called to try and bring about an election unless he could get a copper-bottomed guarantee that the anti no-deal legislation tabled by the government was adhered to.Serwotka, who was due to address the first day of the TUC’s annual congress in Brighton on Sunday, said he favoured going to the polls as soon as anti no-deal legislation was in place. “My position is that we want an election – we want it as soon as possible once a no-deal Brexit is off the table. We have been demanding a general election and now we should get to it as quickly as we could,” he told the .Serwotka, the general secretary of the PCS public service union since 2001, said the current political crisis should mean that Watson and others no longer “indulge” in plots or undermining tactics against Corbyn. “I think the dangers of perceived splits in the Labour party are damaging.“The actions of some of the parliamentary Labour party such as Tom Watson and others have been really unacceptable. They must know as much as anyone else what is at stake. And I think there will be a demand to keep our eye on the ball here. Now is not the time to indulge in undermining Jeremy,” he said.Watson has been criticised by Corbyn supporters for calling for greater cooperation with the Lib Dems to stop Brexit and for allegedly “exacerbating fears” over antisemitism within the party – claims that Watson’s allies deny.Serwotka, who rejoined Labour under Corbyn’s leadership, dismissed the idea of a national unity government led by a parliamentary grandee, adding that he would only support a Corbyn-led government."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/013e53a44f799ddbca19d592503e5ff83a690c5c/0_6_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cff055a141a4f995312d19e9fa606ca5","title":"luciana berger joins liberal democrats brexit remain","story":"Remain campaigner says party is only one that is unequivocal in wanting to stop BrexitThe former Labour politician Luciana Berger has joined the Liberal Democrats, becoming the second MP to join the party in a week.The MP for Liverpool Wavertree and remain campaigner said the party is the only one that has proven to be “unequivocal in wanting to stop Brexit”.In February she quit Labour over the party’s handling of antisemitism cases and its approach to Brexit alongside six other MPs to form fledging political grouping Change UK.

Berger, who is Jewish, was a vocal opponent of Jeremy Corbyn’s handling of claims of antisemitism and said she no longer felt welcome within the party. Labour members in her constituency attempted to hold a vote of no confidence in her while she was pregnant with her second child which was eventually called off after complaints were made to the Labour leadership.Swinson said: “Luciana is a passionate advocate for women’s and LGBT+ rights, and she’s at the forefront of efforts to counter antisemitism and prevent discrimination.“I’m delighted to welcome her to the Liberal Democrats, where we can work together to stop Brexit and build a fairer, more equal society for all.“Luciana becomes the fourth MP in three months to cross the floor and join the Liberal Democrats.

But Prof Neil Gemmell, who led the study, said he couldn’t rule out a theory that eels in the loch have grown to an extreme size.“It is possible there are very large eels,” Gemmell told a packed press conference at the Loch Ness Centre at Drumnadrochit, “but it depends how big you think ‘large’ is.”The eel theory resurrects a possible explanation for “sightings” of the monster that date back to 1933, when the Inverness Courier first reported a “strange spectacle on Loch Ness”.In the decades since, there have been dozens of high-profile attempts to prove the existence of the monster. In 2003, the BBC funded an extensive search using 600 sonar beams, which turned up nothing.Gemmell said the sheer volume of eel DNA surprised him and his team. And, maintaining a straight face, he added: “We don’t know if the eel DNA we are detecting is from a gigantic eel or just many small eels.”Looking more sceptical, he outlined the theory: “The notion is that these eels would normally migrate to reproduce, but they, for whatever reason, don’t. And they continue to grow to a very large size, forgoing reproduction for growth.”One of the favourite Loch Ness monster theories is that it is an elasmosaurus or plesiosaur that somehow survived the extinction of the dinosaurs.Gemmell was more certain about ruling this out. “Is there a plesiosaur in Loch Ness? No. There is absolutely no evidence of any reptilian sequences. So I think we can be fairly sure that there is probably not a giant scaly reptile swimming around in Loch Ness.”His study sequenced DNA from 250 samples of Loch Ness water at a range of sites and depths. The nearest it found to dinosaur DNA was very distantly related amphibians such as toads and frogs. “We didn’t find crocodiles. We didn’t find lizards. We didn’t find adders,” Gemmell said.The earliest recorded sighting of the monster was in 565AD by St Columba, but the modern phenomena starts when the Inverness Courier reports a Strange Spectacle on Loch Ness, the first of what would go on to be thousands of newspaper articles about Nessie.Probably the most famous photograph of the monster, the surgeon\u0027s photo by RK Wilson, is taken. It shows a plesiosaur-like head and neck emerging from the water, and creates a nationwide stir in the press.Tim Dinsdale captures on film what he claims is the monster. However, analysis of the footage in 1984 proves conclusively that it was, in fact, just a fishing boat.The Loch Ness Investigation Bureau spends a decade Nessie-hunting, positioning still and movie cameras around the loch, and using other techniques including searchlights, infra-red cameras and submarines. They make strong unexplainable sonar contact with an object in 1962, and again in 1968.The Nessie myth is by now fully embedded in popular culture, and the monster features in Doctor Who, where it is revealed to be an alien called a Skarasen. Four years earlier, The Goodies episode \u0027Scotland\u0027 revolves around the trio hunting for the beast to capture it for London Zoo.The creature is given a scientific name in the journal Nature by Sir Peter Scott and Robert Rines - Nessiteras rhombopteryx. It takes a while for people to spot that it is an anagram of “Monster hoax by Sir Peter S”.Operation Deepscan uses a flotilla of 24 boats to scan the loch with sonar from end to end. It is unable to explain the strong sonar contacts it makes.Project Urquhart takes a complete hydrographic survey of the loch. A biological study as part of the project fails to turn up a monster, but does discover a previously unknown species of nematode.The surgeon photo is finally exposed as a hoax - Christian Spurling reveals that his stepfather set it up using a toy submarine with a fake snake head attached.There are 17 separate sightings of the monster - considered a record at the time. It is also, coincidentally, the same year that the Ted Danson-starring Loch Ness monster movie is released.The BBC funds an extensive search using 600 sonar beams. It turns up nothing.\u0026nbspNessie hunting gets an internet-era makeover when a mysterious image is spotted in a satellite picture of the loch used on Google Earth.Sonar finally locates a monster - but it is a prop of Nessie built for the 1969 movie The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes which had sunk to the bottom of the loch nearly fifty years previously.Sightings continue to this day - anyone seeing the monster can register their sighting at lochnesssightings. The monster myth has become such big tourist business that nearby Drumnadrochit can support two competing Loch Ness attractions - Nessieland and the Loch Ness Centre and Exhibition.\u0026nbspThe press conference had been called under slightly false pretences, Gemmell admitted. He said: “If you like, this has been a great big science con. We’ve been talking about science the entire time and we’re using the monsters as bait.” He said he hoped interest in the Loch Ness legend would raise the profile of environmental DNA research.“I came into this with a view that there probably wasn’t a monster,” he said. “I wanted to understand the bioersity of Loch Ness and we’ve done that very well.”Gemmell said the study would eventually provide a publicly available database of all the species in the loch, which could help gauge changes in bioersity and the impact of invasive species such as pink salmon.“We’ve communicated science in a way which has been more compelling than perhaps most of the science I’ve been involved in in my prior career,” Gemmell said. “More people now know about environmental DNA than ever before, I would imagine, and I think that’s a good thing. Because we need these tools to be able to document what is living in places as, slowly but surely, our world becomes less special.”Gemmell was challenged about why the study had failed to detect the presence of otters or seals in Loch Ness. He said: “We may have missed things. But we found all the species we know are residents in Loch Ness in respect to fish.”He added: “Like every other monster hunt there has been here at Loch Ness, we have found no definitive evidence of a monster. More and more studies providing more and more negative evidence cast more and more doubt on the possibility, but we can’t prove a negative.”However, he denied that he had totally killed off the legend of the Loch Ness monster. “There’s still some level of uncertainty there, so there is still the opportunity for people to believe in monsters. Is it front page news? I don’t know. But we’ve captured some imaginations.”That will come as a relief to the tourist industry that has thrived on the banks of the loch ever since the earliest sightings, to the extent that nearby Drumnadrochit can support two competing Loch Ness attractions, Nessieland and the Loch Ness Centre and Exhibition."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/733073c3614a33521ec9cb0bf3eba174bf27c911/0_13_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2ac61405e6eee799026e6dbc2f77c64f","title":"spacewatch european mars rover ready for final test","story":"European Space Agency’s ExoMars rover arrives in France for final tests before next year’s mission The European Space Agency’s ExoMars rover has arrived in France for final tests before being prepared for its mission next year.Named Rosalind Franklin after the English chemist, the rover is designed to determine whether there has ever been life on Mars.

With Castleford’s season on the line, this was as masterful an inidual display as any Tigers fan could have hoped for.“Fantastic,” was how Daryl Powell summed up his stand-off’s performance: and he was right. Trueman’s treble provided the headline, but this was a superb all-round show from a 20-year-old who continues to defy his years. And it ensured Castleford a priceless victory.As it transpired, the 20-0 lead the Tigers had established after 25 minutes was more than enough to beat a woeful Hull side. Lee Radford had promised a response after Hull’s Challenge Cup semi-final defeat to Warrington in July instead, they have lost four of their last five games and, having been in the play-off places for six months, are now outside the top five at exactly the wrong time.With one week remaining of the regular season, Hull have the unenviable task of needing a result against the league leaders, St Helens, next Friday to stand any chance of a play-off spot. On this form they are rank outsiders.“They’ve saved some of their strangest decisions for the biggest of stages,” was Radford’s damning assessment.Trueman and Castleford wasted little time in setting about dismantling Hull. His magnificent pass enabled Cheyse Blair to break the deadlock after eight minutes, before back-to-back solo tries from Trueman himself, coupled with three goals from Jamie Ellis, made it 18-0. Ellis’ penalty five minutes later extended the hosts’ lead.Masi Matongo’s try 11 minutes from half-time offered the visitors a glimmer of hope, but that was extinguished by Trueman two minutes after the restart when he completed his hat-trick. “The boys call him ‘world-class’ around the place and he’s a very good chance of being that for a long time,” Powell said of his protege afterwards.But Trueman’s night was not done. Although Hull scored their second try through Jack Logan, Castleford finished much the stronger. Jordan Rankin sent James Clare over before Trueman’s reverse kick enabled Rankin to extend the lead further.There was still time for Matt Cook to cross for Castleford’s seventh try in the closing minutes, before Jake Connor was sent to the sin-bin for dissent with seconds remaining. Asked how Hull can manage Connor’s temperament issues, Radford quipped: “Apart from taping his mouth up, I don’t know.”Connor has made plenty of headlines this season for various reasons but for once, this night did not belong to him: it belonged to another young Englishman with the same first name."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6116c6278feefd5daaffce5dce2d0eaecda83551/0_1075_4221_2533/master/4221.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bd9686ce150c460ea4c08ae2b5d580f6","title":"grigor dimitrov us open daniil medvedev semi final","story":"The Bulgarian’s return to form has been dramatic but his semi-final opponent has emerged from the NextGen pack as the best player outside the big threeAfter Grigor Dimitrov’s breathless five-set upset of Roger Federer on Tuesday night, one question stuck in the mind: has there ever been a greater turnaround in a single tournament? Twelve months ago Dimitrov stood handsomely in the top 10, yet over the following year his form turned to dust. He fell 70 spots from eighth to 78th. He struggled with shoulder injuries. Only six weeks ago at a small warm-up tournament in Atlanta, the 28-year-old lost to the 405th-ranked Kevin Kim.Dimitrov stresses that nothing clicked, that his turnaround is a simple consequence of his consistent work through the doubts. Throughout his run to a third career grand slam semi-final, he has played clean, varied tennis with conviction. He dropped only one set en route to the quarter-finals and against Federer, in the middle of battle, he found himself overjoyed by how good his legs felt after so long on the court.Across the net on Friday Daniil Medvedev’s route to his first grand slam semi-final could not have been more different. The 23-year-old was ranked 68th last year but this glorious summer has seen him piece together 19 wins in 20 matches and he will rise to fourth behind Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer – in other words number one among mere mortals. In his semi-final victory over Novak Djokovic his body seemed close to hitting a physical wall, yet through his litany of injuries he marches on.They will try to confound each other in different ways. If Medvedev is feeling good, he will simply try to break Dimitrov by lengthening the rallies to however long Dimitrov can last. The Bulgarian will have to thwart Medvedev’s metronomic rhythm by coming into the net, playing dropshots, attacking the forehand and showing all the talent that he has promised for so long.As Medvedev and Dimitrov relaxed on Wednesday, savouring the extra day of rest they received by the luck of the draw Matteo Berrettini was serving for his first grand slam semi-final and had raucously arrived at match-point against Gaël Monfils. As Berrettini hit the second serve, his grip slipped in his nervy, sweaty hands and the ball fell limply into the net.“I was saying to myself during the match: ‘What do you expect?’” said Berrettini. “You’re 23. Just playing your first quarter-finals and you expect that you not get tight?”As both men battled double faults and nerves, somehow Berrettini recovered for a victory that marked the first time three grand slam semi-finalists were born in the 90s. It is about time players outside the big three started excelling after years of NextGen hype but it is fascinating that the two 23-year-olds to survive should be the two with the least fanfare.As recently as April Berrettini was ranked outside the top 50, his future promising but his ceiling uncertain. He has spent his spring and summer breaking through across three surfaces, winning titles on clay and grass, reaching his first grand slam fourth round at Wimbledon and then thriving in the chaos of New York.He now faces Nadal, who has lost only one set here, and he responded to that by punishing the 2014 champion, Marin Cilic, 6-1, 6-2 in their final two sets. Nadal has won 25 of his last 26 matches and he will attempt to obliterate Berrettini’s weaker backhand as he has done to so many over the years.Berrettini will have to handle pressure, hit his two-handed backhand as well as he ever has and, when Nadal draws out yet another error with his series of wicked, spinning high forehands, have to calm himself in a familiar manner."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4df7ac46b1b678a88d7cf6b25a9ae42cfd07af1a/0_247_4206_2524/master/4206.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=600735974710e7e0d4e3cf8b4ff7f346","title":"joe root bayliss reaction steve smith","story":"• Joe Root and Trevor Bayliss deliver scolding to England team• ‘It’s satisfying to get a big score’ after Headingley, says SmithEngland face an uphill battle to keep their Ashes hopes alive after a scolding from Joe Root was followed by the agony of watching Steve Smith pile on a masterful double-century in Manchester.Root and Trevor Bayliss, the head coach, are understood to have thundered about the team’s poor attitude following their struggles on the wind- and rain-swept opening day – both that evening and before play the next morning – but a response in terms of on-field results was not forthcoming.Instead Smith continued his indomitable run of form with 211 from 319 balls as Australia declared on 497 for eight. The right-hander had made the hosts pay for errors along the way too, surviving a drop by Jofra Archer on 65 and Jack Leach claiming his wicket on 118 only for replays to show a front‑foot no-ball.With Joe Denly falling late in the day to Pat Cummins via a fine catch by Matt Wade at short-leg, Rory Burns and Craig Overton, in as nightwatchman, will resume in the morning with England 23 for one. They need 275 more runs just to avoid the follow-on and know Australia will retain the Ashes if they lose here.Smith, who has 589 runs this series despite sitting out three innings with concussion, said: “It’s satisfying to get a big score. I was disappointed to miss Headingley but I wasn’t quite right and the right call was made. It gave me time to recover and I felt good. I was confident and have got us into a nice position.”On returning to the middle after the blow sustained from an Archer short ball at Lord’s, Smith said: “I faced a lot of short-pitched bowling and haven’t had too many issues. The opposition bowling there means they can’t hit my pad or nick me off. It softens up the ball too and that plays into my hands.”When Smith brought up his third Ashes double-century after tea, tucking the 310th delivery he had faced round the corner off Stuart Broad for a couple of runs, England’s weary cricketers could only applaud the batting on show and think back to missed opportunities.Archer, who ended up with his career-worst first-class figures of none for 97 from 27 overs, had seen a tough return catch off Smith fly past his fingertips in the morning.But the most galling came at the start of the wicketless afternoon session when Smith edged to Ben Stokes at slip only for replays to show Leach had overstepped. The spinner has sent down more than 15,000 deliveries in his first-class career – this was only the eighth no-ball along the way.Two more chances slipped through English fingers – Jason Roy and the substitute Sam Curran gave Tim Paine lives on nine and 49 en route to a half‑century – while Jonny Bairstow let slip some frustration about the pitch.Bairstow said: “To come here from Headingley, where it seamed a bit and did a bit in the first few days, and there be a lot less live grass on it was interesting.“There’s no point talking about the wicket, that’s gone now. We’re playing on the pitch and we’re into day three. No point complaining about that, we’ve got a job to do these next three days. I’m sure those conversations will be had later down the line.”A troubling day was compounded by Stokes pulling up injured with a shoulder problem during his 11th over. England say it is too early to know whether he will bowl again in the match. The all-rounder, who returned after a spell off the field, clearly merits his place as a batsman alone but, if still hampered come the fifth Test, may force a selection change elsewhere."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eb52928274fff4eadfb6036354c9f84ac89252ed/0_649_4295_2577/master/4295.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4ce8c20523b874917028e9c594aee95f","title":"england inept afternoon dark memories 90s ashes","story":"Two and a half hours of spills, thrills and bellyaches put Australia out of sight and the home side may already be thinking about how to surviveFor a while in mid‑afternoon as the score ticked along, the white shapes moved listlessly about the Old Trafford turf and the men in green helmets punched gloves at some fresh milestone, something odd seemed to happen.Squint a little and the picture began to dissolve. Baggy-jeaned ghosts shuffled at the edge of the stands. Jangly guitar music seemed to float across the Manchester skyline. And for two and a half hours between lunch and tea on the second day of this fourth Test England went back to the 90s. In Ashes terms that was the decade of sessions from hell, of howlers and shockers, of bursts of defining English ineptitude. Proper Cricket Men will say you can’t win the Ashes in a session – but you can lose them.It is probably too early to suggest England managed this in Manchester. But they did their very best across a rain-extended middle session that brought two dropped catches the dismissal of Steve Smith, Test cricket’s own next generation terminator, from a front-foot no-ball assorted barks and gripes and fallings-out in the field and finally the departure of Ben Stokes from the field with a twinge (mercifully short-lived) in his shoulder.Get back to the 90s! As the endless afternoon wore on you half expected Martin McCague to come bustling in from the pavilion end, or Ronnie Irani and Mark Lathwell to produce a slapstick fielding mishap on the deep midwicket rope. Either way a position of some strength at lunch, with two early wickets taken, had proved to be fool’s gold blown away by two and a half hours of spills, thrills and bellyaches.It was also a period of illumination as much as anything else. Test cricket is a brutal game, but not brutal in the way it seemed at Headingley, a game of explosive last‑ditch jeopardy. It is instead brutal like this. It wears you thin, peels away the layers, strips out the froth, leaves you pinned and wriggling on the turf.Occasionally it exposes you to the full range of a batting genius like Smith, who continued to do the same thing he has done throughout the series but did so here to a degree that will haunt some of these England players, and indeed the England captain.Smith’s scores now in this series are: 144, 142, 92 and 211, at a time when almost every other top‑order player has appeared to be batting with a length of plastic drainpipe on the deck of a storm-tossed dinghy.Up to this point England have worked around Smith, absorbing the hits at Edgbaston and Lord’s. Here his brilliance became an instrument of torture. The step to leg, the flick off the hip, the thrilling launch through cover: England’s bowlers will see these things in their sleep. Plus there’s the other stuff. It can’t be easy acting as Australia’s 12th man when Smith is batting: Wait … What’s he asking for? Gloves? Bat? Fly-swat? Yard of ale? Or … Just having a think?Smith was at the wicket as that session of pain began after lunch. Fittingly, perhaps, he was on 101. Australia had gone to lunch 245 for five, a door England will have felt they could kick down with a little early intensity. Instead they brought something else.The fourth ball after lunch saw Tim Paine dropped at second slip by Jason Roy, a fumble from a toe‑edged drive off a wide half‑volley. Roy doesn’t field at slip for Surrey. By the end of this session he wasn’t fielding at slip for England. Batting form and catching confidence have often seemed to go hand in hand. But he probably shouldn’t have been there.Then, four overs later, came the gut-punch. Jack Leach tossed out a slower, wider ball. Smith drove and edged to Stokes, who took a good low catch. At which point enter: the horror. As Smith walked off the TV replays showed Leach had overstepped, ankle dangling just short of the line. After Headingley, England’s No 11 had been hailed as a kind of village‑cricket everyman. This felt like a slightly vicious punchline.Joe Root chided his players. An over later Jonny Bairstow was involved in a brief altercation with Smith over an absent-minded double-hit of the ball. Stokes wandered off in the middle of an over flexing his shoulder. And half an hour before tea his substitute dropped Paine again, Sam Curran putting down a low chance at straight midwicket off Archer. Paine had gone from nine to 49 between drops. By the end of that extended dissolve Australia had moved to 369 for five and over the hill and out of sight in this game.All that remains for England is to escape, intact, to the Oval and a possible decider. Perhaps in time Old Trafford’s unhappy Thursday afternoon might come to look like the horror session where England dropped the Ashes, no-balled the Ashes, then dropped the Ashes again. But this wasn’t really a turning point. It was more a kind of reveal, a moment to strip bare whatever pretensions this England group might have towards being a functioning, settled group of red‑ball players.Headingley, Stokes, and one astonishing day of cricket kept them level in this series. Either side of that Test Smith has baffled both the bowlers and the captain. Australia’s pace and spin attack has looked more settled and more potent.

When that embryonic, concert adaptation was announced in New York in 2016, it triggered a social media backlash because, though the story was set in Africa, the majority of the cast were white.The producer of the British show, Michael McCabe, speaking at a launch event in the capital on Thursday, said: “We all went into it feeling very strongly that the show … should be a true reflection of our society. That it was about now as much as it was about being authentic to the time the story is set. This show needs to resonate with all audiences, and it cannot achieve that if what you are seeing is not a mirror of all of us.”He said lessons had been learned from the casting row: “It focused everyone. We all need to think harder everyone needs to think more carefully. In the same way you would not want to go to a Shakespeare production and see an all white cast. It would be kind of shocking.”All areas of the arts have come under greater scrutiny over ersity. Last month a group of actors and writers published an open letter criticising the lack of Jewish actors in a London revival of the musical Falsettos. However, producers of the show, which tells the story of a dysfunctional Jewish family, said it would not have been appropriate to ask about actors’ religious beliefs during auditions.McCabe said the erse casting for The Prince of Egypt had happened organically as they, too, had not asked about race or religion during auditions. Instead choices had been made on ability and how right people were for the role. “We were very lucky with who wanted to be considered for the show,” he said. “The industry has significantly changed. It is an exciting time to cast a show like this.”Though the musical is based on the film, it is also markedly different, say its producers. The London version will feature 10 new songs as well as five from the original film, including the showstopper When you Believe, a hit for Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey. All the songs were written by Stephen Schwartz, the composer behind Godspell and Wicked.The cast, mostly actors at the start of their careers, includes Luke Brady and Liam Tamne as the two male leads, Moses and Ramses.Rehearsals for the show, directed by Stephen Schwartz’s son Scott Schwartz, will begin in December and its opening night will be at the Dominion Theatre in London on 25 February."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8249963a2e54850cc3bf229f1049340b7c2410ea/197_349_2257_1354/master/2257.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c55ac77c057c3aaf7accef899d4548b1","title":"tesla model 3 was uk third best selling car in august","story":"Sales of electric vehicles overall have doubled in the past yearThe Tesla Model 3 has rapidly become the UK’s third most popular new car as sales of electric vehicles overall doubled in the past year.New owners registered 2,082 Tesla Model 3 cars in August, according to data published on Thursday by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT).The figures meant Model 3 registrations overtook popular cars including the Ford Focus, the Vauxhall Corsa and the Mercedes-Benz A-Class in August.

FrankFirst, some background. Microsoft used to provide new versions of Windows every three or more years, and support them for 10 years. Examples included Windows XP and Windows 7. They didn’t change unless Microsoft released a service pack update, such as Windows 7 SP1.When it launched Windows 10 four years ago, Microsoft switched to delivering “Windows as a Service” (WaaS). Now the operating system is updated every month, at no charge, with two “milestone” releases each year. These are named after their intended release dates, such as Windows 10 1809 and 1903. (The March update, 1903, was actually released in May.)Thanks to WaaS, there are no more expensive “big bang” updates, which used to cause large organisations enormous pain and left some of them clinging to obsolete versions of Windows for more than a decade. Smaller, more frequent updates are much easier to handle, especially using tools such as WSUS (Windows Server Update Services), SCCM (System Center Configuration Manager) and WUfB (Windows Update for Business). They are a bit of a pain for some home users, but Microsoft is trying to alleviate any problems.With WaaS, Microsoft also changed its support system. It now has a Modern Lifecycle Policy where basic versions of Windows 10 are only supported for 18 months. You have lost the 10 years of support, but your support now continues for ever, as long as you keep installing new versions of Windows 10. In reality, “for ever” means for as long as your device can run them.The net result is that Microsoft is still supporting at least three versions of Windows, but the three will usually have been launched about six months apart, instead of three years apart.You are, I deduce, running Windows 10 version 1803: this was released on 30 April 2018, and reaches the end of its supported life on 12 November 2019. So Windows Update is telling you, correctly, that this version is up to date.However, you have failed to install either of the two latest milestone releases, 1809 and 1903. You therefore have an up-to-date version of an out-of-date version of Windows 10. Your current version does not need updating, it needs replacing. This is what you should do.You are in much the same position as someone who is still running an up-to-date version of Windows 7, having skipped later releases. The main differences are that the timescales are much shorter and the upgrades are now free.Microsoft would like everyone to be on the same version of Windows, and it would not be economic to support 10 or 20 different versions. It is therefore using the end of support – and the end of security fixes – to push users into updating their systems, even though the Windows 10 Enterprise version of 1803 will be supported for another year (until 10 November 2020).These PCs are less of a burden because large organisations use tools such as WSUS to update thousands of PCs, rather than each one downloading the code separately. Either way, Microsoft must still be producing security fixes for 1803 it just won’t let you have them.With WaaS, not everybody gets the code at the same time, as you might expect. Instead, the task of updating more than 800m PCs is spread over many months.A few million people want the latest version, even if it isn’t finished. They join the “insider ring” of beta testers, who look for bugs before the operating system is released to a wider audience. Some are what Microsoft calls “seekers”: they check manually for updates and install them as soon as they become available. Most people just ignore new versions until they are reminded to install them, or – if they really are not paying attention – the installation is practically under way.In general, it’s safer to install milestone updates later rather than sooner. If you upgrade to version 1903 now, you will get a version that has had months of testing, and that has already been installed on hundreds of millions of PCs. If you wait for the “fall version”, currently called 19H2, then you will get code that hasn’t been as thoroughly debugged. Also, it will be a bigger leap from 1803, and big leaps are inherently riskier than small ones.You don’t have to be on the current version of Windows 10, where some new features may introduce a few new bugs. However, it’s a bad idea to fall two or three versions behind.The mass upgrade process depends on a lot of machine learning based on feedback from telemetry. The PCs that seem easiest to upgrade correctly are offered updates before the ones that look trickier. As bugs are found and fixed, updates are offered to more and more PCs.Updates are sometimes suspended for various reasons. It happened to some PCs that had not been patched for the Meltdown and Spectre vulnerabilities. With 1903, some users were put on hold because their PCs were running an outdated Intel Rapid Storage Technology (RST) driver. In my case, the warning went away and Microsoft installed a Microsoft driver. For the reader who wasn’t so lucky, it should have been fixed by the KB4512941 update on 30 August.Update attempts can also fail because your PC does not have enough storage space. You need enough room for the version of Windows that is running, the version you have downloaded, and a security copy of the old version of Windows 10 in case you need to roll back a failed upgrade. This backup is now deleted after about 10 days it used to be about 30 days.Otherwise, you may be able to solve update problems by downloading the Update Assistant.You can also contact Microsoft support via the “Get help” link on the right hand side of the Windows Update page in the Settings (cogwheel) app. I tried it once, got instant help, and it was helpful. The Microsoft Support web page for Windows 10 offers further options including “call me back”, “schedule a call”, and “ask the community” (by posting in the support forum).The current 1903May 2019 version of Windows 10 is a bit more flexible. You can click a pause button to “pause updates for 7 days” or skip down to “Advanced options” and pause updates for up to 35 days. You can pick a date when you want to resume, which is useful for business trips and holidays. After 35 days, you have to install some updates before you can pause it again.With the forthcoming 19H21909 version, Microsoft plans further changes. In particular, it will try using the same trick as major browsers: install feature updates without turning them on. This introduces an exciting new three-letter abbreviation: CFR (Controlled Feature Rollout). Microsoft defines this as: “A method to progressively rollout new features by gradually increasing the audience in a controlled manner.” In other words, every PC will get the same updates, but new features will be turned on gradually while telemetry checks that they are working correctly.According to Microsoft’s John Cable, who is in charge of Windows servicing and delivery, the aim is to make the twice-yearly updates more like the monthly updates. In the same blogpost, he said: “Anyone running the May 2019 update and updating to the new release will have a far faster update experience.”Have you got a question?

This time it’s a dramatised account rather than a documentary – The Loudest Voice (Sky Atlantic) is a seven-part miniseries starring Russell Crowe as Roger Ailes, the former Republican strategist who was hired by Rupert Murdoch in 1995 and a year later gave television Fox News, the truth-mauling ratings monster that would end up eating the world.We first meet Ailes as he is fired from CNN as a result of the sexual harassment allegations piling up against him. It will come as no surprise to learn that his behaviour does not markedly change once he has his own news network to run. As he gathers his team about him, men are recruited on the basis of their killer instincts and ethical detachment, women on the basis of whether they look good in skirts and don’t kick up a fuss when he makes his predatory moves on them.The problems that The Loudest Voice faces are several – some inherent to the subject, some of its own making. Among the former (leaving aside the additional difficulties presented by a UK audience nowhere near as steeped in Fox lore as the production’s native one) is the fact that Ailes remains throughout such a deeply unpleasant, one-dimensional character (as megalomaniacs tend to be). Without much in the way of a developmental – let alone redemptive – arc, the viewer tires of him almost as quickly as his beleaguered crew does the great difference being that we have the option to walk away without consequence and enjoy the rest of our lives without him.More challenging, at least dramatically speaking, is the fact that Fox News is now old news. We are so steeped in its results and ramifications that it is hard even to see Ailes as the visionary he undoubtedly was. The political strategist in him knew early on that his success would again lie in “turning out the base” – in this case, the half of the country that didn’t recognise itself in the liberal media or messages and were ripe for the picking by someone who gave them a non-mealy-mouthed alternative. Thus the news channel engineered to create precisely that, with the chutzpah of sporting the motto “Fair and balanced” obscuring the deliberate uncoupling from any journalistic or professional standards that might have made it so.The problems of The Loudest Voice’s own making are simply that, from the prosthetics used to turn Crowe into the fat, balding Ailes and Sienna Miller into a facsimile of his wife, Beth, to the script, it’s not good enough. Not in a landscape dominated by excoriating documentaries on similar subjects and by stylish and sophisticated limited series such as Ryan Murphy’s American Crime Story anthology that manage to reconstruct real-life events compellingly while using them to scrutinise American history and illuminate current affairs in new, important and broadly appealing ways. The Loudest Voice is a straightforward retelling of an essentially straightforward story, and it won’t do. This goes double for the prosthetics. Crowe’s bald head is barely one step up from a beige swimming cap with wire wool stuck around the edges.There is so much gone to waste here. It could have been an unsettlingly detailed look at how the big players widened – then smashed – the Overton window, making any and all ideas, however hateful, not just tolerable in public but eventually unchallengeable by any civilised means. It could have been a forensic dismantling of the fake news phenomenon and its co-option by increasingly malevolent forces, or an interrogation of the neglect of people in American heartlands that left them so desperate for representation and a saviour. It could have been any number of things, but it has settled for being a study of one man and the showcase for Crowe’s bid for an Emmy – which he may deserve, if only for trying to do so much with so little.It has – at least in the few episodes made available late in the day in the UK (in the interests of fairness and balance, I should note that I have heard rumours of improvement in the latter half of the series) – about as much light and shade as the thunderously arrogant and relentlessly ambitious Ailes did himself."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d8ed05a217fa5f859c70192d339506b621f46dda/0_324_4954_2972/master/4954.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e192329b90be4dbdda1a9525f9b2dd94","title":"iowa 2020 primary elections vacation","story":"Some vacationers ‘too depressed by UK politics’ are heading to Iowa, the state with an outsized importance in the nominee process, to witness the primary electionsFor many people, a vacation to the US means heading up New York’s Empire State Building, descending into the Grand Canyon in Arizona or splashing about in the Pacific Ocean in California.Some, however, are choosing to whet their appetites differently, by instead traveling to Iowa, in the middle of the US, to witness the presidential primary elections in person.“I’m kind of too depressed by UK politics,” said Edward Gray, a 21-year-old law student from Essex. “So I thought I might as well come and be depressed by US politics.”To that end, Gray committed to spending a month in Iowa, along with 24 others. They had booked through Politrip, a bespoke travel company that charges $1,200 a person to ship them around Democratic campaign events.Iowa has an outsized importance in selecting a party’s nominee for president. It is the first state to vote in the primary process, and a good – or bad – performance here can make or break presidential campaigns. This year, more than 20 presidential hopefuls are crisscrossing Iowa, kissing babies, eating bad food and sitting on tractors, all with the hope of winning the February 2020 caucus.“I thought the opportunity to come out here and possibly meet a couple of candidates was an opportunity I didn’t want to miss.”Gray ended up seeing 23 out of 24 major candidates – many of those at the Iowa state fair, where the  met some of the mostly British and Irish holidaymakers. The fair, a sprawling exhibition of livestock, fairground rides, bars and deep-fried food served on a stick, is a must-visit for presidential hopefuls. Over the course of a week the majority of the 24 Democratic candidates made an appearance, along with less-heralded independent contenders and Bill Weld, a Republican challenger to Donald Trump.Politrip is the brainchild of Paddy Brown, a Northern Ireland-based PhD student and American politics enthusiast. According to Brown, its a mixed bunch of people on the trip.“A couple of lawyers have come out, a couple of people working in retail, and a lot in between,” Brown said as he hung out at the “soapbox” stage, an area of the fair reserved for presidential candidates to attempt to charm the crowd: Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren spoke over the weekend.Many of the political vacationers end up volunteering for campaigns – they can express their preferred candidate in advance – with people knocking on doors in support of candidates such as the New Jersey senator Cory Booker and Warren.“There’s a couple of people just working summer jobs trying to figure out their next steps, and a lot of people actually who want to do this to get campaign cycle experience on their CV,” said Brown.One of the most intriguing aspects of the 2020 Democratic race is the number of candidates – many of whom have, to put it generously, little chance of winning. As Brown and the  chatted, a slight man wearing black jeans took to the soapbox stage.“Who’s that?” said one woman.“His name is … Joe Sestak,” her partner replied, reading haltingly from a pamphlet.The higher-profile candidates are, understandably, more of a draw.Etienne Seymour, from Southampton, was wearing a T-shirt in support of Warren, who is currently vying with Sanders for second place in the polls. Seymour, 22, had spent days knocking on doors touting Warren’s policies, and had also been deployed to cheer for the senator at rallies.“I got a hug from her. I’ve had two now,” Seymour said.To pay for the trip, Seymour had taken a job at John Lewis during her summer break from Nottingham University, where she studies international relations. Seymour hopes the experience will boost her CV – but she was also keen to sample some of Iowa’s more unusual offerings.“I want to see the butter cow,” she said – a cow modelled from butter which has become an Iowa state fair staple.“And I do want to try a corn dog.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7112f4f33dff92094586016a13b75fff4ca64fc5/0_69_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=657df8a2cd817a55aeac34c8cb38d26d","title":"mike pence ireland shat on the carpet","story":"The vice-president’s comments on Brexit while visiting Ireland and his stay at his boss’s golf course did not go down wellMissteps during Mike Pence’s visit to Ireland that included controversial praise of the British prime minister, Boris Johnson, have led to accusations of betrayal and “humiliation”.One  columnist concluded that the vice-president, a “much-anticipated visitor”, turned out to have “shat on the … carpet”.Pence’s problems started with his decision to stay for two nights at Donald Trump’s golf resort in Doonbeg, County Clare, more than 140 miles from Dublin, necessitating costly and logistically complex travel. The move quickly drew fire from ethics experts and political rivals.The House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, called Trump’s properties a “cesspool of corruption” and accused the president of “prioritizing his profits over the interests of the American people”.“Pence is just the latest Republican elected official to enable President Trump’s violations of the constitution,” she said.A spokesman for the vice-president said the decision was partly based on the president’s suggestion Pence stay there, and partly on secret service concerns about costs and logistics. Questioned about the decision on Wednesday, Trump claimed he had “no involvement, other than it’s a great place”.But that was only the start of the controversy.The  columnist Miriam Lord responded to a tense meeting between the vice-president and the taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, in which Pence urged the republic to protect the “United Kingdom’s sovereignty”. That Varadkar is gay and Pence a past champion of anti-LGBTQ legislation in Indiana also caused widespread comment.Pence laid on platitudes about being “deeply humbled” and “honoured” to be visiting Doonbeg, the home of his mother’s grandmother. But in Dublin he offered his hosts a clear lesson in his administration’s political priorities.“Let me be clear: the US supports the UK decision to leave the EU in Brexit,” Pence told Varadkar in a prepared statement. “But we also recognise the unique challenges on your northern border. And I can assure you we will continue to encourage the United Kingdom and Ireland to ensure that any Brexit respects the Good Friday agreement.”Among media responses, Irish Central asked: “Did VP Pence betray Ireland in his Brexit comments during Irish trip?”The Irish Examiner accused Pence of trying to “humiliate” the republic.But Lord struck the most telling blow.She described the impact of the Pence visit on Ireland as “like pulling out all the stops for a much-anticipated visitor to your home and thinking it has been a great success until somebody discovers he shat on the new carpet in the spare room, the one you bought specially for him”.“As Pence read from the autocue and Irish eyes definitely stopped smiling,” she added, “it was clear he was channeling His Master’s Voice. Trump is a fan of Brexit and of Boris.”“Pence,” Lord continued, “is Irish American and wastes no opportunity to go misty-eyed about his love for the ‘Old Country’ as he lards on his Mother Machree schtick on both sides of the Atlantic.”Lord wasn’t alone in her criticism. The Cork Examiner’s political editor, Daniel McConnell, wrote: “The cheek of him coming here, eating our food, clogging up our roads and then having the nerve to humiliate his hosts.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/06ad1c0da5f253951ae49727b6130518804fabc5/0_0_2768_1662/master/2768.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=94a9b573b3721e602df0960db5860e32","title":"american philippines baby human trafficking charge","story":"Jennifer Erin Talbot arrested at Manila airport after hiding six-day-old baby in a sling bagA US woman who attempted to carry a six-day-old baby out of the Philippines hidden inside a sling bag has been arrested at Manila’s airport and charged with human trafficking.Jennifer Erin Talbot was able to pass through the airport immigration counter without declaring the baby boy but was intercepted at the boarding gate by airline personnel.Talbot, 43, was unable to produce any passport, boarding pass or government permits for the baby, airport officials said.Public records indicate she had been living in Utah. Talbot had planned to board a Delta Air Lines flight to the United States with the baby, airport officials said.“There was really an intention to hide the baby,” an immigration official, Grifton Medina, said by telephone.After discovering the baby, airline staff called immigration personnel, who arrested Talbot at the airport. She was later handed over to the National Bureau of Investigation and the baby was turned over to government welfare personnel.The NBI said Talbot presented an affidavit at the airport, allegedly from the baby’s mother, identified as Maricris Dulap, giving consent for the baby to travel to the US, but it had not been signed by the mother.Officials said no government travel approval had been issued for the baby, prompting them to file human trafficking charges against Talbot. The charges carry a maximum penalty of life imprisonment. Talbot also violated at least two other laws on child abuse, kidnapping and illegal detention, the NBI said.US embassy officials were notified of Talbot’s arrest and told Philippine authorities that she had no criminal record in the US, an NBI official, Manuel Dimaano, said.Dimaano said Dulap gave her baby to Talbot in southern Davao city. He said investigators will try to determine how Talbot brought the baby out of Davao, which requires a city clearance for infants to be transported by a foreigner.The baby’s parents have been charged under a child protection law but have not been placed under arrest, although the mother has been interviewed by social welfare officers, Dimaano said.He said Dulap told the officers that she wanted to offer her baby for adoption, and there was no indication that she had sold the baby.Dimaano said when he and other officials asked Talbot what she intended to do with the baby, she replied that she just wanted to give it “a name and a church blessing”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d7f4108881072a928fefc416ec13d9cd44ff774b/0_123_2657_1594/master/2657.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c915387f57851d7c50f337d87971503a","title":"berlins panda cubs cause debate about chinese human rights","story":"Competition to name Meng Meng’s twins intensifies pressure on German governmentThey may have captured the public’s imagination, but the tiny, pink panda cubs born at Berlin zoo a few days ago have also spurred a national debate about whether panda diplomacy is blinding Germany to the Chinese government’s human rights record.As visitors and journalists queue around the block to catch a glimpse of Meng Meng’s cubs, a competition to name them has increased pressure on the government of Angela Merkel, who kicked off a trip to Beijing with a large economic delegation on Thursday.The German tabloid Bild has called on Berliners to choose Hong and Kong as names for the cubs, in recognition of the protests that have been taking place in the territory for the past three months. Der Tagesspiegel newspaper has also taken up the baton, with its readers favouring Hong and Kong above the alternatives Yin and Yang, Ping and Pong, Plisch and Plum, and Max and Moritz, after a favourite German children’s story.“Bild is choosing to call the panda cubs Hong and Kong because it’s China’s brutal politics that lies behind these panda babies,” Bild wrote in a headline story on Thursday. “Bild is demanding of the German government that it reacts in a political way to the birth of these small bears.” Even Hong Kong activists have been pulled into the debate, with the leading protester Joshua Wong urging the zoo to call the cubs Democracy and Freedom. “That way Germany could send a very clear signal to China,” Wong told Bild.The animal rights campaign group Peta said it was an opportune time to draw attention to pandas’ exploitation. “The panda babies face a sad life as a public attraction. They will never get to know their natural habitat in the mountain forests of China,” said a spokesman. “They have only been bred in the first place because of politics, prestige and profit.”Germany has been renting six-year-old Meng Meng (which means Sweet Dream) and her companion, Jiao Qing, nine – who is the cubs’ father – from the Chinese government for €1m (£900,000) a year since 2017, under an agreement valid for 15 years.Merkel and the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, opened the bears’ enclosure together amid huge fanfare, in what was billed as an expression of friendship between the two industrial power rivals.And the pandas have proved to be the hoped-for visitor magnet. A record of 5 million visitors last year was put down to the presence of the pandas, which are by far the zoo’s most popular attraction, with the queues to see them often stretching through the zoo.There has been no official word yet on the cubs’ future. But according to the agreement drawn up between Berlin and Beijing, the cubs officially belong to China, which will in all probability reserve its right to name them. The cubs are likely to be sent to China in about three or four years’ time when they are able to fend for themselves.Vets and carers have been flown into Berlin from China to care for the cubs who, when they are not being breastfed by their mother, are being housed in incubators borrowed from the Charité hospital’s neonatal unit. The zoo said the public would be able to see them in November, “by which time they should look more like panda bears”, according to a spokesman, who said the zoo was expecting another surge in visitors."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d3169db46896ef2a4b8c198852693f24a862cf50/0_109_5106_3064/master/5106.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=135b7a492fc4961686c62fc400589d6a","title":"german city bielefeld offers 1m for proof it doesnt exist","story":"Bielefeld’s marketing office aims to exploit ‘conspiracy theory’ spawned by joke in 1994It started off as a throwaway remark by a student who expressed faux incredulity at meeting someone from the western German town of Bielefeld.“Das gibt’s doch gar nicht,” or “that simply cannot be,” Achim Held, an IT student, said at a party in 1994, giving birth to what became known as the Bielefeld conspiracy. The jokey theory that Held concocted and shared with friends was initially something akin to a parlour game in which participants had to use their skills of persuasion to argue that Bielefeld, Germany’s 20th largest city, was actually a figment of the imagination.Twenty-five years later, it has a cult following, helped in large part by the internet. Held, now a computer expert, believes it continues to serve its initial purpose of ridiculing all popular conspiracy theories. For those who may be offended by the idea that Bielefeld does not exist, he insists the choice of city was pure accident.That has not stopped the city’s marketing department from using the Bielefeld conspiracy’s popularity to help boost a low key, some would say nondescript, profile.Around 2,000 people have now taken up the offer to enter a competition promising a €1m (£896,000) reward to anyone who can present solid proof that Bielefeld really is made up. Launched last month, it invited participants to “by all means be infinitely creative” but to “deliver incontrovertible evidence”.Following Wednesday night’s deadline for entries, marketing chiefs are poring over the answers, 300 of which have come from abroad, and will announce the winning result on 17 September. “We are having lots of laughs,” a spokesman said.Previous evidence offered of the non-existence of the city, which if history books are to be believed was founded in the 15th century and became home to a thriving cloth industry, include the closing of its autobahn exit roads for major road works in 1993 and the fact that train timetables indicate impossibly tight gaps between the stopping and continuing of a journey.Cars with BI number plates, indicating that they come from Bielefeld, are sent across the country as part of the attempt to keep up appearances. The CIA, Mossad and aliens are cited as being behind the conspiracy, using Bielefeld as a cover for what has even been suggested might be the entrance to Atlantis, the fictional island mentioned by Plato.Even Angela Merkel has entered the realm of the Bielefeld conspiracy, referring in 2012 to a town hall meeting she had attended there “ ... if it exists at all”. She said: “I had the impression that I was there ... I do hope I’ll be able to return.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9f38767e1df2774104e8275225ee64559078a8e0/0_251_4708_2824/master/4708.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=53a6106804f17a9078f690816ba74ae8","title":"hong kong withdraws delegation from dsei arms fair in london","story":"Teargas canisters made in the UK have previously been used on protesters in the territoryHong Kong is no longer sending a delegation to next week’s DSEI arms fair in London, a month after it emerged that the UK government had invited representatives from the territory to visit.The decision to pull out was confirmed in a parliamentary answer by Graham Stuart, a junior international trade minister, in response to a question from a Labour MP following a report in the  last month.Vicky Foxcroft had asked the international trade secretary, Liz Truss, why Hong Kong had been invited to the arms show, prompting Stuart to say it had “recently confirmed it is not attending”.Hong Kong is mired in its worst political crisis since the British handover of the territory to China in 1997. Police have fired at least 2,000 rounds of teargas during the protests that broke out in June over a now-abandoned extradition law.DSEI, which starts on Tuesday, is the biggest arms fair in Europe, featuring 1,600 exhibitors and more than 40 country pavilions. Companies showcase security and crowd control equipment as well as land, sea and air technology.Canisters recovered by protesters show that some of the CS gas used in Hong Kong had been manufactured by a British company, Chemring, at a factory in Derby. That prompted Jeremy Hunt, the former foreign secretary, to announce an export ban on crowd-control equipment. Britain had licensed £9.4m of arms sales and security equipment to Hong Kong since 2014.Eight other countries identified by the Foreign Office as priorities in its latest annual review of human rights and democracy are still listed as attending.They include Saudi Arabia, where British ministers’ failure to consider the impact of civilian casualties in Yemen from bombing by the Saudi air force has led the court of appeal to declare that UK exports had been conducted unlawfully until a proper assessment is carried out.Another is Bahrain. Two staff from the Gulf state’s embassy in London were accused this week of assaulting an activist who climbed on to the roof of the five-storey building in Belgravia in protest at the pending execution of two men. The embassy has denied the claim.The other six priority countries the Department of International Trade has invited to the DSEI are Bangladesh, Colombia, Egypt, Israel, Pakistan and Uzbekistan."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f3a081f7e75cd27e5c0b30123245c681317eac6c/0_4_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=be2e92c7093ae117f8d8fd4587c758ca","title":"hurricane dorian latest us strength path","story":"After hammering the Bahamas and leaving at least 20 dead, Hurricane Dorian began raking the south-east US seaboard, with the eye hitting the North Carolina coast on Thursday evening.The threat to the US remains real but in the Bahamas the storm has left such terrible devastation that the authorities were still struggling to get aid to stricken areas and the death toll is expected to rise, perhaps steeply.Dorian made landfall over Abaco and Grand Bahama on Sunday, then stayed where it was, the nation’s strongest hurricane on record. Category 5 winds of up to 185mph obliterated entire neighborhoods and triggered a humanitarian crisis.On Thursday Luíz David Rodriguez, the programme manager for the NGO Direct Relief, spoke to the  from Abaco, via satellite phone. He had witnessed disturbing scenes outside the island’s main health clinic, near Marsh Harbour.The clinic has the capacity to deal with about 20 people but Rodriguez estimated there were between 1,500 and 2,000 people waiting in the area around it.“Lots of people are just laying around,” he said, “waiting to get off the island. People are getting a little desperate.”It was too early to properly assess the most pressing health concerns, he said, suggesting many were simply exhausted. Aid groups have been struggling to deliver basic supplies due to the level of destruction. On Thursday, some planes were able to land.“Everything is destroyed,” Rodriguez said, adding that much of the flooding had begun to subside.The final death toll could be very high in Abaco alone, with the government reportedly taking delivery of at least 200 body bags, according to local media on Thursday.At the Bahamas National Emergency Management Agency headquarters in the capital, Nassau, a delegation of Caribbean leaders set off for a flyover trip to see the destruction on the Abaco Islands.Mia Mottley, the prime minister of Barbados, spoke about her thoughts on Dorian’s links to the climate crisis. She did not pull her punches.“We are on the frontline of the consequences of climate change but we don’t cause it,” she said. “And the vulnerability that attaches therefore to us is a matter we’re trying to get the international community to deal with consistently.”She added: “People say the words and hear you, but they don’t follow through so that I have every confidence. Now that the last few years are beginning to show others that frontline states, whether it’s an island in the Caribbean or states in the US or cities, all of us who are continuously being affected, have to recognise that this doesn’t happen out of the blue.“The warmer waters do what? They fuel the growth and the strength of hurricanes.”Sarah St George, the chairman of the Grand Bahama Port Authority, told the  that the “force and size” of Dorian took everyone by surprise.In Abaco, some dazed survivors struggled back towards shantytown homes on Thursday, but found them razed.The small community, known as the Mudd and built by Haitian migrants over decades was reduced to splinters. The people picked through debris, avoiding a body underneath a tree branch with its hands stretched toward the sky – one of at least nine bodies reported in the area.“Ain’t nobody come to get them,” said Cardot Ked, a carpenter, originally from Haiti, who had lived in Abaco for 25 years.Meanwhile, with winds still at 110mph on Thursday, Dorian was a threat to hundreds of miles of US coastline. The US National Hurricane Center (NHC) said it was expected to gradually weaken through Saturday.The core of the storm hit North Carolina on Thursday evening local time, with sustained winds of at least 100mph.The NHC warned of life-threatening storm surge, flash-flooding and dangerous winds reaching into Virginia “regardless of the exact track of Dorian’s center”.The North Carolina governor, Roy Cooper, had urged residents on Thursday “to stay in a safe place and off the roads”, warning “we have a long night ahead of us” as conditions deteriorated.Dorian swept past Florida at a relatively safe distance, grazed Georgia, then began hugging the South Carolina coastline with howling winds and sideways rain.An estimated 3 million people in Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas were warned to evacuate. Navy ships were ordered to ride it out at sea and aircraft were moved inland. At least four deaths in the south-eastern US so far have been blamed on the storm.In Charleston, South Carolina, a historic port city of handsome antebellum homes on a peninsula prone to flooding, the power flickered on and off as the storm shrieked in and flooding began. Dorian spun off tornados in the Carolinas, damaging homes.By late morning in coastal Wilmington, North Carolina, rain swept sideways, trees bent and traffic lights swayed.Additional reporting by Edward Helmore and agencies."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1f2d921a45c9434d18ec43899c13d36c1115d7ba/0_124_6300_3781/master/6300.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0e5aa63e4a8d7f8d205c1670066936e5","title":"justin trudeau china canada beijing","story":"Justin Trudeau has accused Beijing of using “arbitrary detentions” as a tool in pursuit of political goals in the latest broadside in a diplomatic and trade row with China.“Using arbitrary detention as a tool to achieve political goals, international or domestic, is something that is of concern not just to Canada but to all our allies,” Trudeau told the Toronto Star editorial board.He said nations including Britain, France, Germany and the United States “have been highlighting that this is not acceptable behaviour in the international community because they are all worried about China engaging in the same kinds of pressure tactics with them”.Canada’s relations with China soured after its arrest of Chinese Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou on a US warrant last December.Nine days later, Beijing detained two Canadians – former diplomat Michael Kovrig and businessman Michael Spavor – and accused them of espionage in a move widely viewed as retaliation.They are among a string of foreign nationals arrested in China and charged with espionage or attempting to steal state secrets.﻿Trudeau added that “we need to figure out how to engage with them, but we also have to be clear-eyed about it, that China plays by a very different set of rules and principles than we do in the west”.His comments may further inflame tensions between the two countries, which had appeared to be trying to move on from the row. This week both Beijing and Ottawa nominated new ambassadors, although a spokesman for the Chinese foreign minstry this week urged Canada to “reflect on its mistakes” and immediately release Meng.“At present, China-Canada relations are facing serious difficulties,” Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said at a daily briefing.Geng said China hopes the new Canadian envoy Dominic Barton can play an active role in returning ties to a “normal track”.The previous Canadian ambassador John McCallum was fired in January after he said it would be “great” if the US dropped its extradition request for the Huawei executive.

He also became the first vice-president to speak at the openly anti-LGBT Family Research Council’s annual conference in 2018.Bloomberg’s White House correspondent, Justin Sink, pointed out on Twitter that Jóhannesson had been wearing a rainbow bracelet in pictures showing him shaking Pence’s hand. Iceland’s first lady, Eliza Reid, also wore a rainbow bracelet for the occasion.Johannesson also previously wore the bracelet to meet the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, who is a supporter of anti-LGBT laws.Pence’s arrival in Iceland also raised eyebrows because of the amount of security he brought with him, including military jets and personnel, in a nation ranked as the world’s most peaceful.On Tuesday, Donald Trump said Pence could not be “anti-gay” because he had agreed to meet the Irish taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, who is gay, and his partner during an official visit to Ireland."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/02f7a61f8539231213584436dafea0b73426d55d/0_179_5387_3234/master/5387.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=80beda578212a0751d329edd5cc7d773","title":"hurricane dorian hammers the bahamas in pictures","story":"Images show the extent of flooding in cities including Nassau and Dorian this week"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4009387.1567713554!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"students stage walkout over lack of subjects being taught through irish","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tStudents of Coláiste Lú, Dundalk along with parents  walk from the school to the LMETB offices to protest about being forced to learn in English. Photograph: Alan BetsonStudents at a school in Dundalk staged a walkout from their classrooms on Thursday morning over claims school authorities are limiting the provision of Irish medium education.Expressing dissatisfaction and anger at the lack of subjects being taught through Irish at Coláiste Lú, students marched to the Dundalk offices of school patron LMETB (Louth and Meath Education and Training Board) to hand in a petition addressed to the its director of schools.Coláiste Lú is an Irish-medium unit, or aonad, at the larger English-medium Coláiste Chú Chulainn. Units such as Coláiste Lú are provided for where the Department of Education has determined it is not feasible to establish a stand-alone Irish-medium post-primary school but where demand does exist for some Irish-medium provision.Parents say they were left with little option but to protest publicly after a number of teachers left the school during the summer and Coláiste Lú students had to take lessons with students from the larger English-medium Coláiste Cú Chulainn.Aidan Kinsella who is a parent at the school and is secretary of the parents committee, Comhairle na dTuistí de Choláiste Lú, said parents had previously been given assurances the core subjects would be taught through the medium of Irish.ExamsHe said the reduction in Irish-medium provision has had an adverse impact in particular on students preparing for exams.Students currently in third and sixth year who had previously studied in an immersive Irish language learning environment now have to “relearn the entire syllabus through English and learn technical terms they hadn’t done before,” he said.He said migrant parents who do not speak English in the home attended a recent committee meeting.“They arrived in this country and made a commitment to the Irish language and they don’t have that natural English fall-back to be able to support their children when they are in an exam year learning new terminology. It is horrendous,” he said.Parents of students at Coláiste Lú say the LMETB inherited a Gael Choláiste at its inception and has a responsibility “to promote and nurture” the Irish language. They are calling on the board to publicly commit to Irish-medium education at Coláiste Lú.School principal Tomás Sharkey said he recently became aware of a shortfall in the hours allocated for special needs teaching provision at Coláiste Chú ChulainnColáiste Lú. Ensuring the needs of students are met with the resources made available by the department would be a challenge.“When the available teaching resources are allocated, the resources are not there to teach higher-level mathematics to classes with two students through Irish, or physics through Irish to classes of three students, or accountancy to four students or to teach four people in second level English.”He said if the parents want him to provide this service the needs of students with learning difficulties would not be met.“I have to use the teaching hours I have fairly, which means I cannot provide for tiny classes,” he said.The LMETB said in a press statement: “The Aonad at Coláiste Chú Chulainn, Dundalk which was sanctioned by the Department of Education and Skills is being referred to by certain parents as Coláiste Lú.”It said parents were advised previously that the department had not sanctioned a roll number for Coláiste Lú but instead “had issued formal recognition for an Aonad within Coláiste Chú Chulainn”.“The Aonad is managed by the principal on behalf of the patron within authorised staffing limits,” the statement added.It said that “similar to other schools nationally”, it experiences difficulty in securing teachers in certain subject areas including mathematics, sciences, modern foreign languages, technology subjects, guidance and SEN “to name a few”.It said it was “not in a position to commit resources sanctioned for other students to meet certain expectations expressed by parentss of students attending the Aonad at Coláiste Chú Chulainn, Dundalk”."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"The then PM said that many in Britain see Ireland as \u0026lsquojust another island\u0026rsquoArchbishop says no right to confuse personal opinion with well-formed Christian conscienceUK prime minister says cross-Border arrangement could extend beyond agri-foodProgramme shows clips of Martin McGuinness preparing bomb used in Derry attackA 42-year-old man was shot up to 10 times in his car in Lucan on WednesdayHome office says new EU migrants have three years\u0026rsquo temporary leave to remain\u0026lsquoExpensive and bureaucratic\u0026rsquo: Varadkar spells out effects of worst-case scenarioSocial media by far the most popular thing people use their phones for \u0026ndash ComReg reportParents say cuts having adverse affect on students preparing for exams at Dundalk schoolEconomy in Northern Ireland will be \u0026lsquonegatively affected\u0026rsquo in all scenariosNew cases of rabbit haemorrhagic disease confirmed in Clare and LeitrimFriends say Cameron McClements was last sighted in bookshop on Wednesday eveningSimon Byrne clarifies remarks made about taking children of paramilitaries into careMinister for Justice says Garda Commissioner has plans to deal with border issuesFormer addict says he welcomed prison because it meant not having to sleep rough\u0026lsquoOnce we mattered too much, now we\u0026rsquove moved beyond antipathy into apathy\u0026rsquoEastern European woman rushed by ambulance to University Hospital Kerry but was pronounced dead shortly after arrival"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4009253.1567703897!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ian paisley supplied money to uvf for bombings in 1969 bbc series","story":"A new BBC TV series on the Troubles claims former DUP leader Ian Paisley supplied money to the Ulster Volunteer Force to carry out a number of bombings in 1969.The seven-part series, which starts on Tuesday, also contains rare footage of former deputy first minister Martin McGuinness, of Sinn Féin, allegedly preparing a car bomb for an IRA attack on Derry’s Guildhall in 1972.The series, Spotlight on the Troubles: A Secret History, also reveals a “top secret” memorandum from 1972 in which British army commander Gen Michael Carver proposed as a “lasting solution” to the conflict that the British government gradually escape from the “commitment to the Border”.The allegations against Paisley in the first programme of the series relate to a number of bombings of water and electricity installations that the UVF and a group called the Ulster Protestant Volunteers carried out in early 1969.At the time, the unionist prime minister Terence O’Neill was trying to bring in reforms to meet some of the demands of the civil rights movement.The UVF hoped the bombings against targets such as the Silent Valley reservoir in the Mourne mountains and the water pipeline at Annalong, Co Down, would be blamed on the IRA. The plan was that it would generate further unionist hostility to an already beleaguered O’Neill and force him to resign.At the time, Paisley had been mounting a campaign of protest against O’Neill, who resigned at the end of April 1969 under claims he had lost control in Northern Ireland.The programme cites a police intelligence report of the period that said the UVF was linked to Paisley, a connection the cleric denied.Viaduct explosionFormer British army officer David Hancock, who served as a major in Northern Ireland from 1968 to 1970, told the programme an RUC district inspector in Kilkeel, Co Down, informed him Paisley had supplied money for the bombings.Mr Hancock, who was stationed nearby, actually heard the Annalong viaduct explosion and said he felt at the time it did “not have the footprint of the IRA”.Mr Hancock recalled: “I was good friends with the district inspector down in Kilkeel. He showed me the evidence that they had of the involvement of money from Paisley into what was then called the UVF, where they got the explosives from, how it was carried out, who did it, and why.”The programme also reports that Samuel Stevenson, Paisley’s bodyguard in 1969, told former SDLP and Fine Gael politician Austin Currie the UVF was planning to bomb the hydroelectric power station at Ballyshannon, Co Donegal. In that attack in October 1969, Thomas McDowell was killed when his bomb exploded prematurely.Mr Currie told the programme Mr Stevenson warned him of the planned attack and also told him he was supposed to be part of the UVF bomb team, but that he would try to avoid being involved.McGuinness footageThe programme also features footage of Mr McGuinness in Derry in 1972 that shows him sitting in a car while children crane in the window to look at bullets. It shows him handling a pistol while talking to them. A rifle lies beside McGuinness in the car.There is also film of IRA members assembling a car bomb in Derry, with Mr McGuinness clearly appearing to be part of the unit. The bomb was then used to damage the Guildhall in March 1972, as was evident from the car’s registration.The day after the attack, in which no one was killed, Stormont prime minister Brian Faulkner was brought to London by UK prime minister Edward Heath to be told the unionist government was being stripped of security powers. Mr Faulkner’s government resigned and direct rule was introduced from Britain shortly afterwards.The McGuinness footage came from an American documentary that was never shown in Britain or Ireland. Mr McGuinness admitted he was in the IRA, although he claimed to have left the organisation in 1974.The first programme in the series also covers Bloody Sunday on January 30th, 1972, and reports how an officer from another regiment described the First Parachute Regiment responsible for 14 deaths in Derry as “hooligans in uniform”.This comment was made shortly before Bloody Sunday and after members of the regiment were accused of brutally dealing with an anti-internment march on Magilligan Strand in Co Derry on January 22nd.Top secret briefingThe programme features part of a “top secret” briefing to British government defence secretary Peter Carrington in May 1972 from Gen Michael Carver headed “Army Aims in Northern Ireland”. In it Gen Carver said the IRA had strengthened its military position since the collapse of Stormont, while the British army was losing the military initiative.Gen Carver appeared to be proposing the British government should facilitate the creation of a united Ireland. “If I am right, and we want a lasting solution, it must be in finding a way in which HMG can gradually escape from the commitment to the border,” he wrote, adding that the “answer appears to lie with the plebiscite”.The series is edited by Jeremy Adams and produced by Chris Thornton, one of the authors of the Lost Lives book of those killed during the Troubles. The reporters for the series, which took two years to make, are Darragh MacIntyre, Mandy McAuley and Jennifer O’Leary.The first programme will broadcast on Tuesday, September 10th, at 8.30pm on BBC1 Northern Ireland and BBC4.Future episodes will deal with issues such as how the IRA sustained its campaign, the intelligence war against the IRA and loyalist paramilitaries, the loyalist Glenanne Gang and how the Troubles were brought to an end."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4009392.1567716332!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"irish people spend 4 hours on their smartphones daily","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tIrish people spend an average of 274 minutes on their smartphones each day. Illustration: iStockIrish people use their phones for more than 4½ hours every day but spend a tiny fraction of the time making or receiving phone calls. People spend just over 10 per cent of the time on their phones talking. Considerably more time is spent accessing social media and streaming music and video, according to new research published by the communications watchdog ComReg.The report says accessing social media is by far the most popular thing people use their phones for, with an average of 64 minutes spent on various platforms over the course of a typical day. By contrast people spend 32 minutes making or receiving traditional calls. After social media, streaming video is the next most popular thing people use their devices for, with an average of 53 minutes spent on platforms such as YouTube. A further 47 minutes are spent streaming music, while 32 minutes are spent browsing the internet and 20 minutes spent sending and reading emails. The report, realised to coincide with ComReg’s national conference on the Digital Society, suggests that when the time spent on all activities is totted up, people spend an average of 274 minutes on their smartphones each day. The research highlights the trend towards an increasingly digital Irish society with handset ownership almost universal across the country. Smartphones are the handsets of choice, with 84 per cent of people now having such a device. The report shows that two-thirds of smartphone owners use Google’s Android operating system with most of the rest on Apple’s iOS. Samsung Galaxy and Apple’s iPhone handset are the most popular among consumers.Generation gapThe report highlights a digital ide between younger and older consumers with the percentage of people over the age of 65 who own a smartphone falling to 47 per cent. Half of all phone users are bill-pay customers, with an average monthly spend of €42, including the cost of their handset. The figure is slightly up on the €40.28 that was spent each month two years ago.By contrast pre-pay customers are spending an average of €21 per month. The research points to loyal – or lazy – consumers, with 71 per cent of mobile phone customers saying they were with the same provider for more than three years and most people saying they chose their provider based on who their friends and family were with.The next most popular reason given was the reputation of the provider followed by price. “The survey results demonstrate how important mobile communications are to our daily lives, particularly for a digitally empowered society like Ireland, ” said the chairman of ComReg Garrett Blaney. “Now more than ever, electronic communications technologies permit people to connect in ways that they have never done before. The digital era is constantly evolving and is already central to our economy and society,” he continued. He said that while Irish consumers were enjoying the benefits of the digital era, “they also need protections from various forms of harm while online. However, this protection should not stifle innovation.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4009299.1567707072!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"kitty r%C3%B3is%C3%ADn ciara and brendan a storm by any other name","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tEye of the storm: the devastating Hurricane Dorian takes shape earlier in September. File photograph: EPAThe winds of change have blown through the latest storm name list with Irish-sounding storms such as Kitty, Róisín, Ciara and Brendan joined by some more exotic ones, including Gerda and Piet.The less than familiar names are as a result of the Dutch national forecaster’s decision to join its counterparts in Ireland and the UK in identifying the worst of the winter’s weather by name.Some of the names on the new list were put forward by the general public over the course of the summer as part of the “name our storms” initiative, which is now in its fifth year.Only storms categorised as Status Orange or Red are to get names on the grounds that that they have the potential to cause a substantial impact.The names go through the alphabet alternating between men and women, omitting names starting with the letters Q, U, X, Y and Z in order to comply with US National Hurricane Centre naming conventions and to maintain consistency for official storm naming in the north Atlantic.Those who have made the gradeOnce a storm receives a name from any national met service, it hangs on to it even if it subsequently enters Irish waters. Two of the worst storms of recent years – Ophelia and Emma – were named by forecasters in the US and Portugal respectively. The first storm of sufficient strength to earn a name in the weeks ahead will be known as Atiyah, after which Brendan will make an appearance followed by Ciara and then Dennis.

Willow, the last name on this year’s list, is unlikely to make an appearance unless the weather is particularly bad over the course of the seasons ahead. “We are overwhelmed with the huge response to our public call for storm names.

Photograph: Philip LeonardTánaiste Simon Coveney has played down suggestions fellow Ministers were taken back by the severity of his warning about the impact of a no-deal Brexit.Mr Coveney had briefed Ministers at a Cabinet meeting earlier this week.“I don’t think people were surprised,” he said.“It’s not the first briefing the Cabinet have been given on a no-deal Brexit – nobody in the Cabinet should be surprised that there are vulnerable sectors here – those vulnerable sectors we know are fishing, agri-food and tourism.”“There was no report to Cabinet yesterday, there was nothing in writing, talking about 10,000 jobs . . . No report that I gave referred to the figure of 10,000 in any of the documents that I gave to the Cabinet yesterday,” he said.Mr Coveney said a discussion involving several Ministers and lasting an hour or so focused on the supports that would be necessary for vulnerable sectors such as tourism, agri-food and fishing in the event of a no-deal Brexit.Asked about the time frame of any job loses, Mr Coveney said unlike others, he did not “ talk about what happens at the Cabinet table”.However he said, if there was to be a significant devaluation of sterling in the event of a no-deal Brexit, it would make Ireland a more expensive location for British tourists and may have an impact on UK visitor numbers.Speaking in Cork, where he announced 40 new jobs at accountants Crowleys DFK, Mr Coveney was also reluctant to comment on events at Westminster where the opposition is seeking to prevent a no-deal Brexit on October 31st.SterlingAsked if he thought sterling had strengthened on foot of the increased likelihood of a UK general election, he said he thought it owed more to moves to prevent a no-deal Brexit.“I think the strengthening of sterling was more about a no-deal Brexit now being marginally less likely than it was before the votes in Westminster over the last 24 hours but I’m always slow to comment on the politics of Westminster.”Mr Coveney said he still believed British prime minister Boris Johnson would travel to Dublin next Monday to meet Taoiseach Leo Varadkar.“I have no reason to believe that that won’t happen,” he said.On border arrangements in the event of a no-deal Brexit, Mr Coveney said no agreement had been reached yet with the EU.“We have some sense but we don’t have detail on that because it is not agreed yet with the European Commission – as soon as we know, you will know – this is not just an Irish border, it is also an EU frontier with the UK,” he said.“We need a dual objective here – we need to protect and maintain Ireland’s place in the EU single market so that we don’t get dragged out of the single market against our will, as a result of Brexit.”‘Uncertainty and volatility’Separately, speaking on RTÉ radio’s News at One, Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure Paschal Donohoe said the risk of a no-deal Brexit had “grown” in recent days. He also warned of the need for a “stable political environment” to be maintained in this country, while a British government decision is awaited on what it will do about Brexit and when it will leave the EU.Speaking from Waterford where he was attending a presentation on regional infrastructure projects, Mr Donohoe said it was a significant development to see “that within the current House of Commons, there is a majority there that is in favour of avoiding a no-deal Brexit”.“But of course it’s equally apparent to all of us that that there’s a really high level of uncertainty and volatility now afoot in British politics.”He said we are looking at “uncertainty developing there” and “risk growing there”.“It’s very important that the stable political environment that we have here in Ireland be maintained,” he said.“It will be maintained, our sole political focus is on doing all we can to try and get Ireland ready to deal with consequences that might develop after the end of October.”He also said he and his Cabinet colleagues were “well aware of what will be the employment consequences of a no-deal Brexit”.He repeated the Government’s warning from earlier this year that, in that eventuality, “up to 50,000 jobs would not be created in our economy that would otherwise be created”.He said in next month’s budget he would outline supports and plans to be put in place to deal with the consequences of a no-deal Brexit if it happens.“A no-deal Brexit will create many unknowns, it is an event the like of which the UK or Europe has not had to confront before, but all that can be done will be done to protect us from the kind of risks that we can plan for.”InformationSinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald said her party had already begun preparations for a general election in Northern Ireland and remained firm in its resolve not to take up any seats it wins in Westminster.“All of the evidence in the last number of days, weeks and months and decades demonstrates that Irish interests are not addressed, Irish interests have not been and will never be protected at Westminster and to go down that road is to miss the point entirely, that Irish interests are protected on this island, they’re protected by a whole network of diplomacy and relationships that are Europe-wide and are trans-Atlantic,” she said.Ms McDonald warned that the Irish Government should not “think its way into a position where it is essentially making a choice between the single market and the Good Friday Agreement”.She said the Government, at this stage, needed to share more information “as to the nature of their conversation with the European Commission”.“Any information that’s been made available to the Cabinet needs to now be made available to party leaderships across the Oireachtas and across the island,” Ms McDonald said.“For us to get to a solution and mitigation we have to have all the facts before us.“We have to at this juncture, not lose our nerve, I think we need to maintain focus, not to get tied up in the theatrics of the zoo that is Westminster at the moment, I think we need to go back to the first basic premise that all of us agreed right across Irish politics, that we could not countenance a hardening of the border on the island or damage to the Good Friday Agreement and as the prospect of a disorderly Brexit looms, now is not the time to soften that position collectively.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph: Maxwell The hospitable hosts buttered up their important guest and made a big fuss of his family and hoped he would say nice things about them to the important people he would meet after his visit to Ireland. And he told them they were wonderful and that he loved them. He even said a special prayer for everyone and then, just before he left, he turned around and kicked them where it hurts. It came as a shock. Like pulling out all the stops for a much-anticipated visitor to your home and thinking it has been a great success until somebody discovers he shat on the new carpet in the spare room, the one you bought specially for him. US vice-president Mike Pence met President Michael D Higgins and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar on Tuesday during an official visit. His Irish hosts, up to their oxters for the last three years in Brexit worry, hoped to impress upon him Ireland’s fears about the consequences of a no-deal Brexit for the country. He could, maybe, stick in a supportive word for us in his talks with Boris Johnson in London – his next port of call. Pence, after all, is Irish American and wastes no opportunity to go misty-eyed about his love for the “Old Country” as he lards on his Mother Machree schtick on both sides of the Atlantic. He couldn’t praise Ireland enough on Tuesday – “deeply humbled” and “honoured” to be going to the hometown of his mother’s grandmother and so on. Strong endorsementBut, after he said all these nice things about the “Emerald Isle” and how much his boss Donald Trump – he sent his best wishes, by the way – appreciates us and all we do to help American security in Shannon, he delivered a very strong endorsement of Boris Johnson and Brexit. No room left for doubt. As Pence read from the autocue and Irish eyes definitely stopped smiling, it was clear he was channeling His Master’s Voice. Trump is a fan of Brexit and of Boris. And this, after such a lovely morning, with Pence and his mother meeting the Taoiseach and his mother. His Irish mother, as Mike calls her. He dotes on Nancy. So he should have known that any Irish mammy will tell you if you can’t say anything good, say nothing at all. Instead, he veered off his rather gushing statement following his meeting with the Taoiseach into some crunching Brexit remarks about our duty to do right by Boris Johnson and the UK. As the air in the steamy ballroom turned decidedly frosty, Pence urged Ireland and the European Union “to negotiate in good faith” with the new British prime minister. The local crowd raised eyebrows and wondered what he thinks the aforementioned EU has been doing for the last three years, if not negotiating in good faith with the UK. Varadkar’s expression didn’t change. He stood on the platform beside the vice-president and hardly flinched, smiling politely. Even when Pence made it worse by not only mentioning “good faith” and “Boris Johnson” in the same context but by also requesting his hosts to have “respect for the UK’s sovereignty”, Varadkar maintained a stoic courtesy. He had to. It’s in the job description for normal prime ministers. Same goes for Michael D Higgins, even though it would be true to say that Michael D and Mike Pence do not sing from the same hymn sheet. But international diplomacy is what it is and in the context of going about their nations’ business, everyone has to be seen to get along. But for all that, Michael D’s sprayed-on smile when the US vice-president came to visit him in Áras an Uachtaráin was a joy to behold. The Áras was bedecked with flowers from the garden for the visit of the anti-gay-rights Pence. All the flowers were in shades of pink. The only other colour was lavender. Huge entouragePence arrived with a huge entourage. President Higgins escorted him through the Áras and into the ballroom where he invited his guest to sign the visitors’ book. Michael D looked ahead a lot of the time. “Can I invite you to sign. . . ” he motioned towards the book. Pence sat at the table and began to write. The President stood to one side, saying nothing apart from the occasional whisper to his wife, Sabina. The VP kept writing as the silence got louder. Still writing. Michael D looking into the distance. Finally, thank God, Pence stopped writing, which was a relief all round. There was another photo opportunity then the party retired next door for tea. A picture was released of the two groups sitting on either side of a long table – two tables together. The sort of thing when more guests than expected arrive. “Quick, run out next door and ask Assumpta for the collapsible table they got in for Mossie’s wake. Your man from America is only after arriving with half of Indiana. Where’s the big tablecloth?”The talks between the President and the vice-president didn’t take long. Soon, they were waving goodbye from the portico. The dogs didn’t put in an appearance. He didn’t call the vice-president a “w*****r”, which is what he did when he had a row many years on radio with a famous American conservative commentator. Michael Graham was his name. Michael D might easily have become confused, because Mike Pence is an adherent of the “Graham rule”. This is where he doesn’t stay alone in a room with a woman who is not his wife so as not to give rise to bad thoughts and the like.Static courtesyAt Farmleigh House, Varadkar’s static courtesy was equally impressive. But then, the Taoiseach has dined before in Pence’s presence. “We are all God’s children,” Leo pointedly told him when they met for breakfast last March in Washington. Just to be clear, they met for breakfast in a roomful of other people. The two men weren’t dining alone, perish the thought. It was a very pleasant event. This was when Leo invited his American host to Ireland and told him to bring along his mother too. It would be a grand trip for her and, in an emergency, if Mike’s wife was otherwise detained, mammy could sit in as chaperone should the VP have found himself unavoidably alone in a dining room with our gay Taoiseach. You can never be too careful. In the end, Pence brought his wife, his mother and his sister to the Old Country, where it seems a lot of the natives have turned alarmingly heathen in the generations since his ancestors left our shores.His morning began with a trip to the Phoenix Park and a courtesy call on the President. To look at Mike Pence, with all smiles and handshakes, you’d hardly think he isn’t very keen on the gays at all. Brave Mike sat down to lunch with the Taoiseach and his partner Matthew and managed not to choke on his Dublin Bay prawns. The VP’s wife Karen, who recently took up a part-time teaching position in a school which bans LGBT pupils and staff, kept her fillets of venison down despite the company. The next prime minister the couple will meet on their trip will be the serial philanderer Boris Johnson. He’s pretty experienced on the extramarital and premarital sex front, which they abhor. On Tuesday, to be on the safe side, nobody was left alone with the US vice-president in case it might upset him. “We have both been blessed with Irish mothers,” Pence told the Taoiseach when they met the press. He didn’t say anything about Indian fathers (in Leo’s case) but there you go. “I carry Ireland with me wherever I go,” said Pence, speaking of an old Ireland, one his ancestors left generations ago. Still, his visit was a great example of ersity in action. President Trump, who recently visited, is very hands-on with women and likes to grab them in all sorts of places. And his second in command is the opposite. He won’t stay on his own with a woman who isn’t his wife."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4009386.1567714433!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"taoiseach says no deal brexit may require checks near the border","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach Leo Varadkar told the British-Irish Chamber dinner some checks on goods and live animals entering the Republic would take place ‘near the Border’ in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Photograph: Dave MeehanTaoiseach Leo Varadkar has warned some checks on goods and live animals entering the Republic are likely to be required “near the Border” in the event of a no-deal Brexit.In his clearest assessment of the effects of a no-deal yet, Mr Varadkar listed a range of disruptions that would occur after October 31st if the UK left the EU without an agreement.He also said he believes “there is a possibility we may have to live with no deal for a period”.Mr Varadkar does “not anticipate any significant change in medicine supplies. There will still be food on shelves but perhaps not all of the same brands,” he told the annual dinner of the British-Irish Chamber of Commerce in Dublin on Thursday night.“Tariffs will apply to goods imported into Ireland from the United Kingdom and vice-versa . . . This will be expensive and bureaucratic for business. There will be checks on goods and live animals and, as far as possible, they will take place in ports, airports and at businesses. But some may take place near the Border. We are working out the details of this with the European Commission,” he said.Mr Varadkar’s warning was softened slightly from the script supplied by Government Buildings, in which he said checks “will” take pace near the Border.Earlier this week Ministers who asked were not given any further details about the border checks, and the progress of the exchanges with the commission remains a closely-guarded secret within Government. One source described recent statements as “a softening up process”.Citizens’ rightsMr Varadkar also warned if there was a no-deal, any subsequent negotiations with the UK would have the same red lines for the EU – “citizens’ rights, the financial settlement with the EU and a solution to the Irish Border. All the issues we spent the last two years on”.However, he stressed that the Government was “open to alternatives” to the backstop “as we always have been. But they must be realistic ones, legally binding and workable in practice.“We have received no such proposals to date,” he said.“Whatever happens,” Mr Varadkar said, “Ireland will not be dragged out of the single European market.”Ireland’s economic model, he said, depended on membership of the single market.While Ireland wanted a deal, he said, he did not want one “at any cost”.More than 450 attendees from Britain and Ireland attended the dinner which was also addressed by Director-General of the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), Dame Carolyn Fairbairn.John Cronin, president of the chamber, warned a no-deal Brexit would “damage and imperil existing trade between Ireland and the United Kingdom,and will limit future business opportunities.“Businesses in Ireland and the UK are entering uncharted waters,” he said. “The persistence of uncertainty on the terms on which businesses on both sides of the Irish Sea will trade with each other is disruptive, costly and harmful to relationships. The ability of many businesses to limit the impact of no-deal while protecting supply chains, commercial ties and livelihoods is actually quite small.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph: Matthew PolakSygma via GettyThey spoke by phone at 11.13pm Irish time on February 9th, 1996, just four hours after the IRA ended a 17-month ceasefire by detonating a large bomb in the London Docklands.The explosion, which killed two people and injured more than 100, came after months of stalemate in the attempts to start talks towards a peaceful political solution to the then 27-year-old Troubles in Northern Ireland.Conversations during that night’s phone calls between the leaders of the United States and the United Kingdom and then taoiseach John Bruton were filled with shock, frustration and sadness. None of the three leaders had seen it coming.The calls show the deep commitment that Clinton personally showed in trying to secure peace.Transcripts of the calls, released by the US National Archives to the William J Clinton Presidential Library in Arkansas – and The  – reveal a sense of despair among the three leaders as they tried to grapple with fast-moving and unexpected events.The US president’s surprise was compounded by the fact he had met Sinn Féin leader Gerry Adams days before at the White House in Washington.“I just wanted to call and tell you how sorry I am about what happened,” Clinton told Bruton in a four-minute call from the Oval Office shortly after he had telephoned the British prime minister.“It is dreadful really,” Bruton replied. “It was completely sudden and unexpected.”The Fine Gael leader thanked Clinton for his public statement in response to the attack, in which he said that “the terrorists who perpetrated today’s attack cannot be allowed to derail the effort to bring peace to the people of Northern Ireland – a peace they overwhelmingly support.”“It touched a lot of people. It appears a lot of Sinn Féin’s leadership was taken by surprise,” Bruton said.‘Gutless’ IRAReferring to the IRA statement after the bombing, which blamed Major and his government for the failure of the peace process, the president said: “Blaming the British under these circumstances is pretty gutless.”At this stage Major had demanded the IRA decommission its weapons before being allowed to enter multi-party talks or there would have to be an election.Clinton was annoyed at himself because he had met Adams just days earlier and not foreseen the bomb attack, though he had noticed the Sinn Féin leader “seemed ill at ease”.The US president said he had “no inkling” of the bombing and that it was “hard to explain”.“I didn’t see it coming,” he said, adding that he felt “badly” having met Adams.It has emerged in recent years that Adams warned senior Democratic congressman Bruce Morrison, who was close to the Clinton White House, just over two months before the Canary Wharf bombing that the UK government’s demand for some prior IRA disarmament was threatening the ceasefire.During their February 9th, 1996 call, Major thanked Clinton for his statement “and the speed with which it was made”. He told the president he intended to “dampen things down”, according to the partially redacted transcript.“I think we are going to see how to keep the show on the road. First, we must make sure that the British and Irish governments lock arms and I think Bruton and I will be able to do that,” Major said.Both leaders criticised a statement Adams had released after the bombing in which he said he regretted that “an unprecedented opportunity for peace had foundered on the refusal of the British government and the unionist leaders to enter into dialogue on substantive negotiation”.Clinton told Major this was “ not a very diplomatic statement”.Proceed with cautionDuring a call to Clinton, Bruton said the bombing would put the idea of “proximity talks” – negotiations between warring factions through a third party – “on the back-burner”.Bruton said decisions had to be taken “from the security perspective and what attitudes to take with Sinn Féin” but that the three governments had to proceed cautiously.“We don’t want to rush into it, but we can’t reverse the course. We have to keep hope alive,” he said.Clinton agreed, adding: “We don’t want to over-react. It is sad and troubling.”The US president offered to help in any way.“I just wanted to call and check in with you and tell you if you have any ideas about what we ought to do just give us a call and let us know what to do and we’ll do it,” he told Bruton, wrapping up their call.In the weeks afterwards the three governments worked towards trying to put together a package that would enable Sinn Féin to enter all-party talks once the ceasefire was restored.The taoiseach told him there needed to be a definite date for all-party talks and that he felt he could convince reluctant members of the SDLP, led by John Hume, to accept some form of election “so long as the transition to talks is absolutely direct and there would be no delay and no further conditions”.“The best and only chance to get the IRA to restore the ceasefire is if a specific date is designated,” Bruton said.‘I am heartsick’Clinton promised to stay in touch with Adams and to see what he could do to persuade Hume on the election proposal – both of which, Bruton said, would be helpful.“Call me at any time. I am heartsick about this but I believe we still have a shot at getting this back on track so if there is anything I can do, I’ll do it,” the president told him.Bruton thanked him for taking the trouble to call. “It’s a critical situation right now,” the taoiseach said.Their next phone call (for which transcripts have been released) started on a more humorous note when, on June 6th, 1996, Clinton joked about being kept on hold by Bruton and having to listen to holding music.“I just want to let you know that you’ve got the best muzak in the world. We don’t have Tchaikovsky over here. I’m in much better humour than I was 30 seconds ago,” he said.“You had to listen to Tchaikovsky? That’s shocking,” replied Bruton.The taoiseach shared the “good news” that “things are coming through for the talks” and he was “very grateful” to Clinton for sending former US senate leader George Mitchell to lead attempts to find a solution.“We have not lost hope that there may be an IRA ceasefire by Monday – it’s still possible,” Bruton said.Clinton said the US would “do everything we can and call some of their best friends over here.“Most American-Irish are 100 per cent with you and Major on the agreement for decommissioning and the role of Mitchell,” he said. “I fully support the position you have taken that Sinn Féin cannot participate in the talks unless the IRA agrees to a ceasefire. If it hadn’t been for the bombing, it would be much easier.”In the end, it would take just over a year to convince the IRA to agree to a second, permanent ceasefire.In July 1997, the UK government, under new prime minister Tony Blair, dropped its demand that the IRA disarm as a condition of Sinn Féin entering the talks. This secured a resumption of the IRA ceasefire.On an earlier call, in May 1995, nine months into the first ceasefire, Clinton asked Major if the peace process was giving him a political “boost” at home.“Not a bit,” replied Major. “For most people here, Ireland is just another island. They don’t really care what happens elsewhere in the world.”"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons september 2019","story":"To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraph matt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2018 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514. ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to telegraphmattprints or call 0191 603 0178.Is there going to be a General Election - and will it happen before Brexit? Brexit latest news: Boris Johnson says \u0026#39I\u0026#39d rather be dead in a ditch\u0026#39 than ask for an extension from Brussels Police should be allowed to use facial recognition to investigate specific crimes, according to first national survey of attitudes to the technologyWine lovers pay seven times as much alcohol tax on a glass as cider drinkers, study showsPolice should be free to use face recognition in investigations and at public events, says first nationwide poll Royal Navy rescues British woman in Bahamas as survivors describe horrific scenes in Dorian\u0026#39s wakeContactless payments fueling debt among millennials, as study finds they struggle to keep track of spendingBilly Connolly\u0026#39s Great American Trail, episode 1, review: A pleasant if ill-focussed ramble through New EnglandComment: I will stand with Scottish farmers and stop Nicola Sturgeon creating an international frontier with EnglandBoris Johnson, his brother Jo and the inside story of a Brexit schismComment: Tory members voted for Boris because they wanted him to do things differently – he has and we\u0026#39re gratefulComment: What Jo Johnson has done is Cain and Abel with knobs onComment: Boris\u0026#39s agenda isn\u0026#39t \u0026#39extreme\u0026#39 or \u0026#39hard-Right\u0026#39 – and voters know itJacob Rees-Mogg compares Remain-supporting doctor to MMR anti-vaxxerLabour plot to trap Boris Johnson by delaying general election until November after Brexit delayBritish Airways say pilots demands would cost them £50m, as they accuse union of backtracking on agreed dealJapanese museum demands compensation before it will return stolen £1m painting to family of British BaronetJamie Laing forced to pull out of Strictly Come Dancing due to foot injuryChianti producers to consider increasing sweetness to \u0026#39appeal to women\u0026#39 and younger drinkers Tory MPs: We don\u0026#39t blame Boris, we blame Dominic CummingsJo Johnson hands Labour propaganda coup as he resigns over brother Boris\u0026#39 Brexit policyWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/04/13/amazon-payment-hand-biometrics.jpg","title":"amazon deals shop whole foods new payment hand wave","story":"IM Subscribe NowIM Subscribe NowCreated with Sketch.IM  Subscribe NowIM  Subscribe NowSubscribe NowSubscribe NowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Try Independent Minds free for 1 monthSee the optionsNext-generation biometric technology could be introduced to Whole Foods stores in the US later this yearClick to followThe Independent TechAmazon is said to be\u0026nbspdeveloping a new payment system that allows customers to pay simply by waving their hand.The online retail giant is testing scanners that use biometric technology to identify people by the shape and size of their hands, with the hope of rolling them out in its Whole Foods stores later this year.Sensors are already being tested by Amazon workers on vending machines in the firm\u0027s New York offices, according to the\u0026nbspNew York Post.The so-called Orville system is different to other biometric scanners currently used on smartphones, which use in-built fingerprint scanners\u0026nbspto confirm payments.Using computer vision, Amazon\u0027s technology is able to recognise a hand without users having to physically touch\u0026nbspthe scanner.\u0026nbspIt is currently able to do this with an accuracy of one ten-thousandth of 1 per cent, though Amazon hopes to improve this to one-millionth of one per cent.Created with Sketch.Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.125 Gun-toting humanoid robot sent into spaceRussia has launched a humanoid robot into space on a rocket bound for the International Space Station (ISS).

The same is true of construction, 45 down from 45.3, and manufacturing, 47.4 down from 48. The difference is the latter two sectors are now shrinking, as is business activity overall. UK plc only avoided a cricketing hat-trick because the video replay umpire didn’t overturn a marginal LBW decision made on the field after the third ball.\u0026nbspUK manufacturing output slumps to seven-year low amid Brexit concernsPMI survey reveals biggest slide in UK construction output since 2009How a no-deal Brexit will affect the economy — now and in the futureBusiness expectations are at their lowest for three years, with economists starting to pencil in the first recession since the financial crisis, unless there is a dramatic pick up in September. It’s hard to see where the fairy dust might come from.\u0026nbspThese are the sort of figures that should be of deep concern to any sane and sensible government of whatever hue, all the more so to\u0026nbspa Conservative government with its\u0026nbspmuch ballyhooed, and largely undeserved, reputation for economic competence. In more normal times, they’d scare the pants off it.\u0026nbspBut these are not normal times and this is not a normal government. It is run by a party that has completely lost its marbles, having been dragged to the edge of a cliff by gangsters who have just one policy of note. \u0026nbspThe global situation mightn’t be terribly cheery, but the contraction that is getting underway in Britain is an entirely self created one, a squeeze manufactured in Downing Street.\u0026nbspAnd remember, this could just be a taste of what’s\u0026nbspto come, a red balloon or two of warning of what Johnnywise the dancing clown of Downing Street could yet brings down on us as he emerges from his sinister house.\u0026nbspThis brings us to another set of figures published this morning. They concern household debt and come courtesy of the TUC ahead of its annual Congress.\u0026nbspThey give voice to the disturbing level of unsecured borrowing engaged in by the average Briton before one even starts to consider things such as mortgages.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Sterling has tumbled almost 19 per cent since the EU referendum in June 2016.The government’s defeat by a margin of 328 to 301 on Tuesday leaves Mr Johnson’s Brexit strategy in tatters by potentially robbing him of the threat of no-deal, which he has repeatedly said is essential to obtain concessions from the EU.Responding from the despatch box immediately after the result, the prime minister said he would table a bill to trigger a general election, with a vote expected to take place soon after the anti-no deal bill completes its passage through the Commons on Wednesday.But Mr Johnson’s plans seemed doomed to failure after Labour said it would not back his election motion, which requires a two-thirds majority and is therefore dependent on opposition support to pass through the Commons, until the legislation to stop no-deal is passed.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

A reading below 50 indicates contraction, while higher than 50 shows growth.Duncan Brock, group director at the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply, said the sector had “clung on by its fingertips this month” as overseas clients “abandoned spending in favour of a wait-and-see approach and the political environment became increasingly murky”.He added: “There’s only so much companies can do to absorb costs before UK consumers notice the impact to their wallets, and only so much Brexit indecision the sector can take before it is tipped into contraction.”Recession fears grow as construction firms and retailers sufferBusiness confidence about the next 12 months in the service sector dropped in August to its lowest point since July 2016, the month after the\u0026nbspreferendum on membership of the European Union\u0026nbsp(EU).Similar surveys earlier this week showed the UK’s manufacturing sector was suffering its worst downturn for seven years and the construction industry had shrunk for the fourth month in a row.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He added: “The PMIs are excessively influenced by business sentiment and have given a misleadingly weak steer during the past 12 months of heightened political uncertainty.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Minds Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Minds.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

We understand this category better than anyone.”Despite these reassurances, shares with Match Group fell by more than 20 per cent following Facebook’s announcement.When addressing privacy concerns, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the new Dating feature had been designed with “safety in mind from the beginning” and that the company had made improvements to its security.“Your friends aren’t going to see your profile, and you’re only going to be suggested to people who are not your friends,” he said.“This is going to be for building real, long-term relationships – not just for hookups.”Since 2018\u0026nbspFacebook has continued to be plagued by privacy scandals.This week\u0026nbspa security researcher discovered an unsecured database of 419 million phone numbers of Facebook users on the internet.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Samsung has also partnered exclusively with EE – the first UK network to launch 5G.Samsung is already working on a successor to the Galaxy Fold, according to recent reports.The next version\u0026nbspis expected to be thinner, smaller and cheaper, while also making use of a clamshell design.Rather than folding out like a book like the Galaxy Fold, it\u0026nbspwill open up vertically like a classic flip phone.The world’s number one smartphone maker reportedly worked with American designer Thom Browne on the 6.7-inch device, which folds up into a “pocketable square”.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But their 2006 debut – the defiantly titled Whatever People Say I Am, That’s What I’m Not – is arguably the most generation-defining, by a band experiencing the kind of hype that hadn’t been seen since Oasis with Definitely Maybe. Alex Turner’s sardonic and keenly observational lyrics on songs like “Fake Tales of San Francisco” and “When the Sun Goes Down” had fans clamouring to get into their early shows. It was an early example of the power the internet would hold over the music industry – propelling them from an unknown indie band on MySpace to the top of the charts in the space of six months.Please Please Me has a rhythm to it like little else released by The Beatles. Songs like “Twist and Shout” and “I Saw Her Standing There” have an energy that reflects the youthful vim of the band themselves, who were raring to go following the number one single from which the album takes its name. Their harmonies are thrilling to hear, and this is arguably the best album for capturing the band’s raw power.335 33) Yeah Yeah Yeahs – Fever to Tell (2003)In 2003, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs stuck a middle finger up to the naysayers who scoffed that they were little more than a bunch of posers. Their debut album Fever to Tell is a bristling record loaded with New York snark supplied by Karen O’s impressive vocal turns. Nick Zinner keeps the urgency going with roaring guitar licks while Brian Chase offers earth-shaking percussion on the likes of “Date With the Night” and “Y Control”. More than trendsetters – the Yeah Yeah Yeahs were the brains behind the smartest album of that year.Kanye West called it “white crunk music”. The band themselves called it “music for girls to dance to”. And songs such as “This Fire” certainly livened things up their irresistible hooks and disco energy, as frontman Alex Kapranos turned the male gaze on its head with lyrics like “I can feel your lips undress my eyes”. Fifteeen years later and “Take Me Out” still makes you swing your hips.Blur versus Oasis is a battle music fans will be waging for decades to come, but when it comes to debut albums, Oasis emerge as top dogs. Definitely Maybe was exciting, aggressive and loaded with attitude: a 22-year-old Liam Gallagher spits and snarls over the reverb-soaked guitars of “Cigarettes \u0026amp Alcohol”, and soars on that falsetto for “Live Forever”. Among the “too cool for school” alt-rockers who spurned the glitz and glamour of fame, Oasis asserted themselves as the definitive rock and roll stars.Stefani Germanotta’s debut album The Fame brought maximalist pop back to the forefront of the late-Noughties music scene, in an industry that was desperately lacking in pop as. Lady Gaga already sounded famous and she acted famous – but that doesn’t mean her music couldn’t stand on its own. Songs like “Beautiful, Dirty, Rich” and “Just Dance” seemed to convey Gaga’s love of fame and hedonism while remaining supremely self-aware of its superficiality. To top it off, it was masterfully produced and resplendent with slick, catchy dancepop and Eurodisco influences.Kendrick Lamar subtitled his debut record “A Short Film by Kendrick Lamar”, and indeed it feels as though you’re watching the movie of his early life – such is the autobiographical nature of this record. He raps in low, furtive tones, interrupted by voicemails from his family (his mother asks him pleadingly to return her car) that reinforce the familial themes. It is family, and faith, that keep Lamar on the outskirts of a world of violence and sin. Even this early on his career you hear the virtuosity and acute understanding of rhythm – Good kid, m.A.A.d City now stands as a classic album from a rapper who chooses the power of storytelling over a cheap punchline.Not every great debut album is defined by whether the artist has landed on their “sound” by the first track. Led Zeppelin were still figuring things out when they released their self-titled debut, yet it is essential because it laid the groundwork for what they would go onto achieve the following decade. “We were learning what got us off most and what got people off most,” Robert Plant said. You had the blues and folk notes on “Babe I’m Gonna Leave You”, and the chugging rock of “Communication Breakdown” Plant’s yowling vocals and Jimmy Page’s guitar. It did the trick.935 27) The Jesus and Mary Chain – Psychocandy (1985)“It was the crap coming out of the radio that made us want to be in a band more than anything else,” Jim Reid told Rolling Stone for the 30th anniversary of the Scottish alt-rocker’s debut album Psychocandy. “Because it was like, ‘Why is everything we hear so f***ing awful?’ That was the main driving force: how bad things were.” Psychocandy was certainly like nothing anyone else released at that time. Inspired by the Velvet Underground and The Stooges, the Reid brothers loaded their debut with buzzy guitars and hair-raising levels of feedback on singles like “You Trip Me Up” and “Never Understand”. It paved the way for countless shoegaze and alt-rock bands in the decades that followed.Grace is a masterpiece, and the only album the perfectionist Jeff Buckley was satisfied with before he drowned, aged 30, in a freak accident in Memphis in 1997. Yet had Grace been the only material ever released under his name (live recordings, covers and demos were released posthumously), it would have been enough to prove he was a rare and exceptional talent. His exquisite rendering of Leonard Cohen’s “Hallelujah”, his melismatic singing on “Grace” and the church-like hush of “Lover, You Should Come Over” – all of this and more carved out a rich legacy that ensures Buckley’s music will never fade.The whipsmart, cynical, outrageous young man on Eminem’s major label debut was a breath of fresh air – or perhaps more of a slap in the face – after a spate of soulful, conscious hip hop records. Of course, the rampant misogyny and homophobia his so-called “character” Slim Shady spat out caused uproar, regardless of how surreal the scenarios to which they were applied were.  Arguably what stands out the most on The Slim Shady LP is the sheer technical skill and lyrical ability that few have been able to match since.Not only did it lay the groundwork for so many punk, rock and heavy metal bands that came after them – but the manic rhythms and raw intensity of their power-chord ballads featured on The Who\u0027s my Generation propelled rock and roll to new heights in 1965.“Saviours of rock and roll!” “The greatest rock band since the Rolling Stones!” You have to pity The Strokes, who released their debut album under the biggest wave of hype imaginable. Yet it’s hard to deny the impact Is This It had on rock music – critics have argued that the Arctic Monkeys and Franz Ferdinand wouldn’t have existed if not for this band. They eschewed pre-programmed beats and autotuned vocals in favour of a gritty post-punk approach, and the result was an album that reinvigorated a floundering music industry, and inspired an entire generation of bands.The idea of a rap album was virtually inconceivable until Run-DMC released their full-length, self-titled debut in 1984. When he inducted them into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Eminem called them “the first movie stars of rap… they are The Beatles”. Busta Rhymes proclaimed: “Run-DMC didn’t change music, they changed everything.” The trio’s aggressive yet stark tracks – like “Sucker MCS” and “Hard Times” – were a dramatic contrast against the R\u0026ampB-driven rap of the time, an approach emulated by the rappers themselves, who spurned outlandish costumes in favour of tracksuits and sneakers. As an anniversary piece in Billboard noted, “they were authentic before authenticity in hip hop was even a thing”.Brian Eno’s experimental synths met Bryan Ferry’s romantic, old-school charm on the debut album from Roxy Music\u0027s bizarre art-glam-rock outfit. There were odes to Humphrey Bogart (“2HB”) and cyber-rock jams (“Ladytron”), and songs decorated with spooky-sounding hooks that wouldn’t sound out of place in The Rocky Horror Show (the character Riff Raff even seemed to take his cues from a balding Brian Eno).Still regarded by many as his greatest album to date, Reasonable Doubt asserted Jay-Z as a master freestyle – perhaps the best of his generation – recorded in a studio he compared to a psychiatrist’s couch. At the heart of the record is a blistering duet with the Notorious BIG, “Brooklyn’s Finest”, which practically heralded the shift of focus back from West Coast hip hop to the East.Rolling Stone\u0027s Lester Bangs described the Black Sabbath as “just like Cream! But worse”, and their debut album as “a shuck – despite the murky song titles and some inane lyrics that sound like Vanilla Fudge paying doggerel tribute to Aleister Crowley, the album has nothing to do with spiritualism, the occult, or anything much except stiff recitations of Cream clichés”. The Village Voice weren’t keen either, with critic Robert Christgau condemning it as “bulls**t necromancy.” Yet this is the album that invented heavy metal. Black Sabbath arrived ready to lure fans over to the dark side with Ozzy Osbourne’s piercing, operatic cry: “My name is Lucifer, please take my hand.” Critics be damned.1835 18) Sex Pistols – Never Mind the Bollocks, Here\u0027s the Sex Pistols (1977)“The album will last. The sleeve may not,” said the adverts for the Sex Pistols’ first and only studio album in 1977. The Sex Pistols were already controversial before the release of Never Mind the Bollocks, having caused nationwide uproar for swearing on live TV, been fired from two record labels, and been banned from a number of live venues in England. Yet despite many major retailers refusing to sell it, the album debuted at number one on the UK album charts and is today regarded as one of the most important punk albums in music history.Joe Strummer was a ball of rage and ambition when he and the rest of The Clash laid down the tracks for their debut album. Most of the guitar on this record was provided by Mick Jones, because Strummer didn’t think technical ability was punk enough. Yet their vision burns through on the buzz-saw attack of “Career Opportunities” and “White Riot”, raising a fist against unemployment, racism and the fat cats of industry. 2035 16) Guns N Roses – Appetite for Destruction (1987)Guns N Roses\u0027 Appetite for Destruction was the biggest thing to happen to hard rock since Led Zeppelin IV. Slash’s guitar and Axl Rose’s wild, animal howls contribute to the raw energy on songs like “Paradise City” and marked a dramatic shift away from the commercialised heavy rock that was being played on MTV at the time – proudly championing a gritty form of hedonism instead. “A lot of rock bands are too f***ing wimpy to have any sentiment or emotion,” Rose said. Not this band.Daft Punk\u0027s Homework was originally intended as “just a load of singles”, until Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo realised they had enough quality tracks for a full-length release. Each one opens with a kind of motif upon which multiple textures build and sprawl outwards – sleazy guitar hooks, G-funk whines and glittering synths. It’s the album that alerted the rest of the world to the French house music scene.Sex and poetry go hand in hand, especially if you’re a Jim Morrison fan. While few bands manage to ide critical opinion as much as The Doors, their debut album’s organ-driven rock was as tight as their frontman’s famous leather trousers. They brought theatricality to the Sixties music scene and went onto inspire as broad a range of artists as The Stranglers to Skrillex. The baroque pop stylings and lustful lyrics on “Light My Fire” proved to be a breakthrough, and helped propel them to number two on the US Billboard 200.After making a name for himself on Jay-Z’s The Blueprint as well as by producing hits for Janet Jackson and Ludacris, Kanye West spent four years recording The College Dropout. His background as a producer was obviously beneficial to his own debut, at a time where hip hop sampling was being accused of being too safe. And he subverted many other hip hop clichés, skirting round the dominant “gangsta” persona and instead finding solace in family and the church.2435 12) Pink Floyd – The Piper at the Gates of Dawn (1967)Pink Floyd’s debut The Piper at the Gates of Dawn stands as a classic of psychedelic rock. Helmed by an unravelling Syd Barrett – ousted a year after the album’s release – it shows the band at their most playful, with several tracks going onto become staples of their live shows. Songs such as “Bike”, meanwhile, proved the band were not averse to a good pop hook along with the acid guitars and hazy production. 2535 11) Lauryn Hill – The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998)Lauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with the immense and groundbreaking record, The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill. Flipping between two tones – sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky – the former Fugees member stepped out from rap’s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R\u0026ampB, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D’Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill’s reggae influences are what drive the album’s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around.2635 10) Dizzee Rascal – Boy in Da Corner (2003)It’s staggering to listen back to Boy in Da Corner and remember Dizzee Rascal was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London’s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track “Sittin’ Here”. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener’s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk.2735 9) Beastie Boys – Licensed to Ill (1986)Hip hop’s first number one album was an incendiary, all-guns-blazing record that would send shockwaves around the music industry for years to come. Few artists release something so assertive as this – a statement of intent to middle America that demanded they fight for their right to party. Beastie Boys\u0027 Mike D, Ad-Rock and MCA would move on from the frat boy humour and “good time” attitude of Licensed to Ill, but it is that record that delivered rap against a backdrop of Led Zeppelin and James Brown-inspired guitar licks.2835 8) The Notorious BIG – Ready to Die (1994)The rapper Notorious BIG, born Christopher Wallace, had been taking part in rap battles around Fulton Street, Brooklyn since he was 13 years old, but it was only at the urging of his friends that he quit a lucrative drugs operation and devoted himself to music. Living on a knife’s edge was all Biggie Smalls knew as a kid, when he was “waking up every morning, hustling, cutting school, looking out for my moms, the police, stickup kids just risking my life every day on the street selling drugs”, as he told Rolling Stone back in 1995. The things he witnessed and experienced were poured into Ready to Die – one of the best debut albums in hip hop – delivered in his signature throaty vocals with wit and humour.At less than 30 minutes, Ramones’ debut injects their rage, their disillusionment and their frustration directly into the listener’s veins. It’s a record that spurned the posturing of Seventies rock and stripped all of the artifice away to the bare bones beneath, with songs such as “Beat on the Brat” and “Now I Wanna Sniff Some Glue” proving to be as surly as the band themselves. “Our early songs came out of our real feelings of alienation, isolation, frustration – the feelings everybody feels between seventeen and seventy-five,” singer Joey Ramone said. The whole record cost just $6,000 to make.NWA unveiled their cold, menacing sound on debut record Straight Outta Compton that heralded the beginning of gangsta rap and also launched the careers of Dr Dre, Eazy-E and Ice Cube. The latter made it clear they weren’t positioning themselves as people to look up to: “Do I look like a mother***ing role mode?” he demands on “Gangsta Gangsta”. Their track “F*** tha Police” – a protest track against racism and police brutality – led to them receiving a threatening letter from the FBI, which only contributed to their growing fame.Dubbed the Banana Album for its famous Andy Warhol cover art, The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico is proof of what a band can do when they are completely fearless. With Nico – the beautiful German vocalist added to the band at Warhol’s request – you have this exquisite balance of cool femininity and fiery machismo. Sex and hedonism are everywhere on this record, from “Venus in Furs” to “Run Run Run”, but it’s not so much glamour as glam rock – gritty tales of drug addiction and raw desire. Speaking of its initially low sales figures, Brian Eno observed that, nonetheless, “everyone who bought one of those 30,000 copies started a band”. David Bowie called it “the future of music”, and 52 years later, it still feels like it.A virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Jimi Hendrix used Are You Experienced  to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”.  And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his.“Jesus died for somebody’s sins, but not mine,” go the immortal opening words of Patti Smith’s debut album Horses. There’s a heady anticipation as she speaks the lyric in a low, seductive murmur, before switching to a cocky swagger as the electric guitar line kicks in. It was a bold move, to open her debut album with a reinvention of someone else’s song (in this case Van Morrison’s “Gloria”), but Smith was unlike anything the music world had ever seen. She was a poet, who wanted to capture the literary genius of her idol Arthur Rimbaud and channel it via the raw passion of an artist like Jimi Hendrix. “She was like a wildcat, walking out with this jacket slung over her shoulder,” Sonic Youth’s Thurston Moore once recalled of seeing her perform the album live in 1976. “It was life-changing.”How good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried – and failed – to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around – Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor – was a move that Complex blamed for “ruining hip hop”, while still praising Nas’s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densley-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source’s 1991 track “Live at the BBQ”: ‘When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.”Unknown Pleasures is unlike any album that had been created before it – or indeed any album since. It’s mysteriousness makes it as compelling as many great works of literature indeed, our critic Chris Harvey said the spiritual force emanating from the Joy Division\u0027s record\u0027s grooves make it feel “almost Dostoevskyan”. Peter Hook’s basslines veer and thrum wildly beneath Ian Curtis’s dark mutterings that are at once urgent, detached, and strangely sexless. On “She’s Lost Control” it as though you’re hearing the band play from the end of a dark tunnel – the echoes of Curtis\u0027s voice and the ominous rumblings of that bass build and build. By the time you reach those final, shivery notes on “I Remember Nothing”, it doesn’t feel like an overstatement to call this a life-changing record.135 35) Arctic Monkeys – Whatever People Say I Am, That’s What I’m Not (2006)A new wave of British guitar bands was already being pioneered by the likes of The Libertines, Bloc Party and Franz Ferdinand when the Sheffield-formed Arctic Monkeys arrived on the scene. But their 2006 debut – the defiantly titled Whatever People Say I Am, That’s What I’m Not – is arguably the most generation-defining, by a band experiencing the kind of hype that hadn’t been seen since Oasis with Definitely Maybe. Alex Turner’s sardonic and keenly observational lyrics on songs like “Fake Tales of San Francisco” and “When the Sun Goes Down” had fans clamouring to get into their early shows. It was an early example of the power the internet would hold over the music industry – propelling them from an unknown indie band on MySpace to the top of the charts in the space of six months.Please Please Me has a rhythm to it like little else released by The Beatles. Songs like “Twist and Shout” and “I Saw Her Standing There” have an energy that reflects the youthful vim of the band themselves, who were raring to go following the number one single from which the album takes its name. Their harmonies are thrilling to hear, and this is arguably the best album for capturing the band’s raw power.335 33) Yeah Yeah Yeahs – Fever to Tell (2003)In 2003, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs stuck a middle finger up to the naysayers who scoffed that they were little more than a bunch of posers. Their debut album Fever to Tell is a bristling record loaded with New York snark supplied by Karen O’s impressive vocal turns. Nick Zinner keeps the urgency going with roaring guitar licks while Brian Chase offers earth-shaking percussion on the likes of “Date With the Night” and “Y Control”. More than trendsetters – the Yeah Yeah Yeahs were the brains behind the smartest album of that year.Kanye West called it “white crunk music”. The band themselves called it “music for girls to dance to”. And songs such as “This Fire” certainly livened things up their irresistible hooks and disco energy, as frontman Alex Kapranos turned the male gaze on its head with lyrics like “I can feel your lips undress my eyes”. Fifteeen years later and “Take Me Out” still makes you swing your hips.Blur versus Oasis is a battle music fans will be waging for decades to come, but when it comes to debut albums, Oasis emerge as top dogs. Definitely Maybe was exciting, aggressive and loaded with attitude: a 22-year-old Liam Gallagher spits and snarls over the reverb-soaked guitars of “Cigarettes \u0026amp Alcohol”, and soars on that falsetto for “Live Forever”. Among the “too cool for school” alt-rockers who spurned the glitz and glamour of fame, Oasis asserted themselves as the definitive rock and roll stars.Stefani Germanotta’s debut album The Fame brought maximalist pop back to the forefront of the late-Noughties music scene, in an industry that was desperately lacking in pop as. Lady Gaga already sounded famous and she acted famous – but that doesn’t mean her music couldn’t stand on its own. Songs like “Beautiful, Dirty, Rich” and “Just Dance” seemed to convey Gaga’s love of fame and hedonism while remaining supremely self-aware of its superficiality. To top it off, it was masterfully produced and resplendent with slick, catchy dancepop and Eurodisco influences.Kendrick Lamar subtitled his debut record “A Short Film by Kendrick Lamar”, and indeed it feels as though you’re watching the movie of his early life – such is the autobiographical nature of this record. He raps in low, furtive tones, interrupted by voicemails from his family (his mother asks him pleadingly to return her car) that reinforce the familial themes. It is family, and faith, that keep Lamar on the outskirts of a world of violence and sin. Even this early on his career you hear the virtuosity and acute understanding of rhythm – Good kid, m.A.A.d City now stands as a classic album from a rapper who chooses the power of storytelling over a cheap punchline.Not every great debut album is defined by whether the artist has landed on their “sound” by the first track. Led Zeppelin were still figuring things out when they released their self-titled debut, yet it is essential because it laid the groundwork for what they would go onto achieve the following decade. “We were learning what got us off most and what got people off most,” Robert Plant said. You had the blues and folk notes on “Babe I’m Gonna Leave You”, and the chugging rock of “Communication Breakdown” Plant’s yowling vocals and Jimmy Page’s guitar. It did the trick.935 27) The Jesus and Mary Chain – Psychocandy (1985)“It was the crap coming out of the radio that made us want to be in a band more than anything else,” Jim Reid told Rolling Stone for the 30th anniversary of the Scottish alt-rocker’s debut album Psychocandy. “Because it was like, ‘Why is everything we hear so f***ing awful?’ That was the main driving force: how bad things were.” Psychocandy was certainly like nothing anyone else released at that time. Inspired by the Velvet Underground and The Stooges, the Reid brothers loaded their debut with buzzy guitars and hair-raising levels of feedback on singles like “You Trip Me Up” and “Never Understand”. It paved the way for countless shoegaze and alt-rock bands in the decades that followed.Grace is a masterpiece, and the only album the perfectionist Jeff Buckley was satisfied with before he drowned, aged 30, in a freak accident in Memphis in 1997. Yet had Grace been the only material ever released under his name (live recordings, covers and demos were released posthumously), it would have been enough to prove he was a rare and exceptional talent. His exquisite rendering of Leonard Cohen’s “Hallelujah”, his melismatic singing on “Grace” and the church-like hush of “Lover, You Should Come Over” – all of this and more carved out a rich legacy that ensures Buckley’s music will never fade.The whipsmart, cynical, outrageous young man on Eminem’s major label debut was a breath of fresh air – or perhaps more of a slap in the face – after a spate of soulful, conscious hip hop records. Of course, the rampant misogyny and homophobia his so-called “character” Slim Shady spat out caused uproar, regardless of how surreal the scenarios to which they were applied were.  Arguably what stands out the most on The Slim Shady LP is the sheer technical skill and lyrical ability that few have been able to match since.Not only did it lay the groundwork for so many punk, rock and heavy metal bands that came after them – but the manic rhythms and raw intensity of their power-chord ballads featured on The Who\u0027s my Generation propelled rock and roll to new heights in 1965.“Saviours of rock and roll!” “The greatest rock band since the Rolling Stones!” You have to pity The Strokes, who released their debut album under the biggest wave of hype imaginable. Yet it’s hard to deny the impact Is This It had on rock music – critics have argued that the Arctic Monkeys and Franz Ferdinand wouldn’t have existed if not for this band. They eschewed pre-programmed beats and autotuned vocals in favour of a gritty post-punk approach, and the result was an album that reinvigorated a floundering music industry, and inspired an entire generation of bands.The idea of a rap album was virtually inconceivable until Run-DMC released their full-length, self-titled debut in 1984. When he inducted them into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Eminem called them “the first movie stars of rap… they are The Beatles”. Busta Rhymes proclaimed: “Run-DMC didn’t change music, they changed everything.” The trio’s aggressive yet stark tracks – like “Sucker MCS” and “Hard Times” – were a dramatic contrast against the R\u0026ampB-driven rap of the time, an approach emulated by the rappers themselves, who spurned outlandish costumes in favour of tracksuits and sneakers. As an anniversary piece in Billboard noted, “they were authentic before authenticity in hip hop was even a thing”.Brian Eno’s experimental synths met Bryan Ferry’s romantic, old-school charm on the debut album from Roxy Music\u0027s bizarre art-glam-rock outfit. There were odes to Humphrey Bogart (“2HB”) and cyber-rock jams (“Ladytron”), and songs decorated with spooky-sounding hooks that wouldn’t sound out of place in The Rocky Horror Show (the character Riff Raff even seemed to take his cues from a balding Brian Eno).Still regarded by many as his greatest album to date, Reasonable Doubt asserted Jay-Z as a master freestyle – perhaps the best of his generation – recorded in a studio he compared to a psychiatrist’s couch. At the heart of the record is a blistering duet with the Notorious BIG, “Brooklyn’s Finest”, which practically heralded the shift of focus back from West Coast hip hop to the East.Rolling Stone\u0027s Lester Bangs described the Black Sabbath as “just like Cream! But worse”, and their debut album as “a shuck – despite the murky song titles and some inane lyrics that sound like Vanilla Fudge paying doggerel tribute to Aleister Crowley, the album has nothing to do with spiritualism, the occult, or anything much except stiff recitations of Cream clichés”. The Village Voice weren’t keen either, with critic Robert Christgau condemning it as “bulls**t necromancy.” Yet this is the album that invented heavy metal. Black Sabbath arrived ready to lure fans over to the dark side with Ozzy Osbourne’s piercing, operatic cry: “My name is Lucifer, please take my hand.” Critics be damned.1835 18) Sex Pistols – Never Mind the Bollocks, Here\u0027s the Sex Pistols (1977)“The album will last. The sleeve may not,” said the adverts for the Sex Pistols’ first and only studio album in 1977. The Sex Pistols were already controversial before the release of Never Mind the Bollocks, having caused nationwide uproar for swearing on live TV, been fired from two record labels, and been banned from a number of live venues in England. Yet despite many major retailers refusing to sell it, the album debuted at number one on the UK album charts and is today regarded as one of the most important punk albums in music history.Joe Strummer was a ball of rage and ambition when he and the rest of The Clash laid down the tracks for their debut album. Most of the guitar on this record was provided by Mick Jones, because Strummer didn’t think technical ability was punk enough. Yet their vision burns through on the buzz-saw attack of “Career Opportunities” and “White Riot”, raising a fist against unemployment, racism and the fat cats of industry. 2035 16) Guns N Roses – Appetite for Destruction (1987)Guns N Roses\u0027 Appetite for Destruction was the biggest thing to happen to hard rock since Led Zeppelin IV. Slash’s guitar and Axl Rose’s wild, animal howls contribute to the raw energy on songs like “Paradise City” and marked a dramatic shift away from the commercialised heavy rock that was being played on MTV at the time – proudly championing a gritty form of hedonism instead. “A lot of rock bands are too f***ing wimpy to have any sentiment or emotion,” Rose said. Not this band.Daft Punk\u0027s Homework was originally intended as “just a load of singles”, until Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo realised they had enough quality tracks for a full-length release. Each one opens with a kind of motif upon which multiple textures build and sprawl outwards – sleazy guitar hooks, G-funk whines and glittering synths. It’s the album that alerted the rest of the world to the French house music scene.Sex and poetry go hand in hand, especially if you’re a Jim Morrison fan. While few bands manage to ide critical opinion as much as The Doors, their debut album’s organ-driven rock was as tight as their frontman’s famous leather trousers. They brought theatricality to the Sixties music scene and went onto inspire as broad a range of artists as The Stranglers to Skrillex. The baroque pop stylings and lustful lyrics on “Light My Fire” proved to be a breakthrough, and helped propel them to number two on the US Billboard 200.After making a name for himself on Jay-Z’s The Blueprint as well as by producing hits for Janet Jackson and Ludacris, Kanye West spent four years recording The College Dropout. His background as a producer was obviously beneficial to his own debut, at a time where hip hop sampling was being accused of being too safe. And he subverted many other hip hop clichés, skirting round the dominant “gangsta” persona and instead finding solace in family and the church.2435 12) Pink Floyd – The Piper at the Gates of Dawn (1967)Pink Floyd’s debut The Piper at the Gates of Dawn stands as a classic of psychedelic rock. Helmed by an unravelling Syd Barrett – ousted a year after the album’s release – it shows the band at their most playful, with several tracks going onto become staples of their live shows. Songs such as “Bike”, meanwhile, proved the band were not averse to a good pop hook along with the acid guitars and hazy production. 2535 11) Lauryn Hill – The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998)Lauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with the immense and groundbreaking record, The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill. Flipping between two tones – sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky – the former Fugees member stepped out from rap’s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R\u0026ampB, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D’Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill’s reggae influences are what drive the album’s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around.2635 10) Dizzee Rascal – Boy in Da Corner (2003)It’s staggering to listen back to Boy in Da Corner and remember Dizzee Rascal was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London’s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track “Sittin’ Here”. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener’s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk.2735 9) Beastie Boys – Licensed to Ill (1986)Hip hop’s first number one album was an incendiary, all-guns-blazing record that would send shockwaves around the music industry for years to come. Few artists release something so assertive as this – a statement of intent to middle America that demanded they fight for their right to party. Beastie Boys\u0027 Mike D, Ad-Rock and MCA would move on from the frat boy humour and “good time” attitude of Licensed to Ill, but it is that record that delivered rap against a backdrop of Led Zeppelin and James Brown-inspired guitar licks.2835 8) The Notorious BIG – Ready to Die (1994)The rapper Notorious BIG, born Christopher Wallace, had been taking part in rap battles around Fulton Street, Brooklyn since he was 13 years old, but it was only at the urging of his friends that he quit a lucrative drugs operation and devoted himself to music. Living on a knife’s edge was all Biggie Smalls knew as a kid, when he was “waking up every morning, hustling, cutting school, looking out for my moms, the police, stickup kids just risking my life every day on the street selling drugs”, as he told Rolling Stone back in 1995. The things he witnessed and experienced were poured into Ready to Die – one of the best debut albums in hip hop – delivered in his signature throaty vocals with wit and humour.At less than 30 minutes, Ramones’ debut injects their rage, their disillusionment and their frustration directly into the listener’s veins. It’s a record that spurned the posturing of Seventies rock and stripped all of the artifice away to the bare bones beneath, with songs such as “Beat on the Brat” and “Now I Wanna Sniff Some Glue” proving to be as surly as the band themselves. “Our early songs came out of our real feelings of alienation, isolation, frustration – the feelings everybody feels between seventeen and seventy-five,” singer Joey Ramone said. The whole record cost just $6,000 to make.NWA unveiled their cold, menacing sound on debut record Straight Outta Compton that heralded the beginning of gangsta rap and also launched the careers of Dr Dre, Eazy-E and Ice Cube. The latter made it clear they weren’t positioning themselves as people to look up to: “Do I look like a mother***ing role mode?” he demands on “Gangsta Gangsta”. Their track “F*** tha Police” – a protest track against racism and police brutality – led to them receiving a threatening letter from the FBI, which only contributed to their growing fame.Dubbed the Banana Album for its famous Andy Warhol cover art, The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico is proof of what a band can do when they are completely fearless. With Nico – the beautiful German vocalist added to the band at Warhol’s request – you have this exquisite balance of cool femininity and fiery machismo. Sex and hedonism are everywhere on this record, from “Venus in Furs” to “Run Run Run”, but it’s not so much glamour as glam rock – gritty tales of drug addiction and raw desire. Speaking of its initially low sales figures, Brian Eno observed that, nonetheless, “everyone who bought one of those 30,000 copies started a band”. David Bowie called it “the future of music”, and 52 years later, it still feels like it.A virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Jimi Hendrix used Are You Experienced  to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”.  And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his.“Jesus died for somebody’s sins, but not mine,” go the immortal opening words of Patti Smith’s debut album Horses. There’s a heady anticipation as she speaks the lyric in a low, seductive murmur, before switching to a cocky swagger as the electric guitar line kicks in. It was a bold move, to open her debut album with a reinvention of someone else’s song (in this case Van Morrison’s “Gloria”), but Smith was unlike anything the music world had ever seen. She was a poet, who wanted to capture the literary genius of her idol Arthur Rimbaud and channel it via the raw passion of an artist like Jimi Hendrix. “She was like a wildcat, walking out with this jacket slung over her shoulder,” Sonic Youth’s Thurston Moore once recalled of seeing her perform the album live in 1976. “It was life-changing.”How good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried – and failed – to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around – Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor – was a move that Complex blamed for “ruining hip hop”, while still praising Nas’s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densley-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source’s 1991 track “Live at the BBQ”: ‘When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.”Unknown Pleasures is unlike any album that had been created before it – or indeed any album since. It’s mysteriousness makes it as compelling as many great works of literature indeed, our critic Chris Harvey said the spiritual force emanating from the Joy Division\u0027s record\u0027s grooves make it feel “almost Dostoevskyan”. Peter Hook’s basslines veer and thrum wildly beneath Ian Curtis’s dark mutterings that are at once urgent, detached, and strangely sexless. On “She’s Lost Control” it as though you’re hearing the band play from the end of a dark tunnel – the echoes of Curtis\u0027s voice and the ominous rumblings of that bass build and build. By the time you reach those final, shivery notes on “I Remember Nothing”, it doesn’t feel like an overstatement to call this a life-changing record.Since the clip was shared online, Hart has been condemned for his attitude towards Lil Nas X.\u0026nbspThe Daily Beast\u0027s Goldie Taylor wrote: Kevin Hart knows exactly what the \u0027so what\u0027 is here and why a young black boy would closet his sexuality until he believed it was safe. Why not simply listen, give Lil Nas X the space and deference to tell his own story...Vox\u0027s Jenee Desmond-Harris said: Kevin Hart\u0027s rage and bitterness about anything to do with gay people is so jarring. Lil Nas X seems so stable and healthy and Kevin seems so... not okay.Hart stepped down from hosting the 2019 Oscars in December last year after a number of homophobic tweets he had posted resurfaced, including one where he said he would beat his son if he found him playing with a doll\u0027s house and say stop, that\u0027s gay.In his 2010 comedy special\u0026nbspSeriously Funny,\u0026nbsphe also claimed having a gay son was his biggest fear.\u0026nbspWatch the video for Lil Nas X\u0027s\u0026nbspnew\u0026nbspsong Panini here.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Yet few are likely to have as much inspiration to draw on as India-born, Zimbabwe-raised and now Peckham-based artist Rina Mushonga.On Deerhunter’s eighth album, frontman Bradford Cox takes on the role of war poet, documenting the things he observes with a cool matter-of-factness, and heart-wrenching detail. Death is everywhere on Why Hasn’t Everything Already Disappeared?, as much as others may refuse to see it.After a period of tumult, Sharon Van Etten’s fifth album is a reinvention. But beneath its hazy synths and electronics are songs of endurance and inner peace, of settling after a flurry of activity. 443 Bring Me the Horizon  – AmoBMTH frontman Oli Sykes wants to assert the fragility of the boundary between love and hate. Amo is a way of exploring that, even down to the title itself.543 Nina Nesbitt – The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will ChangeNesbitt is back with her second LP, switching to a brand of soul and R\u0026ampB-fused pop that feels bang on time, and suits her far better. The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will Change has slick, polished production from Fraser T Smith (Adele), Lostboy (Anne-Marie), Jordan Riley (Zara Larsson), and Nesbitt herself.This self-titled record, a loose but beautifully crafted collection of folk-rock songs, explores the kinds of anxieties intrinsic to the modern age – the longing to be at once noticed and invisible the paralysing effects of limitless information, and the desire to do good versus the desire to be seen doing good.The album is packed with personal confessions for the fans – “Arianators” – to pick over. It lacks a centrepiece to match the arresting depth and space of Sweetener’s “God Is A Woman”, but Grande handles its shifting moods and cast of producers (including pop machines Max Martin and Tommy Brown) with engaging class and momentum. One minute you’re skanking along to the party brass of “Bloodline” the next floating into the semi-detached, heartbreak of “Ghostin’”, which appears to address Grande’s guilt at being with Davidson while pining for Miller. She sings of the late rapper as a “wingless angel” with featherlight high notes that will drop the sternest jaw. (Helen Brown)The perma-brilliant James Blake has flooded his fourth album – Assume Form – with euphoric sepia soul and loved-up doo-wop. His trademark intelligence, honesty and pin-drop production remain intact. But the detached chorister vocals of a decade in which he battled depression have thawed to reveal a millennial Sam Cooke crooning: “Can’t believe the way we flow, way we flow, way we flow...”While he recognises his roots and includes plenty of nods to grime, AJ Tracey\u0027s magpie’s eye for a good melody or hook extends far beyond that. With the help of stellar producers like Cadenza (Kiko Bun), Swifta Beater (Kano, Giggs), and Nyge (Section Boyz, Yxng Bane), Tracey incorporates electronic music, rock, garage and even country on his most cohesive work to date.The album title of the year gives us an image of Brexit Britain trashed by Old Etonians David Cameron, Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg, but the fifth studio work from the punk duo has more than social commentary to offer. There’s some of that, as vocalist Jason Williamson skewers documentary-makers who take advantage of the poor in “Kebab Spider” – “the skint get used in loo roll shoes” – but elsewhere this is a record that expands the idea of what Sleaford Mods could be.“Do you still have that photograph? Would you use it to hurt me?” asks Australian indie rocker Julia Jacklin, against the menacing throb of “Body”. The tension is stormy: imagine a mid-period Fleetwood Mac song, covered by Cat Power. It’s a masterclass in narrative songwriting.With praise from Kendrick Lamar, five EPs released by the time she was 21, tours with Lauryn Hill, collaborations with Gorillaz and two critically praised albums – including 2017’s excellent concept album Stillness in Wonderland – fans and critics alike wondered what else Little Simz could do to find the kind of mainstream success enjoyed by so many of her male peers.1343 Solange – When I Get HomeSolange Knowles has never been coy about the intent behind her music. Beautiful arrangements and seamless production notwithstanding, you get the sense, each time she drop a project, that it serves a distinct, zeitgeist-shifting purpose.1443 Foals – Everything Not Saved Will be Lost (Part 1)FoalsMerging their asymmetrical early math pop with the deep space atmospherics of Total Life Forever and Holy Fire, plus added innovations – ambient rainforest throbs on “Moonlight”, deadpan EDM on “In Degrees”, Afro-glitch Radiohead on “Café D’Athens” – they’ve created an inspired album of scorched earth new music that, in all likelihood, will only really be challenged for album of the year by Part 2. (Mark Beaumont)Tracks are at once astute and deeply personal in how they capture vignettes of everyday life and spin them into important lessons. “Black”, the most recent single from the record, considers what that word means to different people around the world, as well as to Dave. “Voices” has him singing over an old-school garage beat, fighting off personal demons.At her best, Sigrid throws out precision-tooled high notes like icicle javelins into vast, blue Scandi-produced skies. Then she growls like an Icelandic volcano preparing to disrupt western civilisation until we sort ourselves out.1743 Karen O and Danger Mouse – Lux PrimaLux Prima was born just over a decade ago from a drunken phone call from Karen O to Danger Mouse – real name Brian Joseph Burton – during which the pair vowed they would work on something together. It wasn’t until after O had given birth to her son, though, that recording finally began, and there is a beatific sense of contentment on songs like “Drown”, with its Kamasi Washington-like choirs and stately horns.This is an ambitious creation, meticulously crafted and assembled. For a start, the range of guest performers is a cornucopia of contemporary soul and hip-hop collaborators: vocalists Moses Sumney, Roots Manuva, Heidi Vogel, Grey Reverend and Tawiah strings player Miguel Atwood-Ferguson, and keyboardist Dennis Hamm – both of whom have worked with Flying Lotus and Thundercat.Rose – who found fame in the UK’s indie-folk scene as an unofficial member of Bombay Bicycle Club in 2010, only to walk away amid the band’s growing hype – is darkly compelling on No Words Left. Assisted by producer Tim Bidwell, who worked on Rose’s last record Something’s Changing, she sounds braver than she ever has before. There are moments that recall her Communion labelmate Ben Howard, on his latest album, Noonday Dream, and others that nod to the quiet stoicism of Joni Mitchell and Neil Young. (Roisin O\u0027Connor)The record is loosely conceptual insomuch as it’s punctuated with mock adverts for “WWAY HEALTH, our 247 care programme”. But don’t be put off: Miss Universe is a brilliant collection of songs, an expansive melange of indie, jazz, pop and trip-hop that flits between a lo-fi sparseness and something The Strokes would play. Yanya – who is of Turkish-Irish-Bajan heritage – grew up in London on a mix of Pixies, Nina Simone, The Libertines and Amy Winehouse, and this unlikely combination is certainly reflected in the sound. (Patrick Smith)2143 Jenny Lewis – On the LineHere, Lewis does what she does best: adds the glossy sparkle of Hollywood and a sunny Californian sheen to melancholy and nostalgia, with her most luxuriantly orchestrated album yet. Even when she’s singing, “I’ve wasted my youth”, it’s in that sweet voice, with carefree “doo doo doo doo doo doos”, and at a pace that’s so upbeat that it masks the sentiment. It’s a bittersweet mourning of her past. (Elisa Bray)Comprising songs from Segall’s eclectic (that’s putting it lightly) catalogue and performed by him and the Freedom Band (Mikal Cronin, Charles Moothart, Emmett Kelly, and Ben Boye), the album is delightfully short and sweet. It is certainly a drastic switch-up from Freedom’s Goblin (2018), which had 19 tracks and ran for 75 minutes.If you want to know how hard it is to categorise Titanic Rising – the enthralling fourth album from Weyes Blood – look no further than the American musician’s own attempt to do so. It is, she says, “The Kinks meet the Second World War, or Bob Seger meets Enya.”Tension aside, there’s a great sense of fun here. The title track is pure euphoria, as restless synths of a Utah Saints or Orbital rave break into swelling bass and melody. And they create the full club experience with “Got to Keep On”, on which the four-to-the-floor beat, funky rhythm guitar, sweet backing vocals and chiming bells make way for the simple sounds of happy party-goers just as the anticipation builds, so does the instrumentation into a hypnotic crescendo. It’s masterful production. (Elisa Bray)Six months after the release of Oxnard, Anderson .Paak returns with another Dr Dre-produced record, Ventura. Where the former was overflowing with choppy, experimental sounds, guest appearances and clumsy attempts at Gil Scott Heron-esque revolutionary lyrics, the sequel – recorded around the same time – streamlines .Paak’s sound, making for a tightly packaged, melodic and danceable album.Two years after the release of his Mercury Prize-nominated debut Yesterday’s Gone, the south London hip-hop artist unveils its follow-up, Not Waving, But Drowning. And if any two records could portray how quickly someone can grow from a boy to a man, it’s these.2743 Lizzo – Cuz I Love YouNo one could accuse Lizzo of holding back. Not when it comes to her voice – which is raw and rowdy, so laden with personality even the vulnerable moments are a joy to listen to –  and certainly not when it comes to her message of unabashed self-love. That’s the predominant theme of the singer  rapper  flautist-extraordinaire’s hugely likeable third album, Cuz I Love You.It seems as likely as Old Man Steptoe dining with the Rees-Mogg, but this new tactic of burying their confrontational gruesomeness beneath a veneer of alt-rock respectability for album three works well for Fat White Family. Drenched in chamber strings and celestial harmonies, the plush yet sinister “Oh Sebastian” could be Pet Sounds selling its soul to the devil. “Fringe Runner” is so sleek and funksome it could be a New Romantic “White Lines (Don’t Don’t Do It)” “Kim’s Sunsets” is a piece of refined cosmic reggae resembling a blissed-out “Bankrobber”.2943 Cage the Elephant – Social CuesOn Cage the Elephant’s fifth album, Social Cues, frontman Matt Shultz reacts to the breakdown of his marriage and the loss of three close friends. He undergoes a kind of Jekyll and Hyde transition through the 13 tracks, the result of which is the band’s best work to date.SOAK reaches to outsiders once again on her new album. 3143 The Cranberries – In the EndThere’s a cruel irony that the release of The Cranberries’ final album should come just a week after journalist Lyra McKee was shot dead by the New IRA during a riot in Londonderry. “Zombie” was a protest song written by the band’s late frontwoman Dolores O’Riordan after two children were killed by IRA bombs – was released. She was deeply affected by the deaths, and would no doubt have been devastated by recent events in Northern Ireland as well.On her third record, Aldous Harding combines the gothic folk of her self-titled 2014 debut with the dramatically intimate tones of her follow-up album Party.Big Thief’s frontwoman Adrianne Lenker has an uncanny ability to make you feel like you’re in on a secret. Her whispering, spectral delivery and deeply personal lyrics are the key to this. Even on the band’s third album UFOF, with an audience that has grown exponentially in the past few years, the songs are still immensely intimate affairs.On his debut album, the 24-year-old Collard mixes sultry jams that recall the electronic funk of MGMT with nods to the greats: Prince, James Brown, Led Zeppelin and Marvin Gaye. Throughout, Collard exhibits his extraordinary voice, which swoops to a devilishly low murmur or soars to an ecstatic falsetto.   Dedicated covers the full, but generic, spectrum of relationships: dizzying love, lust, and break-ups. But whether she’s pining for the return of a former love in the funky disco banger “Julien”, or singing about masturbating post-break-up in lead single “Party For One” (“I’ll be the one If you don’t care about me Making love to myself Back on my beat”), the vibe remains positively jubilant.Getty Images for Spotify3643 Tyler, the Creator - IGOR“I don’t know where I’m going,” Tyler, the Creator begins on the song “I THINK”. “But I know what I’m showing.” The US artist’s words ring true throughout his fifth studio album, IGOR, where he adopts the dark and twisted mutterings of the Frankenstein character from which the record gets its name. It’s been a long wait for Flying Lotus’s new album. In fact, the LA producer has been masterminding Flamagra for the past five years – snatching moments between collaborating with Kendrick Lamar on To Pimp a Butterfly, directing and writing the comic horror movie Kuso, producing much of Thundercat’s Drunk and growing his Brainfeeder label.A heftier sound is never at the cost of melody, which shines through in Thomson’s vocals, the rest of the band’s backing falsetto, and the searing blues grooves stamped all over Future Dust. Those qualities are captured nowhere more satisfyingly than on “25”. “All Over Town” is their singalong anthem, neatly positioned in the middle to ease the pace.In keeping with the relatively restrained guest spots, it’s heartening just how much Skepta has rejected overloading Ignorance is Bliss with high-profile producers, preferring instead to burrow into his own aesthetic. There’s no attempt to chase someone else’s wave here no token drill, afroswing or trap beats to satisfy playlist algorithms. Instead, his cold grime sonics are rendered down to their no-frills essentials – brutalist blocks of sad angular melodies and hard, spacious drums.Bruce Springsteen seems to have told almost every tale in the grand old storybook of American mythologies, except perhaps one: a wide-eyed Californian dreamer finds the Golden State turns sour and flees back east, to some romantic speck of a town, to pine and rehabilitate. It’s the classic pop plotline of Bacharach and David’s “Do You Know the Way to San Jose?”, and it’s a tale Springsteen taps repeatedly here, on his sumptuous, cinematic 19th album, which is nothing short of a late-period masterpiece.A revolving door of female vocalists (A-listers, indie darlings like Angel Olsen and unsung songwriters) deliver heartbroken lines over big, shiny beats and synths. The emotional cohesion the record loses in its shifting cast of singerssongwritersgenres it makes up in DJ-savvy textural variety. Help Us Stranger reaches all corners of guitar rock: funky Detroit garage (“What’s Yours Is Mine”) country soul (“Somedays (I Don’t Feel Like Trying)”) psych (a cover of Donovan’s “Hey Gyp (Dig the Slowness)”) blues and bluegrass (“Thoughts and Prayers”). A cornucopia of instrumentation is woven into its brisk 42-minute yarn.4343 Hot Chip - A Bath Full of EcstasyWhen Hot Chip achieved chart success with their second album, 2006’s The Warning, it seemed more like a happy coincidence than a sign they were conforming to current pop trends. Since then, they\u0027ve released a string of consistently great albums, from 2008’s Made in the Dark (featuring their only Top 10 single to date, “Ready for the Floor”) to this, their seventh and best record, A Bath Full of Ecstasy. It’s not uncommon for an artist to be influenced by the place they grew up in. Yet few are likely to have as much inspiration to draw on as India-born, Zimbabwe-raised and now Peckham-based artist Rina Mushonga.On Deerhunter’s eighth album, frontman Bradford Cox takes on the role of war poet, documenting the things he observes with a cool matter-of-factness, and heart-wrenching detail. Death is everywhere on Why Hasn’t Everything Already Disappeared?, as much as others may refuse to see it.After a period of tumult, Sharon Van Etten’s fifth album is a reinvention.

(Mark Beaumont)Tracks are at once astute and deeply personal in how they capture vignettes of everyday life and spin them into important lessons. “Black”, the most recent single from the record, considers what that word means to different people around the world, as well as to Dave. “Voices” has him singing over an old-school garage beat, fighting off personal demons.At her best, Sigrid throws out precision-tooled high notes like icicle javelins into vast, blue Scandi-produced skies. Then she growls like an Icelandic volcano preparing to disrupt western civilisation until we sort ourselves out.1743 Karen O and Danger Mouse – Lux PrimaLux Prima was born just over a decade ago from a drunken phone call from Karen O to Danger Mouse – real name Brian Joseph Burton – during which the pair vowed they would work on something together. It wasn’t until after O had given birth to her son, though, that recording finally began, and there is a beatific sense of contentment on songs like “Drown”, with its Kamasi Washington-like choirs and stately horns.This is an ambitious creation, meticulously crafted and assembled. For a start, the range of guest performers is a cornucopia of contemporary soul and hip-hop collaborators: vocalists Moses Sumney, Roots Manuva, Heidi Vogel, Grey Reverend and Tawiah strings player Miguel Atwood-Ferguson, and keyboardist Dennis Hamm – both of whom have worked with Flying Lotus and Thundercat.Rose – who found fame in the UK’s indie-folk scene as an unofficial member of Bombay Bicycle Club in 2010, only to walk away amid the band’s growing hype – is darkly compelling on No Words Left. Assisted by producer Tim Bidwell, who worked on Rose’s last record Something’s Changing, she sounds braver than she ever has before. There are moments that recall her Communion labelmate Ben Howard, on his latest album, Noonday Dream, and others that nod to the quiet stoicism of Joni Mitchell and Neil Young. (Roisin O\u0027Connor)The record is loosely conceptual insomuch as it’s punctuated with mock adverts for “WWAY HEALTH, our 247 care programme”. But don’t be put off: Miss Universe is a brilliant collection of songs, an expansive melange of indie, jazz, pop and trip-hop that flits between a lo-fi sparseness and something The Strokes would play. Yanya – who is of Turkish-Irish-Bajan heritage – grew up in London on a mix of Pixies, Nina Simone, The Libertines and Amy Winehouse, and this unlikely combination is certainly reflected in the sound. (Patrick Smith)2143 Jenny Lewis – On the LineHere, Lewis does what she does best: adds the glossy sparkle of Hollywood and a sunny Californian sheen to melancholy and nostalgia, with her most luxuriantly orchestrated album yet. Even when she’s singing, “I’ve wasted my youth”, it’s in that sweet voice, with carefree “doo doo doo doo doo doos”, and at a pace that’s so upbeat that it masks the sentiment. It’s a bittersweet mourning of her past. (Elisa Bray)Comprising songs from Segall’s eclectic (that’s putting it lightly) catalogue and performed by him and the Freedom Band (Mikal Cronin, Charles Moothart, Emmett Kelly, and Ben Boye), the album is delightfully short and sweet. It is certainly a drastic switch-up from Freedom’s Goblin (2018), which had 19 tracks and ran for 75 minutes.If you want to know how hard it is to categorise Titanic Rising – the enthralling fourth album from Weyes Blood – look no further than the American musician’s own attempt to do so. It is, she says, “The Kinks meet the Second World War, or Bob Seger meets Enya.”Tension aside, there’s a great sense of fun here. The title track is pure euphoria, as restless synths of a Utah Saints or Orbital rave break into swelling bass and melody. And they create the full club experience with “Got to Keep On”, on which the four-to-the-floor beat, funky rhythm guitar, sweet backing vocals and chiming bells make way for the simple sounds of happy party-goers just as the anticipation builds, so does the instrumentation into a hypnotic crescendo. It’s masterful production. (Elisa Bray)Six months after the release of Oxnard, Anderson .Paak returns with another Dr Dre-produced record, Ventura. Where the former was overflowing with choppy, experimental sounds, guest appearances and clumsy attempts at Gil Scott Heron-esque revolutionary lyrics, the sequel – recorded around the same time – streamlines .Paak’s sound, making for a tightly packaged, melodic and danceable album.Two years after the release of his Mercury Prize-nominated debut Yesterday’s Gone, the south London hip-hop artist unveils its follow-up, Not Waving, But Drowning. And if any two records could portray how quickly someone can grow from a boy to a man, it’s these.2743 Lizzo – Cuz I Love YouNo one could accuse Lizzo of holding back. Not when it comes to her voice – which is raw and rowdy, so laden with personality even the vulnerable moments are a joy to listen to –  and certainly not when it comes to her message of unabashed self-love. That’s the predominant theme of the singer  rapper  flautist-extraordinaire’s hugely likeable third album, Cuz I Love You.It seems as likely as Old Man Steptoe dining with the Rees-Mogg, but this new tactic of burying their confrontational gruesomeness beneath a veneer of alt-rock respectability for album three works well for Fat White Family. Drenched in chamber strings and celestial harmonies, the plush yet sinister “Oh Sebastian” could be Pet Sounds selling its soul to the devil. “Fringe Runner” is so sleek and funksome it could be a New Romantic “White Lines (Don’t Don’t Do It)” “Kim’s Sunsets” is a piece of refined cosmic reggae resembling a blissed-out “Bankrobber”.2943 Cage the Elephant – Social CuesOn Cage the Elephant’s fifth album, Social Cues, frontman Matt Shultz reacts to the breakdown of his marriage and the loss of three close friends. He undergoes a kind of Jekyll and Hyde transition through the 13 tracks, the result of which is the band’s best work to date.SOAK reaches to outsiders once again on her new album. 3143 The Cranberries – In the EndThere’s a cruel irony that the release of The Cranberries’ final album should come just a week after journalist Lyra McKee was shot dead by the New IRA during a riot in Londonderry. “Zombie” was a protest song written by the band’s late frontwoman Dolores O’Riordan after two children were killed by IRA bombs – was released. She was deeply affected by the deaths, and would no doubt have been devastated by recent events in Northern Ireland as well.On her third record, Aldous Harding combines the gothic folk of her self-titled 2014 debut with the dramatically intimate tones of her follow-up album Party.Big Thief’s frontwoman Adrianne Lenker has an uncanny ability to make you feel like you’re in on a secret. Her whispering, spectral delivery and deeply personal lyrics are the key to this. Even on the band’s third album UFOF, with an audience that has grown exponentially in the past few years, the songs are still immensely intimate affairs.On his debut album, the 24-year-old Collard mixes sultry jams that recall the electronic funk of MGMT with nods to the greats: Prince, James Brown, Led Zeppelin and Marvin Gaye. Throughout, Collard exhibits his extraordinary voice, which swoops to a devilishly low murmur or soars to an ecstatic falsetto.   Dedicated covers the full, but generic, spectrum of relationships: dizzying love, lust, and break-ups. But whether she’s pining for the return of a former love in the funky disco banger “Julien”, or singing about masturbating post-break-up in lead single “Party For One” (“I’ll be the one If you don’t care about me Making love to myself Back on my beat”), the vibe remains positively jubilant.Getty Images for Spotify3643 Tyler, the Creator - IGOR“I don’t know where I’m going,” Tyler, the Creator begins on the song “I THINK”. “But I know what I’m showing.” The US artist’s words ring true throughout his fifth studio album, IGOR, where he adopts the dark and twisted mutterings of the Frankenstein character from which the record gets its name. It’s been a long wait for Flying Lotus’s new album. In fact, the LA producer has been masterminding Flamagra for the past five years – snatching moments between collaborating with Kendrick Lamar on To Pimp a Butterfly, directing and writing the comic horror movie Kuso, producing much of Thundercat’s Drunk and growing his Brainfeeder label.A heftier sound is never at the cost of melody, which shines through in Thomson’s vocals, the rest of the band’s backing falsetto, and the searing blues grooves stamped all over Future Dust. Those qualities are captured nowhere more satisfyingly than on “25”. “All Over Town” is their singalong anthem, neatly positioned in the middle to ease the pace.In keeping with the relatively restrained guest spots, it’s heartening just how much Skepta has rejected overloading Ignorance is Bliss with high-profile producers, preferring instead to burrow into his own aesthetic. There’s no attempt to chase someone else’s wave here no token drill, afroswing or trap beats to satisfy playlist algorithms. Instead, his cold grime sonics are rendered down to their no-frills essentials – brutalist blocks of sad angular melodies and hard, spacious drums.Bruce Springsteen seems to have told almost every tale in the grand old storybook of American mythologies, except perhaps one: a wide-eyed Californian dreamer finds the Golden State turns sour and flees back east, to some romantic speck of a town, to pine and rehabilitate. It’s the classic pop plotline of Bacharach and David’s “Do You Know the Way to San Jose?”, and it’s a tale Springsteen taps repeatedly here, on his sumptuous, cinematic 19th album, which is nothing short of a late-period masterpiece.A revolving door of female vocalists (A-listers, indie darlings like Angel Olsen and unsung songwriters) deliver heartbroken lines over big, shiny beats and synths. The emotional cohesion the record loses in its shifting cast of singerssongwritersgenres it makes up in DJ-savvy textural variety. Help Us Stranger reaches all corners of guitar rock: funky Detroit garage (“What’s Yours Is Mine”) country soul (“Somedays (I Don’t Feel Like Trying)”) psych (a cover of Donovan’s “Hey Gyp (Dig the Slowness)”) blues and bluegrass (“Thoughts and Prayers”). A cornucopia of instrumentation is woven into its brisk 42-minute yarn.4343 Hot Chip - A Bath Full of EcstasyWhen Hot Chip achieved chart success with their second album, 2006’s The Warning, it seemed more like a happy coincidence than a sign they were conforming to current pop trends. Since then, they\u0027ve released a string of consistently great albums, from 2008’s Made in the Dark (featuring their only Top 10 single to date, “Ready for the Floor”) to this, their seventh and best record, A Bath Full of Ecstasy. Minaj\u0026nbsprose to prominence between 2007 and 2009 with her mixtapes, eventually delivering hits such as “Anaconda”, “Super Bass” and “Starships”.Her first album,\u0026nbspPink Friday, came out in 2010.\u0026nbspPink Friday: Roman Reloaded\u0026nbspfollowed in 2012.Minaj’s third studio album,\u0026nbspThe Pinkprint, was released in 2014, and her most recent album to date,\u0026nbspQueen, debuted in 2018.Throughout her career, Minaj has been heralded as one of the most influential hip hop artists of all\u0026nbsptime.She earned 10 Grammy nominations, six American Music Awards, 11 BET Awards and four\u0026nbspBillboard\u0026nbspmusic awards, among other accolades.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Sterling has tumbled almost 19 per cent since the EU referendum in June 2016.The government’s defeat by a margin of 328 to 301 on Tuesday leaves Mr Johnson’s Brexit strategy in tatters by potentially robbing him of the threat of no-deal, which he has repeatedly said is essential to obtain concessions from the EU.Responding from the despatch box immediately after the result, the prime minister said he would table a bill to trigger a general election, with a vote expected to take place soon after the anti-no deal bill completes its passage through the Commons on Wednesday.But Mr Johnson’s plans seemed doomed to failure after Labour said it would not back his election motion, which requires a two-thirds majority and is therefore dependent on opposition support to pass through the Commons, until the legislation to stop no-deal is passed.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

There are a lot of them.“Our data doesn’t reveal their size, but the sheer quantity of the material says that we can’t discount the possibility that there may be giant eels.“Therefore we can’t discount the possibility that what people see and believe is the Loch Ness Monster might be a giant eel.“Divers have claimed that they’ve seen eels that are as thick as their legs in the loch, whether they’re exaggerating or not – I don’t know – there is a possibility that there are very large eels present in the loch.“Whether they are as big as around 4m\u0026nbspas some of these sightings suggest – well, as a geneticist I think about mutations and natural variation a lot, and while an eel that big would be well outside the normal range, it seems not impossible that something could grow to such an unusual size.”He added: “Further investigation is needed to confirm or refute the theory, so based on our data, giant eels remain a plausible idea.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The unidentified creature was apparently enormous – around 25ft long and 4ft\u0026nbsphigh, with no discernable limbs, but with a large body and long neck. Spicer said it left a trail of broken undergrowth as it headed towards the loch.The following year, after at least two more sightings of unexplained creatures in the area, the most famous photograph of the Loch Ness Monster was taken by respected British surgeon, Colonel Robert Wilson.\u0026nbspIt was published in the Daily Mail on 21 April 1934, but Wilson initially refused to have his name published alongside, so it became known as “the surgeon’s photograph”.In the 1990s the photograph was revealed to have been a hoax masterminded by a man named Christian Spurling, who reportedly wanted to get some form of revenge on the Daily Mail after the newspaper publicly ridiculed his father-in-law,\u0026nbspthe actor and director Marmaduke Wetherell, for claiming\u0026nbsphe had found “Nessie footprints” which later turned out to be fake.Spurling made the “monster” out of a toy submarine fitted with a serpent head and neck.Since then, regular “sightings” have been claimed, and even more regular hoaxes made.Additional reporting by SWNSShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Minds Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Minds.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

And now.”Continuing his attack on the PM, he claimed Mr Johnson\u0027s cabinet “has no majority and no mandate” - but added that this was “not the only impediment to its moral authority to change the whole direction of our country”.Sir John described Mrs Johnson\u0027s front bench team as being “chalk and cheese in character” to the government elected two years ago, led by Theresa May.He stated: “It is not a cabinet of all the talents.

A reading below 50 indicates contraction, while higher than 50 shows growth.Duncan Brock, group director at the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply, said the sector had “clung on by its fingertips this month” as overseas clients “abandoned spending in favour of a wait-and-see approach and the political environment became increasingly murky”.He added: “There’s only so much companies can do to absorb costs before UK consumers notice the impact to their wallets, and only so much Brexit indecision the sector can take before it is tipped into contraction.”Recession fears grow as construction firms and retailers sufferBusiness confidence about the next 12 months in the service sector dropped in August to its lowest point since July 2016, the month after the\u0026nbspreferendum on membership of the European Union\u0026nbsp(EU).Similar surveys earlier this week showed the UK’s manufacturing sector was suffering its worst downturn for seven years and the construction industry had shrunk for the fourth month in a row.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He added: “The PMIs are excessively influenced by business sentiment and have given a misleadingly weak steer during the past 12 months of heightened political uncertainty.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Minds Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Minds.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

My brother gave it to me before he died.’ Omar lost both of his older brothers in the conflict. His brother Abdulrahman was just 7 years old when he died. \u0027He bought it for me in the market and told me to take care of it. We used to watch the cartoon together. I still watch it now.\u0027 He doesn\u0027t remember much about his home in Syria but he thinks it was as big as a Unicef Makani centre, where he goes for learning and psychosocial support. \u0027Most of our stuff we had to leave behind but my mum packed Ben 10 so I could play with it. It\u0027s so important to me. This toy is as precious to me as my own brother. I\u0027m going to keep it forever.\u0027 The best part of Omar’s day is sunset when he comes home from school and Makani, eats food and does his homework sitting with his family. His favourite subject is maths and he studies hard to achieve his dream. ‘I want to become a pilot. I used to be afraid of planes but now I want to travel. Maybe if I get on a plane I won’t be afraid anymore.’ Omar now has two little sisters in Za’atari Refugee Camp. He lets his youngest sister Islam play with Ben 10. When he gets dirty he puts him in the washing machine. ‘I’m the only boy now. I think my brother would be proud of me.’ Makani (which translates as ‘My Space’) centres provide an integrated set of services to children in the camp, including learning support, community-based child protection, early childhood development, adolescent and youth participation, life skills and innovation labs426 Yahya, 13, holds a passport photo of himself‘This is a photo of me. It’s my memory. It means a lot to me because it was taken for my school registration form. I was in the first grade for only one week and then we had to come here. I have memories from this time, both good and bad. I remember how my school looked, it was beautiful. I had started making friends and playing football. But the bad memories are of the war, when we were under bombing. I want to forget this memory and the memory of the journey here. It was night time when we left Syria and we could hardly see the road in front of us. We moved through valleys full of thorns that hurt when we stepped on them. People started throwing away their belongings because of how hard the journey was, anything heavy had to go. I had to leave behind my school books, my pens and my colours because my mum told me too. She said it wouldn’t be long before we came back home. But it’s been six years.’ He is now in sixth grade‘I was in first grade in Syria and my dad gave me this schoolbag. I was only little then but now I’m in the sixth grade.’ Although the schoolbag is now too small for him, he keeps it safe. ‘It’s important to me because my father gave it to me as a gift and I remember him by it. Also because it is from my country.’He still has happy memories from life in Syria, including going to school. ‘I used to feel really happy when break came and I could go to the shop. I remember playing in the schoolyard, my friends chasing me and me chasing them.’ Although he preferred his school in Syria, he still enjoys going to school in the camp. His favourite subject is English and he wants to become an English teacher. He has no plans to give up the old schoolbag. ‘I will keep this schoolbag forever. I will tell my children my father gave this to me and I kept it safe for all these years to show you.’726 Ayoub, 13, holds a set of spoons‘These are my spoons. I was six when I left Syria. I wanted to take them with me from Syria as a memory so I grabbed them as we were leaving the house and I carried them the whole way here. I used to eat my meals with them back at home so I thought that I am going to need them to eat when I come to the camp.’ Ayoub has dropped out of school in the camp but he continues to attend a Makani centre for learning and psychosocial support.  ‘When I grow up, I want to be a taxi driver because I want to leave the camp and go everywhere. I’ve been in a taxi before and I loved it. Inside the camp we don’t have taxis, only bicycles. I’m not in school so I can’t be a doctor or an engineer but I think it’s the easiest thing for me to do when I grow up. In Za\u0027atari, there are 13 Makani centres serving over 7,000 children. Located in every district of the camp, vulnerable children, youth and communities have access to Makani, no matter where they live826 Hamza, 14, holds a handwritten note, from his teacher in Syria‘This note was written by my teacher when I was in first grade in Syria. It’s a thank you letter to my family saying that I am a good student.’ The note calls Hamza a star. ‘I made sure to put it in my bag when we were coming here.’ Hamza is now in the eighth grade and has made a big effort to keep achieving academically, despite the disruption to his education. ‘It’s important for me to keep it because it reminds me of when I was the best student in my class.’926 Mohammad, 16, holds his hat‘This is my hat. My father used to work in Damascus. He bought it there and gave it to me. Life then was magnificent.’ He still remembers the beginning of the conflict in Syria. ‘Children were being killed and houses were being bombed. My father feared for our lives and for our future. When we had to leave Syria, it was winter. I remember crossing a valley and the ground being difficult to walk on. It was dangerous, cars were sliding on the ice.’ Mohammad brought as much of his clothing as he could carry to Za’atari but the hat remains his most loved item. ‘I wore it all the way crossing to Jordan and I still wear it every winter. It’s so precious, it reminds me of Syria. And it’s a gift from my Dad which is why it means so much to me.’Mohammad lives with his parents and brothers and sisters in the camp. He is in tenth grade and likes school. He feels like the camp is home because he is surrounded by his family and a bigger Syrian community who keep their memories alive. ‘My parents tell me about when we were little. They say that Syria was beautiful. I will go back home to my village and continue living there. I will bring my hat and tell my children everything about my story.’  When asked if it’s important for children in Za’atari to try to remember Syria when some of the memories are so traumatic, he replies straight away: ‘Both. I think it’s very important to keep memories but also to forget the horrors of war.’1126 Ahmad, 12, holds a key ring inscribed with his father\u0027s name‘This key ring belonged to my dad, I inherited it from him a long time ago. He died of a heart attack at the start of the war in Syria. I barely have any memories of my dad but the few I have are very precious. My favourite memory is the time he brought us to the river for a picnic and we played in the water. If I want to remember him, I take out his key ring and look at it.’Ahmad wants to be an architect when he grows us because his father worked in construction. ‘I still have a long way to go as I am only in the sixth grade but I will do my best. It would make my Dad proud of me.’ Ahmad lives with his grandmother and brother in the camp. Although they don’t have much, he says that their love is enough for him‘This toy is from Syria. Her name is Farah.’ Yara’s father gave her Farah for her birthday. ‘He used to buy me so many things.’ She enjoys taking off Farah’s dress, washing it and dressing her again. ‘I take care of her because I love her. I feel happy when I’m with her. I take her everywhere. I sleep with her. I tell her the story of Little Red Riding Hood – it’s about a wolf - to put her to sleep.’ Yara still has memories of her bedroom in Syria. ‘It was white and I had teddy bears and one was really big. Bigger than me. It got scary in Syria. There were shootings. Dad said get your stuff together, we’re going. I wanted to bring that teddy bear here but my parents said no, it was too big. So I put Farah in my bag. I told her we’re going to Za’atari. I told her don’t made any sound because if you do, we can’t go in. She was scaredWe were both happy when we arrived in Za’atari. I brought a pink dress too just like Farah’s. I am never going to get rid of her. I have so many toys, even one that costs 5 JD, but I love this one.’ Yara goes to school in the camp and wants to be a pharmacist when she grows up so she can give people medicine that will heal them.  She wants to return to Syria. ‘I will dress her up and get her ready and we will go. But this time, I’m bringing all of my toys1526 Hala, 11, holding a photo of her and her older brother in Syria‘My favourite photo is me and my brother together. It was a Friday. My mum had dressed me nicely for Friday prayer, then we went to the market and a restaurant. After that we went to a photographer’s studio where this photo was taken.’ Hala keeps her photos from Syria hidden in her closet to keep them safe. She takes them out from time to time to look at them. ‘I only remember the war. I used to be so afraid. Bombs used to fall all around our house. Without photos, I wouldn’t know what it was like to be a kid in Syria. Because Syria is in my heart, it is my country where I was born. When I look at this photo, I remember those days again. There aren’t enough words to describe the life I see in these photos. It’s pure happiness.’ Hala missed two years of her education because of the conflict, one in Syria and one in Jordan. Now she is in the fourth grade. ‘I love school a lot. Arabic is my favourite subject and I want to be a surgeon. My mum told me that it was her dream when she was a child to become one but she got married instead. I want her to fulfil her dream through me.’ As well as getting a good education, Hala knows what it will take to achieve her dream. ‘I have to be courageous and not fear anything.’‘These are my house keys. I brought them with me because when we go back to Syria, I’m going to be the one who opens the door. My parents tell me that Syria is beautiful. I was so little that I don’t remember.’Rudaina is in fourth grade and her favourite subject is Maths. She wants to be a pediatrician when she grows up. ‘We once had a home but now we live in a caravan. I feel so sad when I hold the keys because I’m so far away from home.‘This is my blanket. When I was little and it was my birthday, my grandmother bought it for me. I remember that we had to flee because there was bombing. It was night time. That’s why we came here. I was covered in it when I was little and I came here. It protected me against the cold and the rain. I was scared but my mum held me.’Nour wants to be a teacher when she grows up. Her favourite subject is Social Studies because she likes it and her teacher. ‘I still have feelings when I cover myself in this blanket. I feel sadness thinking about the old beautiful days in Syria. But I also feel protected and safe. I’m going to keep it as long as I can.’2126 Iman, 13, holds her doll Her name is Lulu. She’s a gift from my mum so she’s very important. I love her! We brought her here from Syria. When I was little and upset, my parents would give me this toy and I would stop crying. I feel safe as long as Lulu is with me. When the war started and there was shooting, I used to hug her to feel safe. I remember coming here. It was at night and it was dark. On the journey I felt protected having her with me.’ These days, having Lulu near still makes Iman feel better whenever she is afraid or sad.  She keeps her hidden but still lets her little sister play with her. ‘I will keep Lulu forever.’2326 Zaina*, 13, holding a framed photo of her father‘That’s my father’s photo. When I was in first grade he died in the war. I wanted to bring this with me when I came here. It was hanging on the wall. I saw my mother putting stuff together so I ran to the photo and took it off the wall and put it in her bag. I have many memories of all the toys he gave me that I couldn’t bring with me.’ Zaina has been living in the camp for six years. She is in sixth grade and her favourite subject is English. She wants to be a lawyer when she grows up. ‘I wish to return to Syria and for life to be like it was before. I will put my father’s photo back on the wall where it was hanging before.’ *name changed to protect identity‘I brought this dog,’ says Shath. ‘I was little when we left Syria, only 8 or 9 years old. I don’t remember much.  When we had to leave, I took him with me, I was thinking he would protect me. I had so many toys to choose from but he was my favourite. I played with him a lot. I remember being on the bus here and sleeping a lot. I held him the whole way to Za’atari.  ‘The camp was full of tents back then and life was hard, really hard. I kept getting lost. I never let go of my dog in those first days so he could protect me. Now life is sweet. We have these centres and schools and we’re getting an education. We have friends and partiesShatha wants to be a lawyer when she grows up to protect herself and others. ‘I love the Makani, it’s my favourite place in the camp. We learn and we play here. I play lots of football and like the computers. ‘My toy dog will always be with me. I’ll tell my children my whole life story and his because it’s the same as mine.’2626 Sham*, 7, holding a photo of her father‘That photo was taken in Syria. It’s important to me because my father died and I loved him so much. He used to tell me stories, stories about Syria. I loved his stories so much. One day he told me we were going to the camp in five days. He said the war is going to get bad so you have to go. He told me you will grow older and I need you to look after your mother. He wouldn’t come with us and he died in Syria.’ Sham says that if she ever lost the photos of her father, she would never stop looking for them. To keep them safe, she hides them in a bag and then hides the bag in their caravan. She goes to school and is in the second grade. ‘I like to go to school to learn. Science is my favourite subject. I study hard so I can practice on my own without using the books.’ If my dad was here now he would ask me “what do you want to be when your grow up” and I would say, I want to be an engineer just like you’. He would be really proud of me. *name changed to protect identitySyrian refugee children attending Unicef Makani centres in Za\u0027atari refugee camp share the stories behind the objects they brought from Syria and the powerful memories that they represent226 Omar, 11, holds his teddy bear Ben 10‘My Ben 10 transforms into an alien from space and he saves the world,’ says the 11-year-old. ‘I brought it from Syria. My brother gave it to me before he died.’ Omar lost both of his older brothers in the conflict. His brother Abdulrahman was just 7 years old when he died. \u0027He bought it for me in the market and told me to take care of it. We used to watch the cartoon together. I still watch it now.\u0027 He doesn\u0027t remember much about his home in Syria but he thinks it was as big as a Unicef Makani centre, where he goes for learning and psychosocial support. \u0027Most of our stuff we had to leave behind but my mum packed Ben 10 so I could play with it. It\u0027s so important to me. This toy is as precious to me as my own brother. I\u0027m going to keep it forever.\u0027 The best part of Omar’s day is sunset when he comes home from school and Makani, eats food and does his homework sitting with his family. His favourite subject is maths and he studies hard to achieve his dream. ‘I want to become a pilot. I used to be afraid of planes but now I want to travel. Maybe if I get on a plane I won’t be afraid anymore.’ Omar now has two little sisters in Za’atari Refugee Camp. He lets his youngest sister Islam play with Ben 10. When he gets dirty he puts him in the washing machine. ‘I’m the only boy now. I think my brother would be proud of me.’ Makani (which translates as ‘My Space’) centres provide an integrated set of services to children in the camp, including learning support, community-based child protection, early childhood development, adolescent and youth participation, life skills and innovation labs426 Yahya, 13, holds a passport photo of himself‘This is a photo of me. It’s my memory. It means a lot to me because it was taken for my school registration form. I was in the first grade for only one week and then we had to come here. I have memories from this time, both good and bad. I remember how my school looked, it was beautiful. I had started making friends and playing football. But the bad memories are of the war, when we were under bombing. I want to forget this memory and the memory of the journey here. It was night time when we left Syria and we could hardly see the road in front of us. We moved through valleys full of thorns that hurt when we stepped on them. People started throwing away their belongings because of how hard the journey was, anything heavy had to go. I had to leave behind my school books, my pens and my colours because my mum told me too. She said it wouldn’t be long before we came back home. But it’s been six years.’ He is now in sixth grade‘I was in first grade in Syria and my dad gave me this schoolbag. I was only little then but now I’m in the sixth grade.’ Although the schoolbag is now too small for him, he keeps it safe. ‘It’s important to me because my father gave it to me as a gift and I remember him by it. Also because it is from my country.’He still has happy memories from life in Syria, including going to school. ‘I used to feel really happy when break came and I could go to the shop. I remember playing in the schoolyard, my friends chasing me and me chasing them.’ Although he preferred his school in Syria, he still enjoys going to school in the camp. His favourite subject is English and he wants to become an English teacher. He has no plans to give up the old schoolbag. ‘I will keep this schoolbag forever. I will tell my children my father gave this to me and I kept it safe for all these years to show you.’726 Ayoub, 13, holds a set of spoons‘These are my spoons. I was six when I left Syria. I wanted to take them with me from Syria as a memory so I grabbed them as we were leaving the house and I carried them the whole way here. I used to eat my meals with them back at home so I thought that I am going to need them to eat when I come to the camp.’ Ayoub has dropped out of school in the camp but he continues to attend a Makani centre for learning and psychosocial support.  ‘When I grow up, I want to be a taxi driver because I want to leave the camp and go everywhere. I’ve been in a taxi before and I loved it. Inside the camp we don’t have taxis, only bicycles. I’m not in school so I can’t be a doctor or an engineer but I think it’s the easiest thing for me to do when I grow up. In Za\u0027atari, there are 13 Makani centres serving over 7,000 children. Located in every district of the camp, vulnerable children, youth and communities have access to Makani, no matter where they live826 Hamza, 14, holds a handwritten note, from his teacher in Syria‘This note was written by my teacher when I was in first grade in Syria. It’s a thank you letter to my family saying that I am a good student.’ The note calls Hamza a star. ‘I made sure to put it in my bag when we were coming here.’ Hamza is now in the eighth grade and has made a big effort to keep achieving academically, despite the disruption to his education. ‘It’s important for me to keep it because it reminds me of when I was the best student in my class.’926 Mohammad, 16, holds his hat‘This is my hat. My father used to work in Damascus. He bought it there and gave it to me. Life then was magnificent.’ He still remembers the beginning of the conflict in Syria. ‘Children were being killed and houses were being bombed. My father feared for our lives and for our future. When we had to leave Syria, it was winter. I remember crossing a valley and the ground being difficult to walk on. It was dangerous, cars were sliding on the ice.’ Mohammad brought as much of his clothing as he could carry to Za’atari but the hat remains his most loved item. ‘I wore it all the way crossing to Jordan and I still wear it every winter. It’s so precious, it reminds me of Syria. And it’s a gift from my Dad which is why it means so much to me.’Mohammad lives with his parents and brothers and sisters in the camp. He is in tenth grade and likes school. He feels like the camp is home because he is surrounded by his family and a bigger Syrian community who keep their memories alive. ‘My parents tell me about when we were little. They say that Syria was beautiful. I will go back home to my village and continue living there. I will bring my hat and tell my children everything about my story.’  When asked if it’s important for children in Za’atari to try to remember Syria when some of the memories are so traumatic, he replies straight away: ‘Both. I think it’s very important to keep memories but also to forget the horrors of war.’1126 Ahmad, 12, holds a key ring inscribed with his father\u0027s name‘This key ring belonged to my dad, I inherited it from him a long time ago. He died of a heart attack at the start of the war in Syria. I barely have any memories of my dad but the few I have are very precious. My favourite memory is the time he brought us to the river for a picnic and we played in the water. If I want to remember him, I take out his key ring and look at it.’Ahmad wants to be an architect when he grows us because his father worked in construction. ‘I still have a long way to go as I am only in the sixth grade but I will do my best. It would make my Dad proud of me.’ Ahmad lives with his grandmother and brother in the camp. Although they don’t have much, he says that their love is enough for him‘This toy is from Syria. Her name is Farah.’ Yara’s father gave her Farah for her birthday. ‘He used to buy me so many things.’ She enjoys taking off Farah’s dress, washing it and dressing her again. ‘I take care of her because I love her. I feel happy when I’m with her. I take her everywhere. I sleep with her. I tell her the story of Little Red Riding Hood – it’s about a wolf - to put her to sleep.’ Yara still has memories of her bedroom in Syria. ‘It was white and I had teddy bears and one was really big. Bigger than me. It got scary in Syria. There were shootings. Dad said get your stuff together, we’re going. I wanted to bring that teddy bear here but my parents said no, it was too big. So I put Farah in my bag. I told her we’re going to Za’atari. I told her don’t made any sound because if you do, we can’t go in. She was scaredWe were both happy when we arrived in Za’atari. I brought a pink dress too just like Farah’s. I am never going to get rid of her. I have so many toys, even one that costs 5 JD, but I love this one.’ Yara goes to school in the camp and wants to be a pharmacist when she grows up so she can give people medicine that will heal them.  She wants to return to Syria. ‘I will dress her up and get her ready and we will go. But this time, I’m bringing all of my toys1526 Hala, 11, holding a photo of her and her older brother in Syria‘My favourite photo is me and my brother together. It was a Friday. My mum had dressed me nicely for Friday prayer, then we went to the market and a restaurant. After that we went to a photographer’s studio where this photo was taken.’ Hala keeps her photos from Syria hidden in her closet to keep them safe. She takes them out from time to time to look at them. ‘I only remember the war. I used to be so afraid. Bombs used to fall all around our house. Without photos, I wouldn’t know what it was like to be a kid in Syria. Because Syria is in my heart, it is my country where I was born. When I look at this photo, I remember those days again. There aren’t enough words to describe the life I see in these photos. It’s pure happiness.’ Hala missed two years of her education because of the conflict, one in Syria and one in Jordan. Now she is in the fourth grade. ‘I love school a lot. Arabic is my favourite subject and I want to be a surgeon. My mum told me that it was her dream when she was a child to become one but she got married instead. I want her to fulfil her dream through me.’ As well as getting a good education, Hala knows what it will take to achieve her dream. ‘I have to be courageous and not fear anything.’‘These are my house keys. I brought them with me because when we go back to Syria, I’m going to be the one who opens the door. My parents tell me that Syria is beautiful. I was so little that I don’t remember.’Rudaina is in fourth grade and her favourite subject is Maths. She wants to be a pediatrician when she grows up. ‘We once had a home but now we live in a caravan. I feel so sad when I hold the keys because I’m so far away from home.‘This is my blanket. When I was little and it was my birthday, my grandmother bought it for me. I remember that we had to flee because there was bombing. It was night time. That’s why we came here. I was covered in it when I was little and I came here. It protected me against the cold and the rain. I was scared but my mum held me.’Nour wants to be a teacher when she grows up. Her favourite subject is Social Studies because she likes it and her teacher. ‘I still have feelings when I cover myself in this blanket. I feel sadness thinking about the old beautiful days in Syria. But I also feel protected and safe. I’m going to keep it as long as I can.’2126 Iman, 13, holds her doll Her name is Lulu. She’s a gift from my mum so she’s very important. I love her! We brought her here from Syria. When I was little and upset, my parents would give me this toy and I would stop crying. I feel safe as long as Lulu is with me. When the war started and there was shooting, I used to hug her to feel safe. I remember coming here. It was at night and it was dark. On the journey I felt protected having her with me.’ These days, having Lulu near still makes Iman feel better whenever she is afraid or sad.  She keeps her hidden but still lets her little sister play with her. ‘I will keep Lulu forever.’2326 Zaina*, 13, holding a framed photo of her father‘That’s my father’s photo. When I was in first grade he died in the war. I wanted to bring this with me when I came here. It was hanging on the wall. I saw my mother putting stuff together so I ran to the photo and took it off the wall and put it in her bag. I have many memories of all the toys he gave me that I couldn’t bring with me.’ Zaina has been living in the camp for six years. She is in sixth grade and her favourite subject is English. She wants to be a lawyer when she grows up. ‘I wish to return to Syria and for life to be like it was before. I will put my father’s photo back on the wall where it was hanging before.’ *name changed to protect identity‘I brought this dog,’ says Shath. ‘I was little when we left Syria, only 8 or 9 years old. I don’t remember much.  When we had to leave, I took him with me, I was thinking he would protect me. I had so many toys to choose from but he was my favourite. I played with him a lot. I remember being on the bus here and sleeping a lot. I held him the whole way to Za’atari.  ‘The camp was full of tents back then and life was hard, really hard. I kept getting lost. I never let go of my dog in those first days so he could protect me. Now life is sweet. We have these centres and schools and we’re getting an education. We have friends and partiesShatha wants to be a lawyer when she grows up to protect herself and others. ‘I love the Makani, it’s my favourite place in the camp. We learn and we play here. I play lots of football and like the computers. ‘My toy dog will always be with me. I’ll tell my children my whole life story and his because it’s the same as mine.’2626 Sham*, 7, holding a photo of her father‘That photo was taken in Syria. It’s important to me because my father died and I loved him so much. He used to tell me stories, stories about Syria. I loved his stories so much. One day he told me we were going to the camp in five days. He said the war is going to get bad so you have to go. He told me you will grow older and I need you to look after your mother. He wouldn’t come with us and he died in Syria.’ Sham says that if she ever lost the photos of her father, she would never stop looking for them. To keep them safe, she hides them in a bag and then hides the bag in their caravan. She goes to school and is in the second grade. ‘I like to go to school to learn. Science is my favourite subject. I study hard so I can practice on my own without using the books.’ If my dad was here now he would ask me “what do you want to be when your grow up” and I would say, I want to be an engineer just like you’. He would be really proud of me. *name changed to protect identityBut instead, through sheer grit and determination, he became the exception to the rule. This week, after a long and exhaustive selection process, he touched down in the UK to take up a scholarship at a prestigious boarding school in Wales.\u0026nbspIn doing so, he became one of only a handful of Syrian refugees to make it to the UK without being part of a resettlement programme and with no help from the government.\u0026nbsp“I never dreamed I would be successful,” he says, speaking to The Independent in his now-empty apartment in the town of Bar Elias, just days before he is due to leave for the UK.“At the beginning, when I first applied, I was really upset and miserable and hopeless. There are lots of programmes and scholarships like this. I was applying, but I was\u0026nbsppretty sure it was\u0026nbspnot going to make any difference.”It is easy to see why Nour was so pessimistic. The town of Bar Elias, where he has spent the last three years of his life, is home to thousands of refugees from neighbouring Syria. It sits just off the main road between Beirut and Damascus, around 10 miles from the Syrian border.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Seven years ago, when he was 10-years-old, his mother was killed by an airstrike that hit their neighbourhood. Less than a month later, his father suffered the same fate.\u0026nbspNour was taken into the care of his brother, before\u0026nbsphe too was killed a year later. He was left with two sisters, but they were soon married and unable to care for him. He was on his way to an orphanage when a cousin stepped in to bring him to Lebanon.Nour’s love of school kept him going. He was a good student in Syria\u0026nbspand desperately wanted to carry on studying in Lebanon, but as soon as he arrived he was put to work in his cousin’s dairy factory.\u0026nbsp“I didn’t have any free time for myself,” he says. “I wanted to study English, but I didn’t even have time to read a book. My cousin wouldn’t let me study.”The same is true of many Syrian children. According to the United Nations children’s charity, the average monthly income of refugee families in the Beqaa Valley\u0026nbspis around $50 (£41), while their expenses are close to $120. The result is that many children are sent to work to make up the difference.Wahid Save the Children)Nour was still going to school while working for his cousin, but his job was getting in the way.\u0026nbsp“Living with him was a really hard part in my life,” he explains.\u0026nbsp“I was suffering so much. That’s why I decided to leave him and live on my own.”So, at 15 years old, a refugee in a country where most Syrians were struggling to survive, he moved into a one-room apartment on his own. He found a job painting houses\u0026nbspand on the weekend he worked in a restaurant chopping fruit.\u0026nbsp“It was the worst place I have ever lived,” he says.\u0026nbsp“It didn’t have a door even. I was doing everything myself. Cooking, cleaning\u0026nbspand studying. I worked during my time off to support myself. I was only thinking about surviving.” \u0026nbspThere were other difficulties, too, not unique to Nour’s life.\u0026nbspEight years into Syria’s devastating civil war, more than a million refugees remain stuck in limbo here, too afraid to return home to a country still stricken by conflict, where forced conscription and arbitrary arrests are commonplace.Lebanon was praised early on for its hospitality to Syrians, but as the war dragged on, pressure has increased for them to leave. Evictions and army raids on refugee camps are on the rise, towns have introduced curfews specifically for Syrians, and ministers and politicians have made repeated calls for them to go home.\u0026nbspA worsening Lebanese economy only added to these tensions. Nour felt that undercurrent of anger.\u0026nbsp“I love Lebanon, but Lebanon doesn’t love me,” he says. “Being a Syrian in the Lebanese society is really hard. Even though you have really close friends, you can’t erase from his mind the idea that I’m a Syrian and you’re a Lebanese.“I had friends for more than five years and sometimes they say something so racist to me, they really hurt me. Even though I was so integrated, they will still treat you like a foreigner.” \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspNour did more than survive. In his high school exams, he achieved the 28th highest marks in the entire country.\u0026nbspCharity workers started to take notice. He began receiving some assistance from Save the Children to help him stay in school. In 2018, he was visited by its then CEO, the former Danish prime minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt. The meeting would have a profound impact on the course of his life.\u0026nbsp“She came to my house and she suggested that I apply to a boarding school. I had no idea what a boarding school was,” he says. “She wrote the name of it on a piece of paper and a few months later I applied.”The boarding school, which The Independent is not naming to protect Nour’s anonymity, offered a scholarship for refugees –\u0026nbspbut competition for the place was fierce. A gruelling process of online tests and interviews followed.\u0026nbsp“After the first interview, I said, ‘I don’t care,’” Nour\u0026nbsprecalls.\u0026nbsp“I didn’t think it would go any further. When I realised that things were getting more serious, I started to think about it more and more.”He waited and waited for news. When the day finally came, it was the worst possible timing. He was due to take three exams and he couldn’t keep his mind off what could be the biggest decision of his life.\u0026nbsp“I woke up at 5am, I looked at my phone and found nothing,” Nour says.\u0026nbsp“I thought ‘oh my God, I have been rejected’. Then I remembered that the wifi was turned off. I turned it on and I found the email.“I started shouting. I didn’t want to go to school to do the exams. I was writing and I was so sleepy. I couldn’t concentrate. I wanted to go home. I wanted to dance.”While Nour’s story has a happy ending, there are some 2.5 million Syrian children scattered across the region who have little hope of following in his footsteps. \u0026nbsp“Nour’s story illustrates how important education is for children,” says Allison\u0026nbspZelkowitz, Save the Children’s country director in Lebanon. “He fought against all odds to make it to the UK, and while we supported him throughout his application process, he did it by himself thanks to his remarkable will and high grades.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp“But resettlement of Syrian refugees in countries outside of the region has decreased. The UK can play a key role to ensure that more resettlement places are accessible and to increase access to other pathways for refugees, such as student\u0026nbspvisas. Supporting learning can be a lifeline to some of the highest-performing Syrian refugees.”It would be a nervous few months while he made preparations for his new life. There were still so many things that could go wrong. It is not uncommon for Syrians to be detained at Beirut’s airport for bureaucratic infractions and there was always the chance that he could face problems on the other end, in the UK.\u0026nbspAs he sits beside his packed bags in his apartment, Nour is a bundle of excitement. He is fascinated with aviation, and airports especially, and has spent the last few weeks studying the layout of Heathrow Terminal 5, where he is due to land.\u0026nbspHe doesn’t have a clear idea of what he wants to do after school, only that he wants to tell his story to as many people as possible.\u0026nbsp“All I know about what I want to be in the future is that I want to express all my opinions,” he says.\u0026nbsp“When I was a kid I felt I was restricted by what I could say. I want to share my story. I don’t want to be in one place. I want to move.”\u0026nbsp*Nour arrived in the UK this week and is now getting ready to start the school term.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Minds Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Minds.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

The message is clear: Useful work is no longer done here.If Remainer MPs block Boris Johnson’s Brexit plan this week, we should place similar signs around the Palace of Westminster.Parliamentarians will have turned the place into a toxic waste ground which no longer fulfils a decent .It will have become an eyesore, a municipal liability, an assembly which no longer represents its voters and has become a poisonous threat to them. It will stand as sad testament to the misjudgement of its management in latter days.If Speaker John Bercow, former Chancellor Philip Hammond and other dead-set Remainers such as Sir Keir Starmer refuse to enact the  referendum result, the British Parliament — supposedly the fount of modern parliamentary democracy — will have lost its centuries-old claim to give voice to the people. The consequences of that would be enormous.The word “Parliament”, first used in these islands in the early s, comes from the French “parler” .The th Century Parliament was where leading men of England could let the king know how they felt about his laws and taxes. Kings did not always take much notice but the principle was established: That the people of England would be heard by their ruler.Over the ages, the people slowly became the boss. Until now.Sometimes you will hear the Commons derided as a talking-shop but that, correctly, is what it is. Talking can prevent violence.There is a reason modern heads of government are not, by and large, stabbed in their beds like poor King Duncan in Shakespeare’s Macbeth.That reason has been the parliamentary process and the comforting knowledge that when push came to shove, parliamentarians would be on our side.Our side, please note. Not on the side of rival countries.There developed a quiet understanding that on issues of conscience , MPs need not slavishly follow their constituents. They were not quite delegates.But as representatives, they would be expected to follow broadly the sympathies of their electors and the policies of their parties. Otherwise they could just lie at election time then do the opposite once they had won their seats in the Commons.In his address outside  Downing Street last night, Boris left people in no doubt of his intentions to see us out of the EU after October .But when MPsto the Commons this afternoon, you will hear Remainers complain that “Parliament has been bypassed” in the Brexit process. This is tommyrot.As can happen in modern politics, it is the very opposite of the truth. I’m afraid they’re lying. They are ignoring you — the electorate — and they think you are too busyto notice.The EU referendum in  was set up by the Commons.The Commons approved the Article  process under which we told Brussels we were off. All well and good.David Cameron would not have won the  election had he not promised a referendum.Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn would not have attracted millions of votes in the  election had they not promised to respect the Leave result.But now that our departure is imminent, Remainer extremists such as Hammond, Bercow, Gauke, Grieve, Soubryplan to try to stop it.They have already bent the rules doing so and will possibly do so again today.Please, guys: Spare us any bleating about “constitutional outrages” by Boris. Your behaviour has been far worse.These swivel-eyed Europhiles have decided that the Leave vote of  — the biggest exercise in British electoral history — must be neutralised.The plebs got it wrong. Computer does not recognise. Reboot time. All past data has been lost.Just look at that warped figure Tony Blair, who treated Parliament with open contempt when he was PM.Yesterday he was throwing up his soft hands in horror at the idea of a new General Election to break the Westminster deadlock. He opposes an election because he knows it could result in a big win for an on-fire Boris. All this from the same Tony Blair whose regime helped kill hundreds of thousands of Iraqis in the name of, er, democracy.Instead, Blair wants a second referendum, whose wording would be decidedby the current, pro-EU, electorate-defying Parliament.We used to laugh at communist assemblies in countries such as North Korea, which were stuffed full of identikit dummies.We mocked minnows such as Ireland, which were forced by Brussels to re-run referendums that produced “wrong” results.We thought our democracy was more authentic because Parliament was connected to its constituents and because our politicians accepted the electorate’s verdict.We won’t be able to make such boastsWestminster’s Remainers have their way.What is the point of a parliamentit ignores the electorate  None. Many of these Remainer MPs seem readier to take their cue from Twitter users than from their own voters. It’s weird and it is not democracy.If our Parliament ceases to have a point, so do its buildingsand so do its members’ privileges .The very nation state becomes questionable, for what is the point of a state without a democratic Parliament Before long you find yourself asking what is the point of Western Europe, Nato and the whole web of Western values that separate us from Putin’s Russia and other hostile powers.Such is the importance of the decisions facing our MPs this week.

Suddenly, the all-encompassing full-time job into which you poured all your time and effort becomes harder to juggle with what’s going on at home.Ruth Davidson is the case in point, after tendering her resignation as leader of the Scottish Conservatives because, among other reasons, the thought of getting on the road to fight two elections in  months would have once fired her up but now fills her with dread.Ruth, who will remain as an MSP, adds: “Additionally, I fear that having tried to be a good leader over the years, I have proved a poor daughter, sister, partner and friend. The party and my work has always come first, often at the expense of commitment to loved ones. The arrival of my son means I now make a dferent choice.”It was a similar story when former sports minister Tracey Crouch revealed she recently turned down the chance toto Government because of her three-year-old son Freddie.She’s still an MP but says: “I may or may not ever get the chance again to join the Cabinet, but I definitely won’t get this time back with Freddie.”And therein lies the rub for any Government, or indeed corporation, trying to inflate the number of women appointed to jobs that pay extremely well and, consequently, often involve great responsibility and super-human levels of commitment.As I have frequently suggested in this column over the years, the paucity of women in the Cabinet and certain boardrooms isn’t necessarily down to sexism, it might also be because women have chosen not to be there.We have the wombs, therefore we have the babies. That’s unlikely to change any time soon.Some manage — with the help of nannies or wider family — to juggle a high-powered job with motherhood, somechoose the route of flexible working and somechoose to stay at home.

It is a pathetic showing for a main opposition party at a time when it should be sailing ahead.Corbyn — branded a chicken by Boris Johnson for blocking a snap election — is doing so much worse than he did in his unexpectedly strong  ­election campaign.That’s because voters have seen so much more of this unreconstructed Marxist than they had then. And the more they see, the less they like it.Gradually it is dawning on the country that the economic policies advanced by Corbyn and his even more left-wing shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, would not so much redistribute national wealth as obliterate it.Earlier this week McDonnell came up with his latest wheeze for robbing the rich and — as he sees it — giving to the poor.He promised to give private tenants a “right to buy” their homes at a discount. I can see why this policy might initially seem attractive to young people who have been priced out of the housing market — a group with whom I have a lot of sympathy.Notionally, the policy may seem little dferent from Mrs Thatcher’s right to buy which enabled a generation of council house tenants to become homeowners for the first time.But there is every dference. If private investors were forced to sell their properties at a discount it would crash the housing market. Who would want to buy a property, knowing that the Government could come along at any moment and confiscate it If you crash the housing market, you crash the ­mortgage market, too. Private tenants might in theory gain the right to buy their homes, but that will not be much usebanks refuse to lend them any money.Confiscation is a thread which runs through so much of Labour’s programme.McDonnell has already announced a plan to snatch ten per cent of the shares of all private companies with more than  employees.He wants to put these shares into what he calls an inclusive ownership fund, invested on behalf of the workers.The workers shouldn’t get too excited, though. They would be allowed a maximum of £ a year in idends — and that onlytheir ­company was able to pay a idend.Meanwhile, the value of ordinary people’s pensions would plummet by far more than £. According to an analysis by law firm Clford Chance, workers would gain £billion — but overall, investors would lose £billion as share values crashed.Labour’s plan would dilute a company’s shares, effectively confiscating wealth from existing shareholders.Corbyn and McDonnell ­promote a fantasy that shareholders are a bunch of capitalist fatcats.Yet the reality is that almost everyone who works in the private sector is indirectly a shareholder. Share investments form the bedrock of the pension funds on which we will rely in old age.EvenMcDonnell was only helping himself to ten per cent of company shares initially, he could be sure to come back for more when his tax revenues failed to match his vast spending plans.These include spending £billion nationalising utility companies — that is £billion for gas and electricity firms, £billion for water firms, £billion to buy out Private Finance Initiativecontracts for schools and hospitals and £.billion for the Royal Mail.Labour claims this will save householders an average of £ a year on the basis that these firms will no longer have to pay shareholders.But he overlooks the poor record of nationalised industry. Lower efficiency could well lead to higher prices.How is McDonnell going to bring in the revenue for his massive spending plans He seems to live under the delusion thatyou raise taxes by x per cent, revenue, too, will rise by x per cent.Thus he claimed, in Labour’s  manesto, that reversing corporation tax cuts would raise £billion. But tax doesn’t work like that. In fact, cuts to corporation tax made by George Osborne increased revenue as multinationals erted profits to, rather than away from, Britain.So it is perverse for Labour to claim jacking up rates again will raise extra money. On the contrary, McDonnell would likely end up with LESS revenue.As for iniduals, McDonnell has promised to increase income tax for the top ten per cent of earners, which means anyone on more than £, a year. The top rate of income tax would go up to  per cent.But the real damage could come from a wealth tax — an annual levy on the value of homes, shares, bonds and all other assets.Although not yet Labour party policy, McDonnell has previously expressed approval for a whopping  per cent levy on the wealthiest ten per cent of the population.It wouldn’t be the super-wealthy who paid — they would quickly be off.In the s, a high-tax Labour ­government caused a brain drain which led to net outwards migration of , people over a few years.It would be worse now, as wealthy iniduals and businesses are much more mobile compared with the s.The real victims of a wealth tax would be ordinary people who have spent years saving to buy a home and build themselves a half-decent pension. To qualy for McDonnell’s wealth tax you would only need to own a home, and to have a pension with a combined value of £,.With Labour on just  per cent in the polls, of course, the nightmare of a Corbyn government — or at least a Corbyn majority government — is at the moment unlikely.But no one should be ­complacent.We could all too easily end up with a Labour-SNP coalition with the ­Scottish Nationalists happy to inflict pain on English, Welsh and Northern Irish voters infor the promise of a second independence referendum.Over the past couple of years we have had endless attempts to blame Brexit for every economic woe. Actually, over that period, employment has risen to an all-time high and the economy, except for the last quarter, has grown.But international investors, have been shy of Britain.The uncertainty over Brexit doesn’t help but talk to wealth managers and they tell you a very dferent story.What really strikes terror into investors is the prospect of Jeremy Corbyn arriving at the door to No.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They’re not all “champions”, or possibly even the best each respective part of the Cowell empire has to offer.That goose was cooked the moment SuBo, Diversity, Dennis Egeland almost everyone  with a signicant career or talent declined to appear.There was a certain curiosity value to BGT: The Champions, though, I’ll admit, as it featured several performers doing the one thing everyone in their country should arguably be forbidden from even attempting.Indian salsa, Ukrainian sand-painting, Australian stand-up comedy, Indonesian magic, British dog dancing.This last one was  winner Ashleigh Butlerwho began by revealing that, moments before Pudsey died: “He lted his head and had a little look at me.That was him saying ‘Goodbye’.” Or  him saying: “You’ll be going through the same motions, with some hyperactive little impostor, in two years’ time, mark my words.”I got the impression everyone  at the show thought it might just be “a bit too soon”, as well, which may not entirely explain The Champions’ in-built British bias.But the line-up was certainly front-loaded with other familiar faces, Paul Potts, Boogie Storm and Connie Talbot, who’s doubled in size since we last saw her, with Piers Morgan, in . So’s Piers Morgan, for that matter.The great unknown factors were the foreign acts, though, who proved to be a pretty forgettable bunch apart from America’s “comic daredevil” Bello Nock, whose wheel of death t***tery, with daughter Annaliese, was almost as terrying as his appearance,which was described perfectly, by David Walliams, as “Jedward’s dad”.It was certainly enough to hypnotise the Wembley arena audience into voting him the winner.If all this exotica and the set were designed to make us think we were watching something on the scale of Eurovision, though, it failed. The Champions is nothing like as good.Nor is it even as original as Going For Gold, with Henry Kelly, for the simple reason BGT has been welcoming foreign acts for years.All this adds up to is Britain’s Got Talent minus the best bit, the auditions. We also don’t get a chance to vote, either.That came down to a golden buzzer Amanda Holden went for the Ukrainian sandpainter and the arena vote for Bello Nock.Quite something, isn’t it, when we can’t even win such a heavily loaded show and, I have to tell you, Paul Potts took it pretty badly.

Frances, , is a Labour-supporting, Remain-voting socialist, dedicated to making le better for working people. Dennie Smith, , is a small business owner and entrepreneur who runs Vintage hairdressers in South Croydon, Greater London, along with a dating site and an antiques business. “If we’d had Boris Johnson in charge three years ago we wouldn’t be in this mess now,” Dennie says. She believes the EU is “a form of dictatorship”. Ahead of the TUC Congress next week, we asked Frances and Dennie to meet in person over a lunchtime drink, for the Mirror’s Britain Talks project.  Both women grew up in large working class families, and were born only two years apart. Frances was born in Oxford, the daughter of a car factory shop steward and a shop worker who later worked for the NHS. Dennie was born in Clapham, South London, and was raised partly by her grandparents.As the conversation flows between kids, politics, relationships, business and Brexit , they discover they share a love of soul music. Both have grown-up children they worry about. Both share a passion for history and politics, which Frances studied at Manchester University, and to which Dennie devotes her spare time.And both women share similar feelings for former Prime Minister David Cameron. “He was so confident Brexit wasn’t going to happen, and when it did, he just ran off,” Dennie says. Frances agrees. “As a negotiator, you never go into battle with no plan,” she says. Dennie laughs. “When I was chairman of the school PTA,we ran any event we had to have a Plan B forit rained.”  Then Dennie tells Frances about her heroes. “I’d have been a suffragette,” she says. “So would I!” Frances agrees. “They were practically terrorists,” Dennie admits. “But that’s what happens when a man won’t listen. I’ve got one of the coins they used to deface and write ‘Votes for Women’ on. I had it made into a necklace.” She says Martin Luther King is her biggest political hero. “He wasn’t about power, he was about rights of the people. Imagine a person with that vision today.” Frances nods. “Too many politicians now feel like technicians,” she says. “What do they really believe ” She adds that her view on President Trump is “unprintable”. Dennie says: “I’d like to do his hair.” Finally, the chat turns to Brexit, but by now it’s a conversation between friends.  “My husband recently lost his job, but that was already happening,” Dennie says. “It’s not Brexit.” Frances nods. “It’s like during the recession, when employers used it as an excuse to lay people off,” she says. “But we also know a hard Brexit will make it harder for us to protect people’s jobs.” Dennie says immigration was “not even in my mind” when she voted Leave. “But there have been ­consequences of the Brexit vote,” Frances says. “Racist attacks have gone up.” Dennie says the main reason she voted out was sovereignty. “We have our laws and then the European Court just overturns them,” she says. “And the EU got too big. The original countries were all bringing something to the table. Now it’s  countries. It’s bad enough trying to set up a meeting with nine staff.” Frances listens carefully. “I voted Remain because I thought that was best for workers’ rights and peace in Northern Ireland,” she says. “The TUC played a big role in the Good Friday Agreement. “I don’t think the EU is perfect. We need reform. I’m not saying it was an easy decision. But, in the end, my working le has been about standing up for working people. And all of us, as unions, thought the best outcome would be Remain. For workers and for trade.

As a vegetarian, he doesn’t even eat fowl like me. But turkey Boris Johnson keeps pecking away at him for refusing one on the rules of his hen house. Ruffled Johnson, an arrogant bird, seems to think it’s the Leader of the Opposition’s job to do exactly what he squawks. And that seems a bit featherbrained even for me - the clue’s in the name, featherhead: “Opposition.” Corbyn refusing to cross the road just because Johnson says so doesn’t mean he’s afraid of getting run over by the Tories’ election battle bus. It means he’s suspicious of Johnson’s motives.    Corbyn’s clocked Johnson’s plotting to exploit an early election campaign to ram through a hard Brexit while MPs are flapping around on the campaign trail. Johnson insists he doesn’t plan to do this. But a couple of days ago he was saying he didn’t want to have an election at all, and now look at him. In any case, Johnson calling anyone chicken is a bit rich.

Hannah Webb, , married Joe Webb in the V-necked dress complete with train in Paphos, Cyprus, last Saturday.And the mother-of-two refused to take it off - even when she went in the sea on the evening of the big day and parasailing days later. She said: Thereaposs a lot of pressure with a wedding dress in how it needs to be perfect, and kept neat and how you need to store it in a box in your loft for  years afterwards. We just didnapost want it to be like that. We wanted it to be really fun and thataposs why [I went parasailing in it].

But she admits her escapades have left the huge garment looking like it had been up a chimney. We wanted to go parasailing anyway.

It was amazing.  Hannah, who works as a change coach helping people transition between careers, now intends to have it professionally dry cleaned and sent off to charity to be made into clothes for deceased children to be buried in. She continued: We went swimming in the sea. I was rolling around in the grass and rugby tackling my cousins. Weaposd been on the beach and Iaposd been messing around swimming. We were all playing games on the grass and after that I went swimming in the pool on the way back to our room. My dress was filthy and my auntie had to wash it in the bath when we got in.

On Tuesday the Year  pupil went to class at George Spencer Academy in Nottinghamshire wearing a pair of MS trousers that rested a short distance from the top of her shoes. She was quickly made to leave the class and spend time in exclusion. While the girl had worn the trousers with no issues last year, the Stapleford school had updated its unorm policy. Now all trousers have to touch the top of pupils shoes. The studentaposs dad told the BBC: They werenapost fashion. They werenapost ankle grabbers.    I think she had just slightly outgrown the trousers and they were just a little bit off the top of the shoe. That was enough for her to be singled out and put in isolation for the entirety of Tuesday. He suggested that the blame for the trouserapossshould not fall on the student but on the parents. When approached for comment by the BBC, the school confirmed that its new unorm policy required trousers to be plain and to cover ankles and socks. The spokeswoman said the school would be happy to discuss the matter further with the girlaposs father.    The Nottinghamshire student is not the only one to rub up against authority at the start of the school year. Parents have threatened to protest outside the school gates of Priory School in Lewes, East Sussex after a gender neutral school unorm policy came into force.Parents have also hit out at a  school  for taking  pupils out of class for wearing the aposwrongapos shoes on the first day of term."},{"url":null,"title":"guinness world records 2020 speedy","story":"NewsGuinness World Records : Speedy shed, huge hula hoop and a wood-smashing coupleFast sheds, hula hoopers, super strong women and a ferocious Taekwondo couple grace the pages of this years bookShareCommentsByMilo Boyd:,  SEP Updated:,  SEP Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news weird-news video entrants-guinness-world-records--,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,hidePreviewImage:,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,hidePreviewImage:\"\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for the purpose of sending you newsletters.

Shannon OaposBrien was  weeks pregnant when she opened the door to Siobhan Hood last year, believing she was a delivery person. The -year-old was pushed to the floor, kicked and punched. She endured the barrage of blows until a friend of her mumaposs, who was round for dinner, came to her aid. Thankfully, single Shannon was given the all clear by doctors who treated her at hospital. Her baby boy Alfie was born healthy on March , .    The ordeal began when Shannon ordered a takeaway to her Peterborough home on January , . Her hopes for a night in stuffingface in front of the TV fell apart when Siobhan appeared at her door. “She barged in and started attacking me right away.

She burst into my house and after squashing me deliberately with the door then punched me in the face.  She knocked me right onto the floor and just carried on punching and kicking me.

After confronting the cheat Shannon then became aware that Hood had in fact been in a long term relationship with the man - at which point Shannon called it off.  Despite immediately dumping the lad in question, Shannon had unintentionally made an enemy for le in Hood. Shannon said: I did really feel for her at the time, weaposd both been played by the same guy and I wouldnapost wish that on anyone. But Siobhan just wouldnapost let it go. She somehow got hold of my number and would message me threats, eventually I just changed my number and she stopped. Thataposs why it was such a shock to see her at my door that night, I couldnapost believe how vicious she could be to a heavily pregnant woman... and all these years later too, itaposs crazy.

Stand up – but not at the controls please – easyJet first officer Michael Bradley who flew the plane from Paris to Liverpool on Monday morning. His suave, brilliant, fluent, informed and amusing mid-air briefing was a tonic to all on board.    More importantly, it was an antidote to the usual piping, brain-numbing, pseudo-posh, Wirral-Scouse, semi-literate, part-read-off-a card cabin twaddle regular passengers so often have to endure. The following week reader Bill Brown from Billinge wrote to the paperaposs letters page to talk about his experience of flying with the pilot. The letter was published under the headline aposDashing pilot Bradleyapos and said: I don’t agree with his comments usually, but he was spot on about easyJet pilot Michael Bradley. My we and I are regular passengers on the Malaga route and last month we had the pleasure of him flying us home. All the passengers around us were laughing and talking about his excellent commentaries. So much so, we asked the hostess to pass on our thanks to him. When we landed, he asked to see us and let me take a photo of him. So to suave, dashing officer Bradley, thank you for making our flight a fun event.  Captain Bradley was among the frustrated tourists on the plane grounded after being one captain down on Sunday. He was hoping to jet off to Alicante, Spain with his we and young son.

Her kidneys were failing. At first she could not bear to tell her family. She had already watched mum Naomi and sister Ingrid suffer through a combined  years of dialysis before they received le-saving transplants. Other relatives were not so lucky. Primrose, , had lost at least five of her family, including her gran, to the same hereditary kidney disease.She says: “I didn’t want my family to see me struggling and worry aftereverything they had been through.“I spent so much time with my mother on dialysis, watching her deteriorate.  “She was so sick I prepared myself to bury her three times. I was terried of going through that myself.” Against the odds, Primrose waited just six months for a suitable kidney. Her transplant last year was days before she was due to start dialysis. Her mum is still going strong  years after her transplant. Ingrid has been free from dialysis for the four years since her surgery. Primrose, a radio presenter from Bristol, said: “It is a miracle we have all had transplants and are still here. We think about our donors every day.” Naomi, Ingrid and Primrose suffered from polycystic kidney disease which causes extreme pain and eventually leads to the organs failing.  Recalling the moment her kidneys ruptured, Naomi, , said: “There was no warning. Blood suddenly started flowing down my nose. It was very frightening. The doctors saidit had happened while I was sleeping, I would have died. I have lost most of my family to kidney disease. “My mother died when she was , my niece was . Five of my six brothers died young.” Naomi had emergency surgery and started dialysis. On average, patients wait three years for a kidney transplant. But Naomi’s rare tissue type and a severe shortage of black organ donors meant she waited almost  years. In that time she had  major operations,  minor surgeries and spent three days a week hooked up to a dialysis machine. Primrose says: “All those years on dialysis left Mum so weak.  It tore her hair apart and turned her skin ashen. The first time I saw her on the street after her transplant, she looked so much better I didn’t recognise her.” Six years after being diagnosed with kidney failure, Ingrid had to quit her job because the condition and dialysis left her too exhausted to work. Ingrid, , said: “Your whole le revolves around dialysis. It takes more than a day to recover. Just as you start to feel a little better, you have to go back to hospital.” She got her transplant in , a wait of nearly  years. Primrose says finding a donor after just six months was a huge shock. She added: “They told me it was a kidney from a -year-old. My heart sank. My first thought was a -year-old had died so I could live. Of course, it isn’t like that.” "},{"url":null,"title":"parents told stop using words","story":"NewsParents told to stop using words like front bottom and fairyCharity Eve Appeal said both male and female body parts should not be shrouded in secrecy and called on mums and dads to use the correct termsShareCommentsByJane Kirby:,  SEP NewsA poll for charity Eve Appeal found % of parents regularly use euphemisms, with less than a fth frequently saying “vagina” and only % regularly using the word “vulva”\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for the purpose of sending you newsletters.

She arrived with mum, dad and big brother Prince George, who is already a student at the £,-a-term private school in London. The Cambridge family were greeted by Helen Haslem, head of the lower school, and William told her his daughter was very excited. Glamorous Kate looked thrilled to be accompanying her little girl on the first drop off.   Charlotte played with her ponytail as her parents shook hands with Ms Haslem. As they walked William told Ms Haslem: First day - very excited. Kate said: How are you  Did you have a nice summer  The four-year-old has been attending Willcocks Nursery in Kensington since last January but sheaposs now making the exciting jump to big school with her brother.Sources told the Daily Mail that George is excited and proud to be showing her around.

Charlotte was driven to school in south London by her father in the family’s Land Rover Discovery, arriving just after .. She was driven up to a side entrance while other children accompanied by their parents went in through the front. Charlotte arrived wearing what the school calls the transitional unorm of a blue pinafore with a white summer blouse, black shoes and white socks.Her arrival was a low-key event, recorded by a small group of journalists, in contrast to the crowds of photographers who turned out for Prince William’s first day at school when he was dropped off by Diana, Princess of Wales. William and Kate took Charlotte to her classroom to meet her teacher and settle her in.She is in a class of , one of three reception classes in her year, and will start by doing half days.

The Duchess was pregnant with Prince Louis when George started at Thomasaposs and was suffering from  hyperemesis gravidarum, a severe and sometimes le-threatening illness which affects mums-to-be. Instead William had to take him by himself. George is said to be doing very well at the London school and heaposs reportedly just treated like a normal kid, so itaposs hardly surprising that Kate and Wills decided to send Charlotte there too. An insider told  Vanity Fair : Heaposs very popular and has lots of friends, and thereaposs very little fuss made about who he is.  Either William or Kate do drop off, and they are always very friendly. William particularly loves to have a chat with some of the other parents and he works out with some of the mums at the Harbour Club after drop off. Heaposs very chatty and amiable. The parent also says that George has been given a cute nickname by his classmates - PG. There is also another friendly face at school -  their cousin Maud, the daughter of Prince Michael of Kent’s son Lord Freddie Windsor, who is in the same year as George. After Kate and Wills wave Charlotte off, she will join her new classmates, sit down at her new desk and get started with the private schoolaposs packed curriculum - which includes some very exciting subjects . In her maths lessons, Charlotte will improve her counting and learn how to do basic addition and subtraction. She and her classmates will also learn about shapes, space and measurements.  In reception, the kids at Thomasaposs will be taught the link between sounds and letters so they can begin to read and write. Staff use a systematic, synthetic phonics approach to reading.

The hate for Thatcher was pure and the depth of feeling surged through concerts and rallies.He says with a chuckle: “Them were the days.“We thought it was bad then, but everything can get worse, as we see now. It’s a case of careful what you wish for.“I don’t get involved in politics now, like I say when didn’t anyone complain about politicians “Can you point me to a golden era where# everybody liked being ruled  F***ing never!“But there are some real creeps nowadays. But then again I expect the worst from any politician.”So what can fans in Dundee expect when John rolls into town for his show at the city’s Gardyne Theatre on Saturday October  Without missing a beat he fires back: “A right f****** good night!“And they can expect more of the same#and then some. There will be a few classics and there will maybe be a few extra poems.“Then I will add a bit of fun and I can guarantee – solid, copper-plated guarantee – that everybody is going to leave with a smile on their face.”John has fond memories of Dundee and spoke of savouring the atmosphere of a waterfront hotel and added: “I love coming to Scotland and Dundee. I’ve been many times and the reaction of the crowd is great.“I was here last year and saw the VA which is fabulous. I know of DC Thomson and the Sunday Post, the Beano and the Dandy plus Oor Wullie.“Maybe I will buy one of those sculptures.”Posh hotels and venues seem a world away from the clubs and student venues of the s with smoke-filled rooms and plastic tumblers full of warm beer.He used to travel to the shows on public transport and chuckles at the memory.John said: “Yeah, long time ago now, mate. Now I have a driver and I am too old for public transport.“But I still love doing live gigs. It’s smashing. Anywhere where there’s people is greatI’m doing my stuff.“I am working on my book of poems right now. It’s called ‘The Luckiest Man Alive’ and I’m also working on the memoirs. vw, px\"  “I am thinking of calling that ‘I Wanna Be Yours’ after the Arctic Monkeys. I just hope to live long enough to finish it.“But I am not finishing up any time soon. I have never even thought about that.

Scott is obviously disappointed that he is not going to be playing in these qualiers as they are two great games.“It would have been two brilliant games for him to go into.“However, I think the good thing is that when Steve took the Scotland job on he played Scott in the first two games.“He sees Scott as part of that .”The hamstring tear suffered at Kilmarnock was the latest injury setback to marr McKenna’s international career.The centre-back suffered a hamstring tear against Rangers in the opening game of last season that ultimately ruled him out of action for six weeks.That injury saw him miss Scotland’s opening UEFA Nations League clash against Albania and the friendly with Belgium last September.McInnes believes the recent injury was particularly cruel for McKenna as he was in good form despite the speculation over his Aberdeen future.McKenna had submitted a transfer request days before the English transfer window closed on August  for Premier League and Championship clubs.Nottingham Forest and Queens Park Rangers both had bids for McKenna rejected before he handed in the request.Sheffield Wednesday came in with a late bid on transfer deadline day that was also rejected for the defender who is contracted to Pittodrie until .McInnes said: “Scott’s level of performance have been very strong. Unfortunately he missed spells of football last season with two hamstring injuries and this is another one.“This is a similar injury to when Scott over-stretched itagainst Rangers here making a blocking tackle.“He has over-stretched it again having lost his footing on that pitch and is out for the region of three to four weeks.“It may be a bit longer, maybe a bit shorter, but Scott has been a quick healer in the past.”Devlin’s call-up came  hours after histo the Dons starting line-up for the first time in six weeks after a hamstring injury.McInnes said: “It just shows you need that squad and how it changes because Mikey thought he was not getting into my team a couple of weeks ago.“Mikey is now in charge of he jersey and he comes back in now and plays.“We know we can rely on Mikey when he is called upon.“It is great to have that quality in the squad to call upon when you have injuries.McKenna is one of five centre-backs ruled out of Clarke’s Scotland squad with John Souttarand Stuart Findlayboth omitted with injuries.Grant Hanleyand Liam Palmerwere called up but dropped out with injuries.In reaction Clarke called up the Dons’ Devlin, , and Hamburg’s David Bates, on loan at Sheffield Wednesday.Uncapped Devlin was previously in the squad last November and was set to earn his first cap only to suffer an ankle injury training with Scotland that would rule him out for three months.McInnes said: “What looked like an innocuous injury when he was away with Scotland saw him miss the best part of three months.“He missed out on the League Cup final, playing for Scotland and a number of key games for us.“For a young lad he has a lot of injuries to deal with but hopefully he will have better times ahead.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/09/2.44476932-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/09/2.44476932-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/09/2.44476932-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/09/2.44476932-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"don devlin urged to take scots chance","story":"Aberdeen defender Mikey Devlin was today urged to make the most of his unexpected Scotland call-up for the Euro  qualiers against Russia and Belgium.Uncapped Devlin, , was called into Steve Clarke’s squad just  hours after his first game action for the Reds in six weeks.Devlin’s start in the - defeat of Ross County at the weekend was his first Dons game time since sustaining a hamstring injury in the - defeat of RoPS on July .Scotland assistant Steven Reid insists the late call is an opportunity to show his international credentials that he must grab.Reid said: “It is not ideal when you have members who would have been in the original squad and they have to pull out for ious reasons.“At the same time it is an opportunity for those who do come in.“An injury or another reason to pull out of the squad at club level as well means there is an opportunity for someone to come in and take their chance, and that’s usually the case.“It is quite rare you get an opportunity through some other reason – usually it’s an injury orsomeone is struggling for form and you have to take the opportunitycalled upon.”Devlin was drafted into Clarke’s Scotland squad along with fellow centre-back David Bates of Hamburg, who is on loan at Sheffield Wednesday.The call-up arrived on Sunday.The defensive duo were called in after Norwich City’s Grant Hanley and another Wednesday player, Liam Palmer, pulled out through injury.Aberdeen centre-back Scott McKenna was ruled out of the Euro  Hampden games having suffered a hamstring tear in the - draw with Kilmarnock.McKenna is set to be out for up to three weeks.Centre-backs John Souttarand Stuart Findlayare also injured.Devlin has been involved with the Scotland squad previously but has yet to be capped.Having recovered from a serious knee injury sustained at former club Hamilton that ruled him out for a year, Devlin’s form for the Dons earned him a maiden call-up to the international squad last November.He was set to earn his debut cap in the UEFA Nations League ties against Albania and Israel under former boss Alex McLeish.However, Devlin suffered an ankle injury while training with the international squad in the build-up to those qualiers.That ruled him out of the ties. It would also have long running ramications as Devlin would miss the League Cup final loss to Celtic and would eventually be ruled out for three months.Now, after a fresh injury set back, Devlin is back and is offered the chance to impress.Reid, capped  times for his country, insists late call-ups can provide the catalyst for a successful international career.He said: “For myself, I went to the World Cupand I was not even in the original squad.“Injury meant I went and I was the first substitute on in the first game against Cameroon.”Reid is confident Scotland can cope with the defensive injury withdrawals against Russia and a Belgium.He said: “There is no question we can still deal with that and there’s still a lot of quality there throughout the pitch.“Hopefully those that do get an opportunity come the Russia and Belgium games take their chance.“Our job as a staff is to get the ideas how we approach a game and how we play and get them organised pretty quickly.“It is about cramming as much information, detail, videos and work on the training pitch as possible to get them as prepared as possible for the games.”"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column july 5 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsMid Argyll Pipe Band followed up success at the Helensburgh competition with a victory in the European Championships.The band#s success is the result of years of hard work and good tuition.Grade  European winner Inveraray and District Pipe Band has more of an international feel to it these days, much like a premier league football team.

We do at the moment have a dentist and fully qualied staff and are happy with their work.Rumour has it that the aforementioned dentist and staff will be taking on patients from Mid Argyll Hospital, which I presume they tend to already.But the practice is to lose its local NHS patients, so they will deal solely with patients who require dental treatment from the hospital. I think this situation leaves the NHS patients in limbo.I am sure we would rather that the current dentist and all of her staff be given a chance to voice their opinions on this matter as much and as well as the local populace.Yes, it will be brilliant to have both dentists in the town. There is the possibility that those on the local list who are currently treated well by the dental department at the hospital maybe still seen by the dentist and her staff, but I would like this to be confirmed by the local NHS trust.Brian MacDonald, CrinanSir,Hundreds of people across Scotland have been helped through their exam results by a local group of Skills Development Scotlandcareers advisers.Based across the north of Scotland, the advisers were part of a team taking calls at the SDS Exam Results Helpline from am on results day.The helpline is a vital service, supporting young people and their families at what can be one of the most stressful times of their lives.Expert advice and guidance is available all year round, not just on results day.Our professionally qualied careers advisers are working in every state secondary school in Scotland and from our network of high street centres across the country.In schools, careers services are delivered one-to-one, in classrooms and at school events across all year groups, supporting young people to develop the skills to make informed career decisions throughout their lives.

It was fantastic to speak to so many of my constituents.It was also wonderful to see many local business stalls promoting Islay#s dynamic and booming economy.The show was well attended with lots of families, both local and visitors, having a fun day out and luckily the sun was shining most of the day.A huge thanks to all the organisers and everyone  who contributed to the event.Councillor Alastair RedmanSir,I have real concerns about the deteriorating condition of some Argyll cemeteries.Constituents from Islay recently joined Councillor Alastair Redman in highlighting the poor upkeep of cemeteries in the area he represents.Councillor Redman reported that there were also problems at other cemeteries in his ward, including the cemetery at Carradale in East Kintyre.I understand that Argyll and Bute Council confirmed that they now, at last, have plans in place to address the problems at Kilnaughton.It remains disappointing, however, that things are allowed to deteriorate to the extent that the maintenance of cemeteries has become a matter of public concern.Frankly, it is very surprising that a cemetery where interments are actually still taking place has been undermined in this way and there must surely be an obligation to ensure this doesn’t happen.My experience is that communities in the Highlands and Islands pay special regard to the final resting places of fellow members of their communities and will be perplexed to discover that they appear to be uncared-for.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSP"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures august 16 2019","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowTayvallich reader Colin MacInnes captured this photo of these two fluffy cygnets at the Corran Burn in Lochgilphead back in July.A couple of adult swans were spotted floating nearby at the time on Loch Fyne and Loch Gilp around Ardrishaig."},{"url":null,"title":"red star take derby spoils","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsRed Star welcomed local rivals Tarbert to the joint campus, and it was the Lochgilphead side who maintained their place at the top of the group thanks to a Stuart MacLean goal early in the second half.The first half of the game on Saturday August  began at a typically fast pace as you might expect from a derby clash-  but both sides were limited to efforts from long range which goalkeepers John Martin and Ally Lewis dealt with relative ease.The home side started to enjoy more possession as the first half progressed but were finding the well-organised Tarbert defence dficult to breach and were limited to efforts from distance which failed to trouble Martin in the Dookers goal.Star came out quicker at the start of the second half and looked to play at a much higher tempo. The deadline was broken on  minutes when Lee MacLean broke from midfield and managed to beat the offside trap, his cross from the left channel was met by the in-form Stuart MacLean whose shot beat Martin to give Star the lead.Tarbert looked to commit bodies forward in a bid to get back into the game which made for a more open contest, however the Star defence of Coll McCallum, Ricky Reid and Kyle Selfridge coped well throughout.Red Star should have made the closing stages a lot more comfortable for themselves with Gregor Peacock going close with a couple of opportunities and Aaron Moore having a shot well blocked but in the end Stuart MacLean’s goal was enough for a hard-fought but deserved win.On Saturday August  Star welcome Dunoon to the joint campus for their final game of the group stage, where a victory for the Lochgilphead side will see them progress to the quarter-finals.The kick-off time will be announced on the club’s social media pages during the week."},{"url":null,"title":"easy like summer busking","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe music club designed for everyone continues its summer of busking on Wednesday August .Get along to Lochgilphead Resource Centre for an evening of music from the much-missed Danny Kennedy with bagpipes, percussion and plenty of chances to sing along to the music.The event starts at pm and is free other than donations.

These songs were associated with the Tlell River on Hai Gwaii in Canada. These tracks, with a selection of later collaborations, make up River to Sea from Tlell to Tiree. The title documents Sheila#s journey from the coast of Canada to Tiree, where the track All You Really Need is the Sea was written.This artist is probably best described as a folk blues singer. She has the sharply observing, descriptive eye of the classic singer songwriter troubadour and while her voice is given gravitas and character by time, she swings and has the timing of the blues singer.Wild Biscuit#s musical accompaniment gives Sheila#s characterful voice depth and presence. The menacing guitar on I#ve Waited a Long Time and the atmospheric double bass and keyboards on Where the Pebbles Grind and Scrape complement Cameron#s lyrics and singing.Remembering Mr Toast is an atmospheric and evocative, less bombastic or overblown Scottish Jim Morrison, finding real beauty in a melancholic memory. The delicate hesitant guitar and reflective lyrics continue on Don#t Sigh and Go on Then, beautul, bitter sweet country love songs. All You Really Need is the Sea and Deep and Real are spiritual songs, again moving between an intimate relationship to consider the huge landscape and the restorative natural world.Is it blues, country, easy listening, folk or poetry set to delicate sympathetic music  It doesn#t matter. Close your eyes, listen to Sheila#s rich voice, with its cadence and rhythm. Enjoy the flow of words and the pictures they conjure on this warm and captivating set of recordings."},{"url":null,"title":"macalister wins tarbert golf championship","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe delayed fourth and final round of the Tarbert Golf Club championship took place at Glenralloch on Saturday August  in glorious conditions.The greens were freshly cut with captain Smyth choosing some interesting pin positions to test the players# skills.Iain Macalister held a one shot lead over Bruce MacNab and a five shot lead over John MacNab heading into the final round.If there were any nerves at the start of play this was not evident as Iain started with four fours then followed that with an excellent -foot birdie putt at the fth and a chip-in birdie at the sixth.

Now I am not saying this is the simplest or even healthiest of activities. All this crouching, hand staining, pricked fingers and even eye strain.Often when you reach for a large black juicy berry it seems to disappear. It’s like the behaviour of politicians. They offer so much but when you reach for it # it disappears. Do you remember the Scottish government passed a law guaranteeing one would be seen by an appropriate health specialist within a stated limited time  The SNP government daily breaks this law – be it on cancer, accident and emergencies, or mental health.Or what about the promises made to the people of Arran and the Outer Hebrides on improved ferry services. The Scottish government is responsible for Caledonian Maritime Assets, CMal, which own and manage ferries. MV Glen Sannox was intended to commence service to Arran in  but lies incomplete for all to see in the Ferguson Marine yard in Port Glasgow. Part of the delay is because of disagreement over the fixed-price design and build contract for the two vessels.The SNP seems obsessed with this type of contract which has adversely affected schools, colleges and community centres. Worse still, while the SNP ridiculed previous government public private partnerships they have introduced a system clearly no better. What about the £. million each month we the taxpayers have to pay for the unopened Edinburgh sick children’s hospital  Jeanne Freeman, the SNP Cabinet Secretary for Health and Social Care, stepped in so late that she does not know whether this much-needed hospital will ever open.The second part of the bramble experience is the delicious mouthwatering bramble crumble. A crumble which gives joy and stimulation. Not like the crumbling state of the SNP government which has a sour taste and clearly disappoints.Finlay Craig, CoveSir,Your readers may be interested to know that there are currently  people in need of a kidney transplant in Scotland whose diet will be restricted due to kidney disease.It is likely that they will be on fluid restrictions of around just ml of liquid a day # including liquid found in foods like sauces and ice cream.

We would like to thank Rhu Amateurs for their excellent post-match hospitality.’Meanwhile, the Pupils’ centenary season officially starts tomorrowwhen they host Argyll rivals Lochgilphead Red Star at Kintyre Park, in the SAFL’s aptly named Centenary Cup, with a pm kick-off.And with two more Saturday group matches to follow in August, firstly away to Dunoon and then at home to Tarbert, the Pupils will look to continue their dazzling pre-season form once the competitive action begins.Photograph:"},{"url":null,"title":"simply the best for james","story":"James was + after nine holes and then proceeded to put together an excellent back nine to finish on +.Meanwhile Donald had gone to + n the front nine only to fall back on the inward nine and finished on +.Result: , James Williamson +  ,  Donald Brown +  ,  Bill Brannigan +  ,  Sandy Watson +  , Ken MacMillan +  , Robert Cook  +."},{"url":null,"title":"letter childrens summer activities","story":"These activities, many of which have been provided free of charge, have been enjoyable and stimulating, not only for the youngsters but also the adults.We wish to express our sincere thanks to all those who gave their time and skills to delivering the activities.

Ryan McConnachie opted to go straight down the middle and evaded the e of the Dunoon keeper.There was a moment of worry at the other end, though, when goalscorer Souden also committed a handball in the Pupils’ box, and referee Peter Laing pointed to the spot. Dunoon halved the Pupils’ advantage, making it -.Then, just  seconds later, the Pupils restored their two-goal lead through Donald McCallum, who met left-sided substitute Kenny Kerr’s low cross to squeeze a shot between the Dunoon defenders and the frame of the goal.Soon after, the Pupils made it -, when Kerr guided another delightful cross onto the head of John McCallum, who guided an effort past the keeper from six yards, but it was the goal creator Kerr who was rightly mobbed by his team-mates.Not content with four, the Feathers-sponsored Pupils scored again, with # stand by # Kerr making it three assists in one match.Played in by McConnachie after some strong play in midfield by fellow substitute Michael McKinlay, Kerr set up young winger Ross Brown, who gladly tucked home goal number five with a close-range finish.With the match drawing to a close, McConnachie sealed his brace # and the Pupils’ sixth goal # with an excellent inidual effort, surging past a defender before rounding the hosts’ keeper and slotting the ball low into an unguarded net, adding gloss to an already emphatic cup win.After a great team performance, the Pupils will be hoping for more of the same tomorrowwhen they welcome a Tarbert side # who last week also defeated Dunoon # in a Kintyre derby.The match is scheduled for a pm kick off at Kintyre Park."},{"url":null,"title":"third round of tarberts golf championship","story":"Former champion Bruce MacNab held a four-shot lead going into the third round but a horror start saw the lead wiped out at the very first hole when Iain Macalister birdied and Bruce had a seven.Iain went on to birdie the second hole as well and despite the windy conditions was very much in control of his game over the first nine holes to be out in .John MacNab was also playing his normal steady game also ing , enjoying birdies at the st and th holes.After nine holes Iain had turned a four-shot deficit into a four-shot lead over Bruce and six ahead of John.Over the next four holes both Iain and John dropped four shots allowing Bruce some breathing space to claw back some of the deficit.When play was complete and all scores checked the totals after round three were as follows: Iain Macalister , Bruce MacNab , John MacNab .In the John Reid Quaich the silverware again headed south to Largieside with Duncan Johnstone retaining the trophy, shooting  nett over the two rounds.

Work is expected to start at the end of the month and should be completed by the send of September.Councillor Frank T. Spears stated that the work would not involve any long-term closure of the main roadway.The #dry bridge#, owned by Lord Margadale, has been the subject of much discussion and minor rows for the past several months. Since Western Ferries Ltd. began their sea service, heavy articulated lorries carrying malt and grain to the island#s distilleries have been unable to go under the bridge. Matters came to a head three months ago when Argyll County Council re-imposed a weight limit on the Glen road # the ersion used by the transporters to avoid the bridge.The bridge owners came quickly to the rescue and allowed the heavy traffic to use their private road at Bridgend for a three-week period, but following local protests and legal consultations the transporters were again allowed to use the Glen road.Leboat saves three on rocksThe crew of a lobster fishing boat were marooned on a partially-submerged rock for more than two hours when their vessel foundered off the north-east coast of Islay on Thursday morning.The ft #May#, owned and skippered by -year-old Mr Lachlan Clark of Port Charlotte # the veteran of several sea-dramas # struck the rocks while they were lting lobster creels.The Islay leboat was called out to rescue the skipper and his crew # Alastair MacDonald, a -year-old fisherman, and Norman Gardiner, a -year-old Colonsay doctor#s son who was making his first trip and deputising for a sick crew member.Following the rescue, the crew # who were unhurt # were landed at Port Askaig.ONE-HUNDRED YEARS AGONational Health Insurance ActA number of contraventions of the National Health Insurance Act were the subject of prosecutions in Campbeltown Sherf Court on Thursday # Sherf MacMaster Campbell on the bench.The first case was that of a Clachan merchant who was charged with neglecting to stamp the card of a female servant.Mr M. Dick, solicitor, who appeared for accused, tendered a plea of guilty, and said the observations he was about to make would apply equally to all the cases subsequently to be heard. These were the first prosecutions of the kind in this court. The Act, as his Lordship knew, was a most voluminous and complicated measure.The sherf observed that some excellent and very lucid summaries had been circulated.Mr Dick, proceeding, asked his Lordship to examine the contribution card. He would find that the part which was the very kernel of the offence was embodied in the middle of Art.  in very inconspicuous type. The employer was there required to stamp the card #not later than the time at which wages are paid# but to read that one required to hold the card at about  degrees.The sherf askedhe was to understand that this was the first occasion on which a domestic servant had been employed by accused  If not, he must have been trained in the use of this wonderful document years ago.Mr Dick said his Lordship must consider this, that in cases of this kind there were two standards of clearness. What was clear to the judicial mind might be very far from clear to the lay mind.It was a matter of common knowledge that there was a very general belief in this part of the country thatinsurance cards were stamped at the time they were run out the Act would be complied with.The card, of course, bore that the stamps must be affixed #not later than the time wages are paid#. He asked his Lordship to consider the phraseology. These cards came into the hands of many rustic employers of labour. Why should it not be stated in bold characters on the card that the stamps must be affixed at the time wages are paid In the country wages were paid sometimes by the half-year, sometimes by the month, and sometimes at irregular periods suitable to the circumstances of the worker.The cards represented not the half-year of the feeing terms, but the calendar half-year. All these circumstances contributed to the confusion of the lay mind, and encouraged the widespread impression thatthe cards were stamped at the end of the period the duty of a citizen was thereby fulfilled."},{"url":null,"title":"leader august 23 2019","story":"The Courier is honoured to deliver news to the community # during the good times and the bad.This week we were delighted to share the news that Campbeltown now boasts the #whisky bar of the year#, according to judges at the Scottish Bar and Pub Awards , who bestowed the title to the Ardshiel Hotel.Since buying the hotel more than a decade ago, Flora Grant and Marion MacKinnon have more than tripled the number of whiskies on offer, turning the hotel into something of a tourist attraction in itself.However, we also revealed that nine jobs have been lost at Campbeltown Creamery.While it is still hoped that a take-over by local farmers is the future for the site, it is terrible for the iniduals who have lost their jobs, some after many, many years.We know there is a market for Campbeltown cheese, and while the number of farms supplying the creamery has fallen over the years, there are still almost .Here#s hoping the future is bright for both Campbeltown#s whiskies and cheeses."},{"url":null,"title":"fun in the sun at first mokfest","story":"India enjoyed herself at this year#s Up The Close event, which included children#s entertainer Funky Chicken and ious fair attractions, and was made all the better by the glorious sunshine.India was joined by her mum Lynsey Mcshannon, who was able to get into the spirit of things this year having been heavily pregnant last year, and her dad Gary Anderson.This year#s Up The Close was a particular hit, with the welcome , after nearly a decade, of indie rockers a new hope "},{"url":null,"title":"more music in store for the wee toon","story":"On Wednesday, September  at .pm, well-known folksinger, entertainer and broadcaster Alastair McDonald will be in concert in Campbeltown Free Church.This will not be Alastair’s first visit to the Wee Toon.

One way we can fight back against ecological collapse is to have wilder, unmown, unsprayed spaces around us. Short grass and manicured parks may look neat but itrsquos vital to have flourishing wild spaces too.Rewilding East Lothian wants the council to commit to planting thousands more trees to help absorb the carbon dioxide emissions that are driving global warming.In addition, the council has been challenged to radically reduce mowing and weed-killing, since weeds provide homes for bees and other pollinators, and to mitigate the loss of green spaces to housing by proactively making dedicated areas for nature to flourish.A council spokeswoman said East Lothianrsquos reputation as the Garden County was ldquoappreciated by residents and visitors alike. She pointed to the relaxation in the cutting of greenspaces and the use of plant species which attract a wide range of pollinators. She added: ldquoOur most recent residentsrsquo survey found high levels of satisfaction with our parks, gardens and open spaces.ldquoWe have a number of initiatives to increase sustainable management of our countryside sites and improve bioersity and pollination.ldquoThis is reflected in the work we have been doing with partners such as Buglersquos John Muir Pollinator Way project, the planting of , metres sqaure of wildflower meadow, low impact grassland management and targeted use of a weedkiller where appropriate.ldquoOur Green Network Strategy, part of our Local Development Plan, recognises the importance of vacant and derelict land for wildle, and seeks to identy suitable locations for tree planting given the important role that trees play in mitigating climate change.

When the corn was eventually gathered in early September, it is said decaying corpses were discovered. They had lain in the fields since August , a day of barbaric infamy in Tranentrsquos history. The dead were victims of the Tranent Massacre, and one of the bodies may have been that of Jackie Crookston or Crookstone.I say lsquomayrsquo for there is ironically so little known about this well-known woman. A statue by David Annand of Jackie on Tranent High Street shows her beating her drum with a clenched fist, defiantly leading the protest against the Militia Act. The plaque by the statue calls her a ldquoresolute woman who joined the protest, and states she was one of those killed by the cavalry.Her heroic reputation is well established in local lore. The th-century historian John Martine called her ldquoa Tranent virago. This word describes a woman of brave, fearless qualities, but it has a sting in its tail. It can also be used to mean a woman who has overstepped her mark, broken cultural rules in relation to her role as defined by gender.And by leading the protest against the Militia Act she most certainly did this.Another th-century historian and collector of traditions, P. MrsquoNeill, was clear on her role: ldquoJackie indeed was the prime mover in the whole affair, he states.We have accounts of her beating her drum and leading the protest with chants of ldquonae militia. She is said to have threatened a captain of the cavalry and declared defiantly that ldquoshe didna care a pin though she were cut in halves, she wad hae nae militia. Another account has her telling a member of the yeomanry to leave or she would ldquothraw his neck, at which he duly rode off.If these accounts are true, she was indeed resolute on that day in defending her family, her neighbours and her community. Jackie was not the only woman on the streets that day, for women took a leading role in defending their families. But she was the most prominent, it seems.The Militia Act aimed to conscript young men into a militia by means of a ballot. It was resisted for a number of reasons, but for the poverty-stricken mining and farming communities of Tranent and the surrounding area, it was seen as an imposition which would take young men of working age away and potentially cripple their families economically.There is no space here to recount the details of the massacre, but much of what happened on that day remains hidden behind a mist of cover-up and official indference.And somewhere in the bloody carnage of August , , Jackie Crookston was killed, along with many others. Yet despite her leading role, her name was not included in the original list of people killed. Eleven deaths were recorded, but no mention of Jackie. ldquoHow her death escaped recording is dficult to explain, reflected P. MrsquoNeill in his book Tranent and its Surroundings.Perhaps an explanation can be found in an eyewitness account written immediately after the massacre. It was a letter from Archibald Roger to his we in Edinburgh.It begins: ldquoDear we, this comes to acquaint you that you need not weary for my ing home, for my sister is to be buried this afternoon at four orsquoclock, and I cannot come away till I see her decently interred. I am sorry to inform you of the cruelties that were committed here yesterday there were six persons shot dead on the spot, of which my sister was onehellip the number of wounded is not yet ascertained, but I am just now informed that  dead corpses were this morning found in the corn-fields and it is not known how many more may be found when the corn is cut.Was Jackie one of those lying undiscovered in a field  It seems so by some accounts. Is that why her death was not on the list  Sandy Mullay in his book The Tranent Massacre says she was shot in the streets, but there is also a tradition which states her body was found well away from Tranent much later in a field, with stab as well as gunshot wounds.Was she initially wounded and then a victim of later retribution  Was she hunted down in an unrecorded atrocity because of her role as ring leader, and a woman who didnrsquot know her place  She will have been easy to identy because of her prominence in the protest.Her death, just like her le, is unrecorded by history. Despite her leadership in the events, she was a woman and she was poor, and history lacks interest in such characters. A tax on the registration of births and deaths at this time meant many poor people lived and died unregistered even in parish records.So who was Jackie  We know she was born in Gladsmuir in June  and was a mother. Perhaps not all her children were registered because of the tax, but it seems she had at least four surviving at the time of the massacre. She was only  when she died, but how do we imagine her le  What was behind her passion in defending her community When I spoke of her to artist Mags Nisbet-Macfarlane, she was inspired to use art to search for the woman behind the historical glimpses.ldquoI felt connected to this woman I did not know, she told me, ldquoshe will have had a le that explains her defiance that day she had so little, but was protecting what was important to her. Magsrsquo image of Jackie tells a story without the need of words.The plaque by the statue in Tranent says there were  killed in the massacre, as Jackiersquos name has been added to the original .

In part, this could be because her fiction is risky, challenging, sometimes riotously funny, but as often sizzling with rage. Her titles include Man or Mango , Dot in the Universe, and Mimi, savage satires on gender politics which are nevertheless also filled with tenderness and optimism. Her fondness for emphasising words in capital letters or italics has irked some critics, who prefer the page to look ordered and calm. But since when was fiction a form of beta blocker  With Ellmann, you feel yoursquove had an injection of adrenaline, quickening your heartbeat and bringing the world alive.Compared with her other novels, Ducks, Newburyport takes something of a new turn. As always, a woman is at its heart, but in this instance, instead of a slim work, it is big: just shy of , pages. Told by an Ohio housewe, who bakes her way through the tale, it is a stream-of-consciousness portrait of modern-day America, in all its confusion, consumerism, and cupidity. A y glossary of abbreviations is appended, ranging from Ato ZPGby way of IHPand WMD . You get the picture.Theof the story is ambitious enough, but asshe needed something more to spur her on, Ellmann has written the entire book ndash barring the opening passage ndash in a single sentence. Does this sound intimidating  Probably. Or make the book hard to read  Not at all. It is like stumbling on an oasis in a desert, a refreshing, invigorating, restorative immersion in a piece of remarkable, thoughtful and truly innovative fiction. Too many headline-grabbing novels are dull and predictable, enervating rather than enjoyable, derivative when they should be daring. Such tedious stuff makes you forget that the original meaning of the word novel was something dferent, unique, and new.Thankfully the Booker  has recognised a work of exceptional talent. Its presence on the shortlist adds lustre to a prize that has been dogged over the years by accusations of mediocrity and popularism, charges that last yearrsquos winner, Milkman by Anna Burns, helped to refute. Ellmannrsquos fellow shortlistees are prestigious, including Margaret Atwood and Salman Rushdie, both of whom have won before, along with El Shafak, second only to Orhan Pamuk in Turkey for international acclaim, British writer Bernadine Eisto, and the Nigerian Chigozie Obioma, shortlisted for his second novel, as he was with his first.The competition is stf, but already statistics are being trotted out: were it to win, Ducks, Newburyport would be the longest to prevail in the historyrsquos prize, beating even Eleanor Cattonrsquos doorstopper, The Luminaries, by more than  pages. Apart from their size, however, these two novels are poles apart. There is nothing conventional about Ducks, Newburyport. Indeed, Ellmannrsquos literary credentials can be traced back to James Joyce, the exemplar of stream of consciousness, where the reader has to surrender themselves to the flow, trusting the author to keep their head above water until they reach their destination. In the fluidity of Ellmannrsquos prose therersquos an echo of Henry James, with his sharp and self-conscious interrogation of America. Therersquos a nod to Virginia Woolf too, but Ellmannrsquos wit and acerbity, her scorching political lens, are all her own.The direction her style has taken is perhaps no surprise. Ellmannrsquos late father Richard was a world-renowned expert on Oscar Wilde and Yeats, but above all on James Joyce. His biography of the myopic Dublin genius has never been surpassed, remaining one of the most acclaimed literary biographies of the last century. The linguistic poetry and emotional range of Joyce, who must have been an invisible but constant presence in the Ellmann household, seems to have got under his daughterrsquos skin at a formative age.The announcement of the Booker Prize next month, on October , will mark  years to the day since its only Scottish winner, James Kelman, took the prize in  with How Late It Was, How Late. This was a highly contentious choice, not just because of its interior monologue narration, but also its liberal use of the F-word, which horried one uptight judge. The controversy it sparked has never been forgotten. These days, though, you canrsquot help thinking the title sounds like a lament for the lapse of time between Kelmanrsquos success and that of anyone  living north of the Border.There is no doubting Kelmanrsquos status as one of our finest novelists. Along with Alasdair Gray, he is an obvious contender for a Nobel Prize, though the chances of that idiosyncratic telescopersquos lens turning in this direction seem slim. Unlike many others, winning the Booker did not make Kelman rich or famous. It did, however, raise his profile internationally, and set a benchmark for those keen to add something memorable to the literary cairn.Ducks, Newburyport certainly does that. Other than in their tireless search for a mesmerising and distinctive way of expressing themselves, at first glance there is little obvious common ground between this pair. It is only when you read their books and recognise their seemingly effortless brilliance that you realise how similar, and rare, they are.In the acknowledgements at the end of Ducks, Newburyport, Ellmann thanks ldquoEdinburgh City Council for my Saltire card, a dandy aid to the impecunious. Itrsquos a cheerful reminder that unless yoursquore a bestseller, the literary le is not deluxe. Yet listening to the naturalness of her narratorrsquos voice, and the stories she tells, makes you grateful that the writerrsquos feet are firmly on the ground, be it a New Town pavement, No.  bus, or mid-west America, where the future is unfolding fast."},{"url":null,"title":"former-shipyard-owner-urges-msps-dig-governments-role-insolvency","story":"Mr McColl, a former controller of the business, urged MSPs to ldquodo their constitutional duty and get to the bottom of the financial crisis at Ferguson Marine in Port Glasgow.In a briefing dossier sent to MSPs, he said he was more than willing to give evidence at Holyrood and blamed a lack of leadership by ministers for tipping the yard into insolvency last month.:Jim McColl: What lay behind the Ferguson Marine crisisHe revealed First Minister Nicola Sturgeon had been personally involved in the situation, and cast doubt on Finance Secretary Derek Mackayrsquos repeated claim that the government had given Fergusonrsquos poundm of public money help it ersity into other businesses.Mr McColl said the money had in fact been used to keep the firm afloat as it struggled with runaway costs on a poundm order for two CalMac ferries.The Tories said ministers had been ldquodisingenuous and must come clean.:Shipyard takeover the act of a banana republicIn his document, Mr McColl said he felt ldquoconstantly frustrated and at times bewildered by the governmentrsquos actions over the last two years.He said the future could be ldquoextremely bright for Fergusonrsquos, but he feared a looming nationalisation would narrow its work options and be a ldquohuge missed opportunity.He said: ldquoTo date, the Scottish Government has repeatedly stated they have no idea on what the true final cost of this sorry situation will be.ldquoI would therefore ask every MSP, irrespective of Party, to please honour your constitutional duty and firmly hold the Scottish Government to account.ldquoWhen the Scottish Government publish the full cost of nationalisation, the figure must be fully scrutinised by Parliament alongside the private sector bids.ldquoIrsquom aware of the current calls for a Parliamentary inquiry and I would be happy to participate.

At a time of a climate emergency, this is an unmissable opportunity to cut tens of thousands of tonnes of carbon.”Glass bottles are a big part of Mark Hazell’s beer business.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"A record  nominations were received for this years Best Park competition, of which  were in Scotland.\"  Aden Park is Much Loved by public viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"FRAS | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"FRAS | Article Teaser\"The founder of Jaw Brewwants to see as much glass recycled as possible and believes the p deposit on glass bottles will help make that happen.“Jaw Brew has always put the environment at the core of what we do so anything that helps make our materials more sustainable is a definite plus for us,” he said. “I lived in Germany for many years so saw how successful depositschemes can be and it’s great that Scotland is set to introduce its own scheme.”"},{"url":null,"title":"20 of the most unusual baby names chosen in 2018","story":"These are some of the most unusual baby names parents in England and Wales named their children in , according to the Office for National Statistics data..

The society now also delivers animal welfare educational programmes, reaching more than , children in .So it’s fair to say that it has come a long way in the last  years.But for all the successes, there are also new issues it has to face – not least thanks to the advent of the internet.Mike explained: “For years, we have looked after all of Scotland’s animals – wild, farm and domestic.“Farming has come on leaps and bounds in the last few decades and we now have very few problems in the industry.“When I was a kid growing up, you used to have pet shops selling cats, dogs, budgies and the like.“Now, thanks to the internet, people have far more exotic animals in their care which all of our inspectors need to know how to care for and handle – from bearded dragons to massive boa constrictors!“We also have to contend with puppy farmers plying their trade online and selling puppies from car boots.“Some of the puppies die within a few days of people buying them, having paid a lot of money for the animal and thousands on vet fees.“Sadly, we also still see things that I saw  years ago such as Dobermans with every rib on their body sticking out.“However, thanks to our education programme, we are reaching the children of today who will be the animal lovers of the future.“And the majority of people our inspectors visit are not harming animals for fun – it’s a case of ignorance and neglect. In those cases, we’re not just helping the animals, but humans too.“Only five to ten per cent of cases every year are intentional cruelty. So Scotland is still a nation which, in the main, loves and cares for its animals.”That care and concern shines through as the public helps fund the SSPCA’s £ million budget annually.That covers the cost of  employees, including  inspectors,  ambulance drivers and the -strong team based at its nine centres across Scotland and its widle sanctuary.The society receives no government funding and relies solely on the public to fund its work.Mike added: “We are really lucky that, from a population of five and a half million, only  people were prosecuted last year for animal cruelty.“We will never be out of a job but the vast majority of people in Scotland are law abiding and animal loving.“And we couldn’t do what we do without their support.”In December, the Society plans to launch celebrations to commemorate the th anniversary that will run throughout .Anyone with interesting anecdotes or memorabilia they’d like to share should get in touch via its website or by emailing .years@scottishspca.org.The SSPCA is the only animal charity in the UK able to report animal cruelty cases to the Crown, with reports sent to the Procurator Fiscal Service. The charity receives no government funding and relies on donations and grants to continue its work, which costs £ million each year.In , it found homes for  rescued animals, helped more than  wildle casualties and spoke to more than , children.For every pound it receives, p is spent on animal welfare, p on fundraising and promotion and p on administration.So you can rest assured that the bulk of any donation you make will make a huge dference to the animals in the SSPCA’s care.Last year, its animal helpline received almost a quarter of a million calls, the inspectorate attended more than , incidents and more than , animals were cared for across its nine rescue and rehoming centres and at the national wildle rescue centre.

The devices were first introduced in Tayside in June this year and they were subsequently introduced in the North East in July.The mobiles will provide apps enabling officers carry out checks and file crime reports. Officers will also be able to type statements directly to the device through the use of its digital notebookPronto which will obtain an electronic signature from victims and witnesses.Chief Superintendent George Macdonald, Highland and Islands isional commander, said: #The introduction of mobile technology is a major milestone which will positively enhance the operational policing approach in the Highland and Islands.#Over the last two years, we have seen a signicant investment and upgrade in our IT systems to enable us to take advantage of technology.#Given the geography of the area, officers do incur signicant travel time between calls and their stations, the mobile device will allow officers to be more visible in the community, spend more time on patrol and hopefully be more accessible within the areas they serve.#Members of the public will see police officers operating their mobile device in public areas. It is important they understand they are not using their personal telephone and that they are working, but be reassured they will always be available to offer help, advice or assistanceneeded.#Cabinet Secretary for Justice, Humza Yousaf  is pleased that the Scottish Government has been able to help Police Scotland invest in new mobile technology, which he believes will enable officers to work in the heart of Scotland’s communities, providing reassurance and increasing their visibility.“This technology is enabling officers to become even more agile and responsive, ensuring the service is better-equipped to meet the modern-day demands upon it,# he said.#Being able to access information at their fingertips will improve the ability of officers in the Highlands and Islands to react promptly to a range of issues they encounter, enhancing the amount of time available to spend in the heart of their communities and keeping people safe.”Susan Deacon, Chair of the Scottish Police Authorityfeels that this is an important and much needed step forward.#The introduction of mobile working will bring real benefits to the police and the public and will make the police service more responsive, visible and efficient,# she explained.#Continued investment in technology is vital to ensure that policing in Scotland keeps pace with changing needs and demands. Communities across Scotland will be better protected as a result of these changes.#The £million Mobile Working Project which was part funded by the Scottish Government’s capital budget allocation will see approximately , of Police Scotland’s unormed officers issued with mobile devices by spring .The devices will be further enhanced over time with the addition of future policing applications, including national systems as they become available.Last year, Police Scotland produced a business case for a major investment in digital, data and ICT over  years to modernise the service. The proposed investment would also generate savings and public service improvements for the wider criminal justice system justice system.David Wallace, BT’s public sector director in Scotland and chair of the BT board in Scotland, said: “We’re pleased to be leading this project, bringing in our EE mobile network – the largest G network in the UK – and our unrivalled resources to help Police Scotland transform the way they work.“By helping our customers take advantage of BT’s investments in innovations and networking, including our launch of G in Scotland, we’ll see opportunities we couldn’t imagine ten years ago come into our lives.”Norman Dixon, Motorola Solutions# Account Director for Scotland added: “The Pronto mobile application replaces the paper notebook and modernises police workflows by giving them access to databases and tools on their mobile device on the beat.

This would be completed over the next two or three months, he said.On the issue of smell, the two sources are from the -metre chimney and from the hatches of the fish meal boats. The former was cleaned out last week after contaminants were discovered inside the base of the stack, said Mr Jonermark, and the amount of bacteria used to pury the air in a filter chamber has been increased. Highland Council would be approached to seethey would agree to a -metre extension to the height of the chimney.As far as the feed boats are concerned, Mr Nilsson said the problem arises when the hatches are opened so that the fish meal can be delivered to the plant. This will occur for about  hours per year, he said, and the firm is currently working on a solution to that.Mr Jonermark added: #We do not want this to be a problem for anyone. We do not want this situation to continue.#We want to make a positive contribution to the village and we will continue to invest to make sure the problems go away. By next summer the plant should be quiet and there should be no smell.#"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/INVERNESS-CITY-SKYE-1-web.jpg","title":"portree high girls selected to join caley thistle","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineKatherine Dibblefrom Breakish and Jenner Macleodfrom Raasay will travel through to the Highland capital for training and competitions.Katherine Dibble can operate as a playmaker, while Jenner MacLeod plays as a defender.

But this week the #Peatbogs# will be back on home turf to showcase their energetic brand of traditional-inspired electronica as part of this year#s Skye Live Festival.The rare Skye gig will mark the start of another autumn tour for the six-piece group, for whom constant re-invention has proved key to longevity spanning almost three decades.The sound that#ll boom out in the tent high above Portree Harbour this Saturday will be far removed from the group#s roots as a folk band playing in local pubs. But the Peatbogs, like more recent successors such as Niteworks, are a reminder that a grounding in traditional music is no barrier to a letime of instrumental experimentation.Le for the Peatbog Faeries began with a gig in Edinbane Lodge in the spring of . Peter Morrison and bass player Innes Hutton from Braes # the two constants in the line-up # were joined by Davie Tait, Ali Pentland and Alan Edmunds.Pubs and village hall dances became their early staple, but gradually more adventurous elements crept into their set and the audiences lapped it up.Morrison recalled: #We#d bring in a blues or a reggae sound, and we found it was these things that started to go down best with audiences.#We moved to more of a world music sound around about , but we never expected much to come of it. We were just out to play at pubs and parties and have a bit of fun#.Their first tape # the #Great Ceilidh Swindle# # sold well locally and paid for a demo in Edinburgh, which in turn caught the ear of Greentrax Records, the specialist label in Scottish traditional music.With bands like Shooglenty and Martyn Bennett also arriving on the scene it proved a perfect time to be breaking new ground and the Peatbog Faeries# debut album #Mellowsity# would stay in Greentrax#s top ten for the next decade-and-a-half.Morrison remembers: #Because of our size and sound, bands like us and Shooglenty cost a lot more to record than other folk bands at the time. So there was a worry at the start.#But as soon as we signed to Greentrax, we quite quickly got an agent and we got sought-after slots at Glastonbury, Nomad and Celtic Connections.#We didn#t really notice what was happening, in a way # it felt like one day we were playing in the pub, the next day playing in front of thousands.#There weren#t that many precedents for bands like ours. Most folk bands just played in pubs. There were some accordion bands that were full-time or groups like #Silly Wizard#, but for us coming out of Skye we never thought it would turn into a full-time occupation.#We just went with the flow and luckily for us it proved a lot more popular than we thought it would be.#The band#s line-up has changed several times, and in turn, each addition helped explore new sounds # the most dramatic sht coming when Rick Taylor and Nigel Hitchcock arrived on Skye in the s to add a three-piece brass section.Taylor # who passed away earlier this year # was a revered musician who had toured with Elton John, while in recent years the Peatbog#s fiddler Peter Tickell left the group to take to the road with Sting.The current scaled-back line-up has seen Morrison and Hutton joined by Edinburgh-based Tom Salter on guitar keyboard player Graeme Stafford from Ardnamurchan drummer Stu Haikney and Shetlander Ross Couper on fiddle.For Peter Morrison, the global tours, the record deals and the Glastonbury stage all owe their origins to the chance he got to learn the chanter in the long-since closed Vatten Bridge primary school.He explains: #Every year Norman MacLeod # the teacher#s husband # and John Laing used to pipe us all in to the Christmas Party, so that was where I first heard the pipes.#Every pupil got the chance of learning the chanter at school, and I think nine of us started playing. It was either that or an hour of maths.#I think I was the only one who carried on into secondary school, but I got the bug. I didn#t like the competing part, but I enjoyed listening to the pipes and learning to play them.#My pal Donnie MacAskill from Roag also played the accordion, so I learned to play drums along with him and from about the age of  I was always in bands.#Morrison#s early piping tutor was Cameron MacFadyen, and he received additional help from Nicol Campbell # another well-known local piper and character from Dunvegan, whose memory has been honoured across the globe.Morrison added: #When he passed away Nicol left me his kilt, which has since been worn on stages in Japan, Africa and America.#A joiner to trade, who also worked for aperiod as a hotelier in Dunvegan, Peter Morrison has seen attitudes to traditional music change over the years, and with it opportunities flourish.He still lives in Roag with we Johan and grown-up kids Jenny and Calum, and it#s no surprise to hear him promote the virtues of free access to music tuition in local schools.He continues to be #amazed# at some of the local talent learning traditional instruments, some of whom he can be heard playing alongside at regular music sessions laid on in the Edinbane Inn and the Old Inn in Carbost.#It#s changed a lot since when I was a youngster whenyou wanted to learn music the only real opportunity was the pipes,# he recalled.#Things like the fis movement have been really helpful in creating opportunities. There now seems to be a constant stream of really good young musicians coming out of Skye.#When I started you would never have thought of making a career out of it, but now with some of these youngsters, it seems to be the only thing they think about. #A lot of these kids are now at a standard that in previous years only a handful of people in Scotland were achieving.#In Skye you have the likes of Daimh, Niteworks, Bridghe Campbell # the list goes on and on. #At these regular sessions there are some great young local players going along like Anna Scott, Dugald McKiggan, Archie and Isobel Maclean and Malin Lewis.#Morrison continued: #Recently over in LorientI saw a great act. It was a Sikh beatboxer, accompanied by step-dancer Sophie Stevenson along with Catherine Tinney from Portree singing puirt-a-beul.#This was another Skye person on the international stage, singing to an incredible standard, but she was someone I#d never heard sing before. #In the past, going somewhere like Lorient,there was a person from Skye on stage you would know exactly who it was # they would be an established name. Now you can go somewhere like that and get a surprise.#It shows the strength in depth there is now.#Some of that west-coast musical talent will be showcased at Skye Live this weekend among a ied line-up that will also include some of the country#s top nightclub DJs.Morrison urged the local community to rally behind the festival weekend, which this year starts with a Thursday-night concert to the Waterboys.He added: #We played at the very first Skye Live five years ago and are looking forward to getting on stage at the Lump in Portree again.#It#s an iconic setting, but organisers have kept the festival to a level that is comfortable for the place.#A capacity of , people is about a fth of the population of Skye and is manageable. When you start to go into the tens of thousands it brings pressures, and it#s a risk to go too big without the infrastructure to support it.#Whenever anyone organises a festival there will always be people who might want to pick holes in it or knock it in some way.#But people need to remember that these guys are putting on a  for so many types of music.#It#s something people of all ages can go to and hear some of the best music in Scotland in Portree. I would hope local people can support it in any way they can.#The Skye Live festival runs from Thursday th until Saturday th September.

On Friday , Mrs Steenson received a call informing her that no bus was available due and mix-up between the EA and the transport provider. Speaking to the Andersonstown News, Mrs Steenson said she had “issue after issue” during the summer months due to their errors.“My experience of it is that the Education Authority has a lot of people off sick, they are understaffed and there is a lot of pressure, and there just isn’t enough transport places available for the kids that need them. There are children being let down, and for us personally, it’s just not doable. We both work, and it’s an hour-and-a-half to get down to Fleming and back up again, so to do that while working and bringing our other child to school is impossible.”She continued: “This week we have been very lucky that my work has been flexible and allowed me to take some times, but that’s not sustainable. I hope that her transport can get organised very very quickly so that she can go to school. We have prepared her for going on the bus or getting in a taxi and she’s wondering why it’s not happening – it’s confusing for her.”She added: “I don’t know what we’re going to do. It’ll be very stressful. There’ll probably be days where she can’t make it in because we can’t get transport. I might have to take more time off or my husband might have to.”Despite complaints from parents, the Education Authority has said there has been no reduction to transport services.A spokesperson for the Education Authority , said: “EA provides transport assistance to over , children every day, including , children with Statement of Special Educational Need.“We remain committed to ensuring that all necessary arrangements are in place ahead of the new school year.“In this case, EA’s transport service provision has been maintained and there has been no reduction to services at either school.

people who are at risk of homelessness, people who need a safe way to get home, reduce pressure on the police and AE, and really, we care about making Belfast a more resilient city, a safer city for

Johnsons first PMQs was choreographed madnessSpeaking in the Commons, Mr Smith said: \"Throughout the period ahead I will be doing everything I can to support and encourage talks to succeed. \"Democratically elected politicians in Northern Ireland are best-placed to take the decisions needed to support hospitals, schools and the police.\" Mr Smith praised the \"excellent\" work of civil servants in Northern Ireland, adding: \"They cannot, of course, take the proactive decisions that are needed on public services or the economy in the run-up to October . \"If we cannot secure the restoration of an executive we will pursue the decision-making powers that are needed at the earliest opportunity.\" Shadow Northern Ireland secretary Tony Lloyd warned that senior members of the Northern Ireland civil service are \"frustrated by their inability to make decisions\". He added the imminent prorogation of Parliament poses \"real dangers\" in terms of Northern Irelands governance, and asked when Mr Smith was consulted about the matter. On the Governments plans to legislate for direct rule in the event of a no-deal Brexit, Mr Lloyd asked: \"Does the Secretary of State accept that some form of direct governance, some form of direct accountability, would be necessary in the event of a no-deal Brexit, and can he tell us what steps hes taking \" Mr Smith replied: \"I think Ive been very honest with the House - powers are needed, not only to ensure the current situation where civil servants across Northern Ireland are making dficult decisions without political direction, but obviously in the run-up to either a deal or no deal that the very tricky decisions can be made and Im sure those will have to be made at pace.\" On legal advice for prorogation, Mr Smith said: \"Its not something I or my department was involved in. That was a matter for the Attorney General.\" Ms Bradley expressed concerns about the impact proroguing Parliament may have on the people of Northern Ireland. She said: \"Can you ensure that while prorogation is in place, Government does not stop working for those that need redress, and by that I mean victims of historical institutional sexual abuse and those that were severely physically and psychologically disabled in the Troubles through no fault of their own  \"They need redress, they need it urgently.\" Former Tory minister David Gauke said powers are needed to protect the people of Northern Ireland and the Commons needs to be sitting to legislate for those powers. He said: \"Is it not clear thatthis House does not get the legislation through because it is prorogued or dissolved by the end of October that the rights of the people of Northern Ireland will be detrimentally affected \" Mr Smith said the priority is on getting Stormont up and running. Mr Lloyd called for a \"clear statement\" that there will be time to discuss the issues before prorogation so the Secretary of State \"has the power to do the things that Northern Ireland needs\". Commons Speaker John Bercow said the concern being expressed on both sides of the House \"will have registered very firmly\" with Mr Smith. He said: \"About this matter, more must be heard. I think we need to be absolutely crystal clear on that point. Nothing can get in the way of the provision of proper information to this House on this matter.\""},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38471504.ece/f39f0/BINARY/_104335493_tv041111713.jpg","title":"northern ireland minister nick hurd announces he wont stand in next election","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Their address is listed as  Parnell Square, which is the partys headquarters in Dublin.It was outlined in Mr Hamptons will that the money was to be used to cover election expenses, to fund Sinn Fein offices and advice centres, and to aid republican prisoners and their families in both Ireland and Britain.Mr Hamptons will stated: \"In the event that the organisation which is now known as Sinn Fein should cease to be in existence or should have split or taken a dferent name at the date of death then I direct that my executors and trustees are to apply my monies to the political party to which Mr Gerry Adams MP then belongs.\"\"Should Mr Adams pre-decease me or not be a member of any political party at the date of my death then I direct that my executors and trustees shall apply my monies to the republican or nationalist political party in the six counties, other than the SDLP, which has the largest number of elected councillors.\"Mr Hamptons donation was made public on Thursday by the Electoral Commission.A Probate Registry of Wales document confirms that when he died on January , , at a nursing home in Pembrokeshire, Mr Hampton left an estate in the UK worth £,,.However, at the time of writing his will in , he was living in a mobile home in Ireland. He states in it that he is \"presently of no fixed abode\".It states he had former addresses in Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire. The pensioner, who was unmarried and had no children, was born in London and was a long-term supporter of Sinn Fein.Mr Hamptons will and probate document, as in the case of any deceased person, are available for public inspection. The donation to Sinn Fein was paid to the party in instalments of £m and £, in April and May this year.The size of the UK estate and the mention of other global assets means that Sinn Fein may yet be in line for further donations from Mr Hampton.Under HM Revenue  Customs rules, Sinn Fein will not have to pay any inheritance tax on the £.m gt as any political party that has at least two MPs in the House of Commons is not liable to do so.Sinn Fein has seven MPs but because of a Westminster abstentionist policy they do not take their seats in the house.A political party also qualies for exemptionit has one MP and received no less than , votes at the last general election. Without exemptions, anyone who is left £.m would be required to pay around £, in inheritance tax."},{"url":null,"title":"taoiseach says checks may be carried out near border in event of nodeal brexit","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Whether it comes ashore or not, the eye of the storm will be close enough to cause extensive damage in North Carolina.”At least four deaths were reported, all involving men in Florida and North Carolina who died in falls or by electrocution while trimming trees, putting up storm shutters or otherwise getting ready for the storm.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Ky Myers looks at an overturned tree in her front garden in Summerville, South Carolina The National Hurricane Centre’s projected track showed Dorian passing near or over the Outer Banks on Friday, lashing the thin line of islands that stick out from the US coast like a boxer’s chin.Dorian was then expected to peel away from the shoreline.The National Hurricane Centre forecast as much as in of rain for the coastal Carolinas, with flash-flooding likely.In Charleston, South Carolina, a historic port city of handsome antebellum homes on a peninsula that is prone to flooding even from ordinary storms, Dorian toppled some  trees, flooded roads and brought down power lines, officials said.In an assault that began over Labour Day weekend, Dorian pounded the Bahamas with Category  winds up to mph, obliterating entire neighbourhoods and triggering a humanitarian crisis.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Trees left bare by Hurricane Dorian dot the devastated landscape in Marsh Harbour, Abaco, Bahamas More than , people sought refuge in  shelters in South Carolina, where rain began falling late on Wednesday in the historic port city of Charleston, situated on a peninsula that is prone to flooding even from ordinary storms.As Dorian crept dangerously closer to the city, the wind picked up, sending sheets of rain sideways.Thunder boomed in the night sky, and power flickered on and off.More than two dozen streets were closed by flooding in the city, where shops and restaurants were boarded up with wood and corrugated metal.Dorian also apparently spun off at least one tornado in North Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, damaging several homes, city spokesman Patrick Dowling said.No injuries were reported.Hundreds of shelter animals from coastal South Carolina arrived in Delaware ahead of the storm.The News Journal of Wilmington, Delaware, said  were airlted early on Tuesday from shelters in danger of flooding.About  more were expected to arrive via land.Hundreds of thousands of people were also ordered off the Georgia coast."},{"url":null,"title":"derry needs gallery art lovers devastated loss ebrington gallery","story":"Art lovers in Derry have expressed their “disappointment” at the loss of an Ebrington gallery space which hosted the most prestigious modern art competition in the UK a matter of years ago.The Derry News exclusively revealed that Nerve Visual is set to close its doors at the end of this week.Artists based in the city say we should “demand” that this space is used to showcase the local arts scene and,properly promoted, it will prove to be a “massive draw” for both tourists and the local community.Since the announcement, people who are passionate about arts and culture have aired their views.National Museum NI curator, Kim Mawhinney, said: “I am devastated to hear this. We worked with Nerve Visual to bring two of our most impactful exhibitions from the Ulster Museum to Derry.”The exhibitions referred to are Silent Testimony and Art of the Troubles. “Derry needs this gallery!” she added.The Nerve Centre reopened the former Turner Prize gallery space as Nerve Visual in June  when it was lauded as a “major new venue for visual arts in the Northern Ireland”.A spokesperson for the Nerve Centre said it has received no core funding and was programmed and funded on a project by project basis.In just over three years it has hosted  successful exhibitions.However, writer and art critic Dominic Kearney said he couldn’t understand why it was so poorly attended, particularly as the Turner Prize was such a success at the same location.Nerve Visual only took over a section of the Creative Hub Building   in  but during the City of Culture year in  the same gallery space hosted the prestigious Turner Prize - one of the best-known visual arts prizes in the world.Mr Kearney believes the location is “terric” and “exactly” what Ebrington needs. “The space is perfect for a gallery and the exhibitions that they had there were very impressive.“The Troubles Art exhibition, Future Artist Makers and the Colin Davidson one was stunning, I’d hesitate to say beautul given the nature of its subject, but it was incredibly powerful.“It’s the only gallery that’s open to the public in Derry that deals with mainstream, accessible, representational art. For this to close is really going to detract from the local art scene, from Ebrington, the Waterside and Derry as a whole. Like a pebble dropped in a pond, the ripple effect will spread out from that building to the outer ring of the entire city.”He added: “It’s such a shame, in six years it’s gone from hosting the most prestigious modern art competition in UK to a couple of empty rooms.“People can only have so many cups of coffee, tourists need something to do when visiting the city. If there was a gallery dedicated to Irish art with links to galleries in Dublin, the Ulster Museum, and maybe Britain. Tourists would definitely want to go there as galleries are the type of thing people look for.”‘Massive draw’Local artists were regularly showcased at the Nerve Visual gallery.Stephen Lewis has lived in Derry for over  years, he’s an artist based at Bishop Street Studios who also works with the arts charities Creative Village Arts and ArtLink at Fort Dunree. He expressed his “disappointment” at the gallery’s closure.“There have been recent initiatives by the Nerve Visual, Tower Museum and An Culturalann to give folk here a chance to see art that is held in their own national collections - but it simply goes back to the inability to keep a space that is equipped to do this open.“People in the North West should not have to travel to Belfast to see their own art - The Ulster Museum often has  or  art exhibitions on at any one time - we built a world class gallery in  and we really should demand that this becomes our space to see our own art collections - properly advertised it could be a massive draw for locals and tourists alike.\"It’s understood there will be plenty of people interested in taking over occupancy of the building but at this stage it is unclear what will be based there.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh"},{"url":null,"title":"vote hurdley hall shortlisted one 30","story":"Have you visited Hurdley Hall near Churchstoke  \" Vote for Hurdley HallHave you visited Hurdley Hall near Churchstoke  \" Vote for Hurdley HallVote for Hurdley Hall\" Vote for Hurdley HallThe view at Plas Dinam, near Llandinam.\" Vote for Hurdley HallCounty Times contact us filler\" Skip to next photo Show caption  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\" href\" my account emailthispage \""},{"url":null,"title":"magnificent moon monty cracking cornish sunset super images powys county times camera club members","story":"Moonshine over the Mpontgomery War Memorial from David Lister.\" Magnicent Moon over Monty and a cracking Cornish sunsetA Buff tailed bumbleebee on Cosmos from Lizzie Wood.\" Magnicent Moon over Monty and a cracking Cornish sunsetA frog in my wildle garden, says Lizzie Wood. \" Magnicent Moon over Monty and a cracking Cornish sunsetA beautul Cornish sunset as sent in by Paul Hanrahan.\" Magnicent Moon over Monty and a cracking Cornish sunsetA beautul Cornish sunset as sent in by Paul Hanrahan.\" Magnicent Moon over Monty and a cracking Cornish sunsetA duck along the canal from Robin Bridgen.\" Magnicent Moon over Monty and a cracking Cornish sunsetA dragonfly at Llandrindod Wells lakeside from Laura Shepherd.\" Magnicent Moon over Monty and a cracking Cornish sunsetA beautul Cornish sunset as sent in by Paul Hanrahan.\" Magnicent Moon over Monty and a cracking Cornish sunsetSunrise over Newtown from Robin Bridgen.\" Magnicent Moon over Monty and a cracking Cornish sunsetThe Royal Welsh may be gone, says Steven Derek, but this is still worth posting.\" Magnicent Moon over Monty and a cracking Cornish sunsetDferent birds, dferent wire says Toni Mannell with reference to her earlier ltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtposting.lt spangtlt spangt\" Magnicent Moon over Monty and a cracking Cornish sunsetMore fun with fungi on the Rainbow Walks near Llangadfan from Toni Mannell.\" Magnicent Moon over Monty and a cracking Cornish sunsetNot all Montgomery visitors are human - bugs enjoying our herb garden, says Daviltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtd Wilson.lt spangtlt spangt\" Magnicent Moon over Monty and a cracking Cornish sunsetCamera club\" Skip to next photo Show caption  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\" href\" my account emailthispage \""},{"url":null,"title":"elan show one best","story":"The championship in the terrier section went to Jason Davies of Pantydwr with Toltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtnic.

Competing in the competition for the first time, Andrew ploughed excellently over both days, winning a bronze medal on day one.With an aggregate score over the two days of competition used to crown the world champion, it was all to plough for on day two which focused on grassland.And Andrew was in good company with three former world champions making up the top five positions on the first day.He ploughed another fantastic plot to finish in fth place on day two, which placed him fourth overall, picking up the best newcomer award.Andrew said it has always been his dream to compete at the world contest.ldquoIt has been an unbelievable experience and I am so delighted to have won a medal.

The only dissenting voice came from the DUPrsquos Harry Harvey, who voted against.The DUP councillor took an alternative view on the perceived harmful effect that circus le has on animals.Cllr Harvey said: ldquoI wonrsquot be supporting this motion as circus animals are very well trained and well trained animals are generally happy and well looked after.Cllr Brown told the meeting that many animals travelling with circuses were ldquosubjected to constantly being moved around cramped temporary housing, forced training and performance, loud noises and intimidating crowds of people.He continued: ldquoTravelling circus le is likely to have a harmful effect on animal welfare as captive animals are unable to socialise, get enough exercise or exhibit natural behaviours.

I hope that it will be delivered as soon as possible, given the huge volume of traffic which passes through the centre of the town each day.Cllr Walker said a number of traffic surveys have been carried out over the years to determine the need for an upgraded crossing and is pleased that one is finally going to be delivered and will be paid for by the Department for Infrastructure.ldquoThe importance of this puffin crossing cannot be highlighted enough, he continued. ldquoThe new crossing will see the provision of Killyleaghrsquos first set of traffic lights which in itself is signicant.

But he conceded that theof -hour AE services may be dficult.Mr McGoran was invited to address the Down Community Health Committee and said it was important that the South Eastern Trust was having a conversation with campaigners who are keen to continue discussions with officials to ensure the retention of existing services and the delivery of enhanced provision moving forward.Over previous years, relations between both organisations was particularly fraught at times and while they did not always see eye to eye, Mr McGoran hopes they can now move forward together.He said he had ldquonothing but respect for the Down community because local people cared about their health and social care services, committing time and energy to make sure the area gets the best provision it can.ldquoThis is not always obvious everywhere in Northern Ireland, Mr McGoran continued. ldquoYou have been at this for a long time and I have no doubt that without your campaigning work we would not have some of the things we have in this organisation today. I am also not sure that we would have the Downe Hospital.ldquoYour contribution and those who went before you has been fundamental in keeping this area in the spotlight, fighting ultimately for your services. I take my hat off to you. The Downe is here to stay and we have a fantastic facility and there are no staff better. In fact, we have incredible staff who work right across the organisation.Mr McGoran said that while administrators and campaigners may not have always agreed in the past about how the health trust did things, he suggested they all had the same aim mdashwanting the best health and social care that could be delivered, sometimes within challenging resources.Looking to the future, the health chief referred to an ongoing review of emergency care which has resulted in the group overseeing the exercise visiting the Downe and meeting with senior health officials.ldquoI do envisage that there is going to be further change for emergency medicine but when I was asked the question what did I think about the future of the service at the Downe, Ulster and Lagan Valley hospitals in  yearsrsquo time, I could not really answer that, explained Mr McGoran.ldquoI was prepared to say what it would be like in five yearsrsquo time, but could not look beyond that. A five year vision is really something that you can get a hold of and we made it clear to those in charge of the review that the emergency care model we have in place at the Downe will be here in five yearsrsquo time.Mr McGoran said the health trust was on record with the Department of Health during the early stages of the current engagement that it still sees the current model at the Downe comprising the emergency department, out of hours GP service and weekend nurse-led minor injuries unit remaining in place.ldquoWe will still have acute beds in the Downe and it will deal with medically unwell patients. All of the current infrastructure we have will remain in place and our vision is to expect these to remain in place for the next five years, he confirmed.Mr McGoran said the one caveat was that it remained to be seen what the Department of Health will do with the information it has been provided with in relation to the future of emergency care, suggesting serious conversations about the way forward have only just begun.He added: ldquoThere is work ongoing and at some point there may be a consultation exercise. I do not know where all this is going to go and it is a bit early to speculate.Community Health Committee chairman Eamonn McGrady welcomed the health officialrsquos ldquoconstructive and honest engagement with campaigners.He said: ldquoWe need to go forward in a partnership, but that does not mean that we will always agree. Our community supports the Downe Hospital and also the centres of excellence in the bigger hospitals that our delivering our health needs.ldquoBut we need as much care as possible provided as locally as possible, safely and well adequately resourced in a brilliant building.Mr McGrady added: ldquoI hope that in five yearsrsquo time we will be looking at a very major extension at the Downe and a major increase in capacity.

This was foreseen in the design of St Johnrsquos Point lighthouse where there is excellent lantern sidewall and cowling ventilation in a tower  feet above the ground in this remote location. There is little hazard from the liquid mercury since it is not readily absorbed dermally.Campaigners have suggested that it would be interesting to see CILrsquos lighthouse keeper health monitoring records for mercury covering the past  years and more when the lighthouse was manned and used the present system. They also said it would be interestingto see the training records for keepers in safe mercury handling during all these years. ldquoPresumably, these would have been managed by independent bodies of experts since the Commissioners probably didnrsquot previously have and donrsquot today have any toxicological experts on your permanent payroll, says the campaigners letter.Another area of concern highlighted is the poor state of the lighthouse, including adjoining housing which a delegation from the Commissionerrsquos office recently visited.Campaigners point to the ldquolamentable state of the walls of the lighthouse station and the grounds, suggesting that they present a picture of ldquowoeful neglect and asking how CIL can expect the public to be impressed with a lack of basic asset maintenance.The letter highlights that the current Fresnel lens system turns  hours a day and is clearly visible from the road outside the lighthouse station.Campaigners say this in itself is a visual attraction during daylight hours ldquosince the magnicent large lens system is big enough to be seen turning on itrsquos mercury bearing and is even more magnicent at night.The letter continues: ldquoWe believe that CIL will miss a tremendous opportunity to preserve this lighthouse and its sweeping beamyou persist with your alternative bearing plans. The whole lighthouse station could become part of a wider tourist attraction in the area. Future generations will thank you for retaining the current historic beam system, still going smoothly after  years and showing no signs of obsolescence.

That was a matter for the Attorney General.”Meanwhile, Boris Johnson was today accused of abusing his power by speaking about Brexit as he stood in front of lines of new police recruits – one of whom became unwell and had to sit down while he spoke. The Prime Minister was condemned as having used the officers as an “inappropriate” backdrop as part of a “political stunt” when he made a speech which ended up referencing a possible general election and criticising Jeremy Corbyn.Around  officers had been standing behind his lectern, in front of an old-style police box, for at least  minutes before the speech at West Yorkshire Police’s operations and training complex in Wakefield began. and his brother and prime minister Boris Johnson.\"   and his brother and prime minister Boris Johnson.\"  Prime Ministers brother and business minister Jo Johnson resigns as M.P. citing unresolvable tension Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"The West Yorkshire Police and Crime CommissionerMark Burns-Williamson called for Mr Johnson to apologise.Mr Burns-Williamson told the Press Association: “To use police officers as the backdrop to what became a political speech was inappropriate and they shouldn’t have been put in that position.“It clearly turned into a rant about Brexit, the Opposition and a potential general election. There’s no way that police officers should’ve formed the backdrop to a speech of that nature.”AskedMr Johnson should apologise, he said: “Yes, because he’s used the pretence of an announcement around police recruitment for mainly a political speech.”Elsewhere, Conservative peer Lord Patten has warned that failing to get Brexit right risks people being killed in Northern Ireland. He was speaking as peers debated proposed legislation aimed at blocking a no-deal exit on October .The European Union Bill, which has already gone through the Commons, requires a delay to the UK’s departure beyond the current deadline date unless a orce settlement is approved or Parliament agrees to leaving the EU without one.Speaking during the Bill’s second reading, Lord Patten, who served as a Northern Ireland minister, said: “We know perfectly well that there is a dangerwe don’t get this right of people being killed. Not just businesses being destroyed, not just communities being devastated, but people dying.”try catch  TrendingNI man killed in road crash is namedTransfer Deadline Day RECAP: Rangers confirm

Image: BBC SpotlightAlthough it has long been known that Mr McGuinness was an IRA commander, he refused to discuss his actions in the organisation and insisted that he had never killed anyone.The images will be broadcast next Tuesday in the first part of one of BBC Northern Ireland’s most ambitious projects, a two-year re-examination of the Troubles which will run over seven programmes. .ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button The first programme in the series also includes a former colonel saying that he was shown evidence by the RUC that Ian Paisley, the future First Minister, had supplied the money for explosives which caused one of the first explosions of the Troubles.The rare footage of an IRA car bomb being assembled was filmed in Londonderry in the early years of the Troubles.During the programme, former IRA bomber Shane Paul O’Doherty commentated on the pictures, saying: “There’s a huge charge there. A very dangerous alarm clock timer that could blow them all to hell.”When asked who he recognised, he said: “Well, there’s Martin....Martin McGuinness.” Mr O’Doherty said he was certain that it was the future deputy First Minister, saying “nobody walks like him, with a stoop in his back”.The car containing the bomb could be identied by its number plate. The BBC programme includes footage of the bomb exploding  minutes later in the centre of Mr McGuinness’s home city, Londonderry.The day after the bombing, Northern Ireland Prime Minister Brian Faulkner was brought to London to be told that security powers would be removed from Stormont and taken on by Westminster, leading to the collapse of Stormont.The Spotlight programme also includes footage of Mr McGuinness showing guns to young children and handing them bullets while seated in a car.Commentating on the film pictures, Mr O’Doherty said: “It’s Martin McGuinness. Very young, tall, handling weapons – a rle and a revolver – rolling up to a load of kids who are staring in the windows, craning in the windows and showing them bullets.“It’s horric, really, because here was McGuinness showing eight, nine and -year-olds guns and bullets that were exciting. People had a feeling that you were on television, you know, you were superstars.”Police had evidence Ian Paisley paid for Troubles bombing, says ex-colonel Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"The programme does not explain the background to the footage. However, Spotlight reporter Darragh MacIntyre said that it would be made clear in a future film in the series.He said that it had been shot by an American documentary maker and was never broadcast.Mr McIntyre, the reporter who in  exposed the then DUP MP Iris Robinson’s affair and financial dealings with property developers, said that the  footage “speaks to a time when within Free Derry and where in the north there was a sense that the IRA had it won, that they were the original guerrilla fighters and within a matter of months would see their way to a new united Ireland...so they were quite free - not just Martin McGuinness - when they were filming with this documentary team”.In , Mr McGuinness told the journalist Eamonn Mallie that he was “very proud that I was a part of the IRA in Derry” but declined to say whether he had ever killed anyone.Last month, former IRA member Kieran Conway said that as the IRA’s chief of staff at the time of the attack which killed Lord Mountbatten and others, including two children, Mr McGuinness had to “take responsibility” for what had happened that day.Another former IRA man, Anthony McIntyre, said of that attack: “If they knew about the children, and were quite prepared to go ahead and to sacrice their lives in order to get Mountbatten, then it’s a war crime”.However, Sinn Féin MLA and former IRA man Raymond McCartney denounced such criticism of Mr McGuinness, saying that he was “held in the highest of esteem across Ireland and internationally”.The Foyle MLA said: “It is reprehensible that anyone would make unfounded allegations against a man who is no longer here to defend himself.”Spotlight on The Troubles – a Secret History involve two -minute programmes and five hour-long episodes. The series has been overseen by editor Jeremy Adams, deputy editor Gwyneth Jones and producer Chris Thornton. It involves three senior Spotlight reporters – Darragh MacIntyre, Jenner O’Leary and Mandy McAuley.The first programme will be broadcast on BBC One NI on Tuesday at .pm and will also be shown on BBC Four across the UK at the same time.try catch  TrendingNI man killed in road crash is namedTransfer Deadline Day RECAP: Rangers confirm pound.m Ryan Kent signing from Liverpool, Celtic sign three,

Ms Parker and Mr Glover met several years ago when he trained her at their local gym. They then ended up unexpectedly working together later in le when Mr Glover changed jobs.Mr Glover said: ldquoIt was very tough for Julie before the transplant as she suffered with a genetic lung disease and her lungs slowly stopped working over a few years.\"It got to the point where she required an oxygen tank to be strapped to her back so that she could breathe. She never gave up and still worked and tried to do as much as she could and always kept a smile on her face.Ms Parker has a rare condition called Alpha--antitrypsin deficiency which means she lacks a protective enzyme inhibitor which makes her more vulnerable to smoke, dust and other toxic materials and increases the risk of lung disease. Because of the deficiency, Ms Parker was required to have a double lung transplant. Shortly after the transplant Ms Parker went to lunch with Mr Glover and he was amazed at how well she looked.He said: ldquoBecause I was seeing her every day, I knew her health was declining as a result of the lung disease. But I donrsquot think I was so aware of the extent until I saw her after the operation, and how healthy she looked.This isnrsquot the first challenge Mr Glover has taken on.In the past he has carried lbs up and down the highest mountain in Southern Britain, completed car dead lts and successfully performed  pull ups.The pair now plan to walk Pen-Y-Fan, the highest mountain in South Wales, together to raise money in the future once Ms Parker is well enough.Mr Glover set out to raise pound, and has now raised pound.Officially, Mr Glover had only  days to train for this challenge, enlisting friends to help him by sitting in the car and steering as he tows.ldquoI was getting up at :am to run around car parks towing the car with a harness before work,\" he said. \"I love setting myself challenges but donrsquot tend to do what everyone  does. So I will look for something a bit far out or invent my own and usually try and document them on video.All the proceeds from the day will go towards the charityrsquos Harefield Transplant Appeal, to raise funds for organ care systems to allow more patients to receive le-saving transplants.If yoursquod like to support Mr Glover in his marathon challenge his Justgiving page is: https:www.justgiving fundraising muscleworld article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Two-year-old Matilda Philpott who has Stickler Syndrome was joined by her two brothers, Oliva and Alfie, four-year-old Alice Haswell who has Goldenhar Syndrome camped out with her sister Scarlet, and -year-old Daisy Stacey who has Vacterl Association attended with her sister Molly.The weekend saw the families take part in a range of activities from archery, crafts and pop rockets to laser shooting, fire lighting, bush craft and raft making.The camp was the first time the referred children have been on a Scout Camp, something leaders have been hoping to achieve since the start of the group.Ruth Weltch, Group Scout Leader said: ldquoThe opportunity to regularly set up camp in the great outdoors is one of the main reasons young people enjoy Scouting so much and we wanted to give our children, who would not normally have the opportunity, the chance to take part in a weekend of outdoor activities and to sleep under canvas with their families.ldquoWe have been overwhelmed and humbled by the amount of help offered by leaders, not just from Cardf and Vale Scouts but from other scouting areas in Wales.This reflects the scope of the hospice itself which is open to all children with le limiting illnesses throughout Wales.ldquoWe have been able to give these children the opportunity to take part in activities not usually accessible to them and that we take for granted. It was an absolute joy to see them and their families take part in the weekendrsquos activities, seeing them smile and forget about their worries for a while was heart-warming.Lynne Phelps, from Ty Hafan, said: ldquoThe hard work, time and effort put in by the Scout Group since its inception has been truly amazing. The group has brought so much happiness to the hospice and given the children referred to us an opportunity to take part in activities with their families that they wouldnrsquot have had access toit wasnrsquot for Scouts.ldquoThe group has had a really positive impact not just on the children in our care, but also their families and our staff. We really canrsquot thank the Ty Hafan Scout Group enough.The Ty Hafan Scout Group was set up on the Scouting Centenary in  for any child referred to the hospice along with their siblings, parents and family, to spend time together having fun and making memories.A growing need for sibling involvement was soon recognised and so the group began to run regular sibling camps.The sibling camps have given the young people who have brothers and sisters in the care of the hospice the opportunity to attend events such as Scarefest and the Jurassic International Jamboree, as well as the chance to spend quality family time with their loved ones.ScoutsCymru gives over , young people in Wales the opportunity to enjoy fun and adventure while developing the skills they need to succeed, now and in the future.Open to all young people in Wales regardless of faith, gender, sexual orientation, race or social background, the movement encourages its members to do more, learn more and be more. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

out how much it costs  ","story":"Do you want to complain about a neighbour#s high hedge  It#s going to cost you five times more in the Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon Council area.That’s £ - five times more than any other area in NI, says AllianceCllr Eóin Tennyson.Cllr Tennysonsays the Council must make it easier for people to deal with high hedges.He said: “As it stands, where mediation fails in dealing with concerns around high hedges – which can often be a real nuisance and source of frustration and stress for people affected – raising an official complaint in the ABC area costs up to five times more than other areas in NI.“Often people dealing with high hedge disputes have no choice but to make an official complaint, which is why it is dficult to comprehend why ABC Council insists on charging applicants £ – adding financial strain to an already stressful situation.“While the fee is ed to the applicantthe complaint is upheld, this is still a large outlay which can be prohibitive for residents seeking resolution to a problem that has often been lingering for some time.“The fee is set by Councils, so while in other areas like Derry and Strabane Council it costs £ to pursue a complaint, I must question why the fee is so excessive for people to access the same service in the ABC area.“That’s why we are not only calling for a review of the costs of high hedge complaints in ABC Council, but have urged officers to advance the development of a mediation toolkit or resource to help resolve a greater number of disputes at an earlier stage.”A Council spokesperson said: “The matter of high hedges was raised at this week’s Environmental Services Committee. It was agreed that a report, which would include how the fee was set within the framework of the council’s fee setting policy and the investigation process, would be brought to next month’s Environmental Services Committee.”Princess Charlotte arrives for first day of school - accompanied by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID

We speak to founder Daniel Crawford and his team about the journey so far A spark in the mind of Daniel Crawford as he studied for his masters degree in Glasgow just a few years ago has grown into a business at the sharp end of technology. axialD is tasked with turning the complicated and laborious process of converting D medical scans into D models – and producing them for use by surgeons and medical professionals. It’s an ever-growing business, spun out of Ulster University, which is expanding its reach across the UK, Ireland and now into the US where it’s targeting a burgeoning fresh marketplace. The company has been involved with Catalyst since , been directly involved with a host of its programmes, and is participating in the EU INTERREG funded North West Centre for Advanced Manufacturing , managed by the Special European Union Programmes Body . Catalyst is Northern Ireland’s leading technology hub, home to  companies and around , staff. Daniel has a strong team around him – growing to  staff based in Belfast city centre, including Niall Haslam, chief technology officer, Katie McKinley, head of new business and strategic partnerships and Cathy Coomber as operations manager. While studying medical visualisation and human anatomy in Glasgow, Daniel was exposed to the raft of imaging available – including CT, MRI and ultrasound, and began examining how the crucial data could be better used. The biomedical physics undergraduate grew the idea into his thesis – looking at converting D data sets and converting them into fully D printable files. “That allows us to turn images into D models to allow surgeons or registrars, to understand digital pathologies, before going in to theatre,” he said. “But we discovered it wasn’t just good for that and surgeons also wanted to get their hands on the D models.” That gave Daniel greater scope for developing the concept. In one early case, a surgeon was able to use one of the D prints to identy small fractures in a patient who had suffered a motorcycle crash, that weren’t initially apparent using more traditional methods. The company was thrust into Catalyst’s Springboard programme in  – a  week scheme which allowed a would-be entrepreneur, fresh out of university, access to business training and development, which included working with PathXL’s Stuart Harvey. From there, it was into the Halo programme – bringing axialD together with angel investors in order to get the start-up off the ground. It landed £, through Techstart and private investors, which allowed the company to get the ball rolling. Through Catalyst, Daniel also got the opportunity to visit MIT and the entrepreneurial development programme, Way to Scale, bringing axialD to Massachusetts and the Boston area – the global heart of the health technology sector. Niall Haslam is axialD’s chief technical officer. He said a Belfast and Boston partnership has helped strengthen the links between the cities, bringing firms from Northern Ireland to the US for both networking and scoping out the potential for setting up shop across the Atlantic. “The Way to Scale program brings entrepreneurs together. It’s a great networking opportunity,” Niall says. axialD is now a partner in the EU INTERREG-funded NW CAM, which brings together a network of research institutes, universities and enterprises to carry out research in advanced manufacturing. It is working with Ulster University on a number of projects, including looking at developing custom designed jigs for hospitals to produce D models. Cathy Coomber has been with axialD for three years. “What we have done in that time is looking at standardising the processes,” she says. “Biomedical engineers from Ulster University and those across the UK are producing data, manually segmenting thousands of medical images in order to help them develop an algorithm. “That allows us to massively improve our standardised process and reduce the time involved in producing those files.” That could mean reducing the time down from up to five hours, to as little as an hour. “When the company started, Daniel was able to get those early users excited in Glasgow, and then setting up in Belfast there were key surgeons which helped set the pace,” Katie McKinley, head of new business and strategic partnerships said. The company has since been involved with NHS frameworks as a means to help remove as many bottlenecks as possible. This involves developing and marketing the products to the NHS and HSC in the Republic – helping them to learn about the product, the process and what area of specialism it can be used in. “In the last  months with the development of the algorithms, we are moving in to the US,” Katie said. “We’re seeing a lot of growth in the US.” And the axialD team is also growing fast. “We have  staff at the moment but are looking to expand in  months,” Daniel said. “That includes new staff in the US to help grow and manage that market as we further expand our software team back home.” The success of axialD mirrors the overall success of Catalyst, since its inception  years ago. It’s an independent not-for-profit organisation across its four sites – including its largest base at the Titanic Quarter in Belfast, alongside its Londonderry hub, Ballymena, along with the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub at Danske Bank in Belfast city centre.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/jm_1.jpg","title":"how do you retain staff and keep them enjoying their job","story":"Posted on Wednesday September  by Ulster Business With such intense competition for talent, the challenge for employers isn’t just finding prospective candidates, it’s also keeping them, writes John Moore, managing director of Hays NI Astonishingly, almost half of professionals surveyed in the Hays What Workers Want Report said that they left at least one new job within the first  months because it didn’t match expectations formed during the application process. A signicant number of our employees at Hays have been with us for , ,  and even  years, and we pride ourselves on growing our own talent and promoting from within. Although there are times when employees leave due to circumstances employers can’t control, organisations can create the right conditions to retain their staff for as long as possible. We believe there are three key areas. A sense of purpose Across ages, cultures and sectors, professionals need to get up in the morning knowing that they can make a dference. No matter how big or small, recognising a clear and meaningful purpose in your role is a huge driver for staff. Communication is key for employers. By prioritising employee progression, offering regular feedback and communicating the wider objectives of the business, employers can ensure their staff come to work each day with a strong purpose. Variety each day While not every task can be exciting, and some parts of a job will inevitably be more stimulating than others,the mundane becomes the usual, employees will think about moving on. Injecting iety into each week and staying interested at work partly falls on employees themselves, who can proactively seize opportunities. But a good employer should also push their staff and encourage them to work outside of their comfort zones. This ensures professionals can keep growing and developing within an organisation rather than move where. A strong network The people we work with have a huge bearing on our happiness levels at work. You simply can’t stay in a role long-termyou don’t enjoy working with those around you, so the importance and impact of these relationships are not to be underrated. Employers can help their staff develop a network of inspiring and admirable colleagues from their first day by making sure they receive proper introductions and support contacts. Workers who have these strong bonds feel a greater sense of belonging which keeps them wanting to work in their organisation. With these three points in mind, it’s important to consider how someone’s organisation and role makes them feel, rather than just how impactful their salary or bonus might be. After all, this is what can’t easily be replicated across organisations and can keep an employee with an organisation throughout their career.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"new  bedroom boutique hotel planned for belfast","story":"Posted on Wednesday September  by John Mulgrew A listed Belfast building could become a new hotel and restaurant as part of wider plans for a £m revamp of the city centre. Tribeca Belfast, formerly Royal Exchange, will see UK developer Castlebrooke redevelop much of the north side of the city centre. It’s made a number of amendments and changes to the development, most notably revising back from a formerly retail-led scheme to one with fewer shops. As part of the revised plans it wants to turn the listed former Assembly Rooms building at the corner of North Street and Waring Street into a new -bedroom hotel, with a restaurant and bars. That would involve knocking down part of the newer extension to the building, including the rear part of the former Northern Bank and the adjacent - North Street to “accommodate the new extension to form the proposed boutique hotel”. “The proposals for the existing building are similar in scope to that which was included as part of the extant approval. It is proposed to conservatively repair the existing historic fabric of the former Northern Bank,” a design statement says. “A key feature of the proposed extension is that the interface with the rearelevation of the existing listed bank building will be improved by setting back the footprint of the proposed extension so that the north west corner of the original building is readable.” The scheme includes the re-use and adaptation of the existing building as well as an extension on the footprint of the existing s extension on North Street. The extension will be set over five floors, with a rooftop bar, while upper floors are set back with metal cladding to the facades to “reduce the overall massing of the building and reflect the roofing materials or upper story treatment of surrounding buildings”. Tribeca Belfast includes development around Royal Avenue, Donegall Street, North Street, Garfield Street and High Street. Castlebrooke Investments says it is now committed to bringing North Street Arcade back into use in a new format, with space designed for independent retailers. This summer the developer ran a fresh public consultation amid revised plans for the scheme, which included signicantly reducing a huge -storey building to around , retaining additional facades and dropping plans for an underground car park.

Before starting as a trainee solicitor in a City of London firm, I initially worked as a paralegal for three months in a law firm in Perth, enjoying the lestyle and dferent culture of le in Australia, and then spent a further three months travelling in Australia, New Zealand and Asia. After ing to London, I qualied as a solicitor and then spent eight years working in the real estate department of a London law firm. With two young children, we decided to move back to Northern Ireland in  when I joined Cleaver Fulton Rankin as an assistant solicitor. I have been here ever since and was made a director in . What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  As we will all be aware, the real estate market can be a bit of a rollercoaster. Having been involved in some fantastic deals here in Northern Ireland, largely courtesy of the peace idend, this all came crashing to a halt in . For real estate lawyers in particular, this presented a fresh challenge in terms of expanding client base and ensuring that our teams were kept busy. For a number of years I spent more time advising clients on restructuring, acting for administrators or receivers in selling off assets and working on refinancing transactions. This proved to be a huge contrast to the positive and very visible growth in the economy seen in the previous years. Thankfully, the real estate sector again currently seems to be enjoying good growth with high rates offor investors. However, it has to be said that the lack of political leadership here does still give cause for concern. How would you describe your management style  The most important resource that we have is our young people, so I hopefully lead by example and seek to encourage them. In my view the carrot is always better than the stick. What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I have spent over  years now practising law, butI could go back to university again, rather than doing a law degree, I would have studied history. It would have meant an extra year spent in training, but I think it may have kept my interest slightly more than lectures on tort and equity. Have you done it all on your own  No, absolutely not. One of the main reasons for coming back to Northern Ireland was, with a young family, we had the benefit here of family support. My parents in particular, played a key role in helping with child care at a time when I was trying to establish my career. I never underestimate the dficulties facing working parents with young children who deserve all the credit and support that they can get. A strong support network is also very important in the office and I am lucky to have the benefit of some great lawyers around me to whom I can turn to for help when needed. How would you like your business to be remembered  As a leading commercial law firm in Northern Ireland that is independent and innovative provides high quality legal advice to its clients conducts business in a socially responsible and ethical matter has a strong commercial awareness and specialist legal professionals. What piece of advice would you give to a -year-old you  Believe in yourself, be flexible and above all when opportunities present themselves to you, grab them.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
