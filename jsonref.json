Here, Beth Hale reveals the stories behind some of the iconic frocks on show.The creation fit for a princess   She called it her ‘favourite dress of all’.And in the flesh, the fabulous fairytale gown Princess Margaret wore to mark her 21st birthday — both her birthday party in August 1951 and portraits — is indeed a dress of dreams.While the diaphanous skirt is not quite as voluminous as photographs suggest and the colour an off-white rather than the lighter, brighter colour of the famous Cecil Beaton photographs, the dress is the kind of flouncing, bare-shouldered perfection that little girls imagine when they dream of princesses (although Margaret’s father George VI was rumoured to have disapproved of it).          Royal Portrait of Princess Margaret on her 21st birthday by Cecil Beaton in a dress designed by Christian Dior, part of the Christian Dior: Designer of Dreams exhibition at the London attraction which runs from February 2 to 14 JulyThe differences are not due to any deterioration in fabric, but rather that the colour version of the portrait was actually painted.Even in the Fifties photographers were not averse to a little creative license.With a waist of miniature proportions (no measurement is provided, but it has to be less than 20 inches), the gown shows quite how petite the princess was.Dr Luke says Lady Gaga accused him of rape to win an Oscar...JANET STREET-PORTER: Sorry, Piers but I\u0027m with Will Young -...Could the queen of clean turn me into a domestic god?: MARK...Share this articleMargaret’s son, Lord Snowdon, was at the V\u0026ampA gala dinner to celebrate the exhibition and gave a toast, recalling how surprised he was to find his mother’s dress in the show. He said: ‘I had never seen it before and couldn’t believe that it has survived all these years and been conserved.‘Interestingly, the Cecil Beaton photograph of her shows the dress looking white when in reality it is between cream and beige. It was moving to see the dress that she wore all those years ago with its tiny waist and extraordinary lines, typical of Dior who made such a genius contribution to fashion.’          Princess Diana arrives at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. Diana was attending the Museum\u0027s 1996 Costume Insitute gala, a tribute to the achievements of designer Christian DiorLord Snowdon, whose wife Serena was dressed in Dior, added: ‘This is an important exhibition for Britain, with an Anglophile designer who showed such elegance and eloquence in fashion design.’Dior admired Princess Margaret’s style, describing her as ‘so very charming’.‘She was a real fairy princess, delicate, graceful, exquisite,’ he would later write. In 1957, Dior presented the princess with a signed silk scarf in appreciation of her support, while she was a loyal customer for years.Gown almost too daring for Diana It was 1996 and Princess Diana walked into the biggest event on the fashion industry calendar in a dress that was at once ravishing and racy.So racy, in fact, Diana very nearly didn’t wear the dress to New York’s Met Gala for fear Prince William, then 14, wouldn’t like it being so revealing.Brit John Galliano had just been appointed creative director at the fashion house, and designed the dress for Diana before turning his mind to his first collection.A navy silk slip dress, with lace straps and edging, it had more than a hint of the boudoir about it and was a bold choice from Diana, who was then 35.She stopped the fashion crowd dead in their tracks, Liz Tilberis, editor of Harper’s Bazaar, would later write.A statement look for every star  From Margot Fonteyn to Jennifer Lawrence and Emma Watson, the house of Dior has dressed stars in abundance.At the start they were drawn to the designer’s famed Bar suit — part of his 1947 ‘Corolle’ collection. Crafted from shantung silk, crepe wool and taffeta, it has become one of the brand’s most iconic pieces.  Dior’s successors have continued to dress the brightest stars, including Natalie Portman in Hollywood last year (left) and Nicole Kidman in a beaded gown at Cannes (right)Ballet dancer Dame Margot Fonteyn was one of Christian Dior’s early muses and the exhibition features two dresses she wore, including a 1950 evening gown named ‘Debussy’, made of silk satin with hundreds of dragonfly sequins.Dior’s successors have continued to dress the brightest stars, including Natalie Portman in Hollywood last year.           Naomi Campbell pictured in Dior in 1997There’s also the silk confection Jennifer Lawrence wore to a film premiere in September 2017, a beaded gown worn by Nicole Kidman in Cannes  — and many more.Fashion firebrands who kept his name alive   A string of illustrious names followed in Dior’s footsteps.First came a 21-year-old Yves Saint Laurent, whose early designs were so strikingly similar to his illustrious predecessor that when he sent them to French Elle magazine, the then editor thought it was Dior playing tricks.Next came Marc Bohan — he assumed the helm until 1989.Italian Gianfranco Ferré became the first non-French artistic director, until 1996 when controversial Brit John Galliano took over — supermodel Naomi Campbell is pictured in one of his typically flamboyant designs in 1997.His reign came to a rather ignominious end when he was sacked in 2011, paving the way for Raf Simons and finally Maria Grazia Chiuri, the second Italian and first woman, appointed in July 2016.Anglophile and his blue-blooded fans   Christian Dior first visited the UK in 1926 and was something of an Anglophile. He admired the grandeur of Britain’s great stately homes and gardens, as well as British-designed ocean liners, roast beef and Savile Row suits.Dior’s chic little black suits of the 1940s and 1950s were beloved by the British aristocracy, and muses Nancy Mitford and Margot Fonteyn both ordered his 1947 ‘Daisy’ suit.Mitford wrote to her sister Diana Mosley later that year, of Dior’s second collection: ‘Now I’m nearly 50 I’ve decided to choose a style and stick to it and I choose Dior’s present collection. Simply, to my mind, perfect.’          Christian Dior (left) became an Anglophile after visiting Britain in 1926 and his suits were beloved by the British aristocracy           Charlize Theron has been the face of J\u0027Adore by Dior since 2004‘I adore the English,’ Dior wrote in his memoir.‘I love English traditions, English politeness, English architecture, I even love English cooking!\u0027I dote on Yorkshire pudding, mince pies, stuffed chicken, and above all I worship the English breakfast of tea, porridge, eggs and bacon.’Sweet smell of success    A clever marketer, Christian Dior was a fashion pioneer in more than one respect: he launched a perfume line in 1947, the very same year of his first collection.He very quickly created lipsticks, introduced hats, shoes and even stockings — wanting to provide a ‘one-stop’ service for his well-heeled clients.Latterly, Dior’s perfumes have had a gold theme.In 1999, the fashion house launched J’Adore, a perfume celebrating Christian Dior’s love of glimmering gold.Since 2004, the face of J’Adore has been actress Charlize Theron.The Hollywood beauty has appeared on screen and in print in a series of ever-more dazzling gold gowns, several of which are on display at the V\u0026ampA.They include fashion designer John Galliano’s J’Adore dress from 2008, which was adorned with sequins and Swarovski crystals.Meghan and Harry brave the cold to greet young royal fans in BristolThe Radical Story of Patty Hearst debuts in the UKMeghan stuns in an all black outfit as she arrives at City University\u0027I was broken\u0027: Stephanie Davis admits she attempted suicideMeghan Markle arrives at The ACU with her hair up in a bunDuchess of Sussex leaves National Theatre after official engagementMeghan Markle arrives at the National Theatre for royal patron debutWoman shows how to fold clothes using the KonMari methodChildren perform for The Duchess of Sussex at the National TheatreDuchess of Sussex waves to fans during visit to City Uni LondonMeghan is pretty in peach as she visits the National TheatreKate Middleton makes a speech and officially opens V\u0026ampA Dundee museum"},{"url":null,"title":"How weeks dithering bricks use helped push cost new EastEnders set","story":"    The Carter family outside the Queen Vic pub.

It was the right thing to do.’The bricks must be tinted, moss must be applied, and the peeling paint outside the Queen Vic pub will be recreated to mimic the current set.The soap’s existing set was built in 1984 using steel frames, plywood and plaster brick panels with the intention that it would be used for two years.

It has been reported that one of the new locations will be a mosqueThe poor quality of the Elstree Studios set means high-definition filming is not possible and health and safety concerns can lead to filming delays.Meanwhile, BBC director-general Lord Hall admitted yesterday that the broadcaster forced some of its stars to be paid via ‘personal service companies’ (PSC), leaving them without sick pay or maternity benefits and now facing large tax bills.He said the Corporation accepts ‘full responsibility’ for ‘pushing’ people into the controversial arrangements as a pre-requisite of pursuing careers as presenters.The arrangement saved the Corporation millions in National Insurance payments, and looked like it would help presenters reduce their own tax bills.But it has dramatically backfired after HM Revenue and Customs later ordered some of the stars to pay back-dated tax.One anonymous presenter was told not to come back from maternity leave unless it was under the new employment arrangement.Last year, BBC Radio 4 presenter Kirsty Lang revealed to a Parliamentary committee that she even had to work throughout her cancer treatment because the Corporation would not give her sick pay.Yesterday, Labour MP Caroline Flint said that BBC stars were effectively told, ‘if you want a career in presenting, you are going to have to move onto a PSC. There is no other choice.‘If you want to be a shining star at the BBC, you are going to have to follow this course of action.’Asked whether he accepted this, Lord Hall said: ‘Yes I acknowledge that. People were pushed into these things. We’re saying that we’ve accepted responsibility. That’s full responsibility.’The BBC previously stood by a 2012 report published by Deloitte, which found ‘no evidence of any pressure to move staff to the PSC arrangements’.But yesterday Lord Hall and his deputy director-general, Anne Bulford, accepted that there was pressure regardless.Lord Hall said: ‘Going back and trying to find records of how these PSCs were set up and people’s correspondence with the BBC about them - we can’t find any record which point to one way or the other.‘But the evidence from people I’ve talked to is... that they were asked to take up PSCs’."},{"url":null,"title":"Dirty Duchess Argyll subject TV drama","story":"    Margaret Campbell, the Duchess of Argyll, is pictured outside the law courts in London in 1960 during what became a famous orce caseA British aristocrat known as the \u0027Dirty Duchess\u0027 of Argyll - whose husband accused her of sleeping with up to 88 men including government ministers and royals - will be the subject of a TV drama. The mini-series about Margaret Campbell, whose sex scandal made headlines in 1963, will be a spin-off of the BBC\u0027s award-winning A Very English Scandal. The Duchess\u0027s orce ignited public speculation when a list emerged of more than 80 men she had reportedly slept with, said to include two ministers and three members of the royal family. Executive producer Dominic Treadwell-Collins said the scandal made her the first woman to be publicly \u0027slut shamed\u0027.  Granting the orce, presiding judge Lord Wheatley said she \u0027was a completely promiscuous woman whose sexual appetite could only be satisfied with a number of men\u0027.The Duchess was the third wife of Ian Campbell, the 11th Duke of Argyll, whose family owned Inveraray Castle in western Scotland. Born Margaret Whigham, she married wealthy American golfer Charles Sweeny in 1933, having three children with him. Sorry ladies, the nation has voted for its greatest icons of...Great British Bake Off star Nadiya opens up about her...Share this articleAfter orcing him in 1947 she married the Duke in 1951 but the marriage fell apart after her suspicious husband hired a locksmith to break open a cupboard at her house in Mayfair. The search allegedly uncovered love letters and polaroid photos of her engaging in sexual acts with her various partners.           First marriage: The Duchess of Argyll on her wedding day after marrying wealthy American golfer Charles Sweeny in 1933           Second marriage: Margaret on the day she became Duchess of Argyll, after marrying Ian Campbell, the 11th Duke of Argyll, at Caxton Hall in London in March 1951  Margaret Campbell is pictured left at Inveraray Castle in Scotland in 1953 and right at a party in 1961.

If after 90 days no progress is made, the governments will consider setting stronger economic sanctions against Maduro.     "},{"url":null,"title":"Commons leader Andrea Leadsom backs Mails Great British Spring Clean campaign","story":"    Commons leader Andrea Leadsom, pictured on a litter pick, has thrown her support behind the Daily Mail\u0027s Great British Spring CleanThe leader of the House of Commons yesterday urged politicians and constituents alike to don their high-vis jackets and take part in the Great British Spring Clean.Praising the Mail’s campaign as she addressed the Commons chamber, Andrea Leadsom said litter is a ‘huge concern to all of us’ and encouraged a parliamentary debate for MPs to air their views on rubbish blighting their areas.In partnership with Keep Britain Tidy, the Daily Mail is hoping to enlist half-a-million volunteers to help pick litter between March 22 and April 23.A remarkable 24,062 people have already pledged to offer their time to help clean up their communities in the six days since the Great British Spring Clean was launched.The campaign, which aims to be the biggest environmental event of the year, has already been backed by Theresa May, Jeremy Corbyn, Sir David Attenborough, Prince William and the United Nations.Yesterday, the National Trust, the country’s biggest conservation charity with five million members, threw its weight behind the Daily Mail and Keep Britain Tidy campaign, alongside environmental group Greenpeace.Dying in a sea of litter: Shocking study reveals every one...How the litter YOU pick up could become a swimsuit... or...Share this article    ‘Litter is a huge concern to all of us and certainly it is a function of the improper use of packaging.’ Mrs Leadsom’s hearty support for the Great British Spring Clean came as Labour MP Mary Creagh, chairman of the Commons environmental audit committee, also offered glowing praise.She said yesterday: ‘With 700,000 plastic bottles littered every day we need an army of volunteers to turn back the plastic tide.                                                                                         To sign up to the campaign visit gbspringclean.org                                                    \u0027I congratulate the Daily Mail on its Great British Spring Clean.

But of the 5.5million people in this age group, just 1.5million – about a third of those eligible – actually take them.Professor Baigent said: ‘If the 4million who are currently not taking statins started taking statins we might prevent 8,000 deaths a year.’The academic said a number of misleading studies – which he branded ‘fake news’ – had created confusion over the effectiveness and side-effects of statins among doctors and patients.Jacob Rees-Mogg says no-deal Brexit would NOT lead to a hard...Boris Johnson\u0027s £3m former marital home is up for rent for...Share this articleMuch of the row over the drugs has stemmed from the uneasiness doctors feel at the ‘medicalisation’ of otherwise healthy people.But Professor Baigent said the new study, which combines the results of 28 trials involving 187,000 people, should put that debate to bed. He said it showed that even those who are healthy could avoid a potentially deadly attack if they took the drugs, which cost just a few pence a day.The research, published in the Lancet and part-funded by the research arm of the NHS, showed that the benefits of statins were just as effective among the elderly as in younger groups.Findings revealed that for every 10,000 Britons aged 78 who take statins, but have no history of cardiovascular problems, 80 heart attacks or strokes would be prevented every year. For those of the same age who already suffer heart disease, the benefits will be even greater – with 160 heart attacks and strokes prevented a year per 10,000 people.          Much of the row over the drugs has stemmed from the uneasiness doctors feel at the ‘medicalisation’ of otherwise healthy people (stock image)Professor Baigent said prejudice against older people – the idea that there is no point treating them – also played a role in under-using statins. ‘Society is ageist,’ he said. ‘There is an attitude to the elderly that we are all working to try and counter.’Cardiovascular disease kills about 150,000 people a year – more than two thirds of which are aged over 75. ‘So there is potential, since those people simply because of their age are at higher risk of cardiovascular disease, to offer statin therapy to a larger number of people who are elderly,’ said the professor.Professor Naveed Sattar, of the University of Glasgow, said the results were ‘convincing’ despite the ‘many doubters on the benefits of statins’. Professor Martin Marshall, of the Royal College of GPs, added: ‘It’s particularly reassuring to see evidence of benefit in patients over the age of 75 – the age group most likely to need cholesterol medication.’Professor Sir Nilesh Samani, of the British Heart Foundation, added: ‘Age should not be a barrier to prescribing these potentially life-saving drugs to people who are likely to benefit.’ "},{"url":null,"title":"Venezuela plans fly central bank gold reserves UAE source","story":"    Nicolas Maduro is planning to sell a total of 29 tons of Venezuelan gold to the UAE, with the first 15-tonne shipment worth $640million due to leave in the coming days, sources say          Maduro will then use the resulting cash to buy basic supplies as it struggles to feed its population (pictured, people hunt through rubbish in Caracas on Thursday)          Venezuela\u0027s economy has fallen apart under Maduro\u0027s leadership, thanks to dwindling oil production and a fall in the price of crude          News of a fresh gold sell-off come days after a Russian Nordwind plane was seen leaving Caracas with a reported 20 tonnes of gold on boardKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: \u0027We have not received any messages yet.

We didn\u0027t know what was going on.\u0027Another driver, stuck in his car on the A690, added: \u0027I have been here about an hour and a half at this particular section, there\u0027s just cars slipping and sliding everywhere.\u0027People are out of their cars pushing, that sort of stuff. Gritters are stuck, they can\u0027t get through the traffic. There\u0027s no hard shoulder for anyone to pop off so they\u0027re just stuck in the traffic like everybody else.          Traffic at a standstill on the A690 \u0027It just came down really hard and fast and we had that big cumulonimbus cloud with all the thunder and the snow, it\u0027s just made the road white.\u0027Snowy conditions also led to a car overturning on the A19 north bound near Testos roundabout in South Tyneside.Traffic was brought to a standstill and was backed up towards Boldon.A driver in West Boldon said: \u0027It\u0027s chaos. It all started about 9 o\u0027clock this morning when we had that thunder and lightning with the hail stones.          Heavy snow leads to the closure of the A690 eastbound lane this morning\u0027All of the roads have just become like sheet glass. The gritters seriously need to get on these roads and get them sorted, it\u0027s ridiculous.\u0027West Boldon is absolutely gridlocked because there\u0027s buses just sliding all over the road on the hills and trucks.\u0027There\u0027s absolutely nothing moving in West Boldon.\u0027Elsewhere, the winter weather also caused problems on the A1 southbound near the J62, with drivers getting stuck in long queues.                                                     Spirits were said to be \u0027incredibly high\u0027 among the guests, who included around a dozen children and an eight-month-old baby.The pub\u0027s seven staff, including two chefs, were pulling out the stops to make sure all were comfortable - although they were \u0027in for a long one,\u0027 Ms Wheeler said.\u0027Credit to my staff - a shout-out goes to all of them,\u0027 she added.The area is under a yellow weather warning of snow and ice until this afternoon and efforts continued through the night to clear the A30 and get people moving again.Speaking at 7.30am this morning Mr Dyre said some travellers had already left to walk back to their cars and that from the Inn they could see traffic on the A30 was moving again.The pub had only 10 of its 36 rooms booked for last night before the snow fell but by the early hours of yesterday there were between 120 and 150 people crammed in every available space.Assistant manager Charlotte Barron said: \u0027All 36 rooms were full, we set up 15 makeshift beds in the restaurant, five in the lounge as well as blankets and duvets on the floor.\u0027It was actually a lovely atmosphere - we brought out all our board games and complete strangers were playing against each other.\u0027A lot of people made friends - probably for life - with one room being occupied by five people who didn\u0027t know each other.\u0027Those taking shelter included about a dozen children, an eight-month-old baby and \u0027two dogs and their four humans\u0027.Ms Barron added: \u0027There were still people arriving at 5am - the furthest one person walked was eight miles to get here.\u0027Her selflessness was shared by seven of her colleagues - manager Ms Wheeler and staff Ashely Brown, June Parker, April Dawe, Tina Wright, David Bailey and Joe Pearson.She said: \u0027There were only two people in the kitchen who cooked all night - they were making people steak and ale pie, fish and chips - the usual pub grub. \u0027Then we started the breakfast menu at 3am as we were starting to get a little short of food.\u0027The chef has been making anything he can find for the lunch menu. We are praying for a delivery but aren\u0027t holding out much hope of one getting through.\u0027Like her colleagues, Ms Barron pitched in all night, making beds, allocating blankets, pot washing, and working behind the bar and in the kitchen.She said most drivers had started to leave by 8am to go back to their vehicles to allow gritters to make their way along the A30.The Jamaica Inn\u0027s maintenance team was transporting motorists to their cars in the pub\u0027s 4x4 as well as shovelling ice from the nearby road.Katie Smith, 26, assistant manager at the Jamaica Inn, said: \u0027At about 4pm yesterday we had the first flurry of people coming in to say the weather had turned on the A30 and it was quite dangerous. \u0027From then on they just kept coming, we had about 150 in the end. We pulled out a lot of the spare beds and mattresses to try and accommodate everyone, we had them everywhere.\u0027One of our chefs stayed and cooked all night, and the bar staff kept the bar open. We didn\u0027t charge them, we did it to be part of the community.\u0027We had a call from a lady who was stuck down the road with a two-year-old boy with a heart condition, some of our staff went down to find them and helped them back to the pub and they stayed all night.\u0027They were absolutely fine and got back on the road this morning. It seems to be a lot better now, the roads are moving and people are leaving and getting on the way.\u0027People couldn\u0027t thank us enough, everyone is leaving said how amazing the staff have been. I couldn\u0027t be more proud of my staff if I tried. It\u0027s a mass cleanup operation now, we have guests booked for tonight so we\u0027ve got to get ready again.\u0027          Makeshift beds beds laid out last night at Jamaica Inn, made famous by Daphne du Maurier in her classic novel, on Bodmin Moor for motorists who are stuck on the A30 due to snow          The view from the Jamaica Inn pub on Bodmin Moor last night as it laid out makeshift bedsHundreds of cars were stuck on the A30 last night for up to ten hours while travelling in the wintry weather which caused chaos across the country.A white out yesterday afternoon stopped cars in their tracks at Temple as thick snow settled up to 3ft high and drivers were forced to abandon their cars.As darkness fell last night drivers were still stuck, some behind a jackknifed lorry, with no idea as to how or when they would make it home from work.Highways England were urged to help stranded motorists, including those stuck with young children as drivers reported the roads were \u0027like an ice rink\u0027 on the A30 which runs between London and Honiton in east Devon. Highways England confirmed a plough and a gritter had been sent to assist the stranded motorists - some of whom have got out of their cars and started a snowball fight.But after hours on the roads many became concerned elderly relatives would spend the night there.Cornwall Council said there was an \u0027intensive effort\u0027 to clear the roads while relatives of the stranded urged authorities to act faster, including those with elderly parents on the roads.    The Jamaica Inn on the A30 last night has laid out mattresses on the floor for stranded drivers Driver Dominic Burton said about 200 vehicles were trapped on the southbound carriage of the A30 near Okehampton in \u0027doomsday\u0027 scenes.People are being warned against travel in the morning on uncleared routes. Some were still on the roads at 11pm, having been there since the mid afternoon.Desperate drivers urged police to send advice over whether or not they should keep their engines on while a pub named the Jamaica Inn laid out mattresses on the floor for stranded motorists.Lee Flagg wrote on Twitter: \u0027My sister has been sat on the A30 for 5 hours. 2 young children in the car with no food, milk etc. Can anyone actually give an update that means anything??\u0027Another man added: \u0027What advice do you have for people who look likely to be spending the night on the A30.\u0027How to keep warm? Should they keep the engine running? How long will that last for? How can they get water? Saying \u0027we\u0027re working as hard as we can\u0027 is great, but need a bit more.\u0027Kind drivers on the A30 with four wheel drive cars began to tow others to get up a hill, around 8pm yesterday evening. Drivers described the response as a \u0027shambles\u0027.   Dominic Burton, 26, was trapped with more than 20 other cars on the A30 at Okehampton One driver said on Twitter: \u0027Ground to a halt at 2.30pm and it\u0027s now 8.20pm and have moved two miles. No snowploughs, no gritters, no police support, it\u0027s a shambles.\u0027The head of roads policing in Devon and Dorset, Chief Inspector Adrian Leisk, said: \u0027The snow is heading eastwards and will cause significant disruption tonight. Please be prepared and avoid all but absolutely essential travel.\u0027He warned people to stay with their vehicles and to check before making a journey. Concerned car owners said they had only moved a few miles in hours.Dominic Burton, 26, was been stuck on the A30 from 4.30pm until 11pm after a lorry jackknifed at the top of a hill on the road at Okehampton.Mr Burton from Barnstaple left work early at 4.30pm in a bid to try and get home before the worst of the snow fell.But hours later after the lorry got stuck the snow has built up around cars, trapping them. Rescue workers were bringing in snow chains to move the lorry last night.There were hazardous driving conditions reported across Cornwall with multiple accidents.Police said people were abandoning their cars on the A30 at Highgate Hill and walking through the snow.     Cars were being abandoned by drivers who could not continue their journey onwards Devon and Cornwall Police urged people to stay in their cars to keep warm.At around 8.15pm yesterday, the force tweeted: \u0027We have further reports of vehicles stuck on the A39 in Cornwall due to snow.\u0027Please stay with your vehicle and keep as warm as possible. Gritter trucks are working their way inwards from Winnards Perch and Wadebridge to get to stranded drivers.\u0027Mr Burton told MailOnline: \u0027I have travelled around nine miles since I left work but we are stuck now. It\u0027s really not a nice place to be right now.\u0027The lorry has jackknifed at the top of the hill and there\u0027s a recovery truck there – but the snow has been building up around us while we have been sat here. I\u0027ve tried to move and I can\u0027t.\u0027There\u0027s about 25 of us – pretty much everyone is just trying to get home from work. I\u0027ve got another hour and a half to drive – but that\u0027s in normal conditions.\u0027Mr Burton, who started a new job yesterday, has seen gritters travelling southbound but nothing on the northbound carriageway.One person wrote on Twitter: \u0027Have moved only 100 yards in two hours! It\u0027s now 5.38pm and no end in sight of this situation. Oh, and it\u0027s still snowing!\u0027           Cars stranded on the A30 with dozens being stuck behind a jackknifed lorry at Okehampton Some were stuck for hours in snow on Bodmin Moor.Paul Newman said when he reached the A30 at Carland Cross heading eastbound the snow started to fall \u0027very, very heavily\u0027 and the traffic started to move slowly until it came to a standstill near Blissland.\u0027We believe the stoppage is somewhere near Kennards Cross. There is a lorry across the road. Now that everybody has stopped it is going to be difficult for lorries to get going again,\u0027 he said.\u0027At the moment we\u0027ve no idea what\u0027s going on really... the chap in the car in front of us was just throwing snowballs to his dog!\u0027A couple stuck in their car on the dual carriageway after a sudden dump of snow fear they face a cold night in their vehicle.Jak Roome was travelling to Wadebridge, Cornwall, to celebrate his 29th birthday with his partner, Jack Slymm, 27, when the roads ahead ground to a halt.Mr Slymm said that 3ft of snow fell quickly and the road beneath froze, making it impossible to tackle the hill in front.He said that many cars had attempted to brave the conditions but kept sliding back, and official advice online urged drivers on the road to stay in their cars.           Cars and lorries had come to a complete standstill along the A30 yesterday evening           Highways England teams were mobilised while others reported being stuck at Bodmin MoorMr Slymm, a hair stylist from Bristol, said: \u0027We\u0027re currently about five miles north of Camelford and about 10 miles south of Bude on A39.\u0027We haven\u0027t moved for over three hours, the snow just came down really hard and really quick and the ground froze underneath it.\u0027The snow at the side of the road is about 3ft deep and anyone trying to get anywhere is just sliding. One gritter just came past and it didn\u0027t make the slightest bit of difference\u0027Mr Slymm said that he had recently taken his car to the garage, and luckily was completing the drive in a brand new grey Mini Cooper.He continued: \u0027We\u0027re going to be here all night I think, luckily we\u0027ve got 34 tank but the people next to us only have half a tank left.\u0027Everyone is helping each other and asking if each other are ok, if someone runs out of fuel we\u0027ll take them in.\u0027To make matters worse, Mr Roome and Mr Slymm have recently bought a puppy and are travelling with the young animal - and have to keep braving the conditions to get it water.\u0027We\u0027ve got a 13-week old puppy with us and we\u0027re worried about her\u0027, Mr Roome said. \u0027We didn\u0027t have any water in the car so we had to melt some snow.           People were seen getting out of their cars and throwing snowballs on the A30  Snow was falling thick and fast in Plymouth last night while drivers remain stuck on the roads           Cars stuck  on the A30 as vehicles were stranded. All but essential travel should be avoided, police said          Drivers were saved by a plough and a gritter being sent in by Highways England yesterday\u0027Luckily we had some food with us, but we can\u0027t leave her outside for too long as it\u0027s too cold.\u0027No one has told us anything, but the traffic report says to stay with your car and wait for the weather to clear.\u0027We\u0027re trying to get to Wadebridge, we\u0027ve rented a house for all of us. It\u0027s my 29th birthday today, I\u0027ll look back and laugh at it one day.\u0027Elsewhere, Londoners have have been warned to be home by 9pm this evening as snow is set to hit the capital, after blizzards blasted the South West today causing travel chaos on roads and rail.Workers and schoolchildren were told to leave early today as Britain endured up to three inches of snow in only 120 minutes, following the country\u0027s coldest night in seven years.And the Met Office has issued an amber warning for snow that carries a potential risk to life while Transport for London and Network Rail are telling passengers to get home by 9pm.County officials in Devon had urged people to get home by 3pm, shortly after the start of an amber warning for snow in parts of Wales and South West England, bringing up to 2.8in (7cm) of snow in just two to three hours.Meanwhile, about 400 students were stranded at Callywith College in Bodmin.Principal Mark Wardle said buses to transport students had not been able to get to the sixth-form college, and catering staff were providing sausages, chips and beans to those waiting for assistance."},{"url":null,"title":"Fugitive poses bed covered bundles 65 000 cash running bogus colleges","story":"    Muhammad Babar Bashir posed on a bed with bundles of cash made from the illegal schemeTeenager is arrested after buying PlayStation 4 for £8 by...Agony for British aristocrat, 33, facing 30 years in Kenyan...Share this articleBashir, Nayyar, 51, from Chorlton and another man, Koteswara Nallamothu, 36, were running \u0027bogus colleges\u0027.The colleges had no books, equipment or teachers but the group managed to profit from 1,300 people who wanted to study in the UK and were otherwise ineligible.Their lucrative \u0027cash for visas\u0027 scam worked by taking over failing further education colleges, which were previously legitimately run.  Tashina Nayyar, 51, pictured, was jailed for two years and three months for her part in the \u0027cash for visas\u0027 scamThe colleges these defendants were involved with were St John College in Ashton, and Kinnaird College in Stevenson Square, Manchester city centre.People would hand over cash to Bashir and Nayyar in exchange for a \u0027golden ticket\u0027 - a confirmation of acceptance of study (CAS) letter - which enabled them to get a student visa.Some were genuine students who wanted to learn, others weren\u0027t.At one point at Kinnard College, which was ran by Nayyar, Home Office officials saw students knocking on the door and trying to get in.The majority of students who applied for CAS were already living in the EU, but used it as a way of securing their immigration status.The scam saw £2.6million pass through St John College\u0027s accounts, and a further £856,000 go through the accounts of Kinnaird College, both over a two year period.In total 955 \u0027students\u0027 were granted a CAS letter through St John College, with 352 at Kinnaird. The colleges were later shut down by the Home Office.Under UK law, students who live outside the EU are able to study in the UK at tier four colleges which have been given permission to provide educational courses.  Bashir, left, did not turn up and a warrant has been issued for his arrest. Koteswara Nallamothu, 36, right, advertised the fake colleges  as costing \u0027£500 with or without English\u0027 The colleges have to obtain a sponsor licence from the Home Office, which then allows them to offer CAS to students.Legitimate students entering the UK who need CAS for their course usually pay a nominal fee of £14 to cover an administration fee to the Home Office.But Nallamothu was advertising it on his mobile phone as costing \u0027£500 with or without English\u0027.Students who enrol on these courses are required to be able to speak English.Bashir of Moss Side and Nallamothu of Rotherham were previously convicted of conspiracy to facilitate breaches of UK immigration law after a four month trial.Their co-defendant, Ayaz Ahmed, 38, from Nottingham, was acquitted during the trial.Nayyar of Chorlton, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to facilitate breaches of UK immigration law before the trial. She was sentenced to two years and three months. Nallamothu will be sentenced in March, as his barrister was unable to attend the sentencing hearing. Bashir did not turn up and a warrant has been issued for his arrest.After the hearing, David Magrath, deputy directior of Immigration Enforcement\u0027s Criminal and Financial Investigations (CFI) team, which uncovered the abuse, said: \u0027Nayyar purported to be selling an education, but, all she was selling were documents which customers were told were golden tickets to a life in the UK.\u0027Since this abuse was uncovered a number of reforms have been made to the immigration system which has slashed student fraud and made it much harder for criminals like Nayyar to operate.\u0027Those measures and the robust action we have taken in this case demonstrates that we will not tolerate abuse of the immigration rules and will pursue any sponsors that try to profit by cheating the system.\u0027"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/07/16/4FD768CF00000578-6143609-image-a-8_1536334592705.jpg","title":"Older people shun public transport smartphone users engrossed seats","story":"    The research found that 42 per cent of people are more likely to be looking down at their phone or tablet than checking to see if someone might need a seat (file photo)Raymond Burrows, 82, who lives in an Anchor home in Worthing, knows exactly what it feels like to be nervous about taking public transport.   He said: \u0027I often struggle to get a seat, I\u0027ve never asked anyone to stand up for me because I\u0027m afraid of how people would respond. \u0027I don\u0027t want to bother passengers who are distracted by their phones and tablets, and don\u0027t notice me standing right there.\u0027If people simply looked up to see if anyone needs a seat, they could make a real difference to people like me.\u0027     Speed camera van parks up near spot Duke of Edinburgh rolled...Shocking footage shows two Tube passengers arguing loudly...Share this articleThe new data, based on a survey of 3,000 people, has been released in conjunction with the \u0027Stand Up 4 Sitting Down\u0027 campaign - launched in an attempt to highlight the scale of the problem.  The study found that forty-three percent of people have not offered up their seat, even if they suspected someone might need it. While sixty-seven percent of those people failed to do so, despite feeling guilty about it. Furthermore, 14 per cent think they do not need to offer their seat when not sat in a priority seat.     Data also found that 14 per cent think they do not need to offer their seat when not sat in a priority seatThe research has also exposed how manners and a typically British stoic attitude are contributing to this breakdown in communication. Despite their discomfort, 41 per cent of older people admit they\u0027re too embarrassed to ask for a seat.While 39 per cent of the public cite fear of causing offence as a reason for not offering an older person their seat.   Jane Ashcroft, chief executive of Anchor Hanover, said: \u0027The implications of people being obsessed with their phones and tablets on public transport, instead of people, is deeply alarming. \u0027Older people are being left to stand are physically suffering and feeling isolated, leaving them reluctant to use public transport which is a lifeline for so many. \u0027A small act, such as looking up and offering your seat, can make a real difference.\u0027 "},{"url":null,"title":"Shocking moment Mexicos Susanna Reid fend politician","story":"    Politician Jose Maria Armenta, Master of Ceremonies of the Government of the state of Sonora, lunges towards host Alejandra Leon and tries to kiss herArmenta forcefully grabs Leon\u0027s head and lunges his face towards hers as he tries to kiss her on the lips.The shocked TV presenter turns her face away and kicks her legs as she struggles to fight off the politician.Failed stockbroker \u0027who killed his wife for her $5m fortune\u0027...#MCCToo scandal as married cricket official and...Share this articleHe smiles and shrugs as he pulls away, calmly saying: \u0027She didn\u0027t want one.\u0027During the uneasy exchange, male host Vicente Ruiz stands up and seemingly tries to block the camera from the incident.           The female host kicks her legs and pulls away she struggles to fend off the politicianTrying to keep her composure, female host Leon then says to the politician: \u0027I need to say something.

The Ojibwa tribe settled mainly in North Dakota, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan and Ontario. Hunters and fishermen, they also traded in furs with the French. The Ojibwa are part of a larger group of indigenous peoples known as the Anishinaabeg. The Ojibwe language, part of the Algonquian language family, is widely spoken in Canada          Three Apache men - Chief James A. Garfield (center), Pouche Te Foya and Sanches - looking resplendent in their feather headdresses, circa 1900. The traditional lands of the Jicarilla Apache also include Oklahoma. They were driven out in 1716 by the Comanche tribe and settled in what is now New Mexico. There are currently about 2,800 tribal members of the Jicarilla Apache Nation, most of whom live in the town of Dulce. The name \u0027Jicarilla\u0027 comes from the Mexican Spanish \u0027little basket\u0027, which references the sealed receptacles they used for drinking           A member of the Crow tribe, circa 1902. The Crow people were a plains tribe from land near the base of the Big Horn mountains in Wyoming and Montana. The tribe were powerful and skilled hunters on horseback and could demonstrate this during battle with techniques like hanging underneath a galloping horse by gripping the animal\u0027s mane. They were also known for their distinctive clothing, particularly their ornate and decorative bead-work          Apache chief James A. Garfield. It is believed that he was given the name by Spanish missionaries. He lived in La Jara, Colorado with his wife. For the most part, the Native American tribes lived peaceably, believing that nature was sacred and was to be shared. However, the coming of the Europeans and the removal of their land led to conflict - both between the different tribes and between the Native Americans and the newcomers          Jose Romero, his wife and a baby in a cradleboard, 1899. This family were members of the Ute tribe. The Utes were a large tribe that lived in the mountain regions of Colorado, Utah, Wyoming, Eastern Nevada and Northern New Mexico. Utes were skilled hunters but, after introducing horses into tribe life in the 17th century, they became known as expert big game hunters - especially of buffalo, which they were particularly reliant on          Taqui, a Hopi snake priest. The Hopi tribe - also known as Moki - settled in what is now northeastern Arizona. Their culture traditionally centered around farming, and after the arrival of the Spanish in 1540, sheep-herding. One of their most notable rituals was the Snake Dance, which saw performers dance with live snakes in their mouths. A peaceful tribe, they were occasionally subjected to raids by Navajo and Apaches. There are believed to be about 15,000 people of Hopi descent alive todayFor the most part the Native American tribes lived peaceably, believing that nature was sacred and was to be shared. However, the coming of the Europeans and the removal of their land led to conflict between the different tribes - and between the Native Americans and the newcomers. By the end of the 19th century, the tribes had lost their fight to preserve their traditional way of life and those who had survived the conflicts were confined to reservations.Trump backs Catholic students who taunted a Native American...Christian missionary from Maine could be tried for GENOCIDE...Notre Dame to cover up murals depicting Christopher Columbus...Share this articleThe vivid images, which were taken around the turn of the 20th century, were produced using photochrom a method of producing colorized photographs from black and white negatives via the direct photographic transfer of a negative onto lithographic printing plates.It was invented in the 1880s and was most popular in the 1890s, when these images were taken.

Ignacio was leader of the Weenuchiu band of Utes, located in present-day Colorado, at a time when European-American settlers started encroaching on Ute land in the late 1800s. He helped to negotiate tribal treaties - and the Southern Ute Indian Reservation would go on to name Ignacio as its capital in his honor          Ojibwa babies in cradleboards, circa 1903.

Mrs Brookes\u0027s home on a leafy street in the Leicestershire market town of Castle DoningtonThis was followed by financial penalties, including a £3,500 fine issued in August 2017, along with the threat of jail for any future offences.In February 2018, a final warning in court saw an eight-month suspended sentence handed down, with Neal promising she had now \u0027learned her lesson\u0027.Judge Judge Godsmark QC took a dim view of her latest offences, following through with the threat of jail. She was sentenced to 28 days in prison in her absence.Judge Godsmark QC found that seven out of the nine breaches presented by the council had been proven beyond all reasonable doubt.          Recent CCTV footage begins by showing Mrs Brookes walking over to put plant pots back upNeal was sentenced to 28 days in prison for the most serious breach of spraying weed killer over the fence. She was also given 14 days for the other breaches - to run concurrently with the 28 days.The judge gave a lengthy judgement, stating that he \u0027was left with the overwhelming impression that Mrs Neal is not taking the injunction seriously\u0027 and that, while the last thing that the court wanted to do was send an elderly woman to prison, there was little else left to do.The judge also warned that the court would have little choice but to impose the full suspended eight-month prison sentence should further breaches occur. Neal was ordered to pay the council\u0027s legal costs of £4,323.          Mrs Brookes is then seen restoring the plant pots to their original position outside her homeNeal has made national headlines in the past when a court heard how she tormented her neighbours by harassing them, trespassing on their property, and deliberately lighting smoky bonfires in her garden, as well as her trademark weedkiller-spraying tactics.Mrs Brookes said: \u0027Since Mrs Neal received her eight-month suspended sentence she has again relentlessly targeted our garden with weed killer, causing criminal damage and using provocative behaviour throughout 2018.\u0027No one wants to see an elderly lady go to prison but Mrs Neal has shown no remorse for her actions and only complete disregard and contempt for the court ruling.\u0027My husband and I therefore now hope that the shock and shame of serving a short sentence in prison will finally change her ways.          But Neal, having removed a fence panel, can then be seen pushing over the plant pots again\u0027We must thank NWLDC for their support throughout along with the local police beat team who, under Inspector Richard Jackson, helped to bring Mrs Neal to justice, and of course our own family who have been a massive support throughout.\u0027Councillor Trevor Pendleton, chair of the Safer North West Leicestershire Partnership said: \u0027Neal has embarked on a campaign of intimidation and criminal damage against her neighbours and clearly did not listen to previous punishments and warnings made in court.\u0027We are committed to supporting the victim of this behaviour and this meant taking Neal back to court for her latest offences. Jail is a last resort but in this case nothing else has worked, including the countless warnings and fines.          Neal is caught on CCTV walking away from the fence after pushing the plant pots over again\u0027We hope that this short prison sentence will make Neal realise the seriousness of her crimes and bring an end to this matter. \u0027We\u0027re pleased with the court\u0027s decision and thank the police for their hard work alongside NWLDC\u0027s community safety and legal teams for bringing about this successful prosecution.\u0027Inspector Richard Jackson, from North West Leicestershire neighbourhood policing area, said: \u0027No one should live in fear of their neighbour and unfortunately Neal has repeatedly refused to put a stop to her campaign of harassment and abide by the injunction.\u0027This left no other option but to go back to court as part of the legal process and as a very last resort.

But from Bridget Jones to Love Actually, romcoms often blur the line between seduction and stalkingBoy meets girl. Boy likes girl. Boy does everything he can to get girl. This is the structure of pretty much every love story, from fairytales to romantic comedies, from The Graduate to Love Actually. As a result, it’s the dynamic most of us have grown up as thinking as the norm, even the ideal: the man is the active subject, and the woman is the passive object, who must be persuaded into love.Caroline Kepnes’s ludicrously readable 2014 novel, You, which has been made into a Netflix series, opens with a classic romcom meet-cute. Handsome bookstore manager Joe spots pretty Beck when she walks into his shop. They banter among the bookshelves, he teases, she – he thinks – flirts back. And so the pursuit begins, with Joe finding out where Beck lives so he can walk past her door – except he doesn’t just walk past.“We’ve all grown up watching those movies dozens of times, in which a man pursuing a woman, and sometimes even being horrible to her, is portrayed as romantic,” Kepnes says. “I wanted to look at where that would lead when taken to the extreme.” Joe watches Beck for days before eventually breaking into her house. When she comes home unexpectedly, he hides in the shower. “I’ve seen enough romantic comedies to know guys like me are always getting into jams like this,” he muses.Objections to the creepiness of romcoms always lead to some people arguing that such cynicism proves romance is dead. “Did feminism kill the romcom?” one British newspaper asked last year, as if it were mere political correctness that makes storylines like a man convincing a woman with amnesia that she is his wife (1987’s Overboard, remade and not improved last year), or a man following a woman he hardly knows to a cabin in the mountains while she’s on a minibreak with someone else (St Elmo’s Fire) look odd. Smart movies also fudge the line between seduction and stalking: in Groundhog Day, Phil (Bill Murray) time travels for the purpose of seducing an unwitting Rita (Andie MacDowell). In Say Anything, the response of Lloyd (John Cusack) to being dumped by Diane (Ione Skye) is to stand outside her house playing the song they once had sex to. This image of Cusack is still regularly used as a symbol of romance, but without the romcom tinted spectacles it is flat-out weird.Defenders of the genre argue that older romantic comedies, often starring Rosalind Russell and Katharine Hepburn, showed women with more agency, and men with less self-entitlement. But Hollywood has always romanticised physical violence and psychological manipulation from men in the name of romance, whether it’s Rhett Butler raping Scarlett O’Hara into happy submission in Gone with the Wind, or Tony Curtis seducing Marilyn Monroe by pretending to be alternately her female friend and a British millionaire in Some Like It Hot.In You, one of Joe’s favourite references is Elliot, the character played by Michael Caine in Woody Allen’s Hannah and Her Sisters. Elliot doesn’t just seduce his wife’s sister Lee (Barbara Hershey), he stalks her: “He waits near her apartment and stages a run-in. Brilliant, romantic. Love takes work,” Joe thinks. But one of the more telling moments in the TV series comes when Beck recognises him on the street, after he has been following her for some time. She approaches him and says hello, then apologises for sounding like “a stalker”. Unaware that he has been masturbating outside her house, she is worried that she’s the one who comes across as overly keen.Women who pursue men in movies are routinely depicted as farcical (Bridget staking out Mark’s parents’ house in Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason) or psychotic. If Glenn Close’s character in Fatal Attraction had been a man, and Michael Douglas’s a woman, that film could have been a romcom about a man wooing a married woman away from her life of boring domesticity. In Play Misty for Me, Evelyn (Jessica Walter) turns up at Dave’s (Clint Eastwood) office and follows him around town. This behaviour, the film says, should be seen as a red flag. But Evelyn looks like a mere amateur next to the men in Love Actually: Colin Firth pursues a woman he barely knows across France, and Andrew Lincoln secretly films the wife of his best friend and turns up to her home to declare his love for her while her husband is inside. What is psychotic from a woman is romantic from a man. “Girls are taught from a young age that if a boy is mean to you that means he likes you, and men are taught that if a woman seems obsessive that means she’s crazy,”Kepnes argues. The superlative TV show Crazy Ex-Girlfriend satirises this while also, to a certain extent, endorsing it: after all, the show says, the only kind of woman who would pursue a childhood boyfriend across America is, as the title says, a crazy one.Some movies have reversed this gender dynamic. In Sleepless in Seattle (written and directed by a woman, the late Nora Ephron), Annie (Meg Ryan) becomes obsessed with Sam (Tom Hanks) after hearing him on the radio. This leads her to research his dead wife, find his address and watch him play with his son, Jonah. The movie ends with Jonah flying to New York to find her, in the belief she is meant to be his new mother. From another screenwriter this could have turned into a horror movie: a bereaved father rescuing his child from a deranged woman. As it’s Ephron, it ends with Ryan and Hanks falling in love.In While You Were Sleeping, Lucy (Sandra Bullock) develops a crush on a stranger, Peter (Peter Gallagher). When he falls into a coma she allows his family to believe she was his fiancee. The ruse continues even after Peter wakes up and Lucy only confesses the truth at the wedding altar. In the real world, Lucy could be convicted of fraud. In the romcom world, she marries his brother (Bill Pullman).Both of these movies were big hits, but by reversing the genders they inadvertently exposed the absurdity of romcom tropes. Audiences are very used to accepting men as pursuers, no matter how creepy their pursuit to see a woman doing the same just looks weird, because it is weird. In Ephron’s next movie, You’ve Got Mail, she reversed the genders back to the more traditional convention, with wealthy bookstore chain owner Joe (Hanks, again) wooing independent shop owner Kathleen (Ryan, again) by pretending to be someone else online. When Kathleen finds out that the man who drove her out of business is her online mystery man, she falls into his arms and says: “I wanted it to be you.” There were, strikingly and predictably, fewer complaints about Hanks’s behaviour in this movie than there were about Ryan’s in Sleepless in Seattle. Kepnes deliberately gave her protagonist the same name as Hanks’ character in You’ve Got Mail: “I’ve watched that movie about 100 times, and everyone finds it romantic – but he is so horrible to her!” Ephron was one of the earliest screenwriters to cop on to the snooping opportunities provided by the internet. In Sleepless in Seattle, made five years before Google was founded, Annie uses a newspaper’s computer database to investigate Sam’s personal life. In You’ve Got Mail, Joe exploits the anonymity provided by the online world to seduce Kathleen. In both cases, she made it look like a fun lark. Now everyone researches prospective dates, current crushes and exes online, scrolling through their old Facebook photos, checking their Twitter timeline. But as Kepnes shows in You, it is a disarmingly short hop from looking through someone’s Instagram photos to standing outside their house. Post #MeToo, it is easy to knock romcoms for romanticising stalking, but technology has normalised it. The truth is we’re all stalkers now• You is available on Netflix now.

He is trying to turn around the loss-making House of Fraser chain the ScS furniture brand is already sold in eight stores.Ashley has been on a buying spree over the past year, snapping up struggling retail chains including House of Fraser and the bike specialist Evans Cycles. He is also in the running to acquire the collapsed entertainment chain HMV. Sports Direct also has shareholdings in multiple high street chains including French Connection, Game Digital and Debenhams.Sofa was started by the entrepreneurs Rohan Blacker and Pat Reeves (who died in 2014) in 2006. The pair bought the domain name sofa for $215,000 and set about cashing in on the emerging online furniture market, making on-trend sofas and beds to order at the company-owned factory in Poznań, Poland.In 2015 the private equity firm CBPE acquired a controlling stake in Sofa for £40m-£50m. However that deal turned out to be the high-water mark for the business: a decision to expand its high street operation to nine showrooms backfired, and the company suffered heavy losses.The most recent accounts filed at Companies House show Sofa made a loss of nearly £10m on sales of £27.6m in the year to 28 February 2018. Last year CBPE was wiped out in a restructuring process that saw its lender, the private debt fund LGT European Capital, take control of the business.Ashley paid a nominal sum for the website, according to Sky News, which first reported the story.

This is the second time the chain has collapsed in less than a decade.EFB, which is owned by the entrepreneur Raj Chatha and his family, bought 35 Oddbins stores from administrators in 2011.Oddbins is one of the last remaining independent off-licence chains after the collapse of rivals, such as Unwins and Threshers, the latter of which now only trades online. Oddbins featured in the comedy series Absolutely Fabulous, with Patsy Stone, played by Joanna Lumley, living in a storeroom above one of its branches.The grocery wholesaler Bestway bought the Bargain Booze and Wine Rack chains after their parent group, Conviviality, collapsed into administration nearly a year ago.Phil Duffy, the joint administrator, said stores belonging to EFB’s retail subsidiaries which had gone into administration would continue to trade while a buyer was sought.“The continued decline in consumer spending, pointing to a squeeze on household finances, combined with rising living and national wages have put increased pressure on retailers’ bottom lines.”He said consumers were not spending as much because wages were struggling to keep up with inflation and there was unease over Brexit. “Add into that mix rising business rates and rents, and traditional bricks-and-mortar retailers are undoubtedly feeling the strain.”In an email to staff earlier this week, the directors of EFB said recent months had been “extremely tough trading-wise” and warned that job losses were on the way.The problems at Oddbins come after Patisserie Valerie and HMV both called in administrators in recent weeks.

The company blamed the problem on “potentially fraudulent” accounting irregularities and the Serious Fraud Office is investigating.The company’s chairman, Luke Johnson, said he had personally extended a £3m interest-free loan to it to help ensure January wages are paid to all staff.However, it is understood that loan is being used to pay staff at the 130 stores that remain trading but does not cover pay for those being made redundant.One former Patisserie Valerie worker, Hannah Milne, told the  she had been informed over the phone that she had lost her job in a very short conversation and was shocked to discover she had not been paid this week for her final month’s work. She said she had been forced to borrow money from her family.“It happened so close to pay day nobody was prepared for it,” Milne said.“I feel really screwed over. You put hard work into the company and all you expect is to be paid your wage and a little respect. The company is getting to go on trading and making money while I sit at home struggling to pay my bills.”Milne said that when she tried to contact the company she was told there was nothing she could do to reclaim her pay.One member of staff who will not receive any statutory redundancy pay because he has worked for Patisserie Valerie for less than two years has set up a petition in an attempt to persuade the company to pay staff.KPMG, which is acting as administrator to Patisserie Holdings, has said it is providing members of staff who have been made redundant with assistance in making claims to the government-backed Redundancy Payments Service, which helps cover wages owed and statutory redundancy pay at insolvent companies.A spokesperson for the administrators said: “We recognise this is a very difficult time for those members of staff who have lost their jobs, and are providing them with support, including assisting with claims to the Redundancy Payments Service.”Dave Turnbull, of the Unite union, advised workers to write to Patisserie Valerie and demand their pay.“The company is still trading so it does still have some money. They should be demanding they get paid. This could be unfair dismissal. Even if the company is in administration it should have gone through the proper process to make them redundant,” Turnbull said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e159900becafc863d1424163b8df32a407d2066e/0_234_3504_2102/master/3504.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1da65f649f6df5739e6985d78d43c253","title":"barklife paris finally allows dogs into its public parks","story":"The city famed for its love of les petits chiens is finally letting them access its world-famous parks and gardensWhen Lucie Desnos was looking for an apartment, she had one important condition: that it be near a park where she could walk her dog. Such a demand is far from unusual among house-hunters with pets, but can be particularly difficult to fulfil in Paris, where dogs have long been banned from most public parks and gardens.Desnos settled on a place in the 15th arrondissement from where, most days, she walks to the Champ de Mars – the stretch of green that runs beneath the Eiffel Tower – with her one-year-old dachshund, Neiko. “When he goes to the Champ de Mars, he goes crazy!” Desnos says. “Five to 10 minutes before arriving he goes nuts, running and pulling on the leash like crazy to go and see his friends.”But as of 1 January the green spaces of Paris are opening up to dogs following a recent town hall vote.Previously, owners who don’t live near the few large, dog-friendly parks have been left with two choices: restrict daily walks to a sad trundle along the pavement, or take their dogs out to the large woods on the outskirts of Paris, the Bois de Boulogne and the Bois de Vincennes – journeys that can take up to an hour on public transport. Others, desperate for somewhere to take their dogs, simply break the rules.“Most of us have already been given a fine, or have been asked to put our dog back on leash or to go somewhere else,” Desnos says.The new ruling was passed as part of a suite of measures to liberalise the strict code of regulations that governs Paris’s parks, including lifting similar (often flouted) bans on swimwear, ball games, bikes and picnics.Pénélope Komitès, the city’s deputy mayor in charge of green spaces, says the rules are part of a wider scheme to makes parks more welcoming.“There were many, many prohibitions in our previous regulations,” she says. “We had a tendency, I think, to see parks as spaces that were very closed, very separate from public space.“We’re in the process of changing that. We’re transforming parks, and the uses of parks, at the demand of Parisians, who want parks to open longer, and who want to ride their bike through parks – which wasn’t possible until now.“We are passing from a regime of prohibition to a regime of permission.”But, Paris being Paris, there are still plenty of rules. The new rule stipulates that dogs must be kept on leads at all times, and must stay on the paths. It applies only to parks without children’s playgrounds, in response, Komitès says, to parents’ concerns about having too many dogs around during busy playtimes.It is unclear how many of Paris’s green spaces have actually opened up to dogs so far. Komitès says her office is still working on the exact numbers, and the database of green spaces on the official Paris website shows that many parks are home to at least one playground. Still, at park entrances across town, pictures of a cheerful pedestrian with a dog in tow crossed out with a big red line are gradually being replaced with an image of owner and hound strolling along unfettered.And there is hope for more canine freedom to come. Komitès says lifting the ban is the first step in making Paris more dog-friendly, and that more parks might be opened up in future.“If Parisians keep their dogs on the lead,” she says, “if they keep to the paths and don’t let their dogs wander into bioersity areas, then afterwards we will see.”Now it is up to the dog owners of Paris, not famed for following the rules (notably those about picking up merde), to prove they and their pets know how to behave.Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/be591d6ee5b97d468c6483a943c0c6f2d5e6cedc/0_0_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9bcbc66abd1d2d544f0c8b76c7a14386","title":"everythings leaving can sheffields high street survive","story":"Exclusive:  Cities analysis reveals extent of high street crisis “Look at it, everything’s leaving,” says Linda Shaw, nodding at a “to let” sign outside the branch of Next on Sheffield’s Fargate. It’s hard to argue with her. Once at the heart of the steel city, the shopping road is now pocked with vacant shops. Soon H\u0026ampM will follow Next in relocating off the high street.For residents like Shaw, 70, the deserted feeling is enough to give up shopping here altogether. “The only reason I bother to come into Sheffield now is to go to the bank because they’ve closed so many outside of town,” she says.Worst affected were clothing stores, specialist shops and restaurants. Some stores are doing better – there has been an increase in cafes, tattoo shops and hair and beauty salons, for example – but in Sheffield you can see the net effect. Fargate has lost an electronics store, a plus-size clothing retailers, a video games store and countless eateries.On nearby Devonshire Street, home to a warren of independent shops and an increasing number of places to get a new trim, ink or a soy latte, the busiest haunt on a January weekday is the 200 Degrees cafe.The blame for Sheffield’s retail decline has long been placed on Meadowhall. Since it opened in 1990, the huge shopping complex three miles (5km) outside the city centre has offered more shopping options under one roof, with free parking. Adding to the competition, last July a new £35m retail park boasting high street behemoths such as Wilko, Next and TK Maxx arrived in the suburb of Meadowhead.But that doesn’t explain why the city centre has been so badly gutted in the last five years, leading others to point the finger at online shopping. In November 2018, for the first time in the UK, more than £1 of every £5 of shopping was spent online.Sheffield shopkeepers, however, are unconvinced. “About half of our clients now come off the internet,” said AJ Rundell, 20, manager of Follow Your Dreams tattoo studio on Devonshire Street. “It’s a way to show people what we do.”Instead, many local shop owners blame high business rates.“We’re paying higher and higher business rates, but I can’t really see how we’re benefitting from it,” said one business owner in the Devonshire Quarter, who points out that shop closures – like that of bookstore Rare and Racy which shuttered to make way for yet another development – means fewer people visit their end of the street. The rates are calculated according to the value of a property on the open market – and the huge increase in property values has seen it skyrocket.Earlier this week, business chiefs called for a dramatic overhaul of business rates to help bolster Britain’s high streets. Bill Grimsey, the former Wickes and Iceland chief executive who has conducted two reviews of the UK high street, urged a sales tax to replace business rates, in order to reflect the shifting way consumers buy products, but the government has shown no indication it will make changes any time soon.Sheffield council, which has no authority over business rates, is trying to use the powers it does have: over the next five years it will plough millions into the city in a bid to compete with Leeds and Manchester as a shopping destination. A huge new 1.5m sq ft triangle of development, housing new shops, luxury hotels, offices, apartments and leisure venues, is planned for the centre.The idea is not a new one – the 2008 financial crash scuppered the original plans – but most struggling shop owners don’t think it will help them. For one thing, the construction sites on Pinstone Street are hurting smaller businesses.“All the building works made it really hard to work as a business,” says Abi Golland, a branch of whose burrito joint The Street Food Chef, which was under a compulsory purchase order, closed last August.Sheffield City Council’s cabinet member for business and investment, Mazher Iqbal, said he understands the struggles of high street shops, but emphasises that the council doesn’t set business rates, and that although “most of the shops have closed down due to the redevelopment” on Pinstone Street, the council have been inundated with queries from investors into the new developments.On Chapel Walk, once a hive of specialist locally owned stores, scaffolding at its narrow entrance just off Fargate hides it from those unfamiliar with the area. Lucille Cox, manager at Andaa Home kitchen supplies shop, says: “People who visited us before know us so they come to us, but others tend not to come down this side of the road any more.”Nor is everyone in the city enthused by the prospect of attracting yet more retail conglomerates. Sheffield Hallam students Ellie Goodman, 18, and Tassie Drobinski, 20, scoffed at the idea of shopping at the huge new Primark or Gap.“We mainly go to the vintage shops up the road, like Cow,” said Drobinski.One independent retailer, who didn’t want to be named because he has been “too vocal” in his criticism of the council in the past and needs its support, believes the city authority’s focus is short-sighted.

Well-off liberals who back tax rises should understand thatIn Uncle Tom’s Cabin, there is a moment when Augustine St Clare, who owns Tom, suggests that he is better off as a slave than he would be as a free man. “No,” insists Tom. “Why Tom?” asks St Clare. “You couldn’t possibly have earned, by your work, such clothes and such living as I have given you.” “Know’s all that Mas’r,” says Tom. “But I’d rather have poor clothes, poor house, poor everything and have ’em mine, than have the best, and have ’em any man else’s.”It has long been a challenge, particularly for those who are comfortable, to understand why anybody who is struggling would choose to be worse off. Liberals can take it particularly personally when those who would most benefit materially from a change in policy or circumstance opt to reject it. The assumption is that they must be misinformed, ill-informed, uninformed, stupid, naive or cruelly misled.Whether they are poor Americans demonstrating against healthcare provision they don’t have, or direct beneficiaries of European Union funding voting to leave the EU, those who act “against” their material interests invite a mixture of befuddlement and derision.Since becoming poorer is not a course of action any poor person would consciously take, goes the argument, they are clearly not acting rationally and deserve what is coming.Quite why well-off liberals in particular would find someone voting against their material interests such a baffling idea is odd. They do it all the time. Whenever they vote Labour, or for any party that plans to raise taxes on the wealthy and redistribute income, they vote to make themselves worse off materially. True, they are better positioned to take a hit than those at the other end of the income scale. But there’s more to it than that. They do so, for the most part, because when it comes to politics they don’t just vote for their own financial wellbeing. They are thinking about the kind of country and world they want to live in, and the values that they hold dear.The notion that working-class voters approach politics differently is extremely patronising. Indeed it is precisely the kind of attitude that provides fodder to the rightwing culture warriors who rail against the “coastal elites” in the US and “do-gooders”. There really are some liberals who think that they know what’s better for working-class people than working-class people themselves do.This is not just a problem in and of itself – infantilising people in the name of their own advancement is a bad thing – it is counterproductive. When you start from the premise that those who disagree with you are acting illogically or are too unsophisticated to understand their own interests, no meaningful political engagement is possible – that would demand first understanding the logic and then challenging, converting, subverting or otherwise engaging it in the hope that you might change someone’s perspective and win them round.This has, of course, been a particular challenge when it comes to Brexit, where the two things we know are that poor people will be the most adversely affected by Britain leaving the EU – particularly if there is no deal – and that the poorer you are, the more likely you were to vote for it.With some notable exceptions, remain advocates have responded to this apparent conundrum by forsaking respectful engagement in favour of a combination of face-palming at the stupidity of lemmings going for a leap and promising Armageddon when they land. This didn’t work in the run-up to the referendum. And it’s not working now.This is partly because leave voters don’t believe the hype. A recent poll showed a significant majority of them believed Brexit posed a less serious crisis than either the financial crash or the miners’ strike. In other words, it’s not that they don’t understand things could get worse they just feel they’ve been through worse. That may, as Fintan O’Toole argued in this newspaper recently, reflect the complacency of those who have only known stability. “Only a country that does not really know what the collapse of political authority looks like would play this game,” he wrote. We won’t know until it’s too late.But also many did not vote purely for their material interest, but for something bigger that they thought more important. Polling by the Centre for Social Investigation revealed that remain voters significantly underestimated the importance that leave voters attached to sovereignty. The UK making its own rules came a close second out of four (immigration was first) in the reasons why people voted leave. When remain voters were asked why they thought people had voted leave they put the UK making its own laws last, after “teach British politicians a lesson”.Embodied in that preoccupation with sovereignty, I believe, was a notion of what this country has been, has become and might be – a story many British, and particularly English, people tell themselves about a once independent and impregnable distinct island that has lost its autonomy to a faceless potage of bureaucrats from Babel and how this is a chance to break free. That story did not come from nowhere. From the Falklands war to Fritz, the New Labour bulldog, the entire political class has colluded in its construction. It has now been leveraged by opportunists and is consuming the political class whole.It is a story enduring enough that when someone argues, “If you do this your factory might close,” you might respond: “It’s not my factory and ‘they’ve’ been closing factories around here for years. But it is my country and I don’t want ‘them’ messing with it.” In this story “they” is a moving target. It could be immigrants, it could be Brussels, it could be foreign companies. The only thing “we” know for sure is it’s not “us”.I think that story’s deeply flawed. It is mythical about the past: those who evoke the wars conveniently forget that they could not have been won without allies. Those who evoke the empire conveniently forget that it could not have been maintained without brutality (as the current furore over Winston Churchill’s legacy illustrates). It is obtuse about the present: countries evolve, borders shift, identities develop. Our royal family is German our favourite food is Indian and if people could only agree on how to spell Muhammad it would be England’s most popular name for a boy. We are not who we were nor should we seek to be. And it is fanciful about our future: our political sovereignty, like everybody else’s, is primarily constrained not by Brussels, but international capital. And since you can’t vote to leave that, staying in or out of the EU will make us less effective, but not more independent.But I also think, in the absence of other stories, it is compelling. Far more compelling than the threat of a scarcity of fresh vegetables and a run on the pound if we crash out with no deal. Compelling enough that some would suffer to see it through. Our challenge is not to mock, but to tell a better story. One that includes them, has a future for all of us and, ultimately, turns “them” and “us” into “we”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d9d112ba62864d743f1df37a23f4116f76988567/0_278_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3ccaa455fa1bc748678b16daa8178b37","title":"ofsted asks government to look closely at steiner schools in england","story":"After multiple inspections reveal safeguarding issues, chief inspector asks for examination of underlying principles of schoolsOfsted has asked the government to look closely at Steiner schools in England, after multiple inspections of schools operating under the Steiner banner revealed worries over pupil safety.The letter from the head of Ofsted throws into doubt the future of Steiner schools receiving state funding, after several opened as part of the free schools programme launched by Michael Gove in 2011.Amanda Spielman, the chief inspector of schools in England, said in a letter to the education secretary, Damian Hinds, that the government should “carry out a thorough examination of the underlying principles of Steiner education and consider the extent to which they may have contributed to the common failures we found in our inspections.”Spielman also urged the Department for Education (DfE) to close down inadequate Steiner schools that failed to show rapid improvement.“Overall, the findings are deeply concerning. They demonstrate that there are a number of areas of common weakness in these schools, which mean that in many cases, the children attending them are inadequately safeguarded and are receiving a poor quality of education,” Spielman said.Ofsted inspectors had witnessed “inappropriate physical handling” of pupils by staff and cases of governors ignoring parents’ complaints about teacher behaviour, she said.Six out of nine state and private Steiner schools recently given full inspections by Ofsted were rated as inadequate, the lowest grade, while the three others were given the next lowest grade: requires improvement.Three of the state-funded Steiner schools – the Steiner academies in Bristol, Exeter and Frome – have been placed in special measures.A fourth state-funded Steiner academy, in Hereford, received a “good” judgment in December. Recent DfE data showed the Hereford pupils to be making rapid progress, while GCSE grades were good but less impressive.Steiner schools subscribe to a pedagogy developed by Rudolph Steiner, an Austrian writer with eccentric views on child development. It translates into allowing pupils to learn at their own pace, in many cases not being taught to read or write until years after children in conventional schools in the UK.The Steiner Waldorf Schools Fellowship, which represents Steiner schools and nurseries in the UK, said: “It is a matter of deep regret when inidual schools fail in their duties. There is no compromise where the welfare of pupils is concerned. Our role is to provide guidance to schools in order for them to ensure all standards are in-line with the requirements set out by the DfE.“Whilst we celebrate the good outcome for Steiner Academy Hereford, we are disappointed that six schools have been judged as inadequate, and have taken immediate action to ensure that standards rapidly improve as per Ms Spielman’s recommendations.”In reply to Spielman’s letter, Hinds said DfE and Ofsted officials should review the evidence from the schools’ inspection reports to discover “what may be lying behind those schools that are failing to meet the standards”.Hinds said the three inadequate academies would be taken over by other multi-academy trusts, while enforcement action would be taken against the independent schools if they did not improve quickly.Spielman’s letter also said the Steiner schools had a poor approach to educating children with special educational needs and disabilities (Send). “At one of the schools found to be inadequate in all areas, inspectors reported that some staff and senior leaders blamed pupils with Send for all the problems in the school,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/13e714e56ee3b98de59932cb64e64e2a175fecf5/0_115_4896_2937/master/4896.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d283ae28d00bc73aae53e72b8ee6b04a","title":"scrapped hs2 bike path could have reaped five times more than hs2 itself","story":"Campaigners argue that the business case for the project was a ‘no-brainer’A scrapped “emerald necklace” cycleway up the spine of the country alongside HS2 would have delivered a return on investment of up to five times greater than the rail project itself, an FoI request has revealed – but neither the government nor HS2 Ltd will fund it.A 50-page report outlining the business case for the national cycleway, obtained by the , reveals health, congestion and economic benefits of between £3 and £8 per £1 spent. The return on investment of HS2 itself, meanwhile, is just £1.5-£1.7 per £1, according to the National Audit Office. Campaigners say completing the cycleway should have been a “no-brainer”.Last year, the government-owned HS2 Ltd was accused of watering down its legally binding commitments to “cycleproof” the rail route, by not providing capacity on bridges and tunnels for cycling. About 11.7 million people would live within three miles, or 15 minutes’ ride, of the cycleway running from London to Manchester, Liverpool and Leeds, via Birmingham, and it would cost the equivalent of between £3.45 and £8.69 each to build.The London Cycling Campaign’s Simon Munk said: “There is loads of evidence (including from the DfT itself) that cycling schemes offer better value for money than any other transport spending. Providing safe cycleways next to HS2 should have been a no-brainer. The cost would have been tiny comparatively.“If the government want best value for money, and it really is a choice between HS2 and cycle tracks, they should have cut HS2. Of course, that’s ludicrous – the government could have done both.”The vision, revealed as part of a feasibility study published last year, was to create a “legacy cycle network” linking communities in the HS2 corridor, within three miles of the new railway. It would build on the concept of the National Cycle Network, using lanes, canal towpaths, bridleways and disused railway lines, but with Dutch-quality standards.Roger Geffen, Cycling UK’s policy director, said the biggest benefits would have been for local communities. “Sadly the HS2 cycleway train has left the platform. However, if there is one bit of this project that has shown exceptional value for money, it’s the local community links. It’s vital that these are retained so that HS2 helps people make local journeys by bike or foot, rather than severing them as currently planned.“If the government wants local authorities to follow its forthcoming new cycling design guidance, it needs HS2 Ltd to set a good example – not a bad one,” he said.The business case report, produced in 2014 by Phil Jones Associates (PJA) and Royal Haskoning, estimated demand for different parts of the proposed cycleway for leisure, utility and cycle-rail trips, and balanced those against the build costs. The report was not published with the feasibility study last year, however.Analysing four indicative sections of cycleway, from busy urban routes to quieter rural and urban connecting paths, it found urban sections with multiple connections would see the highest returns of between £4.70 and £14.84 per £1 spent, considering both pessimistic and optimistic projections. For the quietest linear routes, returns could be between £1.54 and £5.53 per £1 spent.Phil Jones, of PJA, said the cycleway’s high returns are “not surprising”, adding “cycling and walking schemes cost relatively little compared to major highways and railways, and create significant benefits, particularly in terms of public health”.Benefits also include time savings, decongestion, absenteeism and collision and injury reductions.Safe, attractive routes can also attract a broad demographic of people to cycling, including older people and children, women, ethnic minorities and disabled cyclists.In its response to the FoI, the Department for Transport said “neither DfT nor HS2 Ltd have any plans to fund the national cycleway”.A DfT spokesperson said: “HS2 will be the backbone of Britain’s rail network. The project is already delivering significant benefits to local people and economies, employing 7,000 people and 2,000 businesses.There is currently no funding allocated to LCWIPs, however, which campaigners want to see change. The government is currently predicted to miss its own cycling target, achieving just a third of the 800m hoped-for extra cycling trips by 2025, with much of that predicted growth restricted to London.HS2 Ltd did not respond to a request for comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/041ed4fea80aff25da004ac03f0fbb8c9409aa4e/0_95_1000_600/master/1000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=90d299fd8cfcb8863435101485933b55","title":"flashing the clash a high street trend for brexit limboland","story":"Retailers are harnessing chaos, pitting dots against florals in their ‘pre-clashed’ clothesIndecision is not confined to Brexit-era politics. Fashion is having an ambivalent moment and, with shoppers apparently unwilling or unable to choose between two distinct designs, the trend for “pre-clashed clothes” is growing.At high street retailer Zara, there are dresses with ditsy prints alongside big swirling florals, as well as wrap dresses in contrasting colour blocks, usually with a vertical split. At both Rixo and Kitri, blue blooms jar with neighbouring polka dots – a dress in this design has become Kitri’s bestselling item since it launched earlier this month. Rixo also stocks a range of skirts, tops and dusters featuring “abstract florals” clashed together on a single item, while at Topshop, a pair of mom jeans sees black denim vie with another of this year’s biggest trends – leopard print – with a leg in each material. Across the board, the question appears to be: why wear just one print, when you can wear two – or more?On the catwalk, the “half-and-half” look was big at Marni, Gucci and Sacai where it ned dresses and coats as part of AW18 collections. More recently, Gosha Rubchinskiy sent macs in black and beige down the catwalk as part of his SS19 show for Burberry – as well as one mac comprising half of each. On the red carpet and elsewhere, celebrities including Suki Waterhouse, Sigourney Weaver and Rita Ora have also adopted the “split” or “ambivalent” dressing trend.Pre-clashed clothes are a progression from last summer’s matchy-mismatchy layering – a nod to nonchalance and no-rules dressing. In the current climate, the look can certainly be seen to embody a “have your cake and eat it” mindset, but it’s not the first time this trend has proved popular. In the early 80s, Elton John favoured a monochrome half-and-half suit, and the 70s embraced psychedelic florals meshed together for a mismatched look. Earlier still, pre-clashed clothes were fashionable for a more practical reason, according to Susanna Cordner, senior research fellow at the London College of Fashion.“Elaborate and matching print designs require the pattern on the fabric to be perfectly aligned ... which can result in metres of fabric being wasted,” says Cordner. “This was a proponent for ditsy and contrasting prints in the 1930s and 1940s, as they were seen as a way of creating maximum effect with minimum waste.”Be it sustainable styling or organised chaos, it’s a trend that’s set to stick around far beyond 29 March. “It’s a way to give the customer something a bit quirky without the customer having to work it out for themselves,” says the fashion historian Tony Glenville. “At its chicest, it’s spots with stripes or geometrics with florals. It’s less fashion and more collage or assemblage the unlikely forced into a new harmony. I think we need look no further than the state of the world to understand why this might be.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6814a54c7d0f0a8ed68b540a7f9e71be783c60d7/0_1640_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9b49b2cc329bbe287a6667071cf03f1e","title":"how to wear borg jacket jess cartner morley","story":"The new way to wear fake fur is to channel your inner teddy bear and forget about looking like a foxForget about looking like a fox. Or a mink or a chinchilla, come to that. The new way to wear fake fur is to channel your inner teddy bear and embrace the surprise fashion hit of this winter, the Borg jacket. Borg means that your furry coat is nubbly rather than fluffy, with the porridgy texture of an old-fashioned cuddly toy rather than the silky, feline pile of most fake fur. A kind of faux-sheepskin, it was major in the 1980s but fell out of style and was, until recently, relegated to lining parkas (it is densely woven, and therefore very warm).It is no accident that the Borg jacket has come into vogue in the year when real fur has finally begun to slide into the history books. London fashion week went fur-free last year, a sign it is going the way of dinosaur hide. As the real thing becomes less than aspirational, so fake fur has become less literal. A Borg jacket is a fake fur, but old Hollywood glamour this ain’t. And the only animal it resembles is the kind that was born stuffed.The jacket I’m wearing today is one part Paddington Bear, one part Kate Hudson in Almost Famous – both icons and both adorable. It is more thrift store than Fifth Avenue, more backstage than opera box, more soft touch than Cruella. You can get a jacket like this in every store on the high street right now, but you can also find quirkier and less expensive versions in vintage and charity shops. Borg is tough stuff, the kind of clothing that outlives a trend, so it tends to have an afterlife beyond the original owner. Which, again, is very now.Borg might make you dress in a different way than you would in a fake fur of the more traditionally dressy type. Jeans and a white shirt might look odd under a fake mink, but work perfectly here. And stompy boots work, too, when with an old-school fur you might go with a proper heel. If you think about it as a parka lining, this jacket is a parka turned inside out, and it holds on to a little bit of that streetwise attitude.This isn’t just a dress-down fake fur. It’s a much cooler look on top of a straight-up posh frock than a straight-up posh coat. It is Saturday night, as well as Sunday morning. It is nothing like real fur, but it is this winter’s real deal.Styling: Melanie Wilkinson. Hair and makeup: Samantha Cooper at Carol Hayes Management.

But movies have always played fast and loose with the factsWhen Green Book won top prize at the Toronto film festival in September, it became an instant Oscar frontrunner. Three weeks before the ceremony, its odds remain strong: most bookies currently make it second favourite to win best picture, after Alfonso Cuarón’s Roma. This, despite several PR disasters, including star Viggo Mortensen saying the N-word, stories resurfacing about director Peter Farrelly exposing himself, and a fuss over a 2015 tweet by co-writer Nick Vallelonga about American Muslims cheering on the 911 attacks. But arguably none of these has done as much damage as the charge that it misrepresents history.Green Book tells the story of African American piano virtuoso Donald Shirley (Mahershala Ali) and his Italian American driver Tony Vallelonga (Mortensen) as they undertake a tour of the Deep South in 1962. Along the way, Shirley is refused service in stores, excluded from restaurants and physically assaulted. At the start, Vallelonga is hostile towards black people. When he gets to know Shirley, though, and sees the Jim Crow south up close, his sense of justice conquers his prejudice. Simultaneously, Shirley is depicted early on as an uptight, prissy snob, out of touch with his own African American community. Forced to spend time with the knockabout, salt-of-the-earth Vallelonga, he chills out. In a climactic scene, Vallelonga goads Shirley into eating fried chicken for the first time.Green Book is a film designed to warm the cockles of a liberal white audience who want to feel good about not being racist. However, Shirley’s real-life family have reacted with hurt and anger, asserting that there was no close friendship between the pair, and criticising the film-makers for not consulting them. The film, says Shirley’s surviving brother, is “a symphony of lies”. Its focus on a white protagonist’s perspective at the expense of its black character playing into a longstanding controversy about representation in Hollywood. In this heated political context, Green Book’s historical fictionalisation reads to some not as artistic licence, but as erasure.Simon Schama deplored the fictionalised encounter between Elizabeth I and her cousin in Mary Queen of Scots, tweeting that “the whole drama of Elizabeth and Mary lay in the fact they never did meet – movie has copped out on that”. In a pre-emptive strike, Hannah Greig, historical adviser to The Favourite, admitted that Queen Anne didn’t really keep 17 bunnies in her bedroom, stating that rabbits “were an early-18th-century foodstuff and pest”. Donald Trump attacked First Man for not showing the precise moment when Neil Armstrong planted the US flag on the moon.In this newspaper, Simon Jenkins railed against Vice, The Favourite and Mary Queen of Scots, asking why, at a time when there is so much anxiety about fake news, “fake instant history” is rewarded. “The director of The Favourite, Yorgos Lanthimos, remarked casually that ‘some of the things in the film are accurate and a lot aren’t’,” Jenkins wrote. “What is a history student to make of that?” Script reader Gavin Whenman retorted: “How about they conduct actual historical research, rather than watch a film which does not purport to be a documentary?” Yet there are more substantial questions around the public use and understanding of history. Does historical fiction alter our sense of reality? Do film-makers have a responsibility to history? How can we navigate through a world where real and fake information are often blended together?When considering whether film-makers have a responsibility to history, it’s difficult to define with any consistency what is acceptable or unacceptable artistic licence. There has been relatively little criticism of The Favourite, despite major liberties. As an anarchic comedy, it may be less likely to be taken seriously than a drama. Yet Green Book is a comedy, too. The outrage may be louder not because the inaccuracies are necessarily more extreme, but because the recent history of racism in the US is much more familiar and painful territory for many than the bed-hopping antics of the Stuart court.There have been attempts in some countries to enforce legal limits on how film-makers treat history. The Indian Central Board of Film Certification has considered screening films with a historical element to selected historians, and letting them censor accordingly. Clearly, this would be an imposition on freedoms of speech and expression – as well as expensive, time-consuming and patronising. If any government says the public are too mushy-minded to be allowed to watch a historical movie unsupervised, many will consider that an intolerable move towards a “nanny state”.Furthermore, it seems unfair to make film-makers obey historians when historians often disagree among themselves. Experts are ided over whether Mary Queen of Scots should have a Scottish accent, as Saoirse Ronan does in the film, or whether she would have sounded French. This can’t be settled conclusively without a time machine. Even if we had one, we might find that 16th-century Scottish and French accents were different from those we recognise, and that the colloquial speech patterns of early, modern English were nothing like modern film dialogue either.If we can’t make clear rules about what constitutes acceptable historical fictionalisation, and we don’t want our governments to set up bureaucracies to enforce them, we are left with our present situation. Film-makers will make whatever historical films they can get funded. Some care deeply about history, and do feel a responsibility towards it, but they are paid by studios and investors to do a job that is not that of a historian. If we want film-makers to prioritise responsibilities to history or art rather than commerce, they need more public funding. As it is, films are generally commercial products. It’s up to us to choose what we watch and how we respond.So how can we navigate through this squall of real and made-up information? It starts with schools: it is vital that the humanities, including history, aren’t neglected, for they teach the process of critical thinking. Fiction, satire, misinformation, propaganda and “fake news” have been with us for millennia, and they are here to stay. If we learn to think critically as iniduals and as societies, we can make better judgments and decisions. We cannot only survive complexity, but embrace it.Perhaps those who fret about fiction are looking through the wrong end of the telescope. As Greg Jenner, historical adviser to Horrible Histories, tweeted this week: “So long as historians are able to publicly respond (which we do in droves), these films are helpful, not a hindrance, in stimulating public fascination with the past.” It’s understandable that Shirley’s family are upset by Green Book. But the film has prompted much discussion of the politics of race and class in cinema, and an upsurge of interest in the real Shirley, a fascinating man and extraordinary talent. This doesn’t let film-makers off all responsibility. They should think critically, too, and expect criticism. But audiences do not mindlessly absorb everything at face value. They are capable of understanding fiction and debating it. Whether you love or loathe Green Book, or any of the other Oscar contenders, historical films can be seen not as a threat to history but an opportunity to engage audiences. Even the most inaccurate film can prompt questions, spark debate, sharpen our ability to assess and analyse. Those skills are essential not only to understand history, but to understand the world we live in today.Green Book is on general release"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/031079c32ab0548656496a7cb65037c19723ab28/502_108_3158_1896/master/3158.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=349101966560281ca2411ef639af24d2","title":"black sheep guardian film nominated for best short documentary oscar","story":"Ed Perkins’ film about a young black boy’s response to a racist gang after he moves out of London is up for an Academy awardBlack Sheep, a film commissioned by the , has been nominated for best short documentary at the 2019 Oscars.Directed by Ed Perkins, Black Sheep tells the story of Cornelius Walker, a black 11-year-old from London who moves with his family to a housing estate in Essex after the murder of schoolboy Damilola Taylor in 2000. Walker, the same age as Taylor and of similar background, found himself confronting a gang of local racists and, after first fighting back, went to extraordinary lengths to fit in and gain their friendship.The film features interviews with Walker looking back 15 years on from the events he describes, which are re-enacted in the locations where they took place, with Kai Francis Lewis playing Walker.Responding to the nomination, Walker said that he was, “humbled and proud. I worked on this film to tell my story and hoped that it would resonate with people. To be nominated for this award is the highest recognition.”The film was produced by Simon Chinn and Jonathan Chinn of Lightbox (collaborator on the Whitney Houston documentary Whitney).

So accessible, so speedy to cook, so sweetly flavourful, and a brilliant source of protein. At this time of year I rely on them to add freshness when most other green veg is a distant memory. This week, I cooked them with potatoes, lemons and feta to make a family-friendly traybake, and the pea and coconut soup is a go-to, made with things I usually have to hand.Use a tray large enough that the potato chunks have space on the tray or they won’t cook as evenly.

Season well with salt and pepper, toss everything together, and make sure everything is coated with oil.Break the feta into large chunks and sprinkle it over the potatoes. Drizzle with oil again, then bake for 45 minutes, until the potatoes are crisp and the feta is chewy in the middle and crisp on top.Remove from the oven, then prepare the peas. Put them in a bowl, pour boiling water over them for 30 seconds, then drain. Sprinkle the peas into the tray and put it back into the oven for another few minutes. Top with the fresh herbs, then drizzle with plenty of extra-virgin olive oil. The lemons have done their work now and will have transferred all their favour to the potatoes, so scoop them out before serving in the middle of the table.When I am hungry, impatient and have nothing in the fridge, this vegan soup is the recipe I turn to. To be really speedy, the pan you use is important a small, deep saucepan will mean your soup won’t come to a simmer quickly, so I suggest a deep, wide one – cast iron is ideal.

Turn up to the highest heat and cook for two minutes, until softened.Add the peas to the pan with the coconut milk, the stock powder or cube and 750ml boiling water, then cover and bring to a boil. Once boiling, simmer, still on a high heat, for two to three minutes.Remove from the heat. Add most of the herbs, stalks and all, and the juice of the lime, and use a stick blender to blitz the soup until it’s super‑smooth.Serve ladled into bowls with a little olive oil and the rest of the herbs.

This collection of his best goals suggests not By Emmet Gates for The Gentleman UltraThe 1990s was perhaps the last great decade for centre-forwards. With coaches yet to shift to one-striker systems, variations of 4-4-2 were the norm across Europe. The decade was full of lethal strikers. Marco van Basten was king at the start of the 1990s Ronaldo was phenomenal towards the end and Romario, George Weah, Jürgen Klinsmann and Alan Shearer sprinkled some magic in between. But nobody stayed the course like Gabriel Batistuta.Batistuta arrived left Boca Juniors for Fiorentina in 1991 and hit double figures in the league in each of the next 10 season. He was top scorer in Serie A with 26 goals in the 1994-95 season, which might not sound extraordinary in the age of Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, but was the gold standard of world football back then.In a less globalised time, Batistuta was perhaps the quintessential exotic footballer: he had won titles with both River Plate and Boca Juniors in Argentina he was a two-time Copa América champion with Argentina his long, stringy mane gave him the look of a lion crossed with a 1980s glam metal frontman he predominantly played in purple and his surname had more than two syllables. He was a world away from the up-and-at-em world of the early Premier League.Had Batistuta taken up life as an assassin, his preferred method of dispatching victims would have been a shotgun blast. When he struck a ball, it stayed struck.It’s March 2000 and neither Manchester United nor Fiorentina have scored when, in the 16th minute, Batistuta receives a pass from Angelo Di Livio some 30 yards from goal. He sidesteps Jaap Stam with ease and smashes the ball right down Mark Bosnich’s throat at a lightning speed, as if Bosnich had somehow offended him. From nowhere, Fiorentina have the lead in Manchester.Sir Alex Ferguson had chased Batistuta for years and, in 2017, former United chairman Martin Edwards revealed that a deal had been close but the club blocked it as they were worried about disrupting their wage structure.Batistuta could also kill softly. He tormented Inter in the first leg of the Coppa Italia semi-final in 1996, scoring a hat-trick that included a beautifully deft goal. But he wasn’t quite done with the tie. In the second leg, Batistuta produced this chipped marvel at San Siro to emphatically seal Fiorentina’s place in the final.Breaking from an Inter attack, Francesco Baiano plays an intelligent one-two with the majestic Rui Costa down the left. Baiano drives deep into the Inter half before sliding the ball into the path of Batistuta, who runs into the box. With only Gianluca Pagliuca to beat, Batistuta opts for grace rather than power, chipping the ball over the keeper and into the top corner.Fiorentina went on to beat Atalanta 3–0 over two legs in the final with Batistuta, of course, scoring two of the three goals.La Viola’s success in the Coppa Italia gave them a jaunt into European competition for the first time in seven years. Gloria Bistrita and Sparta Prague were seen off in the earlier rounds to set up a quarter-final with Benfica.Baiano gave Fiorentina the lead in the last minute of the first half and, with the clock ticking past the 90th minute, Giovanni Piacentini burst down the wing and whipped a cross towards Batistuta, who met the ball with an astonishing volley that gave Benfica keeper Michel Preud’homme no chance.Batistuta faced Ronaldo for the first time in the semi-final, as Fiorentina’s run ended against eventual winners Barcelona, with Batistuta again scoring in the first leg.Imagine the scene: Fabio Capello is sitting at home in the summer of 2000, staring at his expensive collection of art, quietly seething about how Roma’s city rivals, Lazio, had won the league on the final day of the season while his side finished sixth. Something had to be done. Then it comes to him: he needs a new striker.Capello goes through a list: “Hernán Crespo? No. David Trezeguet? No. Filippo Inzaghi? No. Gabriel Batistuta? Yes!” Capello gets on the phone to Franco Baldini. The story of how Capello and Baldini schemed to bring Batistuta to Rome is an examination in the art of massaging a president’s ego. Batistuta, then 31, cost £23.5m, a record for a player over 30 and one that would last for 17 years.This goal shows why he cost all that money. Ghosting between Fabio Cannavaro and Lillian Thuram, he meets Walter Samuel’s long ball and sends it past Gigi Buffon with a controlled volley. Roma went six points clear of Juventus and never looked back. Batistuta scored 20 goals in Serie A that season and finally won his first Scudetto at the age of 32. Money well spent.Fila. Nintendo. Batistuta: A 9.9 on the 1990s nostalgia Richter scale.It’s the first day of the season and Fiorentina are in Udine facing that season’s surprise package Udinese would finish third in Serie A, two places above Fiorentina. It’s 2-2 in the 90th minute and Batistuta has already scored twice, including a free-kick form 30 yards. The ball is floated towards the Udinese box and Batistuta wins the initial header. The second is won by an Udinese defender, who, for reasons unknown, heads the ball back to Batistuta. Now inside the D, the Fiorentina striker executes a flawless bicycle kick that arrows into the corner of Massimiliano Caniato’s goal. There are worse ways to complete a hat-trick.“He’s incredible. An animal. If we played in Europe he would win the Ballon d’Or,” said Fiorentina coach Claudio Ranieri after a 3–0 win in which Batistuta seemed to make it his personal mission to humiliate Napoli goalkeeper Giuseppe Taglialatela. Either that or the presence in the crowd of supermodel Naomi Campbell spurred him to produce not one but two big moments.Batistuta’s first goal is a textbook free-kick. Then, 15 minutes before the end, he adds the coup de grâce. Rui Costa switches the ball to right-back Michele Serena, who races down the pitch. Just as Serena is about to release a pass to the rampaging Batistuta, the ball takes a bobble. Serena’s pass lands on Batistuta’s chest. He controls it at full speed, smashes a half-volley down the middle of the goal and celebrates furiously, all without breaking stride.Batistuta was 30 when he made his debut in the Champions League. For anyone in England who had missed the Football Italia phenomenon – or his hat-tricks at USA 94 and France 98 – this was a chance to see just how good he was. Batistuta did not disappoint.A tense game was ebbing and flowing one way and then the other until, in the 76th minute, Jörg Heinrich burst deep into Arsenal’s half and slide the ball to Batistuta on the edge of the box. Faced with defender Nigel Winterburn, Batistuta controls the pass with his right foot, shifting the ball on to his left and dragging it forward, all in a few nanoseconds.Winterburn, sensing he cannot match Batistuta’s physicality, lunges in desperatele. It makes little difference. Batistuta blasts the ball high into David Seaman’s net from the tightest of angles. Winterburn had only given him several yards of space. It was several too many.• This blog first appeared on The Gentleman Ultra• Follow Emmet Gates and The Gentleman Ultra on Twitter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ec0c4354c266e14b8c09a3e2f6285f26c1bf775/0_0_2480_1488/master/2480.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=806322a2b0080202b8d850400a66c2a3","title":"transfer window verdict how every premier league club fared in january higuain almiron","story":"Gonzalo Higuaín and Miguel Almirón among main signings as clubs tinkered with squads rather than overhauling them“We need wingers. Wingers,” Unai Emery said on Tuesday night, and it was interesting to note the plural. The Arsenal manager added Denis Suárez, who he says can be one solution – even if he is not perhaps an out-and-out winger – but he saw moves fail for Ivan Perisic, Yannick Carrasco and Christopher Nkunku. David HytnerA very Bournemouth transfer window, their arrivals being a mix of fringe players from big clubs and one of the Championship’s brighter lights. They’re gambles, with Dominic Solanke’s senior goalscoring record virtually non-existent and Chris Mepham unproven, but Eddie Howe has made a business of polishing rough diamonds in the past. Nick MillerIt was all very quiet at the seaside until deadline day when two new players – Jan Mlakar from Maribor and Tudor Baluta from Viitorul (Gheorghe Hagi’s team) – were brought in, but then immediately loaned back to their clubs. Brighton’s significant business was done in the summer, and with Chris Hughton’s steady hand and the first team ticking along reasonably well, they were never likely to splurge in January. NMSean Dyche is keen to operate a one-in, one-out policy at Burnley and originally wanted to sign Che Adams from Birmingham before agreeing to let Sam Vokes join Stoke City for £7m. Birmingham turned down a £12m offer for Adams, however, so Burnley took up the option suggested by Stoke, with 38-year-old Peter Crouch moving back into the Premier League as a makeweight to allow the Vokes deal to go through. Youth goalkeeper Conor Mitchell has also joined Linfield on loan until end of season. Paul WilsonFrom Cardiff’s point of view, the transfer window became irrelevant – in fact, pretty much everything became irrelevant – as soon as those awful reports emerged that Emiliano Sala, their club-record signing, was on board a plane that disappeared near the Channel Islands on 21 January. Strengthening the squad ceased to be a priority thereafter. Stuart JamesChelsea backed their head coach, Maurizio Sarri, with the recruitment of Gonzalo Higuaín from Juventus. They would not normally be keen on hiring a 31-year-old on an initial loan deal, but their forward line has lacked a focal point, and Higuaín knows how Sarri works. Yet, by granting one of the Italian’s wishes, it also allowed the board to postpone the replacement of Cesc Fàbregas for now. Dominic FifieldPalace waited late before making a splash in the market. With interest in Dominic Solanke abandoned over the state of the youngster’s hamstring, and Bakary Sako secured on a short-term deal, it was only in the last three hours of the window that the chance to secure Michy Batshuayi from Chelsea was revived. The Belgium international may be the natural finisher this side has craved. Otherwise, the month actually became an exercise in squad trimming. DFMarco Silva’s main concern was keeping Idrissa Gueye, despite a £21.5m bid from PSG and the player’s expressed desire to join the French champions. Ideally he would have wanted a new striker too, but the many expensive mistakes of previous management teams are now catching up with Everton and spending was put on hold until the summer. Andy HunterFulham ended up waiting until deadline day before securing a defensive reinforcement though, even then, it was not straightforward. Their interest in the Cameroonian centre-back Michael Ngadeu-Ngadjui at Slavia Prague came to nothing, with Hoffenheim’s Havard Nordtveit taken on instead, before a late deal was struck to bring in Liverpool’s Lazar Markovic on a permanent deal. Their only other addition was Ryan Babel given the significant spending was undertaken last summer. It remains to be seen whether Claudio Ranieri can mould what he has at his disposal into a side who can survive. DFThe club’s biggest January moves were above the team, with Olaf Rebbe leaving as director of football and Jan Siewert replacing David Wagner as manager. Beyond the loan acquisition of the midfielder Jason Puncheon, the only addition to the squad – promising 21-year-old striker Karlan Grant – is aimed at adding firepower to a team that has struggled all season to score. Paul DoyleIns Jason Puncheon (Crystal Palace, loan) Karlan Grant (Charlton, £2m) Jaden Brown (free) Outs Colin Quaner (Ipswich, loan) Rekeil Pyke (Rochdale, loan) Ramadan Sobhi (Al Ahly, loan) Rajiv van La Parra (Middlesbrough, loan) Ryan Schofield (Notts County, loan) Jaden Brown (Exeter City, loan)Left it late in terms of incomings but made one of the headline signings of the window by bringing in Youri Tielemans on loan from Monaco. The 21-year-old will add a touch of class to the Leicester midfield – a department trimmed followed the departures of Andy King, Adrien Silva and Vicente Iborra. SJA five-point lead in the title race explains Jürgen Klopp’s reluctance to delve into the January market even with injuries impacting on his defence. Liverpool outspent their Premier League rivals last summer with a title challenge in mind and, with that on course, prioritised new contracts for the likes of Andy Robertson and Trent Alexander-Arnold while moving on fringe players. AHPep Guardiola will have to wait to acquire top-class competition for Fernandinho in the holding midfield position, which now becomes an urgent priority in the close season. Receiving a significant fee for Rabbi Matondo, a player who was never included in a competitive squad, represents smart business – the club believing this shows the academy’s productivity. Jamie JacksonOle Gunnar Solskjær would like to have added at least one central defender but the summer window will now be the time for he or whoever is manager to strengthen this area of the squad. Given this, Anthony Martial signing a fresh long-term contract may prove the club’s best business in the window, while Marouane Fellaini is set to depart for China. JJAfter starting the week refusing to rule out the possibility that he might resign as Newcastle’s manager, Rafael Benítez ended it by breaking the club’s 14-year-old transfer record. Benítez has long wanted a natural No 10 and will be delighted that his year long pursuit of Miguel Almirón has finally paid off. He has needed a left-back to challenge Paul Dummett ever since arriving on Tyneside but Antonio Barreca comes with mixed reviews. Louise TaylorRalph Hasenhüttl’s priority was to trim a bloated squad and – bar Fraser Forster - he moved on everybody that he did not want. Incoming business was a struggle, largely because the club blew their January budget on Mark Hughes’s severance package. Hasenhüttl wants to improve his existing players. DHTottenham were open to making a signing and Mauricio Pochettino admitted he was hopeful of one last week but nothing materialised. Funds are severely restricted by the £1bn new stadium project and upgrading an already strong set of players on a shoestring in a sellers’ market was unsurprisingly impossible. DHThe main concern before the window opened was whether the club would be able to hold on to its key players, especially Abdoulaye Doucouré, and it has done. Other than some pruning of the squad, mostly through loans, Watford evidently felt no need to make additions to a team that has been making quiet progress under Javi Gracía. PDThe mood was calm after the arrival of Samir Nasri at the start of the month, but that all changed when Marko Arnautovic’s head was turned by a lucrative offer from a club in the Chinese Super League. In the end Arnautovic got a new deal. The feeling was that replacing the Austrian would have been impossible in January – any move for Celta Vigo’s Maxi Gómez will wait until the summer – and the focus turned to shifting Javier Hernández and Lucas Pérez from the wage bill, but both stayed and West Ham’s hopes of bringing in a forward on loan ended when they pulled out of talks with Chelsea’s Michy Batshuayi. Jacob SteinbergFrustrated in their attempts to recruit another striker – Wolves thought they had a deal in place to sign Tammy Abraham on loan from Chelsea – but that will hardly matter if Raúl Jiménez maintains his exceptional form. Turning Jonny Castro Otto’s loan into a permanent move was a good piece of business.

But these finishing touches are sewn by some of the world’s most vulnerable women and girls.A week on from revelations that women in a Bangladesh factory were paid the equivalent of 35p an hour to make Spice Girls T-Shirts sold to raise money for Comic Relief, a new report highlights the exploitative conditions facing millions of home-based garment workers in India.Research by the University of California found that women and girls from the most marginalised communities toiled for as little as 15 cents (11p) an hour in homes across India. Child labour and forced labour were rife and wages regularly suppressed.The study is thought to be the most comprehensive assessment of conditions facing home-based garment workers, whose work often involves applying the final touches to a garment, including embroidery, tasseling, beadwork and buttons.“Every major brand, every boutique retailer and everyone in between who sources garments form India is touched by this issue,” said Siddharth Kara, the report’s author and a lecturer at the University of California. “It ends up on the shelves of every major brand in the west.”Roughly one in five home-based garment workers in India are aged 17 and under, according to the study, which draws on interviews with 1,452 workers. The youngest inidual interviewed was 10 years old, although researchers witnessed dozens of younger children.Across India, the vast majority of workers were women and girls from the most marginalised communities. None belonged to a trade union or had a written contract, leaving them with no way of seeking redress for unfair or abusive treatment.Payments were often late, with many workers reporting that they had been penalised for not completing hefty orders on time. Problems of this nature worsened in the run-up to busy periods such as Christmas, said Kara, as shops rushed to meet demand.“Imagine you’re earning 13, 14, 15 cents an hour. Then imagine your payments are not even on time, they’re delayed by a month or two. Then imagine you’re given an order that’s going to take you five days to complete and you don’t complete it on time and you’re not paid,” said Kara.Women were often unable to leave the home for weeks or months at a time, he added. “Their days amount to little more than running the home and working as many hours as they can to meet these orders, cooped up inside,” said Kara.Injury and chronic illness, including back pain and diminishing eyesight, were common. Virtually none of the workers interviewed received any sort of medical care when they suffered an injury at work.Some companies have made efforts to stop abuses in supplier factories, said Kara, but they have not yet felt motivated or pressed to address the treatment of home-based workers.India’s garment industry is among the world’s biggest for manufacturing and export, employing 12.9 million people in formal factory settings, and millions more indirectly in informal, home-based settings.The study added that clothing brands that source garments from India provide vital employment for women and girls who often have no other means of earning an income, arguing that companies should focus on improving conditions rather than shifting production or cutting off supplies."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/45ccb9e20ecdab57671159f625bf51894eac0b97/0_190_5700_3420/master/5700.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9c6e7363c927b96a6b0f5d53b005880c","title":"tell us who do you share your home with","story":"As part of a new series in the ’s Weekend magazine we are looking for interesting pairs who live togetherWe’re looking for unusual partnerships – two people who live together in a way that shows the changing nature of the traditional household – for our new series that seeks to reflect how the place we call home can now include extended family, friends and even strangers.In the first piece in a series talking to pairs of people who live together we met the McPhersons, a grandmother and grandson living together who tell us their story.

Sometimes your inidual free will is lost in this infantilisation: your decisions chalked up to the impetuosity of youth.In my family, I doubt this will change. For example, every year I try to go vegan, and eventually fail. The first time this happened, roughly 15 years ago, my mother hailed it as a fad. “No, these are my genuine values,” I said, citing climate change with a dollop of anticapitalism. “I’m old enough to have my beliefs. I’m in year 11 now.”Over time, the evidence I submitted for having my own mind evolved (“I’m a graduate now” “I have a proper job”). Yet even if my life credentials were to reach impossible heights (“I’m the leader of the Labour party” “I have single-handedly solved global poverty”), I’m sure my endeavours would still be met with a dismissive: “Pffft, sure. Shall I make you an omelette?”Having heard this for so long, I think I somehow believed it. They say you become more conservative as you age – not just politically but in the way you live your life. But I am one of the others: I grow more rebellious. More ideals, more conviction, less fear of speaking up and a growing peace with being an irritant. I will bring my own bamboo cutlery to the party. And I won’t apologise.People mock the youthful stereotype of the rebel without a cause, but frankly, I’m on their side. Causes can be gained, but the spirit? That’s something else.Still, I’ve yet to convince my mother. “We’ll see how much you love rebelliousness when you’re a parent,” she says. “Anyway, eat up.

Laverne still has an outstanding £40,000 loan to the company which could now be at risk, while other investors also face losing out.Staff at the website, which raised at least £4m from shareholders, were not paid January’s wages and will now have to see what can be recovered by administrators to pay their salaries.Many freelance journalists are owed thousands by the site, which lost £1.8m in the last financial year and was known for its relatively generous freelance rates in a struggling industry.Dominic Hill, the company’s only remaining director, told staff that he had no choice but to put The Pool into administration: “As a director and shareholder, I have a duty to do this as the business is now insolvent and we have exhausted all rescue ideasplans.”He told staff that the administrator would “explain the process which will include how you can claim for January’s salary and any redundancy payment you may be due”.He added: “Like you, I loved The Pool and what it stood for, and I’m sorry that I let you and it down.

It is the film’s second coup – the first was securing Springsteen’s blessing and permission to use 16 of his songs on the soundtrack, without which the film would not have been made. “It was quite simple,” said Manzoor. “Bruce loved my book and trusted me and Gurinder.”It used to be hard for film-makers to get major artists to give them permission to use their catalogues. But following the enormous success of Queen biopic Bohemian Rhapsody and the impending arrival of the Elton John film Rocketman, it seems like artists have realised that backing biopics and celebratory movies is a way of reaffirming their cultural relevance and opening new revenue streams as traditional incomes from record sales are on the wane. Although the forthcoming Bowie biopic Stardust – starring Johnny Flynn – has been made without the involvement of the late star’s estate, there’s a Mötley Crüe biopic out on Netflix in March, featuring the no-longer-touring band’s old music and four new songs written for the film. Also on the way is a Céline Dion movie, The Power of Love, while the Who’s Roger Daltrey recently suggested that his long-mooted biopic of drummer Keith Moon is finally in the offing.Bohemian Rhapsody has also been accused of “straightwashing” the flamboyant, bisexual Mercury, (who admittedly guarded his own sexuality, but in less permissive times). However, in the era of social media, gossip and fake news, a biopic or similar vehicle enables an artist – or their estate – to tell their own story, to present a marketable version of history or deliver their own truths. “It’s a standard line in PR,” says public relations author and lecturer, Keith Butterick. “If you’re selling a brand or product, you choose events which fit in with your own version of reality.”This was commonplace at the dawn of pop, when Elvis Presley or Cliff Richard films gave fans another place to see the stars and presented an idealised public image: Richard’s squeaky clean Summer Holiday persona endured for decades. Pink Floyd’s 1979 project The Wall is an example of what film writer and broadcaster Matthew Sweet calls “gesamtkunstwerk, where an album and a film achieve similar status”. But in the biopic era, artists with less or no involvement became reluctant to allow their music to feature in films that might misrepresent them. The 2014 Jimi Hendrix biopic Jimi: All Is By My Side was refused the use of any of his music, making do with other artists’ songs from the era.Some acts are happier for their younger, wilder selves to be dramatised in celluloid. Mötley Crüe biopic The Dirt – based on the notorious 2001 memoir – is described as containing “outrageous, salacious excess” and “hilarity”, although culture writer Fiona Sturges expects some sanitation: “If you reread The Dirt in the current climate it would be deeply shocking. The film has got to make them look fun, but harmlessly so.”Similarly, we’ll have to wait and see whether Peter Jackson’s new edit of Michael Lindsay-Hogg’s unobtainable 1970 Beatles film Let It Be – from hours of unseen footage – will further explore the tensions of the Fab Four’s final days or cheerily dismiss them. “Like any PR campaign,” said Butterick, “you can create your own myth”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8313637159eba02ee4ceb90776510264ba001eb9/0_63_5105_3062/master/5105.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=27b2bd9d8932d4bb271dcc5c805df9c5","title":"one three uk firms activate plans move operations abroad no deal brexit iod survey","story":"Survey finds surge of smaller companies activating plans to move operations abroadNearly one in three British businesses are planning to relocate some of their operations abroad or have already shifted them to cope with a hard Brexit, according to a leading lobby group.More than one in 10 had already set up operations outside the UK as the prospect of a no-deal Brexit becomes more likely amid Westminster gridlock. Most firms considering a move were looking to open offices inside the European Union, said the IoD, which represents 30,000 firms.Edwin Morgan, the IoD’s interim director general, said: “We can no more ignore the real consequences of delay and confusion than business leaders can ignore the hard choices that they face in protecting their companies.“Change is a necessary and often positive part of doing business, but the unavoidable disruption and increased trade barriers that no deal would bring are entirely unproductive.”Large companies such as Sony and Panasonic have relocated their European headquarters from the UK to the continent, but the IoD said smaller companies were also enacting plans. Morgan said a surge of smaller firms had activated their plans in the last week.“While the actions of big companies have been making headlines, these figures suggest that smaller enterprises are increasingly considering taking the serious step of moving some operations abroad. For these firms, typically with tighter resources, to be thinking about such a costly course of action makes clear the precarious position they are in.”Business leaders are becoming increasingly concerned over a build-up of uncertainty while the government attempts to negotiate changes to the Irish backstop, which would keep the UK inside the European customs union in advance of a trade deal being reached.At the weekend the British Chamber of Commerce (BCC) said thousands of firms were gearing up to move operations abroad or stockpiling goods to combat the worst effects of Brexit. On Wednesday Carolyn Fairbairn, head of the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), Britain’s most powerful business lobby group, warned that businesses were “accelerating” their plans for a no-deal Brexit“I don’t think there will be a single business this morning who is stopping or halting their no-deal planning,” she said, adding: “I fear they may even be accelerating it.”Paul Jones, director of Arquebus Solutions, a Coventry-based security consultancy that tracks the illegal trafficking of firearms, said he moved part of the company to Malta to stay inside the EU.“We work with agencies such as the United Nations and the European commission to support countries that are less advanced in dealing with the threat posed by the criminal use and supply of firearms.”He said: “We are proud to promote ourselves as a UK company and the union flag is an integral part of our logo. However, we have had to make contingency plans to enable us to continue to be eligible for funding from the EU and to trade with EU member states.”Ever since the vote to leave the EU in 2016, business groups including the BCC and the CBI have lobbied ministers, arguing that Britain’s exporters needed access to the customs union, which allows goods to be imported tariff-free. But the prime minister has insisted that the UK must leave both the customs union and single market if the referendum result of 2016 is to be fully respected.Other small-to-medium-sized businesses are now close to executing plans for a partial move. Tim Hardman, managing director of the London-based Niche Science \u0026amp Technology, said he had recently returned from a trip to Vienna to view office space for an offshoot inside the EU, which currently sets the regulations for the UK’s pharmaceutical industry.“Britain has been at the forefront of developing the EU’s regulations. Now we are going to be a backwater with no influence at all,” he said.His business, which employs 18 workers, many of them scientists with PhDs, runs clinical trials and research into medical drugs from its UK base. It has also grown over the last 20 years using EU grant funding, which the firm is reconciled to losing, he said.“Vienna is a nice place, but we didn’t need to do it and setting up an office and employing people is all extra costs to us.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d18fe4ceb3eea3b5780e88d5eed7b1bf90348049/308_736_6241_3744/master/6241.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b57cd65d557bcf0469cfc08f5d82ff81","title":"poorer young workers face class ceiling uk study suggests","story":"Employees say disadvantaged have a harder time progressing than two generations agoA majority of UK workers believe disadvantaged young people find it harder to progress in the workplace today than their contemporaries did two generations ago, according to research commissioned by the former education secretary Justine Greening.The study, undertaken by the Social Mobility Pledge initiative founded by Greening, suggests the majority of UK workers believe young people can face a “class ceiling” in attempting to secure jobs and promotions.Greening said it indicated that workplaces for the baby boomer generation may have been more accommodating of class differences than millennials in the workplace today.Greening, who was born in Rotherham and has described experiencing unemployment in her family as a youngster, said the findings suggested class ersity at work may be regressing from generation to generation. “This is hugely concerning, given that the UK already has such a poor record in terms of social mobility,” she said.“Enabling people to get on in life regardless of their background drives prosperity in local communities, businesses and the national economy. This really is a defining issue facing the UK currently and employers in all sectors have a central role to play in solving it.”Greening set up the Social Mobility Pledge after resigning from Theresa May’s cabinet last year following a bid to move her from the education brief to the Department for Work and Pensions.The MP, who has a slim majority in her Putney seat in south-west London, has indicated she may be keen to run as a candidate in a Tory leadership election from the party’s progressive wing, which is also likely to include the current work and pensions secretary, Amber Rudd.Greening, a supporter of a second EU referendum, has been outspoken previously about the limited offer that Tories have for young, working-class voters. She has suggested she had intended to scrap tuition fees in favour of a graduate contribution scheme, because of concerns tuition fees of £9,250 per year could start to put off poorer students.The pledge encourages employers to set up links with local schools and colleges, offer apprenticeships and adopt open recruitment policies such as name-blind or “contextual” recruitment.

It may depend on their first game, England at home – an evening of collisions hinging on a few set plays – followed by Scotland at Murrayfield, opponents who will test them in very different ways.What was most impressive about the victory over the All Blacks was the way Ireland held their defensive shape, minds remaining clear when bodies tired. They are the masters of the breakdown, quickly gauging the tolerance threshold of referees, and they have become smart under Schmidt, rarely deviating from their script. But perhaps the best way to tackle them is to start quickly and make them learn new lines. Ireland have led at half-time in 18 of their past 19 Tests and the last time they overcame an interval deficit to win was in Argentina in 2014.Key player Best. Under Schmidt, Ireland have become a team in which no one is indispensable but the calm authority of their captain, very much a leader in the New Zealand mould, who sets an example through his deeds, would be missed.Gatland is not given to outbursts of emotion but even he would be moved should his time in the Six Nations with Wales end with a title decider against Ireland, who gave him his first international job, the lone blemish on his coaching CV.Wales have gained a reputation for being slow starters, so France away is not the worst of openers given the hosts are a juggernaut that needs a few turns of the key to get going. In the past couple of years, Wales have developed a counterattacking game and no matter how many back-row injuries they suffer, they never seem to run out of turnover specialists. Their set pieces are not the strongest, their back ision not the biggest or quickest and there has been a change of guard at half-back. However, Gatland’s teams tend to add up to more than the sum of their parts and, based on fitness, defensive organisation and the eye for a chance, are major contenders.Key player Ross Moriarty. Without Taulupe Faletau again, Wales will need the power of the back-rower, who contributes as much in defence as in attack. He brings an edge, not always stopping to count to 10.Last year 3rdTownsend is keenly aware of his side’s less than impressive away record. Scoland’s two matches on the road are at grounds where they have never won in the Six Nations era, the Stade de France and Twickenham. They have won seven matches – five in Rome – and lost 41 away, and in 13 of the 19 years since Italy have been part of the championship, they have drawn a blank outside Murrayfield. This year they have two home matches before they have to scour for travel sickness remedies. Italy are followed by Ireland, and Scotland will need to at times temper their gung-ho approach, one reason why Greig Laidlaw remains an essential piece on Townsend’s chess board.The scrum-half appreciates when territory is needed and when to fire a back ision containing Finn Russell and Stuart Hogg. Where Scotland are giving themselves a chance away is the harder edge they are developing at forward, as Glasgow and Edinburgh have shown in Europe. They may not win the title but with Ireland and Wales visiting Murrayfield, they may decide who wears the crown.Key player Stuart McInally. Scotland have become renowned for their derring-do behind but to progress from a team who turn it on only at home they need some dogs of war and few are more combative than the Edinburgh hooker.When France secured the grand slam in 2010, they had won more matches in the first decade of the Six Nations than any other country. As the tournament completes its second 10 years, they are in third place, behind England and Ireland with Wales catching up: the last time they won away other than in Rome or Edinburgh was in 2011. Key player Wesley Fofana. The centre’s skills evoke the flair of France’s past and in his last year of Test rugby the 31-year old will be the fulcrum of the team’s renewed appetite for attack.Last year 5thThe fixture list has not been kind to Eddie Jones’s England: trips to last season’s top two, Ireland and Wales, come in the first three rounds. But come through those and they finish with Italy and Scotland at home, fixtures they have not lost in the Six Nations era.The 2016 and 2017 champions will be the underdogs in Dublin, but with the Vunipola brothers fit again, Manu Tuilagi starting and Farrell in charge, England will not lack bite. England were the last team to win in Dublin in the Six Nations: victory would avenge Ireland’s achievement last year in becoming the first team to win at Twickenham in the tournament for six years, and it promises to be a thunderous encounter.Jones started his reign by talking about his desire for players to turn into problem solvers on the field but has found they are more comfortable in structure and security, and they resembled Ireland in some ways last autumn when they were within a disallowed try of beating New Zealand. Quick service will be needed from scrum-half but they possess a clarity they lacked even in the two seasons when winning the title. Unlikely to be at their most efficient until the World Cup, but England will take some breaking down.Key player Billy Vunipola. Has been missed in the last two Six Nations, making one start, when he was palpably not match fit in Dublin two years ago. England’s game will hinge on a player who can make ground from a standing start and offload.Last year 6thIt is six years since Italy won at home in the Six Nations, with their last victory in the championship coming in Scotland in 2015. Treviso, under the former All Black Kieran Crowley, have made significant strides but with only three of O’Shea’s squad playing outside Italy, defeat has become ingrained. They showed against Scotland last March, when victory was denied them at the last, they have one game in them. It will be the tournament’s last hurrah, surely, for the magnificent Parisse, and Italy will miss the injured back-row Jake Polledri. After 12 wins in 19 years and a world ranking of 15th, Italy’s place in the championship will continue to be questioned. Key player Sebastian Negri. It has to be someone other than Parisse if Italy are to end their four-year wait for a Six Nations victory. Italy will miss Polledri but in Negri, a Hartpury College product, they have a tackle-breaking carrier and prolific tackler who never stops."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d1ddff91d1309bc5295782ad3ae245ae1e3c43b6/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b11eb9e5d5d20708c943d3233e94b650","title":"super bowl predictions new england patriots los angeles rams","story":"One of our writers called the teams for the Super Bowl back in September. Will he get the winner correct this time too?Block the Rams’ interior pass rush. Tom Brady’s passer rating has taken a significant dip against inside pressure compared to pressure from the edge this season. In Aaron Donald, Ndamukong Suh, and Michael Brockers, the Rams have the best interior defensive line in football. OCWhat a mockery Bill Belichick makes of pro football. Sony Michel, James White and Rex Burkhead: eight touchdowns in two playoff games? The ground game which limits chances for Tom Brady to err also provides him with enough gas to crush you late. No reason to stop now. DLForce the Rams to put the game in Jared Goff’s hands. It’s been no secret that the run game has been key for Los Angeles: CJ Anderson has been one of the stories of the postseason and if Todd Gurley is healthy, he could be a game changer. Goff can be a great quarterback, but he has also had some miserable games during the regular season. Belichick may gamble on Goff having a poor performance rather than let the running backs eat up yards and potentially the clock. HFThe same as they have the last few weeks: establish the run early and deploy the same playcalling voodoo that made Chris Jones, Dee Ford, Justin Houston, Melvin Ingram and Joey Bosa turn invisible to take Aaron Donald and Ndamukong Suh out of the game. Build long drives that ensure the Rams’ defenders are too tired to stop Brady from showing off in the fourth quarter. PBGet rid of the ball quickly. Jared Goff tends to hold onto the ball too long (the fifth-highest average in the league). New England’s defense struggles when the ball is out quickly, due to the lack of a consistent pass-rush. OCLA’s young and talented roster includes the likes of Todd Gurley, who must bounce off of his exercise bike and into a run-establishing offense, right at the start. That’ll give Belichick less of an opportunity to throw confusing kitchen-sink coverages at LA’s kid QB, providing Goff with play-action paradise in the secondary. DLCapitalize on the Patriots’ mistakes. New England have not been perfect in the playoffs. While they crushed the Los Angeles Chargers, they needed overtime to beat the Kansas City Chiefs in the AFC Championship Game after throwing two interceptions. They also struggled more away from home, going 3-5 on the road in the regular season despite going undefeated at Gillette Stadium. The Patriots aren’t immune from committing a turnover in a big spot, and if they do the Rams are going to need to turn in into points. HFShow us that the hitherto flawless New England offensive line is more vulnerable when you can bring pressure right up the middle instead of only off the edges. On the other side of the ball, alternate Todd Gurley and CJ Anderson to keep New England off-balance, and become the first team this postseason to win the time-of-possession battle against the Patriots. PBThe Patriots need a throwback game from Rob Gronkowski. He has been used more as a blocker than a pass-catcher this year, but he will have to be at his multi-dimensional best in what could be the final game of his career. OCWill all eyes on Julian Edelman, Rob Gronkowski, and even James White, who Belichick called on early and often against the Chiefs, Phillip Dorsett will have his opportunities. The 26-year-old is reliable and should face a series of single coverage situations. That he’s virtually unknown outside New England makes him the ideal candidate to steal the Big Show. DLThere’s no need to get too cute with this prediction: Tom Brady. Since making his debut in the 2001 season, which ended with him leading the Patriots to a 20-17 win over the then-St Louis Rams in the Super Bowl, Brady has established himself as one of the greatest players in NFL history. Although he’s had a subpar season by his standards, and age may finally be catching up with him, he’s still dangerous and he knows this could be his last shot at his sixth ring. HFBoring to say it, but it’s Brady. The real key to avoiding sacks is getting the ball out quickly and accurately, and the consistency with which he has found open team-mates on short drops the past couple of weeks is the reason New England have been so hard to stop. PBAaron Donald is the best player in football. He has the ability to single-handedly dominate any game he plays. The Patriots will have to get creative with their gameplan to work around his brilliance. OCIf Aaron Donald is double covered than it may be up to Ndamukong Suh to do something the Chargers and Chiefs could not: pressure Brady in the pocket and put him on the ground. The Patriots’ offensive line have been spectacular, but this is a different challenge and Suh is the key to unlocking New England’s interior line. DLNew England’s offensive line is well aware of Aaron Donald, which means that they could be forced to pay extra attention to him. That, of course, would open things up for the likes of Ndamukong Suh or Cory Littleton to make a championship-sealing sack on Brady. Donald makes the whole Rams defense much more dangerous. Brady is a whole different player when he’s scared, and they have the personnel to scare him. HFAaron Donald. Brady is yet to be sacked on 90 dropbacks in this postseason. He has only been hit three times. If he stays as clean as that again, the Patriots will win. Aaron Donald is the best interior pass rusher in the league, and he needs to show it. PBTrey Flowers. Flowers is the key to the Patriots’ hit-and-miss pass-rush. He finished third in the NFL in quarterback pressures per-game, ahead of the likes of Donald, JJ Watt, and Von Miller. OCRex Burkhead: a generic, lunch-pail running back who seems like the ideal prop pick. Of course he’ll score first. Of course he’ll score the Super Bowl winning touchdown. After injuries, he touched the ball 56 times all season, but he scored against the Chargers, and there he was against the Chiefs, racking up 41 key yards and running in the game-winning touchdown. Classic Belichick: beware the Burkhead. DLTyler Higbee. There’s always at least one semi-obscure offensive player who makes a huge reception in the Super Bowl. Just ask a Patriots fan about David Tyree (especially if you want to ruin their day). So, Higbee’s my suggestion. A 2016 fourth-round draft pick, the young tight end made a name for himself in the NFC Championship Game by catching a key touchdown that helped Los Angeles beat the New Orleans Saints, so don’t be shocked if Goff goes to him again if the Patriots defense swarms his more frequent targets. HFI don’t know if you can really call either of them unheralded at this point, but I want to give a nod here to Greg Zuerlein and Johnny Hekker. Everybody was so busy talking about blown interference calls last week that we barely stopped to dwell on the fact that Greg The Leg had just kicked a 57-yard walk-off field goal to win a playoff game in overtime. This after tying the game up with a 48-yarder at the end of regulation. And the Rams might never have even had a shot without Hekker picking up a fourth-down fake punt completion. Don’t bet against Sean McVay pulling out another trick play, but even if he doesn’t, these two are the best kicking tandem in the league. PBNew England Patriots 24-21 Los Angeles Rams. Every time the Patriots play in the Super Bowl it’s a close game. Their differential in Super Bowls in the Brady-Belichick era is +3 their largest margin of victory has been six points. This game will be no different. The Rams have elite-level talent all over the field on both sides of the ball, but I’m backing Brady and Belichick to pick out and exploit LA’s weaknesses. OCNew England Patriots 34-28 Los Angeles Rams. Considering the fast track under the dome in Atlanta and the points these teams have put up, you can expect video game levels of offense throughout. It only matters who has the ball last, and it’s Brady and Belichick: we all know the script by now. DLNew England Patriots 24-27 Los Angeles Rams. While it’s never wise to bet against the Patriots, it’s possible to say that they overachieved just to make it this far, coming out of one of their least impressive regular seasons of the BradyBelichick era and requiring a coin flip to help them to beat the Chiefs. The Patriots Dynasty began with a three-point win over a very talented Rams team, it would be poetic for it to finish with a three-point loss to a Rams team that just so happens to also have a great young quarterback in Goff and a celebrated head coach in Sean McVay. HFNew England Patriots 31-33 Los Angeles Rams. Because (humblebrag alert) Rams over Patriots was my preseason pick for the Super Bowl, and I can’t come this far and back out now."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/90931905203eeace279f5fc927d6239d5d7ad6eb/335_405_2972_1783/master/2972.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2c78f470c2770e4af4a6d4c9b9903a78","title":"england ireland six nations ugo monye rugby union","story":"When I was at Harlequins we had a psychologist, Pieter Kruger, who now works at Munster. I always remember how he would tell us the times you’re most likely to concede points is the 10 minutes before half-time and the 10 minutes after. If anything defines this Ireland team, it is their ability to strike during those moments, in those championship minutes.As half-time approaches you start thinking about the messages to be discussed, you’re looking at the clock and you find your attention is split between the changing room and the pitch – that can be the case just after half-time as well. Ireland have identified that and ruthlessly exploited it.Under Joe Schmidt they have developed a combination of ability, fitness and an understanding of precisely how they play the game, and they have the leadership to pull it off. I go back to their opening match last year. You can talk about championship minutes all you want but if you do not have players fit enough to go through 41 phases in the Stade de France then you won’t execute a thing.We know all about their aerial threat but it is the added dimension of the specialist plays that I love. Every week you have a couple up your sleeve, it may come out on the first play, maybe the third or fourth. Often you try to set a picture to the opposition of what they are expecting, so Ireland’s first play may be Bundee Aki or Tadhg Furlong hitting up, just to reinforce that picture the opposition has been watching all week on video. Then you throw in something different. CJ Stander’s try at Twickenham last year, after Furlong’s reverse pass, is a perfect example.It’s not Baa-Baas stuff, who make it up in the pub when they’re feeling creative instead it’s the dark arts of analysis. It looks so easy for Ireland on the pitch but all the work is done Monday to Friday. It shows what detail Schmidt goes into with his coaching, and just makes it that much harder for the opposition. Ireland already have the physicality to stress teams with power runners but if it’s in the back of the defender’s head that they have these tricks up their sleeves, it just adds to the pressure. When I think of specialist plays it embodies what rugby is, it’s the combination of intellect with physicality. Isn’t that the way it should be played? One moment beating a team up, the next out-thinking them.So having said all that, how do you stop Ireland? It’s a question I’ve heard a lot recently – they are performing as the best team in the world and deserve appropriate respect – but what I want to hear is: “What are England bringing to the table?” Far too often teams fall into the trap of focusing so much on the opposition they forget what they are about themselves.In that sense, I’m encouraged by Eddie Jones’s team selection. Let’s take the back three. Is Elliot Daly as good as Mike Brown aerially? No. But can Brown kick penalties from inside his own half? It’s not going to be a try-fest, there aren’t going to be bonus points, it’s going to come down to narrow margins so the fact England have failed to score a try in Dublin since 2011 means Daly’s boot is a massive weapon. He has that ability to change the game in a second but he can also do what most other players cannot with his kicking.Eddie has also been blessed by the fact Jack Nowell has played at full-back in his past two matches for Exeter. He’s only been back fit for the past two European matches but he made 20 carries against Munster at Thomond Park – that’s unbelievable work rate. And it’s not only what he brings in and around the ruck, or even how hard he is to tackle, it is his work right across the pitch in both attack and defence.With Daly and Nowell England are essentially operating with two guys capable of dealing with aerial threats because Sexton, Joey Carbery and Murray will find holes in the back field if you don’t marshal it well enough. Nowell has the experience of playing against Murray a couple of weeks ago and didn’t drop a thing.You have two guys who can play full-back, marshal the back field and are very different in terms of what they offer in attack – and then you have an absolute gas man on the right wing in Jonny May.

There is a long opening monologue, well delivered by Adrian Lester, that strikes me as structurally clumsy, but this is a play that increasingly gets under your skin through its ability to provoke feeling without lapsing into sentimentality.Majok presents us with two parallel storylines. Eddie, an unemployed New Jersey truck driver, tries to get back with his estranged wife, Ani, who is paraplegic as a result of a road accident. We also see John, a Princeton PhD student with cerebral palsy, employing a young female carer, Jess, who scrapes a living working in bars. Majok captures the tetchiness in both relationships: Jess irks John by using a term like “differently abled” while the free-swearing Ani greets Eddie’s offer of help by snarling: “You’re not doing penance on me.” Yet Majok movingly shows four people bound together by mutual need: in two of the best scenes, we see Jess showering the naked John and Eddie lovingly bathing his grumpy wife.The running theme is of people isolated by disability or poverty. So anxious is Majok to avoid the syrupy that she shows John behaving with implausible cruelty towards Jess. Otherwise this is a play about our dependence on other people that is impeccably acted.Lester, looking unusually burly, suggests Eddie is an instinctive man driven by a craving for his wife’s surly companionship. Katy Sullivan, who was in the original New York cast and who competed in the 2012 Paralympics, captures vividly Ani’s wary toughness and blunt humour. Jack Hunter pins down John’s mix of arrogance and vulnerability, and Emily Barber as Jess neatly embodies an America in which even the educationally qualified end up on the breadline. Fluently directed by Hall, it’s a play that argues, like John Donne, that no man or woman is an island entire of itself but a part of the main."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9ef643c34a9dea23688765c907eea5c80cf9c9ab/0_743_5792_3475/master/5792.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ccf7a402a3d81a5c69440e2d46ed0768","title":"jo brand funniest things","story":"The standup, writer and actor on the things that make her laugh the mostI equally loved Lee Cornes and Nick Hancock.

The View 20 is Honor’s attempt to show that is has the beans to step out from the shadow of just being Huawei’s cheaper sub-brand with a top-flight phone of its own.The all-screen front and a wild colour scheme on the back make the View 20 an eye-catching device, but some might think the V-shaped light reflecting etching looks a little cheap.The View 20 is the first phone on the market to offer a so-called hole-punch notch - a small hole in the top left of the display through which the selfie camera pokes. That leaves the rest of the front, bar a small chin at the bottom, entirely dedicated to its massive 6.4in FHD+ LCD screen. It’s really quite impressive, and unlike some other notch designs, you quickly forget the little hole is there, particularly when playing video full-screen.The display is good too, very bright and with excellent viewing angles. It’s not quite as vibrant and colour rich as some of the best OLED displays out there, but it’s really not that far off.At 8.1mm thick, 75.4mm wide and 180g in weight, the View 20 is also fairly light, slim and manageable for a phone with such a large screen, coming in 5g lighter than the OnePlus 6T and 2mm narrower and 28g lighter than the iPhone XS Max. The curvature of the glass back and metal edges aid your grip considerably compared with some of the flatter competition.The bottom of the phone has an average down-firing speaker and USB-C port for power and connectivity, while the top has a headphone socket – a real rarity in 2019.The Honor View20 has the same processor as Huawei’s current king the Mate 20 Pro, and an option of either 6GB or 8GB of RAM. As such it is fast, powerful and snappy all round, matching the best of the rest powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 845, even in gaming.Battery life is also good, but not quite class leading, lasting about 31 hours between charges.Starting at 7am on day one, it would easily last until lunch on the second day, dying at about 2pm, meaning it would make it through even the heaviest of days and nights out without battery anxiety.Call quality, even with the tiny speaker right on the top of the phone, was excellent. The View 20 was also able to get a usable 4G data connection in more places than rivals, similar to the Mate 20 Pro.The View 20 is one of Honor’s first phones with its new Magic UI 2 software, which is the manufacturer’s version of Android 9 Pie.While Honor says that it will differentiate Magic UI over time, right now it is essentially Huawei’s EMUI, as seen on the Mate 20 Pro, but with a new name.As such it is a bit like Marmite. Some are going to love it, others will hate it and wish it ran a more Google-like version of Android. For instance, it comes out of the box with icons for every app on the homescreen mirroring Apple’s iOS. There is an option to enable the more traditional Android app drawer, but it comes with an old-school button rather than the more modern swiping gesture to open it.You also get the option of the traditional three-button navigation keys, a joystick-like navigation dock and gesture navigation, which is good but lacks a way to quickly jump to a previously used app.Aesthetically Magic UI isn’t as attractive or modern-looking as Android on the Pixel 3 or OnePlus 6T, but it supports full system themes and has added power-saving features that can extend battery life dramatically if needed.Honor promises to deliver two Android major version updates and small updates as and when required for the View 20.The big fingerprint scanner on the back is well placed, accurate and very fast indeed – easily one of the best on the market.The View 20 also has camera-based 2D face unlock, which is also very fast in all but poor lighting conditions, but is potentially less secure, particularly compared with more sophisticated 3D face recognition as found on the Mate 20 Pro or latest iPhones.The camera has been Honor’s biggest weak point in the past, but not any more.The View 20 has one of the best cameras available at any price point. The new 48-megapixel camera – one of the first on the market – is paired with a secondary sensor, which is used to capture depth information for portrait mode and other bits.While more megapixels doesn’t necessarily mean better photos, Honor’s camera is genuinely better. By default it shoots 12-megapixel images, combining four pixels from the camera’s sensor into one for the photo. That helps remove artefacts and boosts low-light performance.Photos come out looking richly detailed, well coloured and simply blowing most of the View 20’s competition out of the water. Low light performance is also excellent without using the special Night mode, which didn’t appear to improve much when activated. Even the zoom, which is 2x lossless then up to 10x digital zoom, matches some of the best from Apple and Huawei.Alongside the 12-megapixel shooting mode there’s the option to turn on Honor’s AI Ultra Clarity mode that shoots full 48-megapixel photos by combining a series of frames into one image. It only really works well in medium to good lighting conditions outside and it takes several second of holding the phone steady, but the images it produces are fantastic. They capture a level of detail only achieved through zooming, but across a full wide-angle image. Great fun.The camera app is good too, and there are plenty of modes to have fun with, including a Pro mode for shooting in RAW, 960 frames-per-second slow motion video and a reasonable portrait mode, which can only be used when the camera can detect a face.Honor’s AI photography system is also much improved over previous versions, reducing the highly oversaturated images it used to produce. I still prefer to make adjustments to colour and contrast manually, but it didn’t totally ruin photos as it has before and I think most will probably just leave it on now. I still wish there was a quick toggle for HDR mode, rather than having to tap through a menu to activate it.The 25-megapixel selfie camera, which pokes through the hole in the screen, is really good too. It captures a great amount of detail, but there’s a surprisingly good skin-smoothing beauty mode if images filled with every fine line and pore aren’t to your taste.The Honor View 20 is genuinely brilliant phone that gives the very best in the market a run for their money. But then you realise that it costs half as much as an iPhone XS and is a full £400 cheaper than Huawei’s Mate 20 Pro.At £500 the Honor View 20 is an absolute bargain. It’s fast, lasts a long time, looks good, feels great and fits a giant screen in a still-manageable body. Its rear-mounted fingerprint sensor is really good, but not quite cutting edge. It is the first phone out of the gate with a hole-punch notch, which is a marked improvement on other notch designs, and it’s even still got a headphone socket.Much of this matches the other flagship bargain, the OnePlus 6T, but where the View 20 is unrivalled is its camera, which is as good as the most expensive phones out there and blows the competition out of the water.The software might not be to everyone’s taste, but it’s relatively adaptable and easy to live with. The LCD screen is inferior to a good OLED screen, but whether anyone will really notice or care is debatable.It’s not cheap by any stretch of the imagination, but if you want a big, top-end phone with a cracking camera at a much more affordable price the Honor View 20 is it.Cons: Magic UI not to everyone’s taste, no expandable storage, no water resistance, no wireless charging This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

He made his announcement on the first day of February, which is designated Black History Month, a time on the calendar for commemorations and educational programs about significant people and events in the history of the African diaspora.On Martin Luther King Day in the US last month, Booker spoke in South Carolina, as did a potential Democratic rival for the nomination, Bernie Sanders.Ostensibly, the politicians were on hand to celebrate the life and work of the civil rights leader. But for both, it was an opportunity to speak candidly about race to black voters who will play a gigantic role in selecting the Democratic nominee for 2020.Following Kamala Harris’s announcement about her run on MLK Day, Booker is the second black candidate in the race. No Republicans have yet announced they will challenge Trump for the GOP nomination.On Friday morning, Booker has planned call-in interviews with radio shows that are especially popular with African American and Latinx listeners. Later in the morning he will go on TV to be interviewed on the popular daytime chatshow The View, which has a majority female audience. His mother will be sitting in the audience.Born in Washington DC, but raised in New Jersey, Booker made a name for himself as Newark mayor, the state’s largest city, by personally shoveling the snow of residents. He has $4.1m left in his mayoral campaign coffers that could also be used to assist his presidential run. Rather than opening an exploratory committee to test the waters, Booker took the direct step to open a campaign straight to the public, seeking the Democratic nomination.He is aligning with many other prominent Democratic White House contenders by forswearing all donations from corporate political action committees (Pacs) and federal lobbyists to his campaign, which he has titled “Cory 2020”. A prominent Booker supporter, San Francisco attorney Steve Phillips, says he is working on millions of dollars in committed donations to a so-called super Pac that would boost the senator’s candidacy, but Booker’s campaign is openly against super Pacs playing any role in the presidential race.Reuters contributed to this report"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/120feb54af80fe9103f475596c4a70658a2482b6/0_7_5000_2999/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=db48297066af902a4485dc3b95cab2d1","title":"polar vortex 2019 america latest news cold temperatures","story":"The bitter cold gripping the American midwest is expected to turn into spring-like weather by early next week, according to forecasters.Just days after arctic conditions, temperatures are expected to climb by as much as 80 degrees Fahrenheit in some regions. Experts said the rapid thaw is unprecedented, and could create its own problems – bursting pipes, flooding rivers and crumbling roads.Already, the blast of cold air known as the polar vortex has killed at least 16 people, including a man found frozen in his backyard in a Milwaukee suburb on Thursday. Dozens of others were sent to hospitals in the region.At least 144 people in Illinois visited hospitals for cold-related injuries over two days. Most of the injuries were hypothermia or frostbite, according to a public health.The weather was caused by a blast of cold air from the North Pole being pushed south into North America. That made some parts of Illinois colder than Antarctica on Wednesday, and with the windchill factor made Los Angeles feel as much as 100 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than some parts of the midwest.Many places remained painfully cold on Thursday, including in western New York, where a storm brought face-stinging winds, sub-zero temperatures and up to 20in (51cm) of snow in some places. In New York City, about 200 firefighters battling a blaze in a commercial building took turns getting warm on buses.However, places such as Rockford, Illinois, where the mercury dropped to a record-setting -31F (-35C) on Thursday morning, should warm to 50F (10C) by Monday.The dramatic warm-up will offer respite from the bone-chilling cold which canceled school, closed businesses and halted trains. However, the same cycle could crack water mains, homeowners pipes and reveal potholes in roads. Scores of vehicles will be left with flat tires and bent rims.Masters, from Weather Underground, said the polar vortex was “rotating up into Canada” and not expected to return in the next couple of weeks. If it does return in late February, “it won’t be as intense.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5b0551189c04cc291fcb7d049e4059f7ac79b674/13_481_3036_1821/master/3036.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=83e62b419389a57248406d5bbaeedd5f","title":"african churches boom london backstreets a picture essay","story":"In 20th century Britain, migrants from Nigeria and Ghana founded churches to build communities, as did the Caribbean peoples before them in the 1940s and 1950sby Simon Dawson  Reuters. Words by William SchombergAfrican churches opened their doors in London from the 1960s, followed by a second wave in the 1980s. Migrants, many of them from Nigeria and Ghana, sought to build communities and maintain cultural connections with their home countries by founding their own churches, often in private homes, schools and office spaces.On a cold, grey Sunday morning, in a street lined with shuttered builders’ yards and storage units, songs of prayer in the West African language of Yoruba ring out from a former warehouse that is now a church. The congregation, almost entirely dressed in white robes, steadily grows to around 70 people as musicians playing drums, a keyboard and a guitar pick up the pace of the hymns. Some women prostrate themselves on the floor in prayer. In the sparse formerly industrial building, its interior brightened by touches of gold paint, a speaker reminds the group of a list of banned activities – no smoking, no drinking of alcohol, no practicing of black magic.In a street outside, a pastor flicks holy water over the car of a woman who wants a blessing to ward off the risk of accidents. The busy scene at the Celestial Church of Christ is repeated at a half a dozen other African Christian temples on the same drab street and in the adjacent roads – one corner of the thriving African church community in south London.Around 250 black majority churches are believed to operate in the borough of Southwark, where 16 percent of the population identifies as having African ethnicity.  Southwark represents the biggest concentration of African Christians in the world outside the continent with an more than 20,000 congregants attending new black majority churches each Sunday, according to research conducted in 2013 by the University of Roehampton.Reflecting the different waves of migration to Britain in the 20th Century, these African places of worship followed the Caribbean churches that appeared in the late 1940s and 1950s as workers and their families arrived from Jamaica and other former British colonies.As the African communities grew, the churches moved into bigger spaces in bingo halls, cinemas and warehouses, gathering congregations of up to 500 people where services are streamed online by volunteers with video cameras.There is a striking contrast with the empty pews at many traditional Church of England churches where congregations have dwindled for years.“We pray for this country,” said Abosede Ajibade, a 54-year-old Nigerian who moved to Britain in 2002 and works for an office maintenance company.“People here brought Christianity to Africa but it doesn’t feel like they serve Jesus Christ any more.”Anyone travelling through south London on a Sunday morning will see worshippers, often dressed in dazzlingly coloured African clothes, making their way to churches, each with their different styles of worship.Hymns are sung only in African languages in some temples, or only in English at others. Some pastors arrange for worshippers to take full immersion baptisms in the cold of the English Channel. Others believe that when congregants suddenly start speaking in unknown languages it marks the presence of the Holy Spirit.The research by the University of Roehampton found that many churches have in common a drive for professional advancement, a commitment to spend three hours or more at Sunday service and typically very loud worship.“That is how we express our joy and gratitude to God,” Andrew Adeleke, a senior pastor at the House of Praise, one of the biggest African churches in Southwark, in a former theatre.“The church is not supposed to be a graveyard,” Adeleke said. “It is supposed to be a temple of celebration and worship and the beauty is to be able to express our love to God, even when things are not perfect in our lives.”For some, the noise from amplified services is a problem, leading to complaints to local authorities from residents. But many churches face bigger challenges than unhappy neighbours: some provide food for people struggling to make ends meet, or work with young people at risk of recruitment by gangs.Andrew Rogers, senior lecturer in Practical Theology at the University and author of the research paper, Being Built Together,, said pastors had to juggle retaining the churches African identity while appealing to children of first generation immigrants, many of whom have never lived outside Britain. They typically have a more liberal world view which can be hard to reconcile with conservative Pentecostal teachings.Rogers recalled speaking to one pastor who lamented he was unable to talk about religious miracles to his children.“If the church doesn’t adapt, then they are going to leave and look elsewhere,” Rogers said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/09d32b6cd960017677be155fc99320c7dcc6b58b/0_0_5306_3185/master/5306.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e210304fa4dd5f3bcd0472a85a75b3eb","title":"sabine weyand profile eu brexit negotiator british sense humour","story":"Weyand, who this week shot down UK hopes of reopening talks, has a reputation for being ‘direct, quick, with no bullshit’MPs voted this week to send Theresa May back to Brussels to restart Brexit talks, but the Commons apparently missed the message delivered in crisp English one day earlier: the talks were over.The messenger was the EU’s deputy Brexit negotiator, Sabine Weyand: the German official with a British sense of humour who loves Shakespeare comedies and Harry Potter, and has been known to describe any outlandish idea as “bollocks”.Whether she has uttered that word since the UK embarked on its Brexit odyssey nearly two years ago with the triggering of article 50 is not clear.But Weyand is credited with coining some of the most memorable put-downs of the talks: British plans were dismissed as “unicorns” and “magical thinking”, before being chucked into the Brussels dustbin. Above all, Weyand is the architect of the Brexit deal: her fingerprints are on all 585 pages of the withdrawal agreement that MPs rejected last month.She has been in the Brexit engine room from the start, but it was her rare public speech on Monday that put her in the spotlight. News reports blazed with her punchy one-liners, evening bulletins reported her no-deal warnings, and the commentariat parsed the significance of her yellow jumper and chunky necklace.“Such a contrast between EU negotiator Sabine Weyand – fluent, detail rich, serious, knowledgeable – and the succession of defiantly ignorant Tory MPs spouting their slogans,” tweeted the former Labour spin doctor and ‘people’s vote’ supporter Alastair Campbell.Born in the West German state of Saarland in 1964, Weyand studied politics and gained a PhD in EU transport policy. She graduated top of her class of 90 students at the College of Europe, the elite training ground for EU civil servants. “She was a brilliant student,” recalls her PhD supervisor, Prof Rudolf Hrbek, who suggested she embark on an academic career. Weyand, who speaks French as well as English, had already set her sights on Brussels.Before getting to know the arcana of international trade law, there was a one-year interlude in Cambridge where she studied political philosophy and English literature. She is a voracious reader, who loves Thomas Hardy and Shakespeare’s The Taming of the Shrew and Much Ado About Nothing. As a student she analysed the role of the forest in the Bard’s works.In the dense thicket of Brexit, she is reputed as a formidable operator. “I would really not want to be on the opposite side of the negotiating table,” one EU diplomat said. Admirers praise her astute handling of the competing egos of the EU institutions.“She is a rare breed. So many officials can either do the big waffle or they can do the minutiae of article 6 paragraph whatever. What she can do is grasp the technical detail and the political interplay,” said one EU official close to Weyand.“She has got a real affection for and understanding of the UK,” said another EU official who knows her well. Several say she has a very British sense of humour, with a taste for sarcasm and irony. “She is really fun to work with very direct, very quick, no bullshit,” said the official. Over the course of 25 years in Brussels, in which she has also worked on climate, energy and development, she bumped into many who would later play a role in the Brexit drama. One senior official at the Department for Exiting the EU, Alex Ellis, was a close colleague in Brussels. It is not the only example where UK and EU officials, once colleagues, have found themselves on the opposite side of the Brexit ide.Weyand is credited as being behind the EU’s policy of publishing many Brexit documents, a decision shaped by the public backlash against trade deals and accusations that food or environmental standards had been bartered away in secret. Critics say the transparency policy does not go far enough. The EU ombudsman reproached the European commission for not publishing an “essential” document on the Irish border or revealing details of Weyand’s meetings – a rare blot of criticism inside Brussels.The lights of transparency were also switched off when negotiators entered the “tunnel” last autumn, an intense phase of talks when the treaty text was thrashed out over long days and late nights. Before the information blackout began, Weyand told EU ambassadors to trust her to protect their interests. The member states agreed, giving her space to agree a big concession to the UK on the Irish backstop.Insiders say it could not have been done without the absolute trust between Weyand and her opposite number, Olly Robbins, the steely civil servant regarded as Theresa’s May’s Brexit brain. But Britain’s Brexit fate is now out of their hands. The final act will be decided by politicians on both sides of the Channel."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e9bb7caff362af4cb96195c6848c5ed7aaea3dd8/60_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=811fe9d5de7f84bb9ab8d4ff1f20cb9c","title":"tell us about the issues men face today","story":"From mental health to relationships, we’d like to hear from men of all ages about what they are really thinkingThe debate around modern-day masculinity has intensified in the wake of the #MeToo movement, and we are asking men to tell us what they are really thinking.As the role of men and women in society continue to change, so too do the dynamics from the workplace to the bedroom and everywhere in between.

File photograph: Eric LukeThe Most places recorded rainfall totals for the month, which were well down on the average for January – traditionally one of the driest months of the year. The driest place in the country was Dublin Airport which recorded just 26.8mm of rain for the month, or 42 per cent of the long-term average (62.6mm.) Mullingar’s total for the month of 41.3mm was 44 per cent of its long-term average of 92.5mm. Johnstown Castle in Co Wexford recorded 43.5mm of rainfall or 42 per cent of its long-term average for January of 103.4mm. January 2019 was a month of two halves. The first half was extraordinarily mild for the time of year. The highest temperature for the month was a balmy 13.3 degrees recorded at Finner Camp in Co Donegal on January 7th. The last 10 days of the month showed a change to more seasonal conditions with a biting easterly wind bringing a monthly low of -5.8 degrees to Dublin Airport on January 31st. Temperatures were above normal everywhere and it was the warmest January in most places since 2012. It would have been among the warmest on record if the mild weather of the first three weeks of the month continued. Nevertheless Valentia Observatory in Co Kerry, Shannon Airport and Cork Airport were among the weather stations which recorded average temperatures of almost a degree above normal. It was also duller than normal for the month but that was chiefly down to the blanket of cloud over the country in the early days of the month which kept temperatures mild for the time of year.

Photograph: Jessica TaylorPA WireTheresa May was allowed to savour her triumph in the House of Commons on Tuesday for only a few hours before European leaders lined up to pour cold water over it.European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker, chief negotiator Michel Barnier, French president Emmanuel Macron and Austrian chancellor Sebastian Kurz made public statements ruling out any renegotiation of the Brexit withdrawal agreement.In separate phone calls with the prime minister on Wednesday evening, Leo Varadkar and Donald Tusk told her that the MPs’ call to replace the backstop with alternative measures was unacceptable.When May asked the Taoiseach to negotiate directly with London about alternatives to the Northern Ireland backstop, he told her that Ireland would negotiate only through Barnier’s taskforce.Dublin is always alert to cracks in the European alliance of support for the backstop but few have appeared since Tuesday’s vote.Poland called for a more flexible approach towards Britain to avoid a hard Brexit but senior officials in London acknowledge privately that Warsaw’s endorsement carries little weight.Most EU governments are exasperated by May’s call for her MPs to vote against the agreement she signed off on last November.A few weeks ago, the prime minister was telling parliament that the agreement was not only the best deal but the only deal that would allow Britain to leave the EU in an orderly fashion.Now she was not only calling for the agreement to be reopened so that the backstop could be replaced with alternative measures but was indulging the wild fantasies of the so-called Malthouse compromise, a compendium of rejected and discredited proposals for how to keep the Border open.When May outlines her proposals to the EU next week, she is likely to call for a time limit or a unilateral exit mechanism for the backstop as well as alternative measures for the Border based on Brexiteer proposals for technological and administrative methods to minimise friction.The EU will almost certainly reject them and is unlikely to engage in any meaningful negotiations until after a series of votes in the House of Commons on February 14th.Last Tuesday, the prime minister promised MPs tempted to vote for an amendment to block a no-deal Brexit that they would have another chance to do so in a fortnight. The amendment, which would oblige the government to seek an extension to the article 50 negotiating period if no deal is approved by parliament by the end of February, did not pass. That could change when the amendment is next put to the vote on February 14th.After that, emboldened perhaps by a Commons vote shutting off the option of a no-deal Brexit, the EU could be more open to addressing Westminster’s difficulty with the backstop.Some officials in Brussels have long argued that giving Britain a unilateral exit mechanism from the backstop is a low-risk option because no rational government in London would exercise the option.Leaving the backstop unilaterally would mean abandoning any trade agreement with the EU, a move that would cause unconscionable damage to the British economy.The backstop has become toxic for some at Westminster but the EU is unwilling to cut Ireland adrift by abandoning it. One idea floating around the Berlaymont in recent days would extend the article 50 deadline not just for a few months but for two years to allow Britain to negotiate a free-trade agreement with the EU.The withdrawal agreement would not be abandoned but would be placed in a quiet corner while Britain and the EU negotiated their future economic relationship.Advocates of the proposal acknowledge that it creates problems for both sides but argue that most can be resolved. Instead of having European Parliament elections in May, Britain would appoint its MEPs. And EU lawyers would find a way around the fact that no trade deal can be negotiated legally until Britain is no longer a member state.Despite the genuine outrage in European capitals at May’s assault against her own agreement, she could still secure changes that could satisfy MPs.To have any chance of doing so, however, she must resist the temptation to appease her wilder backbenchers by proposing solutions for the Border that nobody takes seriously but themselves.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward. I can\u0027t imagine celebrities would want to be associated with Philip Green. He\u0027s in a tricky situation.

He announced his run on the first day of Black History Month, underscoring his consequential status as America\u0027s potential second black president after Barack Obama.“I believe that we can build a country where no one is forgotten, no one is left behind where parents can put food on the table where there are good-paying jobs with good benefits in every neighborhood where our criminal justice system keeps us safe, instead of shuffling more children into cages and coffins where we see the faces of our leaders on television and feel pride, not shame,” Booker said in a video message to supporters, subtly jabbing at President Donald Trump.“It is not a matter of can we, it\u0027s a matter of do we have the collective will, the American will?” he added. “I believe we do.”Booker enters what\u0027s shaping up to be a crowded presidential primary, with three of his fellow Democratic senators - Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Kamala Harris of California and Kirsten Gillibrand of New York - already either declared or exploring a run.But he\u0027s spent months telegraphing his intentions to join the race, visiting the early-voting states of Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina to build connections with key powerbrokers. He already has slated trips back to those states later this month.Booker also will begin reaching out to key constituencies Friday, conducting call-in interviews with three radio shows popular with black and Hiic listeners.Booker delivers remarks at the Conference of Mayors winter meeting in WashingtonLater on Friday, Booker will be a guest on “The View,” a TV talk show popular with female audiences, where his mother plans to sit in the audience.A former mayor of Newark, New Jersey\u0027s largest city, Booker won a special Senate election in 2013 to replace Democrat Frank Lautenberg and then won a full Senate term in 2014.He will be able to run for a second full Senate term in 2020 while running for president, thanks to a law that New Jersey\u0027s governor signed in November.But that doesn\u0027t mean the 49-year-old\u0027s path to the nomination will be easy.As many as five more Democratic senators could soon mount their own primary bids, creating a competition for voters\u0027 attention, and several of Booker\u0027s rival presidential hopefuls bring higher name recognition to a race that may also feature popular former Vice President Joe Biden.Booker also will likely stand alone as an unmarried candidate, though he brings a compelling personal biography that could help elevate his message of bringing Americans together around what he described as “common purpose.”Booker\u0027s father grew up in a low-income community in North Carolina, and the senator has recalled his family\u0027s later struggle to settle in suburban New Jersey amid discrimination against black homebuyers.Kamala Harris (r) is one of Mr Booker\u0026#39s main rivals for the Democratic nominationThe senator has brought a heartfelt and passionate style to his achievements in the Senate, at times fusing his personal spirituality with policy proposals that focus on social justice. Booker played a key role in the bipartisan criminal justice reform bill that Trump supported last year, for example, a deal he helped strike two months after sparring with Republicans during the battle over Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh\u0027s confirmation.In his announcement video, Booker invoked the fight against slavery and the role of immigration in building the nation\u0027s character.“The history of our nation is defined by collective action by interwoven destinies of slaves and abolitionists of those born here and those who chose America as home of those who took up arms to defend our country and those who linked arms to challenge and change it,” he said.Born in the nation\u0027s capital but raised in New Jersey, Booker made a name for himself as Newark mayor by personally shoveling the snow of residents. He has $4.1 million left in his campaign coffers that could also be used to assist his presidential run.Rather than opening an exploratory committee to test the waters, Booker took the direct step to open a campaign seeking the Democratic nomination.Booker is aligning with many other prominent Democratic White House contenders by forswearing all donations from corporate political action committees and federal lobbyists to his campaign, dubbed Cory 2020.A prominent Booker supporter, San Francisco attorney Steve Phillips, says he is working on millions of dollars in committed donations to a so-called super PAC that would boost the senator\u0027s candidacy, but Booker\u0027s campaign is openly against super PACs playing any role in the presidential race. Please review our commenting policyThe Great Southern Ark: Australia\u0026#39s bold new plan to save its native wildlifeUK weather: Snow causes chaos as temperatures hit lowest for seven years - latest news and forecastGibraltar row flares up as Brexit visa legislation agreedDrama clubs should be given same emphasis as sport in school, Duchess of Sussex saysComment: We must clamp down on the cavalier attitude of tech giants to the safety of our childrenUS announces withdrawal from key Cold War nuclear arms treaty with RussiaHuman Rights Watch says Myanmar government using ‘abusive laws’ to punish criticsComedian Jeremy Hardy dies of cancer aged 57Britain\u0026#39s best chance of revenge for its lost Brexit is to remain in the EUDemocrats 2020: Could Cory Booker, the devout \u0026#39street fighter\u0026#39, succeed in taking down Donald Trump?Comment: Why should MPs have to give up their holiday to take part in a cynical PR exercise?Voters understand what a no-deal Brexit means, but are split on what impact it\u0026#39d have \u0026#39The backstop is there to constrain the UK\u0026#39- readers react to this week\u0026#39s top storiesComment: Brexit is a British problem that London, not Dublin or Brussels, needs to solveFormer owner of Blackwater security firm to build training centre in XinjiangCBeebies to have Will Young read children \u0026#39bedtime story\u0026#39 about gay adoption as he says \u0026#39inclusivity must start at youngest age possible\u0026#39Flamingo chicks airlifted to safety as breeding ground dries upGovernment urged to cut key childhood vaccine from three doses to twoJohn Bercow \u0026#39concerned\u0026#39 by lack of Brexit progress as Germany resists backstop changesMacron aides \u0026#39jealous\u0026#39 of Brigitte\u0026#39s influence on the President, new book claimsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/01/31/TELEMMGLPICT000128617463_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"macron aides jealous brigittes influence president new book","story":"French President Emmanuel Macron kisses his wife Brigitte TrogneuxBrigitte Macron’s political role in her husband Emmanuel’s presidency is far greater than previously thought and her influence has sparked a power struggle with his “jealous” inner circle of aides, a new book alleges.Madame La Présidente, published yesterday (Thurs), goes as far as to allege that France’s First Lady helps pick her husband’s cabinet ministers.It cites an “extremely close friend” of the presidential couple as saying Mr Macron’s circle of male devotees at the Elysée are so fed up with her influence over the French president that they “dream about her dying”.Mrs Macron’s part in her husband’s rise has already been documented - she was filmed editing and coaching his campaign speeches. But the fresh claims underline the allegedly almost sect-like devotion of his aides, who other politicians in the Macron camp are said to nickname “the Mormons”, and the scale of her influence.“He owes her everything. If he\u0027s president, it\u0027s thanks to her,” another “friend” is quoted as saying. “She is the Right side of his brain,” write authors Ava Djamashidi and Nathalie Shuck, both political journalists at Le Parisien.  “He consults her once the doors of the Elysée are closed.”The Macrons visit the Coptic Church headquarters in Cairo on January 29thIt has already been reported that Mrs Macron lets her husband know what she thinks of his faux pas. This summer, palatial staff cite by Le Parisien alleged that she made the Elysée walls “shake” in rage at her husband’s dismal handling of the Alexandre Benalla security guard scandal.But the book alleges she even has a hand in choosing the cabinet, such as education minister Michel Blanquer and recently convinced her husband not to receive star environment minister Nicolas Hulot when he resigned, slamming his departure as ”pathetic“.Macron\u0026#39s three-day visit to Egypt included a trip to the temple of Abu Simbel“This kind of mistrust is because Brigitte Macron is seen as a rival in the Elysée by aides not used to competition from a woman,“ say the authors who claim: ”They get him to make a decision in the daytime, but come evening she says I don’t agree and the next day he changes his mind.“The pair met Mrs Macron three times in the Elysée for informal meetings and were allowed to ask questions but rarely quote her directly. Gérard Collomb, the former interior minister, is cited in the book as calling her the president’s “advanced scout” as she is able to test the waters with people on the ground over what the country thinks of her husband.However the “scout” can get it woefully wrong, such as when she opened the doors to the presidential palace to Le Monde newspaper to unveil €600,000 in renovation works at the Elysée just three days before the first violent “yellow vest” protest against high taxes and low wages - adding fuel to claims she is France’s latest “Marie Antoinette”.The authors said that while she does her best to “avoid being a modern Marie Antoinette” by meeting the people and reading 200 letters per day, she is the “product of France’s upper middle class”, who doesn’t know this world and is from a family with a chocolate empire who had staff at home. “She has lots of intuition but sometimes commits huge mistakes due to that upbringing.”Mrs Macron also told the authors that the hardest thing for her to cope with was the misogyny and ageist abuse she receive not just from the French public, but from its political class.The Great Southern Ark: Australia\u0026#39s bold new plan to save its native wildlifeUK weather: Snow causes chaos as temperatures hit lowest for seven years - latest news and forecastGibraltar row flares up as Brexit visa legislation agreedDrama clubs should be given same emphasis as sport in school, Duchess of Sussex saysComment: We must clamp down on the cavalier attitude of tech giants to the safety of our childrenUS announces withdrawal from key Cold War nuclear arms treaty with RussiaHuman Rights Watch says Myanmar government using ‘abusive laws’ to punish criticsComedian Jeremy Hardy dies of cancer aged 57Britain\u0026#39s best chance of revenge for its lost Brexit is to remain in the EUDemocrats 2020: Could Cory Booker, the devout \u0026#39street fighter\u0026#39, succeed in taking down Donald Trump?Cory Booker announces he is running for presidentComment: Why should MPs have to give up their holiday to take part in a cynical PR exercise?Voters understand what a no-deal Brexit means, but are split on what impact it\u0026#39d have \u0026#39The backstop is there to constrain the UK\u0026#39- readers react to this week\u0026#39s top storiesComment: Brexit is a British problem that London, not Dublin or Brussels, needs to solveFormer owner of Blackwater security firm to build training centre in XinjiangCBeebies to have Will Young read children \u0026#39bedtime story\u0026#39 about gay adoption as he says \u0026#39inclusivity must start at youngest age possible\u0026#39Flamingo chicks airlifted to safety as breeding ground dries upGovernment urged to cut key childhood vaccine from three doses to twoJohn Bercow \u0026#39concerned\u0026#39 by lack of Brexit progress as Germany resists backstop changesWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/02/01/TELEMMGLPICT000187182116_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq3JrkRmseEIpHT2xA84grmVOwDiLfuKu6n7qKJHdC384.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"newborn baby abandoned park amid freezing temperatures","story":"The baby girl who was found abandoned in a park in Newham, east LondonA newborn has been found abandoned at an east London park amid freezing temperatures.

In total, we estimated over 950,000 incidents of theft in convenience stores last year.“In the convenience sector, more than half of thefts are now not reported due to frustration with police forces not investigating or prosecuting thieves. Some police forces have introduced arbitrary thresholds below which they no longer investigate thefts, ranging from £100 to £200. Adopting these thresholds effectively prices small stores out of receiving any response to thefts against them, and publicising these policies encourages more theft and gives the impression of these offences being decriminalised.   “Challenging offenders in store often leads to violent incidents which have a huge personal impact on retailers and shopworkers. Only Government action can break the cycle of more theft, violence, inadequate police response and ineffective sanctions.”John Apter, chairman of the Police Federation acknowledged that shoplifting was not a priority crime for stretched forces.He said: These figures mirror the increase seen in many other types of crime. And, although they may not be considered the most serious of offences, it is important those responsible are not allowed to do as they wish without the fear of being caught.The reality is that officers can be tied up, sometimes for hours dealing with shoplifters, preventing them from answering other 999 calls which may be more urgent. It\u0027s all about priorities.He went on: The sad fact is that as forces struggle to meet 999-call demand, incidents such as these are increasingly likely not to be attended by officers at all which, as a serving police constable with 26 years\u0027 service, I find quite shocking.The Great Southern Ark: Australia\u0026#39s bold new plan to save its native wildlifeUK weather: Snow causes chaos as temperatures hit lowest for seven years - latest news and forecastGibraltar row flares up as Brexit visa legislation agreedDrama clubs should be given same emphasis as sport in school, Duchess of Sussex saysComment: We must clamp down on the cavalier attitude of tech giants to the safety of our childrenUS announces withdrawal from key Cold War nuclear arms treaty with RussiaHuman Rights Watch says Myanmar government using ‘abusive laws’ to punish criticsComedian Jeremy Hardy dies of cancer aged 57Britain\u0026#39s best chance of revenge for its lost Brexit is to remain in the EUDemocrats 2020: Could Cory Booker, the devout \u0026#39street fighter\u0026#39, succeed in taking down Donald Trump?Cory Booker announces he is running for presidentComment: Why should MPs have to give up their holiday to take part in a cynical PR exercise?Voters understand what a no-deal Brexit means, but are split on what impact it\u0026#39d have \u0026#39The backstop is there to constrain the UK\u0026#39- readers react to this week\u0026#39s top storiesComment: Brexit is a British problem that London, not Dublin or Brussels, needs to solveFormer owner of Blackwater security firm to build training centre in XinjiangCBeebies to have Will Young read children \u0026#39bedtime story\u0026#39 about gay adoption as he says \u0026#39inclusivity must start at youngest age possible\u0026#39Flamingo chicks airlifted to safety as breeding ground dries upGovernment urged to cut key childhood vaccine from three doses to twoJohn Bercow \u0026#39concerned\u0026#39 by lack of Brexit progress as Germany resists backstop changesWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/11/01/09/amazon-factory-8.jpg?width=1000\u0026amp;height=614\u0026amp;fit=bounds\u0026amp;format=pjpg\u0026amp;auto=webp\u0026amp;quality=70\u0026amp;crop=16:9,offset-y0.5  on= tap:gallery-lightbox-6643726  role= photo  tabindex= 0  layout= fill  alt=   srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/11/01/09/amazon-factory-8.jpg","title":"amazon value drops record christmas sales india","story":"IM Subscribe \u0026nbsp registerIM SubscribeCreated with Sketch.IM Join us?

Ahrendts said, “I always say that the stores are Apple’s biggest product. I think that the architecture of the stores, that’s our hardware and what we do inside is the software. This is an updated software release of the in-store experience. We have over 50 new sessions. Altogether there are 18,000 sessions a week worldwide.”She went on to say that when the Apple Stores were created by Steve Jobs, that the staff were not there to sell. “You know, Steve built Apple Retail. And he told the teams when he hired them that they\u0027re not allowed to sell. He said they have no commission, no quotas. He told them, ‘Your job is to enrich their lives and you have to do it through the lens of education.’ He also said that Apple is the crossroads between liberal arts and technology. Well, we were brilliant in the stores at technology. But how do we unlock that liberal arts piece?”“Being a creative all my life, it\u0027s kind of a dream job for me to help communities be more creative,” Karl Heiselman, a former CEO of brand consultants Wolff Olins, explained. Apple employs staffers in its stores called Creative Pros, who are as heavily trained as the people in the Genius Bars. “We have 3,400 Creative Pros organised by passion or theme –\u0026nbspso photography, music, art and design, coding and app development. They go deep on each one of those, and these people are amazing. Some of them are Emmy winners, celebrated artists and musicians.”Ahrendts added:\u0026nbsp“If you’re a photographer and that’s your passion, we’ll help make you a better photographer, we’ll demo a lens for you. That whole experience of what you do with your iPhone, we want to give you a rich physical experience as well.” The Creative Pros were key to developing the new sessions.Heiselman also made clear that these people are not there just to talk at you. “The thing that defines Today at Apple is it’s not just sharing your story, everyone gets a hands-on. That participatory piece is very important. Because we always say you don\u0027t want to create a session which is like something you can do on the Internet. So maybe an illustrator might share their story and their work and then we hand out iPads and say it’s your turn. We try to, as much as we can, have the audience give it a go.”So, give it a go I did, at previews of the new schedule.New Apple handset to feature three cameras for 3D imagesThe world’s tech giants are about the feel the pinchApple blocks Facebook from installing its internal apps on iPhonesThere are three kinds of sessions in Today at Apple: Skills, Walks and Labs – though the basic sessions introducing customers to Apple products and the ones aimed at explaining accessibility features will continue as before.Skills are the sessions which focus on a particular feature, such as the one I attended on GarageBand, Apple’s deceptively complex music creation app: it looks simple from the outside but is extensive and feature-rich.\u0026nbspI’ve used it but hadn’t been aware of the seemingly endless range of drums available in it. As with all Today at Apple events, you don’t need to bring your own Apple product, or even own one. They’re supplied when you get there, including – to the relief of the other customers in the Apple Store – Beats headphones to keep my attempts at music private. The purpose of the session was pretty specific, to create a beat using the beat sequencer.There are three sections to each event, inspiration, participation and celebration. This means introducing the topic in enough detail to get people wanting to try it and then let them loose on doing it. The final section involved participants sharing their newly created beats. Of course, sharing what you’ve done is voluntary.The Walks events begin inside an Apple Store and then move outdoors. Photography walks have been a staple of Today at Apple for a while, often showing locals parts of their towns they’ve never really seen before. I went to an Art Walk using the amazingly detailed digital illustration app, Procreate. Armed with an iPad Pro, we strolled the area around the store taking photos of colours that took our eye, from a pale green leaf to an eye-searingly bright yellow fire hydrant.

These are the most indepth of the events, lasting up to 90 minutes. I tried out \u0027Video Lab: Small Screen Magic, co-created with Zach King\u0027,\u0026nbspwhich concentrated on how to use a jump-cut technique in Apple’s short video app, Clips. The huge video wall was the focus here, where a specially recorded video introduction\u0026nbspfrom King, a YouTube star known for his “digital sleight of hand” was screened.This screen, by the way, has become so central to these stores that the staff jokingly refer to them as being powered by “Wall OS”. And it’s a magnet: once the session started, scores of people who happened to be in the store stopped to hover and watch.The participation section here was particularly fun and the Apple Store was momentarily taken over by the simulation of vanishing and reappearing chairs while attendees performed precipitous prat falls. When edited together, the final cut movies were shown on the wall.All these sessions are free, with materials provided and no selling involved, though the Creative Pros are knowledgeable about the company’s products as well, so can advise you if you’re interested.\u0026nbspAnd those Pros are pretty remarkable.

They are professional, unflappable and relaxed performers, eager to share their knowledge and their passion.When Apple’s iPhone sales have dipped, as revealed in the latest figures, it’s interesting to see a company make a considerable investment in staffing sessions like this.\u0026nbspBut it’s a cool way to tempt people through its doors.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

In theory, the stockpiling of goods by overseas businesses could provide a short-lived boost to manufacturing output. But the renewed decline in the output index to just 51.4—its lowest level since July 2016 — suggests such support is intangibly small,” said Samuel Tombs of Pantheon.A survey from the Institute of Directors on Friday suggested that 14 per cent of UK manufactrurers have shifted some resources overseas due to Brexit.And the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders revealed\u0026nbspearlier in the week that investment in the UK car industry fell by 50 per cent in 2018 due to uncertainty about the UK’s EU exit.Last week the chief executive of Airbus warned that the company’s entire UK manufacturing operations in the UK could end up closed if the UK crashes out of the EU with no deal.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

How much is Germany’s slowdown actually due to Brexit? And how damaging would a no-deal scenario be for Europe’s largest economy?Click to followThe IndependentAngela Merkel and Peter Altmaier at a Cabinet meetingGermany’s Economy Minister, Peter Altmaier, this week unveiled a rather brutal downgrade in his country’s official growth forecast for 2019, from 1.8 per cent to just 1 per cent. This came on the back of the worst year of GDP growth for Germany (1.5\u0026nbspper cent in 2018) in five years.And one of the reasons Mr Altmaier cited for the downgrade was the negative impact of Brexit.This has led to some speculation that the alarming weakening of Germany economy – it only seems to have narrowly avoided slipping into recession in the second half of 2018 – could influence Angela Merkel’s stance on Brexit, perhaps inducing Berlin to be amenable to Theresa May’s proposals to revisit the Irish backstop in the Withdrawal Agreement.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialIf German politicians like Mr Altmaier appreciate that their own country’s economic self-interest is tightly related to avoiding a no-deal Brexit that could change the terms of trade of the EU-UK Brexit negotiations, goes the thinking.But does the logic here stand up? How much is Germany’s slowdown actually due to Brexit? And how damaging would a no-deal scenario even be for Europe’s largest economy?Germany slumps to worst growth in five years in 2018Andrew Kenningham, a Europe specialist at Capital Economics, says is sceptical that Brexit was the main drag on German growth last year, noting that industrial disruption due to new automotive emissions regulations was influential in the third quarter contraction.“I don’t think most people would see Brexit see as the main reason for it,” he said.“It’s true that exports from Germany to the UK have been declining. They’ve probably been the weakest of its major export destinations. But they’ve also slowed a lot in China, they’ve slowed to other emerging economies, including Turkey and Russia. It’s not just exports to the UK have collapsed everyone else is doing fine.”Oliver Rakau, a Frankfurt-based economist for Oxford Economics says Mr Altmaier was simply listing the long menu of reasons for the slowdown, rather than singling out Brexit.He suspects, based on data released previously in Beijing, that the big drag in terms of German exports in the final quarter of 2018 will turn out to be due to waning demand in China rather than the UK.But Mr Kenningham suggests that Mr Altmaier could have mentioned Brexit for political reasons, rather than economic ones.The economy minister has been vocal for some time about the importance of avoiding a no deal Brexit and has suggested that the UK should be allowed to extend the Article 50 process to avoid the 29 March cliff edge.But what about the German car industry? Here the bigger hit has been Donald Trump’s trade wars, rather than Brexit, say analysts.Exports to the UK downBut what about a no-deal Brexit in March? How damaging would that be for Germany?In the long-term the IMF estimates that the UK being forced to trade on bare World Trade Organisation terms the costs for the UK would be almost 4 per cent of GDP, versus less than 0.5 per cent for Germany.But what about the disruption in 2019?Mr Kenningham says Germany’s exports of goods and services to the UK account for 3 per cent of its GDP.“Even if they were hit hard – say a 10 per cent fall for a few months – it wouldn’t have a huge impact if you look at it arithmetically,” he says.But he concedes that’s a narrow way of looking at it.And Mr Rakau thinks that a no-deal would certainly increase the risk of recession in Germany.More pain for UK than Germany from no dealSo could car companies, and German industry more broadly, come to the rescue and put pressure on Ms Merkel to accommodate the British?\u0026nbsp“I know it’s often cited in the UK that Germany industry will put on pressure – but I don’t foresee that,” says Oliver Rakau, a Frankfurt-based economist for Oxford Economics.“Even the German industrial associations have put out press releases saying this is for the British side to sort out.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Some $45bn in fact.In sterling terms that amounts to £34bn, which a third more than you buy all the shares in Tesco for. The latter is capitalised at just under £22bn.\u0026nbspThe number crunchers were particularly concerned about the giant’s international business, which is still losing money.\u0026nbspAlthough losses have been falling, the Indian government has thrown a fly into the ointment with new rules designed to protect local businesses from giant foreign e commerce operators.\u0026nbspIt has done the sort of thing Britain’s bombed out bricks and mortar retailers have been calling upon our Government to have a go at, without (to date) much success.\u0026nbspWhile this has resulted in the removal of some of products from Amazon’s website, the company has responded by hunkering down and promising to keep at it. Which is what it always does.\u0026nbspOh and finance chief Brian Olsavsky says it’s going to spend more money this year. There is no greater exponent of that old proverb “you’ve got to spend money to make money” than Amazon.There are many, many reasons for criticising the monster this business has become, and feeling ambivalent about the impact it has had on the world.\u0026nbspIts workers are sometimes treated very poorly. It has had a devastating effect on other businesses. It pays about enough tax to buy a couple of Echo Dots (that’s the company’s crazily high selling crazily cheap mini speaker) and a month’s subscription to Amazon Music to go with them.Then there’s the corporate welfare it’s been sucking in back home in America. \u0026nbspYet you still have to admire the way its founder and CEO Jeff Bezos seems sublimely unconcerned about the huffing and puffing of analysts and commentators in response to the latest quarterly results.\u0026nbspI even saw one saying they thought the best may be over for the business.

In theory, the stockpiling of goods by overseas businesses could provide a short-lived boost to manufacturing output. But the renewed decline in the output index to just 51.4—its lowest level since July 2016 — suggests such support is intangibly small,” said Samuel Tombs of Pantheon.A survey from the Institute of Directors on Friday suggested that 14 per cent of UK manufactrurers have shifted some resources overseas due to Brexit.And the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders revealed\u0026nbspearlier in the week that investment in the UK car industry fell by 50 per cent in 2018 due to uncertainty about the UK’s EU exit.Last week the chief executive of Airbus warned that the company’s entire UK manufacturing operations in the UK could end up closed if the UK crashes out of the EU with no deal.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Close to four in 10 listed retailers issued profit warnings last year, with some doing so on multiple occasions.Emma Shipp, Partner at Hewitsons said Mr Ashley’s history with House of Fraser and Evans Cycles suggests he will continue to cut staff and close stores across all of his recent purchases.Ms Shipp added: “Landlords should expect to come under increasing pressure to reduce rent or offer rent free periods.\u0026nbsp“Cross pollination between his businesses is another likely outcome – witness the introduction of Agent Provocateur lingerie at House of Fraser stores last year which are both Ashley owned.“For the moment, an overriding strategy in these acquisitions is hard to discern and some have likened it to a ‘Monopoly board’ power grab.”ScS, which stands for “Sofa Carpet Specialist”, has concessions in House of Fraser stores but announced in October that it would pull out because the partnership was no longer beneficial after Mr Ashley’s takeover of the department store chain.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Facebook development teams would do well to look at this precedent and prioritise user privacy,” Mr MacKey told\u0026nbspThe Independent.“With the integration project currently expected to take a year to complete, and with end-to-end encryption as part of the plan, we should expect the Facebook engineering teams to focus attention on uniform data security both in their platform and in the apps themselves.”In response to such privacy concerns, Facebook said in a statement: “We’re working on making more of our messaging products end-to-end encrypted and considering ways to make it easier to reach friends and family across networks.

That meant the scientists could take all of those different pieces of data – related to 700 different places in all – and combine them to understand the gravity on the surface.As the rover started to climb up a hill on the surface, the amount of gravity went up. But it did not go up as much as expected.The lower levels of Mount Sharp are surprisingly porous, says lead author Kevin Lewis of Johns Hopkins University. We know the bottom layers of the mountain were buried over time. That compacts them, making them denser. But this finding suggests they weren\u0027t buried by as much material as we thought.Scientists could use the findings to help understand where places like Mount Sharp came from, and how the Martian surface developed.There are still many questions about how Mount Sharp developed, but this paper adds an important piece to the puzzle, said Ashwin Vasavada, Curiosity\u0027s project scientist at NASA\u0027s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, which manages the mission. I\u0027m thrilled that creative scientists and engineers are still finding innovative ways to make new scientific discoveries with the rover.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It emerges that these imposters are mental home patients who murdered the couple, and have now taken up residence in their house.

While experiencing visions of her daughter, who we learn died from cancer in her teens, Louise attempts to communicate with the race in a bid to discern the purpose of their visit.The twist: Louise deciphers the language, which gives her the ability to see into the future.

After uncovering photos of black men she’s had prior relationships with, Chris is abducted, realising that he’s been lured to her cult-like family who want to implant their loved ones’s brains into the body of younger black bodies.  The set-up: When Amy Dunne (Rosamund Pike) goes missing, her husband Nick (Ben Affleck) becomes the prime suspect behind her disappearance.The twist: Mid-way through the film, all becomes clear – Amy faked her abduction and spent months framing her husband in revenge for his extra-marital digressions.The set-up: Brothers Elias and Lukas (played by real-life siblings Elias and Lukas Schwarz) believe their mother to be an imposter after she returns home having had her face reconstructed due to a car crash. They take (rather disturbing) matters into their own hands. The twist: One of the twins actually died in the crash.

After he kills them, he is crowned by the cultists.The set-up: Leonard (Guy Pearce) is tracking down the man who raped and murdered his wife. However, his search is stunted by his short-term memory loss. Throughout the film, he tells the story of Sammy Jankis, a man who accidentally killed his diabetic wife she kept requesting more insulin as she didn\u0027t believe he had memory loss.The twist: The man responsible only raped his wife and Leonard killed him years ago – he just can\u0027t remember it. His wife\u0027s actual killer is... himself. His real name? Sammy Jankis.The set-up: A grizzled boxing trainer seeks atonement by helping Hilary Swank\u0027s underdog amateur boxer, Maggie, achieve her dream of becoming a professional.The twist: Mid-way through the film, Maggie breaks her neck after being sucker punched during a fight.

His captors orchestrated their meeting.The set-up: The plot centres on a couple who, after the death of their unborn child, adopt a mysterious nine-year-old girl named Esther (Isabelle Furhman) who starts displaying some disturbing behaviour. The twist: Esther is actually a 33-year old murderer who has a condition stunting her physical growth. The set-up: Nicole Kidman stars as Grace, a mother who tries to protect her two children from supernatural forces in their Victorian mansion.The twist: In a spin on the ghost story, it turns out it\u0027s Grace and her children who are the ghosts: she killed them – before turning the gun on herself – in despair over the presumed death of her husband in World War II.The set-up: The film tracks the rivalry of two magicians, Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) and Rupert Angier (Hugh Jackman), who go to extreme lengths to outsmart one another, each pulling off tricks the other considers impossible.The twist: It emerges that Fallon, the bearded carer of Borden’s children, is actually his twin (he’s also played by Bale) while Angier’s technique is far more disturbing: each night, using Tesla’s technology, he sends his clone plummeting into a water tank.2437 Planet of the Apes (1968)The set-up: Three scientists wake up hundreds of years after being launched into space to discover they’ve landed on a planet where primates rule over humans, who are their prisoners.The twist: As Charlton Heston’s character escapes his cell, he eventually finds the Statue of Liberty protruding from sand.

He rummages through his pockets, looking for the key that will unlock the chain around his leg, convinced the nightmare is finally over.The twist: Instead, he finds a cassette recorder that reveals his supposed captor was, in fact, another victim of the Jigsaw killer who was merely following his rules in order to obtain an antidote for a poison in his body. Cue a corpse in the middle of the room rising to reveal himself as the real Jigsaw killer. He was there the whole time.The set-up: David Mills (Brad Pitt) and retired PI William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) have closed in on serial killer, John Doe (Kevin Spacey), who has been using the seven deadly sins as inspiration for his murders.The twist: He has one final murder left to commit – only he’s already committed it.

That will help Apple\u0027s push into augmented reality, which has seen it release a range of tools to allow people to overlay virtual objects onto the real world.iPhone price to be reduced in many countries, Apple saysThe extra sensing capabilities could also improve traditional photos, allowing for images that capture better depth, according to the Bloomberg report.The technologies could be a trial run for Apple\u0027s plans for an augmented reality headset or glasses, which it has been repeatedly rumoured to be working on\u0026nbsp– and which the company has not explicitly denied.Apple\u0027s 2019 phone will also have a range of improvements to its camera technologies, according to the same report. They will include three cameras to allow for improved photo capabilities, which could allow for the phone to take a larger field of view, better zoom, and potentially allowing the phone to automatically improve photos or videos after they are taken.The 3D cameras were being worked on for this year\u0027s phones but were not ready in time, the Bloomberg report claimed. Instead, they will come to next year\u0027s line on the the 2020 version of the\u0026nbspiPhone XS Max, though they might not make it onto the upgraded versions of the XS and XR.As well as new camera technologies, Apple plans to improve the software used to take photos. That will include changes to the Live Photos feature – which captures video either side of a photo to allow people to see them in context – so that they take six seconds of video rather than three.The new phones will also have improved chips and an updated Face ID sensor so the phones unlock more quickly. Otherwise, they are expected to look largely similae to this year\u0027s models, with more dramatic changes coming in 2020.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They had hoped to use those stars to measure the age of the cluster.But as they did so they spotted the small set of stars on the edge of the area they were observing. After analysis, they found the stars did not belong to the cluster they were looking at – a part of the Milky Way – but were in fact millions of light-years away from it.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s most stunning pictures of space Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.130 Earth from the ISSFrom the International Space Station, Expedition 42 Flight Engineer Terry W.

It measures only 3000 light-years across even at its longest point, making it just a fraction of the size of our own Milky Way.Repeated radio signals coming from galaxy 1.5 billion lightyears awayIt is dark as it is feint. Together, those porperties led astronomers to classify it as what is called a\u0026nbspdwarf spheroidal galaxy.Such galaxies are defined by their small size and dim light, as well as their lack of dust and old stellar populations. Reserchers have found 36 galaxies of this kind in our nearby area, 22 of which are satellite galaxies around our own Milky Way.Dwarf spheroidal galaxies are not uncommon, but the newly discovered one is strange in a number of ways. It is extremely isolated, about 30 million light-years from the Milky Way and two million light-years from its nearest possible host – making it the most isolated of any small dwarf galaxy ever found.From studying its stars, scientists found that the galaxy is around 13 billion years old, making it nearly as old as the entire universe. Because it is so distant from any other galaxies – and so has been left largely undisturbed – as well as its old age, the astronomers refer to Bedin 1 as a fossil from the beginning of th ecosmos.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But does one exist? Ben Chu looks at the evidenceClick to followThe IndependentIs the prime minister looking for something that isn’t actually there?Theresa May is returning to Brussels to try to renegotiate the European Union withdrawal agreement to make it acceptable to a majority of MPs in the House of Commons.But what will she ask for?On Tuesday night almost all of her party’s MPs and\u0026nbspa majority of the Commons voted in favour of an amendment put forward by the senior Tory backbencher Sir Graham Brady calling for the Irish backstop (the insurance clause that says the entire UK will remain in an EU customs union if there is no EU free trade deal struck that manages to avoid a hard border in Ireland) in the withdrawal agreement to be replaced with unspecified “alternative arrangements”.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialDowning Street’s logic is that, if the EU agrees\u0026nbspto this, the agreement she brings back will finally make it through the Commons.But what might these alternative arrangements be? Even if the EU was prepared to reopen the withdrawal agreement, do they really exist?How badly could Brexit disrupt farming exports from Northern Ireland?The “Malthouse Compromise”, a proposal put together by Tory MPs from both wings of the party, refers to a “protocol” to replace the backstop in a document put out last month called “A better deal”. This was written by Shanker Singham of the Institute of Economic Affairs, a think tank with opaque funding.This protocol offers various technological and procedural measures – including, among other things, customs checks away from the border and a new regime of regulatory equivalence between the UK and EU – which would supposedly eliminate any new frictions on the Irish border as a result of the UK leaving the EU customs union and single market.But how credible is it?Dr Katy Hayward of Queen’s University Belfast says its provisions for policing standards and preventing smuggling would not be secure.Sam Lowe of the Centre for European Reform agrees that the document is not\u0026nbspcredible in terms of policing.“Can you do it without physical infrastructure? Maybe. Can you do it without a significant uptick in ‘associated checks’? I don’t think so. Would it still constitute a border in many peoples’ minds and be disruptive?

He told me everything I did was wrong, everything I said, the way I sat, my body language, everything that he could do to attack me.”Ms Bland was offered the role despite her difficult experience of the interview but she chose not to take it.“I’ve been in this position before,” she wrote in response to the job offer.“They tear you down, abuse you, take you to breaking point and then they take you out to dinner or buy you a present to apologise and make it seem like they are the nice guy. This job is supposed to be the present. I don’t want it.”Ms Bland’s tweet was shared by SNP MP Peter Grant, who argued it was “appalling that company bosses still think they can treat people like this in the 21st century”.Mr Dean did not respond to requests for comment but wrote on Twitter that he was “very sorry if anyone has been hurt”.In a message he described as “sleep deprived and anxiety-driven”, Mr Dean wrote: “I have no desire to see anyone hurt and can only apologise if anything I’ve done has had that effect.”But Ms Bland dismissed it as a “non-apology” that “makes it all about him”.“Sometimes you have to take responsibility for your actions and I think it’s about time he and other people in similar positions did,” she said.Historic reviews for Web Applications UK on the employment website Glassdoor have often commented negatively on “the CEO” and, more widely, workplace bullying has been a hot topic in recent months.“If someone can read something that has come from me to identify that they are in an abusive situation and use that to come out of it then that’s all I could ask for,” she said.“You can say no. You can walk away from these situations. I acknowledge I’ve been privileged in being able to turn it down and others won’t be able to, but you can say no and walk away from people that hurt you in your personal life or at work.”The board of directors at Web Applications UK has released a statement saying they\u0026nbsphave carried out an internal investigation, independent from Mr Dean, which involved\u0026nbspinterviewing all employees who were directly involved in the recruitment process.“The board is satisfied that no bullying or intimidation occurred,” they said.\u0026nbsp“Nonetheless, the directors are extremely saddened by this incident and the impact that this has had on the inidual concerned, particularly as we are a company that takes great pride in nurturing the aspirations of young people.”They said they\u0026nbspstrongly condemn any form of bullying or intimidation and would reflect carefully on their recruitment process and HR policies.“As always, Web Applications UK conducted a robust, multi-stage interview, which included simulating challenging, work-based scenarios, designed to help identify the best candidate for the role,” they said.\u0026nbsp“This particular candidate excelled during the interview and responded positively to the feedback. We were delighted to offer her the position of communications assistant, by telephone, later that day. Following her initial acceptance, we were very much looking forward to working together.

It’s not weird, it’s not sexual. It’s about connection. I want this to help build a better, kinder world for my grandkids.“People do long to be touched these days. It’s a touch deprived world and smartphones are part of the cause. People can be lonely and feeling skin on skin is a genuine human need.Adam says that these parties are happening all over the world - and are getting more and more popular in the UK.“There are more and more cuddle parties happening in London and the UK. Maybe there will be more next year because of Brexit, too, he says.Facilitators can set up cuddle parties anywhere but they mainly happen in people’s lounges.Participants pay between  to  to attend- and Adam makes around a month from running the parties.Describing a typical cuddle party, Adam, who is single, told how cushions are set up to make it comfortable, there’s music but candles are discouraged because of the risk of knocking them over.“Each facilitator is dferent but generally there are snacks, he says.I like to take grapes and guests bring their own food. Music helps set the mood. Younger people like their own thing, an older crowd will like to listen to some jazz, for example.“There are singles and couples.Adam says that more men attended the parties at first, then it evened out when women realised it wasnt sexual“There is a minimum level of dress and I prefer pyjamas because they can be fun. I’ve got some Snoopy-themed pyjamas which always get a smile, he says.“I’ve had parties with myself and two other people which is very powerful and others with more than .The first hour is taken up in a group communications exercises “to get people comfortable”, Adam explained.“It’s a workshop first, he said. It can be men and men, women and women, mixed up and all ages but always over .“It’s the empowerment to know what you want and to choose what you want.“People who come to cuddle parties over time find they become more empowered in other areas of their le.”After the first hour, the cuddlers get down to business, he said.“We encourage people to partner up, there are singles and couples but we encourage them to move around the room and try dferent people, we don’t want them sticking to just one person.“The cuddling can include eye gazing, hand holding, head scratching, foot rubbing... even just talking.“There is no sexual element at all. No sexual touching, evenit’s sensual eye gazing or heavy breathing. “We are not trying to generate any sexual energy. Everyone who’s touched has to give their consent. They have to be asked and agree to it.Sometimes, younger people want to be cuddled by an older person.Adam says this is usually when people want to be reminded of when they used to be held by a grandfather or grandmother.“Surprisingly, men find it comfortable to cuddle with each other, he continues.It’s like when guys play sports and they hug during games. It’s a nurturing experience.“I had a party in Massachusetts one time and the men tended to gravitate to each other even though there were an equal number of women there.“They were making growling noises and deep voice sounds. Really making a deep connection. A woman asked to join in and they said no.Adam says his parties are healing, comforting, restorative, rejuvenating, inspiring and insightful.“Touching isn’t just about sex and when we appreciate that, it’s a benefit to us,” he says.Adam said he became a professional cuddler around eight years ago following a chance conversation with a woman who was having relationship problems - and he went off and started his training. “I knew about cuddle parties from the States and I said to her, ‘So what you want right now is to be held by a man in the absolutely certainty he’s not going to try it on with you ’” he said.“She started to cry and said that would be so wonderful.He said applicants to become facilitators are vetted to cut out anyone with a criminal record.“The process really does find out anyone with dishonourable intentions as it is a lot of hard work, he said.It’s not easy. It takes dedication, time and money and the learning is mainly online.“What you’re doing is putting people in a situation where you have to open up and be vulnerable so it is very responsible.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Along with the likes of megabucks Remainers Tony Blair, Peter Mandelson and PR guru Roland Rudd, he seems to think Brexiters are basically pond le.That theory should be buried forever after this weekend’s passionate plea from leading academic Sir Noel Malcolm for MPs to stop wrecking Brexit.Writing in the devoutly pro-EU Financial Times, this distinguished Fellow of All Souls, Oxford, spells out the essence of the Leave case: “Brexit is about sovereignty — and parliament must respect that.”“If the UK is now on the brink of a constitutional crisis,” he adds, “one major reason is that a signicant number of MPs still oppose any version of Brexit, and seek a second ­referendum solely for the sake of reversing the decision of the last one.”Sir Noel does not believe people voted Out because they were racist.“The most important reason was democracy,” he says.“They wanted to live under laws made by the people they elected. Immigration came second.What they objected to was a supranational government ­making some of their laws and lting all immigration controls on the inhabitants of  other countries.”Another Remainer fiction is that Brexiters are narrow-minded Little Englanders.Yet the Daily Mail found space for a German view that Brussels should stop “insulting Britain” and honour us as champions of peace in Europe.“Such blinkered and sour responses are wrong-headed,” says Alexander von Schoenburg, a senior editor of Germany’s biggest newspaper, Bild.“They ignore the great debt Germany and the whole ­Continent owes our friends across the Channel.“We must always remember that throughout your history, independence and sovereignty have been paramount.“Germany in particular should tread lightly when it comes to dealing with your proud nation. It was Great Britain that first stood up to Hitler in .And it was Britain that opened its doors to thousands of ­Jewish refugees fleeing certain death during the Holocaust.“Put simply, there would be no free Europe without you and the bloody sacrice you made to rescue the Continent.”This remarkable tribute ­follows a recent love letter to the UK from Germany’s next Chancellor calling for a friendly Brexit orce and an end to bitterness.It is now clear hardline Remainers have over-reached themselves. The worm has turned.Talk of a second referendum is dead and voters are on the warpath against MPs plotting to scupper Brexit in tomorrow’s Commons showdown.Brussels is in chaos over the Northern Ireland backstop.Michel Barnier has started muttering about new tech- nology to police post-Brexit ­frontiers — a UK idea initially dismissed as “magical thinking”.EU allies are breaking ranks to demand a decent deal — for their sake as much as ours.It is way past time now for Theresa May to scrap the backstop and tell Brussels exactly what she needs to get her deal through Parliament.“There is absolutely no truth in speculation that ­passengers are being advised not to book,” stormed Brittany Ferries as it announced plans to INCREASE services.Meanwhile, mischief-making aviation giant Airbus admits it was asked by Downing Street to warn – incredibly – that it would shut up shopBritain left without a deal.Project Fear is shameless.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We are useless. Have a trophy.”And it’s a depressing cycle that will continue for as long as there are National Television Awards, live from The O.A ceremony where the categories may chop and change every year, but the stupidity remains ritualised.As well as getting all the usual winners though, viewers also had to endure a technical nightmare on Tuesday, where things went wrong — from the shambolic opening scenes right through to the unedited version of the closing credits: “With thanks to — Television Centre White City or just Television Centretoo long.”It’s always a case of fine margins, of course, at the NTAs, and the evening might have strayed into so-bad-it’s-good territorythe cameras had just focused on one of the Love Island gang when host Dermot O’Leary said: “Danny DeVito will be in Dumbo next year.”They didn’t, though. So a night bedevilled by sound issues, rotten acceptance speeches and foul Danny Dyer language was crowned by Special Recognition winner David Dimbleby eulogising the BBC and ordering us to be nicer to politicians, in a speech that could hardly be descri- bed as “mood capturing”.It’s the awards themselves though, that I know get viewers’ goats the most, starting, painful as it is to admit, with the fact perennial winners This Morning absolutely robbed Piers Morgan’s Good Morning Britain operation in the Daytime category.Given that Jack Whitehall’s Travels With My Father managed to scrape on to the Comedy shortlist, there’s also an argument that says Chunk, Charlotte Hawkins, Richard Arnold and Susanna Reid — who was styled quite magnicently on the night as Waitrose’s answer to Vicky Pattison — should have made that final five as well.Because almost no show made me laugh as loud or as regularly as Good Morning Britain did in .A glaring omission too in the TV Judge section — always won by David Walliams — which included X Factor’s Robbie Williams on the shortlist, but not Craig Revel Horwood, who didn’t take a two-week sabbatical in the middle of Strictly, cost the BBC £million or throw in his other half as part of the deal.The award that made a nonsense of the whole occasion though was Ant  Dec winning Best Presenters for the th time in a row, despite the presence of Bradley Walsh and Graham Norton on the shortlist, and the fact Ant spent far more weeks in rehab than he did in a TV studio.The mutual affection is touching in one way, of course, but it ultimately does neither them nor the NTAs any good at all and has robbed both of a glorious moment of redemption when they win the  award.Before that foregone conclusion takes place, please stay tuned to This Morning and sit tight until mid-March, when Dr Chris will be along with part II of his bottom-wiping masterclass: Flushing, FLU-SHING.Practially the only programme I watched at the weekend that wasn’t punctuated by uncontrollable sobbing fits from the participants was BBC’s landmark Holocaust documentary The Last Survivors.Men and women who are all in their late eighties and nineties now and understand that time is precious.When you’re a living part of history you also know facts are far more precious than tears.So in the words of the remarkable Anita Lasker-Wallfisch, who avoided the Auschwitz gas chamber purely because she could play the cello: “I won’t give people the pleasure of seeing my emotions.”The very least we owe all of them is an audience. The Last Survivors is available on the BBC iPlayer and will probably be the most unforgettable  minutes of television you’ll watch all year.At approximately : hours, Sunday, Gemma Collins stumbled over while Dancing On Ice.The tectonic plates groaned a little on impact, the front row scattered like ten pins and there was a surge on the national grid as several million viewers went “click, rewind, play,” then “click, rewind, play,” again.In fact, by the time I’d stopped rewinding and playing, Gemma had “bounced back,”and Piers Morgan, no doubt angling for a Le Stories interview, had claimed it was “the gutsiest thing I’ve seen on a talent show” – probably since the days Piers himself was wedged in behind the judges’ desk on Britain’s Got Talent.It was an undeniably great television moment, though.A proper face plant, with a full Klinsmann snow plough to finish.The downside, obviously, is that it’s guaranteed she’ll be back next week, when Melody, Wes, James and the others will be performing to a Fairytale theme and Gemma will be clearing the B Fettercairn to Banchory road,ITV want to find a proper use for her.Click, rewind, play.Things remain cheerful as hell on EastEnders.Alfie Moon’s car has been discovered near some clfs and a policeman has the job of breaking the most awful news imaginable to Kat and the Slaters.“Considering the location and the evidence at hand, we would suggest you prepare yourself for the worst.”Big Mo: “You understand what they’re saying ”Yes, bloody Redwater’s getting a second series.

But she also says Britain will not leave the EU without a deal.And her deal — the only one on the table at this late stage — was defeated in the House of Commons by a record majority just two weeks ago.Tonight’s Brexit votes are not quite the final shoot-out between the dferent factions in Parliament. The Government has promised that MPs will vote soon on a new plan.Remainers and soft Brexit supporters in government are pushing to hold that vote as soon as possible.And MPs — backed by a Speaker who will rewrite any Commons rules to soften or stop Brexit — will force more votes on what happens next.Nevertheless, tonight’s votes do matter.One proposal comes from Yvette Cooper, a Labour MP.Her Yorkshire constituents voted to leave the EU by more than two to one and, during the election, she promised them she would “not vote to block Brexit.”Yet that is what her plan does:     MPs vote for her   amendment, they will be able to stop Brexit happening this year.Cooper has the support of several rebel Tories, soJeremy Corbyn whips his MPs to vote for it, she stands a good chance of getting her way.Caroline Spelman and Jack Dromey, Conservative and Labour, have an amendment that calls on the Government to avoid a no-deal Brexit.Dominic Grieve wants MPs to control the Commons timetable, allowing Parliament to vote on dferent ways of watering Brexit down.Labour want to present MPs with options that include, predictably, a second referendum.Despite drafting a manesto saying “Labour accepts the referendum result”, the Shadow Brexit Secretary Keir Starmer says in a second referendum he would campaign to overturn the result of the first.It is possible that none of these amendments might pass.Remainers and soft Brexiteers are ided about what should happen.Some want to delay Brexit, some want to tie us to European rules and regulations, and others want another referendum to stop it altogether.Evenno proposal wins a Commons majority, the votes cast by MPs will probably demonstrate that there is a majority to water down Brexit one way or another.For Brexit supporters, this is very dangerous indeed.Some believe they simply need to run down the clock and, in  days, we can leave without a deal.For Leavers who want a negotiated departure, this feels like a serious risk.But Leavers who favour no deal need to ask themselves, can they really be so sure they will get what they want With several Cabinet ministers, many more junior ministers and a Commons majority against no deal, it seems increasingly likely that MPs will ultimately find a way of stopping no deal.When they do, Brexit will only get softer and softer.This is why the amendment proposed by Graham Brady, a senior Conservative, is so important.His idea is to approve the Prime Minister’s original Brexit deal, but with the “backstop” removed.The backstop is hated by unionists, because to prevent barriers to trade between Ireland and Northern Ireland, it creates new barriers to trade between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.And it is hated by Leavers, because it ties the UK to the EU’s customs union, and Northern Ireland to EU single market rules.Brady wants MPs to vote simply for “alternative arrangements” to the backstop.By avoiding a specic proposal, he hopes the amendment can win a Commons majority and, in doing so, demonstrate to Brussels that the deal they struck with Theresa May can be ratied — but only without the backstop.Critics, largely Remainers, say this is impossible.But in the past week or so, Angela Merkel has questioned whether the backstop is such a good idea after all.The Polish foreign minister has suggested it should expire after five years. And the European Commission effectively conceded that in the event of no deal, they would use policy and technology to prevent a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland.In other words, they proposed solutions they once dismissed as “unicorns” and “magical thinking” when they were suggested by the British — and which could render the backstop unnecessary.But this is not all. Some European officials have floated, in private, a more inventive solution: that the UK and Ireland should form a British Isles customs zone, with Britain compensating Ireland for any new friction in their trade with Europe.So it is clear: whatever Remainers claim, alternatives to the backstop are technically and politically feasible.Recognising this, the Brady amendment would give the Government one last chance to negotiate something better.Yet Tory Brexiteers say they might not vote for it. They fear the ambiguity of “alternative arrangements” could allow ministers to negotiate an even worse deal, perhaps tying the whole of the UK to the EU’s customs union and single market rules for good.They do not trust May, her advisers, or most of her Cabinet and demand a specic time limit on the backstop.Butthey vote down the Brady amendment, they will not get what they want, and are more likely to get what they fear.As the clock ticks on and bottoms get even squeakier, MPs will coalesce around a plan to stop a no-deal Brexit.The EU will have no reason to compromise, and Parliament will soften our departure by aligning us with more and more European laws.If Leavers vote against Brady, they will be shooting themselves not in one foot, and not even in both feet, but in the head.As the Commons debates the proposals today, Leavers need to start compromising with reality. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Both are powered by an inexorable sense of self-righteousness. And both have an awful lot of experience of saying sorry.The most recent example came when Sir Nick appeared on the BBC in the wake of the furore over the death of -year-old Molly Russell.It turned out, after she was found dead in her bedroom in December , that she had been viewing material online relating to depression, self-harm and suicide — material which was shockingly easy to find.As her father Ian Russell put it bluntly: “Instagram helped kill my daughter.”Sir Nick, to his credit, said all the right things about how the firm was determined to do more. But he also made the striking claim that it is sometimes better for Facebook and Instagram to keep suicide images online, because it helps other vulnerable young people get support.This after The Sun, on Saturday, found and flagged up multiple images appearing to normalise and even romanticise suicide, all within a few clicks. Many remained published for days, and a Facebook spokesman claimed they could be beneficial to users battling mental health issues.Sir Nick says the firm is following the advice from leading experts and charities. And it may well be doing the right thing. But this is the latest example of Facebook — and other social media giants in general — only acting to tackle a problem once it becomes impossible not to.Over the past decade, social media has come to dominate our lives. The latest research from Ofcom shows internet use rocketing among children and teenagers, with friendships and social lives increasingly run through screens and phones.And it is now clear that this great move online has been accompanied, for our children, by a staggering increase in mental health problems.The situation is particularly alarming when it comes to young women. The latest NHS data found that one in four of those aged  to  report having a mental health disorder — twice the rate among boys.In  alone, one in five US girls aged between  and  suffered a major depressive episode — one in five! Suicide rates for teenage girls, according to academic Jonathan Haidt, have risen by  per cent in the US and  per cent in the UK in a decade.This isn’t just about what happens on the internet. Those having problems online often tend to be experiencing problems offline too, such as bullying, harassment or broken families.More broadly, Haidt believes the “snowflake” phenomenon reflects that “helicopter parenting” leaves children less prepared to cope with shocks and dficulty. But the internet, and social media, are very clearly intensying those problems. And the big tech firms are still playing catch-up.The traditional argument from Silicon Valley is that it’s not their job to regulate human behaviour. They add that eventhey wanted to, there is simply too much out there.They are doing their best to crack down on inappropriate content, but it’s like trying to stem the tide. Behind the scenes — they insist — thousands of people are working day and night to detect and delete messages promoting terrorism, hatred, Holocaust denial and self-harm.But this argument just doesn’t wash. It’s very clear that, in the interests of their bottom lines, many of the big social media firms have long failed to put enough resources into detecting damaging content.Researchers have shown, for example, how following the recommended links from reputable YouTube content can lead to a carnival of horrors. News reports that segue into crackpot conspiracy theories and videos for toddlers that give way to horrendous scenes of a bloodied Minnie Mouse trapped in an escalator.Every day brings new horror stories, such as rival fans of royals Kate and Meghan using the Kensington Palace Instagram to send death threats to each other. Increasingly, online hate is triggering real-le violence. The slaughter of the Rohingya Muslims in Burma was, The New York Times said, “a genocide incited on Facebook”.Part of the reason that Zuckerberg has hired Clegg is to put his house in order. Clegg has talked the right talk about changing Facebook’s culture, and in particular doing more to tackle self-harm.He even says they might start paying more tax. ButZuckerberg’s answer to “how to fix the internet” is “hire Nick Clegg”, we have still got an awfully long way to go.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Some EU figures have admitted it isn’t. They could tweak the text, time-limit the backstop or find another solution.They choose not to. And they will stick to that as long as they believe Parliament’s Remainers will ultimately strip the Government of its only negotiating leverage, the threat to just walk away.Remainers, some in Cabinet, may well yet do that. Nonetheless last night should sow doubt in Brussels’ minds.The victorious Brady amendment demands a vital, legally binding change to the Irish backstop before the PM’s deal can pass, just as The Sun called for. Even a dejected Corbyn has conceded he now needs to talk to Mrs May.The PM needs to know precisely what she’s demanding from Brussels — and we’re far from confident the EU will see reason. It is still more likely Brexit will be delayed, softened to a point that could tear the Tories apart or halted.But, after last night’s staggering turnaround, who knows Corbynista MP Fiona Onasanya is a liar and crook richly deserving of a jail term far longer than three months.She must resign immediately. If not, her Peterborough constituents should sign the petition needed to oust her.We are baffled why the ex-Labour whip and solicitor received such leniency.

So I’m not bothered about no deal.Appearing as a special guest at the Tory Eurosceptic Bruges Group, Mr Stringer said: Often in discussing the European Union my colleagues use kindergarten language - they say theyre our friends, how could they not have our interests at heart .I think it misunderstands that actually the bureaucrats in Brussels are a self-interested group of people - self-interested in their own survival and perpetuating their growing power and influence across the whole of the European continent.“It also misunderstands the fact that the European Union do negotiate but they usually come to agreements at the last minute – the th hour.“And that is possible which is why it’s important to send the Prime Minister back to Brussels over the next fortnight because I think that the European Union – one can’t be certain – actually want to come to a deal.”In an ominous warning for his party he predicted Labour would lose a lot of seatsit continued to frustrate Brexit.And there would be electoral peril for the partyLabour officially backed a second referendum, the MP added.Mr Corbyn is under pressure to sack a number of Labour frontbenchers who defied his order to back the bid to delay Brexit."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/tp-graphic-backstop.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"eu backstop brexit nonsense","story":"Will Eurocrats cause needless ­disruption just to make a point  Would they rather see all sides suffer than watch a post-EU Britain succeed If so, what would it say about the ­organisation we are leaving Let’s take a moment to recap.Immediately after the referendum, EU officials declared they would not talk to Britain about a long-term relationship until we first agreed withdrawal terms, including a “orce payment”, rights for EU citizens and the Irish border.Britain foolishly agreed. It was ­particularly silly to discuss Ireland before the main trade talks, since the obvious way to prevent a hard border on the island is through a deep and ­comprehensive trade agreement between the UK and the EU as a whole.That, though, would have given Ireland a strong incentive to get the best possible terms for the UK, and for itself.So instead, at the end of , the EU suddenly came up with the idea of an “Irish backstop”.It wanted Britain to promise that, unless it came up with a long-term ­trading ­relationship that satisfied ­Brussels, it would stay in the customs union and leave Northern Ireland under EU regulations.Stupidly, British negotiators accepted the backstop. Wisely, our MPs did not.The backstop would mean Brussels continued to control Britain’s trade deals with non-European countries after we left.It would mean placing part of our country under permanent EU jurisdiction.MPs threw the deal out. Then something sensible happened.Leavers and Remainers began to talk directly to each other and hammered out a deal that both sides could live with.There were lots of aspects of the ­withdrawal agreement that Eurosceptics resented.They didn’t like being non- voting members for another  months.They didn’t like Euro judges continuing to rule here even after we had left.They didn’t like forking out more than billion quid in exchange for the better part of bugger all.But they were ready to make ­compromises. If the Irish ­backstop were removed, they’d swallow the rest of the withdrawal terms.On Tuesday, the House of Commons adopted this position. The EU responded with a theatrical snort of indignation.“We stand by the agreement that we have negotiated,” said Michel Barnier, the European Commission’s negotiator.“The withdrawal agreement is not ­renegotiable,” said Jean-Claude Juncker, President of the European Commission.But hang on. Juncker is simultaneously telling us thatwe alter our red lines — by, for example, agreeing to a ­permanent customs union — then the agreement could indeed be reopened.So there is plainly no technical or legal reason why the backstop could not be removed or at least time-limited.Nor, by the way, is anyone still ­pretending that, without the backstop, there will be checkpoints in Londonderry and Crossmaglen.The Irish government has confirmed that,there is no deal, it will not place any infrastructure at the border.The British Government has been saying the same all along.Barnier says there would be ways to carry out necessary checks away from the frontier.In other words, the whole row is about a border that no one is going to build anyway.It’s ­surreal. There is plainly no way the House of Commons is going to accept the backstop.It also became clear on ­Tuesday there is no majority for a ­second ­referendum, because the last thing Jeremy Corbyn wants is to have to come down on one side or the other.That leaves only two options. Either the backstop is dropped but everything  is agreed, or the backstop is lost and so is everything .From the EU’s point of view, it must surely be preferable to agree the bulk of the Withdrawal Agreement, including reciprocal citizens’ rights and the ­£billion payment, while finding an alternative way to guarantee the Irish border stays open.From Dublin’s point of view, the logic is even stronger.Insisting on the backstop risks,not a hard border, certainly more dislocation between the Republic of Ireland and the UK — the very thing the backstop is ­supposed to prevent.The EU has calculated the cost will be worse for Britain than for ­Continental states, since cross-Channel trade is ­proportionately more important for us.But, by that measure, it is more ­important still for Ireland.In private, some Continental politicians are pushing for a pragmatic outcome — one that minimises disruption and ­preserves the long-term alliance between the UK and its neighbours.You especially hear these arguments in countries that trade heavily with Britain, such as Denmark and the Netherlands.You also hear them from governments that want to ensure the rights of their citizens in Britain are guaranteed.But for Eurocrats, in particular the anti-British Martin Selmayr who has seized control of negotiations, this isn’t about finding an outcome that works.If it were, the EU could have signed a continuity deal with Britain easily.The truth is many Euro-fanatics are happy to inflict pain on the EU  ­provided they inflict even more on us.If their view prevails over that of the pragmatists, then Britain has no option but to leave without an agreement. It is never sensible to give into blackmail.If the choice is between No Deal and surrendering part of our country, we will choose No Deal.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The people who can’t get beds in our hospitals, or a place for their kids in the local school. All the while that £billion is being spent on fabulously berserk ­projects in the developing world.To her total credit, Mordaunt has said that our current level of spending on overseas aid is unsustainable. It’s been rising every year. Due to a law passed by the coalition government, we have to spend . per cent of our income on aid to the Third World each year.So right now we spend just under £billion. And where does this money go  No less than  per cent of it is siphoned off to global outfits like that most useless of organisations, the United Nations.This is the body which sent out some dimbo Australian envoy to tick off our Government about economic policy. An organisation which elected Saudi Arabia on to its Women’s Rights Commission. An anti-Western and rabidly anti-Israeli convocation of leftie Third World thugs with chips on their shoulders.The world would be enormously improvedthe UN was shut down tomorrow. And the rest of it  Some of the stuff you wouldn’t believe. A total of £, went to a project investigating Tibetan verbs. Nope, not kidding.I would assume that “climb” was one of the verbs they were investigating. They use that a lot, over there. Thanks to our overseas aid, someone, ­somewhere is now able to say in Tibetan: “F*** me, is that a yeti  Run away!”Then there’s the £, spent on a scheme to stop Indian schoolchildren imbibing sugary drinks. India itself gives overseas aid and has an income rather bigger than our own. Where is the point Another six-figure sum was spent ­persuading Chinese people not to smoke too much — China! The second richest country in the world.Another one was to help Indian workers cool their work­stations down — this in a country which has its own space programme, for Chrissakes. So much of our money is swallowed up by useless leftie quangos and charities to keep themselves in jobs.Still more is pocketed by despots in the horrible countries they run. It is a source of corruption and dependency. It makes things worse. And when we tried to ert our overseas aid to some of the Caribbean countries stricken by hurricanes we were told we couldn’t — they were too rich!It’s a nonsense and a racket. If I thought our overseas aid, in its current form, really alleviated misery and suffering I’d be all for it. That’s why I agreed with the last secretary of state, Priti Patel, who wanted to give a decent chunk to the Israel Defence Forces, which saves a lot of lives in Syria.So my recommendation would be to end it all NOW. Divert the money into our beleaguered and creaking infrastructure. And when a tragedy occurs overseas — sure, splash the cash.Anyway, Penny — hope I’ve helped by starting the conversation. Over to you, babes.SCOTTISH politician Ross Greer has already been called a “ginger turd” by Piers Morgan, and I don’t think I can improve on that. But it’s his ignorance and stupidity that staggers – rather than his hatred for Great Britain, which is something we’re used to from north of the border.Greer described Winston Churchill as a white supremacist, a mass murderer and a racist, and likened him to Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin. He says he is simply challenging the “myth” of Churchill. No, Ross, you’re not.You’re just pig ignorant, with a very poor grasp of history. Of course Churchill was racist. Just about everybody was of his age at that time.If you can’t see the importance of Churchill to winning the Second World War – against REAL racists, REAL mass murderers – when Britain stood alone, then you lack all sense of context and proportion.The more I think about it, the more I reckon “ginger turd” was an understatement.HERO of the week is the excellent Rachel Riley, who has been speaking out against anti-Semitism. As a consequence, she now needs greater security when she’s doing TV’s ­Countdown. The left-wing Jew-hating trolls have been after her.Rachel,  said: “The more I speak, the more abuse I get, and the more abuse I get, the more I speak. It’s got to the point where I can’t look at my Twitter feed any more. It’s just a constant stream.”She’s pretty clear who is behind it, too.  A lot of the abuse comes from people who sign off with the hashtag JCPM.SO, Labour MP Fiona Onasanya is off to prison. Found guilty in court of lying through her teeth.But the remarkable thing is she’s still going to be paid as an MP while she’s inside. She has refused to resign her seat and so her £, salary will continue to be paid by the rest of us.If you got sent to the nick, do you think your employers would continue to pay your wages  You’d be out on your ear. It’s kind of ­outrageous, no THIS cultural appropriation business is getting out of hand. Marks  Spencer has been slammed by leftie nutters with nothing better to do with their time. For selling a biryani wrap.They say it’s not authentic. Well of course it’s not bleedin’ authentic.  This is the UK, not Mumbai. Singer Katy Perry was attacked for wearing a kimono because she isn’t Japanese.White people in the US get criticised for wearing training shoes or sporting afros – that’s appropriating black culture, apparently. Though I think it was white folks who invented training shoes. Thing is, cultural appropriation is brilliant.It’s the way we have of sharing our respective cultures.  think it’s wonderful that countries outside Europe and the US have “culturally appropriated” democracy, sanitisation, railways, computers and so on. I wish more would do the same.SOMALIA is the most corrupt country in the world, according to a list compiled by a group called Transparency International.Not a great surprise, is it  Nor to see most of the rest of Africa hogging the bottom quarter of the world table.It’s bad governance and corruption that is keeping Africa poor – not colonialism. You can tell that the compilers of the report are lefties, though. Asked what countries were becoming more corrupt recently, they named the US, Hungary and Brazil. All three have elected right-wing governments.A NEW study says that women who wear short skirts are more likely to be ­promoted.The lesson I’d take from this,I were a women, is to wear a short skirt to work. But I don’t think that’s the lesson they mean us to take.I wonderwomen who wear short skirts but have the legs of an obese ­elephant also are more likely to get ­promoted I think that’s the next study for those researchers at the ­University of Surrey.I TOLD you last week that the reason we haven’t had a proper winter yet is that the people who run winter couldn’t agree on stuff.Such as whether it should be a hard winter, with lots of snow, no winter at all or a compromise deal with a backstop of some sleet for a bit.But I understand that on Tuesday the President of ­Winter won an astonishing ­victory and was able to push her deal through.Which was why it immediately snowed like hell.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

One, John Mann from Leave-voting Bassetlaw in Notts, yesterday outraged rival backbenchers by quipping: “Show me the money”.David Lammy, a Labour People’s Vote supporter, said any colleagues who took the money would be “cowards and facilitators” and said “history will be brutal”.Wes Streeting – another second referendum backer – said their actions would “never be forgiven”.But Tories in seaside towns such as Clacton, Great Yarmouth, Hastings and Skegness are also set to benefit. One insider said the money could prove critical in helping the PM win a majority when her Meaningful Vote comes back to the Commons.Separately No. is drawing up new primary legislation on workers’ rights and environmental protection to try and win over more Labour backbenchers.Details of the new ‘Bill’ are expected next week after another meeting between Business Secretary Greg Clark and Unite chief Len McCluskey. The pair met earlier this week to thrash out details.One source said: “Len McCluskey is a dealmaker is being very useful behind the scenes. There’s talk he convinced Jeremy Corbyn to finally meet the PM.”Another told The Sun: “The Government needs to underpin the commitments they have made to the unions. This won’t just be an amendment to something but a new Bill.”A number of union officials met Whitehall teams in the Cabinet Office yesterday.A TUC spokesman signalled the unions would not settle for “warm words or half measures” from Government.THE day after the referendum, The Sun called for billions to be pumped into ­working-class communities ignored by London’s politicians.So Theresa May’s pledges to do just that in rundown coastal towns and Labour’s former mining heartlands are very welcome.Eventhey are decades late and a ploy to win votes for her deal.New infrastructure, NHS upgrades and skills training are just what’s needed.But we would go further, with radical regional tax breaks to lure employers.Rebalancing our economy towards Leave-voting areas and away from comfortably off Remain ones is what any Government should be doing.Labour’s “people’s vote” bores are hysterical about it, of course.The status quo suits them fine and Mrs May’s tactic could — shock, horror — secure Brexit.The fact they are crying foul, and would rather get their way than see hard-up towns bailed out by a Tory Government, shows how warped their priorities now are.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The worrying funding gap means tough choices need to be made about cuts or paring back hardware schemes, according to the Commons Public Accounts Committee. But a report published today paints a picture of a department in denial – as it orders new fighter jets, warships and armoured vehicles. The MoD even admits the dference between forecast costs and its budget “could widen to pound.billion, but even this looks to be unlikely and overly optimistic”, MPs reveal. Chairwoman Meg Hillier said: “In terms of poor financial planning, the Ministry of Defence is a repeat offender. “The department’s progress with addressing the concerns set out in our last report on the defence equipment plan has been woeful. “The MoD simply cannot afford everything it says it needs and it is not acceptable for officials to continue deferring decisions that have a bearing on its current affordability gap and longer-term risks.” The committee reveals in its report: “In May  we reported that the Ministry of Defence did not have enough money to buy and support the equipment it needs.   “Despite committing to tackle this problem, the department has made little progress, continuing to delay the dficult decisions needed to make the equipment plan affordable, particularly around which programmes to stop, delay or scale back.” Major cost projects worth tens of billions of pounds on its books include ordering up to  F- stealth fighter jets for the RAF and Royal Navy’s new aircraft carriers, building five Type e light frigates and ordering Ajax armoured vehicles for the Army. The committee recommends “the department’s future Equipment Plans should include more information on the cost, maturity and risks of the largest rojects , as well as being more transparent about its costing approach”. Its scathing -page study claims “the escalating and continuing affordability issues have led to short-term decision making which has only worsened the longer-term affordability risks”. It goes on: “As a direct result, there is uncertainty for both the department and for industry which needs to be addressed. “Coupled with our ongoing concerns over the department’s ability to forecast costs and efficiencies accurately, we remain sceptical that the department is close to reconciling what it says it needs with the funding it has available.” "},{"url":null,"title":"jeremy corbyn pays tribute lifelong","story":"NewsJeremy Corbyn pays tribute to lelong friend Jeremy Hardy who has died aged The comedian, who described himself as politics and played an active role in campaigning, died early on Friday morning, his representative confirmed in an emotional statement.ShareByNicola BartlettPolitical Correspondent:,  FEB NewsJeremy Corbyn posted a picture of friend Jeremy Hardy in tribute on Twitter \"Get politics updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailJeremy Corbyn has paid tribute to his lelong friend Jeremy Hardy who has died from cancer at the age of The comedian, who described himself as politics and played an active role in campaigning, died early on Friday morning, his representative confirmed in an emotional statement.

The infant has been named Roman by police after the street she was found in. A woman and her son who found the baby said she was purple and cold to the touch. The tiny newborn was discovered in a shopping bag next to a park bench in a deserted playground late last night. She was left in freezing temperatures wrapped in a towel in the bag. According to police, a woman walking her dog past the play area in Newham, east London was alerted to the shivering baby when she heard her cries at .pm. Georgina Player, , who lives around the corner from the play area in East Ham said: The police came knocking at midnight to tell us what happened. They said she was only -minutes-old when she was found - she even still had her umbilical cord.   Shes at Newham Hospital and Im going to go there this afternoon to drop some things off for her - babygrows, milk, anything. I feel so bad for the little thing. She was left in a towel and plastic bag on the ground, next to the bench - not even on it. The police had snfer dogs trying to find a blood trial but they couldnt, which makes me ask how she left in that state. Although it was dark, a lot of people pass through here.

Rima said: “She was crying for her le. The baby saved herself.” Her son Ovidijus, who lives just  yards away, rushed to help. He said the infant looked purple and was cold to the touch. The -year-old added: I would say it was inhumane, to do such a thing, to leave a baby like that. Slwek Pelka, , was walking his German shepherd through the play area just  minutes before the baby was found. He said: Its crazy to think I was there just before, it was totally empty apart from a man sitting on the bench.  When the police and ambulance came, I thought maybe he had died. It was very cold and snowing. A -year-old mother living opposite the empty playground said: I saw the ambulance and police arrive and paramedics running and holding a baby wrapped in a towel. At first I thought it was a stabbing and I was terried. I was the only one in the house with my baby. They blocked off the whole area. It was freezing. It was snowing really heavily. It is really upsetting. She didnt have to leave the baby in the snow and cold, she could have left her on my doorstep and rang the bell. A -year-old grandmother added: My neighbour thinks the poor woman might have given birth there. I really feel for her. She must have been so distressed and she did the best she could. She will have known the playground gets busy and someone will have found her. Police confirmed that the baby girl is recovering in an east London hospital and her condition is now stable.   A police spokesman said: She has been unofficially referred to as Roman after the road where she was found, a small children play area on Roman Road. The child was discovered by a woman walking her dog with her children after she heard the child cry. When found they alerted the emergency services immediately. There were no other people present. She was found next to a park bench, not hidden. The child was discovered in a shopping bag in a white towel on the floor.

Temperatures in Braemar, Aberdeenshire, plunged to minus .Con Thursday evening, which is the lowest temperature recorded anywhere in the UK since , according to the Met Office .The snowfall already exceeds the maximum cm of snowfall that was predicted when the forecaster issued a severe weather warning for Thursday.   But this is nothing compared to what people went through in  during Britains coldest winter since records began. Snow started falling on Boxing Day  and the UK didnt start to warm up until March. Huge snowdrts of up to  feet deep were seen across the country and it was so cold even the sea froze over. In some places temperatures dropped to minus C and massive ice boulders formed on the nations beaches.   Even the Thames froze over and the winter had such an impact on the nation it has featured in an episode of Call The Midwe. School closures were common and as the big freeze dragged on, telephone lines were brought down and thousands of homes were hit by power cuts. Virtually all of England and Wales were coated in a thick blanket of snow. While a huge number of sports matches had to be called off because the pitches lay below feet of snow, people found new hobbies.   The first ever car rally was held on the Thames and instead of water skiing, people were towed across the ice behind a motor. Met Office spokesman Grahame Madge reveals the average temperature across the UK for the whole of the winter was a bone chilling minus .C. The big freeze was caused by an anticyclone, which hovere over Scandinavia and pulled the cold air from the arctic and Russia to Britain. An area of high pressure near Iceland meant the milder and wetter air from the Atlantic was blocked from reaching Britain and the snow could never thaw.  And still the snow kept coming. Finally the thaw set on on March  when people woke up for the first time in months to no snow anywhere. And while the current weather looks set to cause chaos for the rest of the day and into the weekend, an Atlantic jet stream will be bringing wet, windy and warmer weather next week. And experts say that wnter weather patterns are changing as the UK gets warmer.  Grahame explained: The climate records tell us that winter is changing. For example in the decade from  to , the UK had five per cent fewer days where temperatures dipped below freezing and motorists had to scrape their car windscreens nine per cent fewer times because of a corresponding drop in the number of ground frosts when compared with the period from -.

The full time mum-of-one, from Eastbourne, East Sussex, was hospitalised for a week and struggled to walk and look after her son. Now, she has been left with a cm-wide scar, and is embarrassed to wear bikinis, she said. Rebecca says: The accident changed my le. I still have flashbacks of what happened.  After years of unexplained seizures, Rebecca was finally diagnosed with epilepsy in February  when she was . In August , Rebecca was recuperating after she broke her leg in a horse riding accident. She said: I felt miserable because I was stuck at home alone. Six weeks after the accident, I was home alone and the heating was on full blast as it was freezing outside. But after a few hours I got too hot, so I changed into thin pyjama shorts. Then I heaved myself into the kitchen to grab a drink. But as I stood up, I felt light-headed and the room started to spin.  Before I tried to steady myself, I collapsed onto the floor. The next thing I knew, I woke up  minutes later to my brother shaking me and screaming my name. Rebecca had landed with her right bum cheek against the radiator which had seared her skin as she lay unconscious. Her brother Harvey Peasgood, , a fisherman, found her on the floor and called an ambulance. Rebecca said: I realised I must have had another seizure. Suddenly I felt an agonising pain in my bum, it felt like it was on fire.  I didnt realise what had happened yet, as I was in and out of consciousness. When the paramedics arrived and tried to remove Rebeccas shorts to check the damage to her bum the fabric had melted into her skin. An ambulance took her to hospital then an hour later she was transferred to a specialist burns unit at Queen Victoria Hospital in Tunbridge Wells, Kent. Rebeccas mum Elaine Petherick, , a carer, her fiance Ben Weston, , a plasterer, and her son Joshua, seven, rushed to the hospital to be by her side. Rebecca said: The doctors gave morphine for the pain, but it wasnt working so I was hysterical. Doctors told me that I had suffered third-degree burns and would be scarred for le.  Every time nurses dressed my wounds twice a day, it felt like they were stabbing me. I was too afraid to look at it in the mirror, I told the nurses I wasnt ready to see it yet. I couldnt sit down, I was forced to lay on my side and my stomach. It wasnt until a few weeks later when I built up the courage to look in the mirror at the damage. All the skin had burned off and there was horrible blisters everywhere. It was the most sickening sight, I was mortied. Doctors told Rebecca that she needed a skin graft and that they planned to take the skin from her leg once her cast was off. A month later in October , Rebecca underwent her first skin graft but, to her horror, it became infected a week later.   Rebecca said: The doctors needed to remove the infected skin and wait for it to heal. The pain was so intense that I was put under general anaesthetic while they cleaned the wound. I couldnt believe I was stuck in hospital again, it had taken over my le. When I ed home two weeks later, I struggled to look after my son Joshua because it was too painful to walk. Three months later in January , Rebecca finally had her second skin graft. Thankfully, it was a success. She says: I was so over the moon. Now today, my bum has healed, and it looks so much better. But the scar has really affected my confidence. I no longer wear bikinis or shorts. I still have horrible flashbacks of that day, it will haunt me forever. Anything that involves heat, like taking a hot bath, makes me panic. Ive even started counselling because of what happened. However, Im lucky that Ben has been so supportive. My scar doesnt bother him at all, it just goes to prove beauty is only skin deep.

Al-Hijrah school in Birmingham was ordered to stop the unlawful practice by the Court of Appeal in . However, it is believed the school is still enforcing “very strict gender segregation” and not allowing girls to eat until after the boys. Luke Tryl, director of corporate strategy at Ofsted, also said that the school continues to teach from very discriminatory texts... encouraging violence against women. Mr Tryl told MPs: The Court of Appeal rightly said that schools needed a transition period where they were segregating and yet still we have not just Al-Hijrah but we have countless other schools, mixed schools which are segregating on the basis of sex. Similarly other schools who have refused to teach about sexual orientation issues. We have commented on reports but we havent seen a change there.  This is where I talk about the isolation. We go out there. We make these tough decisions and we often take quite a lot of criticism for the stance we take but we dont always see the enforcement action we would like to see.According to the Birmingham Mail , Ofsted rated the school as inadequate in .Court of Appeal judges ruled a year ago that city council-funded Al-Hijrah, which is in special measures, was discriminating against its pupils contrary to the Equality Act . In the letter, sent on October , Ofsted said: We noted that the school continues to operate an unlawful discriminatory policy of strict segregation by sex in the secondary phase.  Plans for the school’s future and current practice take some account of the need to address this practice. However, having considered all the evidence I am of the opinion that at this time - leaders and managers are not taking effective action towards the removal of special measures.” A spokesperson for Birmingham City Council said: “The IEB [Interim Executive Board] is proposing that from September  Al-Hijrah will offer mixed gender primary education only, on a new site, converting to an academy following a directive academy order from the department for education.

Scientists are looking for couples in Edinburgh and Manchester to take part in a groundbreaking study. Called NES T, it suppresses sperm production in menused daily, with the product applied to their upper arms and shoulders. As many women can experience uncomfortable side effects from traditional contraceptives such as the pill, researchers have been looking for alternatives. The gel has been developed as part of an international project funded by the US National Institute of Health and led by the Los Angeles Biomedical Research Institute and the University of Washington School of Medicine. In the UK, work is being done by Saint Marys Hospital, which is part of Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust, and the University of Edinburgh. Professor Richard Anderson, of the University of Edinburghs MRC Centre for Reproductive Health, said: Previous trials have shown that hormonal contraception for men can be safe and effective.   This trial allows men to self-administer a gel, which may be much more convenient and acceptable than needing repeated injections, as was the case with previous trials. Dr Cheryl Fitzgerald, consultant gynaecologist at Saint Marys Hospital, who is leading the study in Manchester, said: Currently the contraceptive options for men are limited to condoms and vasectomies. We believe this preparation will allow men to control their fertility in a safe and simple way. Men aged between  and  who are in a stable relationship with a woman aged between  and  are invited to be part of the trial by calling   or    . The two-year trial will require them to use the gel as their sole method of birth control, with the men taking part attending at monthly clinics to monitor sperm production.

The Duke, , made sure to stop and chat to the adorable nursery school children who gathered waving flags to meet the prince and his we Meghan, .However, some of the three and four-year-olds from Abbeywood Tots appeared to be more excited by their snack of digestive biscuits than their brush with royalty. Meghan giggled: They are very good at waving flags. And Harry was heard joking to the nursery staff: How do you keep them all under control  He added to the youngsters: You know you guys can run anywhere you like  as he bent down to check they werent too cold. He then asked: Are you nice and warm in here  as he admired one of the children’s snowsuits  Nursery worker India Leachman, , said afterwards: “The children beckoned them over, like ‘we’re excited to see you’, waving their flags and as soon as they came over, they were interested in their biscuits. “They looked very interested in all the children and making sure they were warm and thanked them for coming out.” The Duchess also stopped to admire one little girl’s plastic tiara and princess dress, which she wore under a zipped up snowsuit. The couple, who travelled  miles from Kensington Palace, were greeted by a winter wonderland after the area was hit by flurries overnight. They were forced to cancel their plans to fly because of the bad weather and arrived in Bristol by train, about half an hour later than planned. Meghan wrapped up warm in a pound, silk-chfon midi Oscar de la Renta dress, vintage William coat and pound olive leather boots by designer Sarah Flint.

Meghan told fans: We tried our best to get here fast. She later apologised and said Sorry my hand is cold.  One member of the public told Meghan how her now-defunt blog The Tig had been an inspiration to her. The Duchess also chatted to another fan about yoga and how it was relaxing for the mind, body and soul. She added: A nice practice would be so fantastic right now.

The normal journey would have taken them less than five minutes but the managed to engage in anal and oral sex and masturbation on the Northern Line trip.Mason later posted the film on Twitter and boasted: It is outrageously horny we could not stop ourselves.Magistrate Lucinda Lubbock was shown stills of the sex acts and said: This was a very unpleasant and serious offence on the public underground.   Although it took place back in July the seriousness of the offence is exacerbated by the fact it went on social media. Turning to Mason, Ms Lubbock added: We feel that your role in this incident and the subsequent uploading was more serious and more of a senior role. Giving the pair community orders she remarked: This is a lesson to both of you. You have been humiliated in the court of social media.

Robert Simpson, prosecuting, said: The two men in the dock engaged in ious sexual acts in a tube train including full anal, and oral sex and masturbation and this was in the presence of the travelling public. The incident was recorded by them and the video of what happened was subsequently uploaded on to Twitter where another gay man saw it and thought it had crossed the line of what was acceptable, and the incident was reported to the police.  The Twitter account was traced back to Mason by the British Transport Police. Speaking about Masons account Mr Simpson said: It is not for the vicars tea party.

Justying her decision on the grounds of her Christian beliefs, Davis’ actions spurred several protests and even landed her five days in Jail for ignoring the courts orders.   “Only Davis refused to comply with the law as was her obligation and as required by the oath of office she took,” Palmer Vance, an attorney of Kentucky State said.

Nicole, , and Matthew Ziesemer, , had only just been introduced to daughter Blakeley when doctors realised the new mum was still in labour. Medics caring for Nicole spotted another head during a post-birth clean up and baby Cade was born  minutes later. During her pregnancy, Nicole only had one scan - the day she went into labour. And it is thought Cabe was not spotted as he was hiding behind his sister. Nicole, from Grand Haven, Michigan, US, is now home and delighted with the two new additions to her family. The -year-old, who worked in insurance before becoming a mum, said: It was crazy. We were over the moon but it utter shock. There were really no signs that I was carrying more than one baby, in fact people said how small I was. We thought the biggest surprise was going to be the sex of the baby, little did we know. It was really scary when they said that something  was inside me.  She continued: And when they told us that it was another baby I literally asked hershe was lying. I just couldnt take it all in and was still in so much pain that it was almost impossible to process. But I really cant imagine having just one baby now. Its like they were meant to be. I love the thought that theyll always have each other. Nicole planned a natural home birth with just a midwe present but had to go to the nearest hospital - Gerber Memorial, Michigan - when her waters broke at just  weeks The new mum - who had severe morning sickness throughout the pregnancy - decided to forgo painkillers in favour of breathing exercises, a yoga ball and cool showers. She did not have any scans throughout her pregnancy, apart from one on the day her waters broke, because she wanted a natural pregnancy. But after being in labour for over  hours, the expectant mum opted for an epidural and a suction.   Blakeley arrived two hours later at .pm on December  weighing lbs oz. But doctors grew worried as instead of the pain subsiding, Nicole was still in agony after the delivery. They were due to stitch Nicoles vagina up but realised something  was in there, Nicole said. While medics were trying to retrieve her placenta, it became clear something was not quite right and decided to do an emergency ultrasound. Nicole gave birth again  minutes later, to a baby boy, weighing lbs. Baby Cade, who was having dficulty breathing on his own, was rushed straight off to nearby Spectrum Hospital, in Grand Rapids, Michigan, USA.   Nicole, who stayed with her daughter, said: Over the next few days my husband was primarily with Cade while my daughter and I stayed in for observations. We were still reeling from the shock and just trying to get our heads around it all. But primarily all we wanted was for them both to be strong and healthy. The craziest thing is that on the day I went into labour I did have a scan but it only picked up the one baby. They think that Cade must have been hiding right behind his sister. When they were allowed home the couple, who met online in , went shopping for duplicates of all the baby equipment they had previously purchased for just one.  Matt, a chiropractor, and Nicole have since been told that twins and triplets run in her side of the family. She said: It was amazing to hear that its a bit of a family tradition, my grandmas cousins apparently had twins and triplets. People do ask uswe were to have another baby would we have scans this time  but I honestly dont think we would. Unless there were any clear medical red flags, Id do it just the same all over again. Matt added: It was truly was just such a surreal moment. I could not believe that my we was carrying two children that entire time. My we does an amazing job with the two of them.

But others were much more sinister: “I’d make sushi outta ur kidneys n chopsticks outta ur hand bones.” The man told police Ades repeatedly contacted him after the date, even though he told her he didn’t want to see or hear from her again. After he blocked her number Ades retuned to her native Arizona but in July  the man spotted her parked outside his home. She still managed to get in touch with him though and her texts became more threatening and delusional.  “You should die,” one message said. “You have worn out ur welcome.” Other texts claimed the time had come for Ades own “self gain.” “I’m turning u in for the money!” another text said. Later a message was sent demanding cash: “I need money. U will give to me. I’ll force it.”   It is alleged that Ades then broke into his home last April. Officers found her naked in the bath after she brought over food, wine and her two dogs. In her car outside cops found an eight-inch butcher’s kne, officials said. She was arrested on April  last year at the businessman’s home in Paradis Valley, Arizona. Adds denies stalking and trespassing, according to the New York Post.

Billi Fitzsimons revealed the unusual tale in a post on MamaMia.au.She claims she left work at about pm on the day in question and headed home to enjoy a dip in her familys swimming pool as the weather was incredibly warm. After changing out of her clothes and into her bikini she made her way to the outdoor pool - only to spot something weird. There was a girl tanning on the perimeter of the pool, she said. Which was annoying because I really had hoped to go for a swim without the company of a random. However, not a fan of confrontation, Billi couldnt bring herself to talk to the stranger, and instead dashed back inside the house to hide.   She text her brother to find outhe knew the girl in the pool, to which he replied he would be home soon. He added that he kind of knew the girl, who was a friend of a friend. It turned out her brother had invited a friend over and shed bought the random girl with her for extra company. But when the brothers friend left, the other girl stayed behind - and had been in their house all day by herself, posing with their possessions for Instagram content.   I decided to have a stalk of her social media, admits Billi. On her Instagram profie, her latest upload was a very generic photo of her in a bikini on an inflatable flamingo in the pool. I noticed my brother had commented I consider this breaking and entering, which gave me small sense of satisfaction. But then she noticed the caption on the photo. The girl said the flamingo had drowned shortly after the photo was taken - and Billi later discovered she had broken her pool toy, which had been a Christmas gt.   If that wasnt bad enough, on the girls Instagram story there was also a photo of her drinking roseacute wine in the pool. The influencer had opened a bottle of roseacute and poured herself a glass ONLY to take a photo, explained Billi. She added: If influencing is the art of deception then Instagram is a gallery. And it is evident that the limit literally does not exist when it comes to just how far these people will go to get their likes.

Koku Istambulova, a survivor of Stalin’s repressions, would have turned  in June, according to accepted pension records in Russia. She was older than a woman listed in the Russian Book of Records who died last month supposedly aged , officials believed. Koku made headlines last year by saying she had never lived a single happy day in her long le. Her grandson Iliyas Abubakarov said she had supper as usual on Sunday, January  at her village home in Chechnya.   “She was joking, she was talking,” he said. “Then she suddenly felt unwell, she complained of a chest pain.“We called the doctor, we were told that her blood pressure had dropped, and injections were made.“But they failed to save her. She died in a quiet way, fully conscious, praying.” She has been buried in her home village Bratskoe, survived by five grandchildren and  great grandchildren. A Muslim who was born before the last Tsar Nicholas II was crowned, she outlived the Soviet Union by a generation, according to her internal Russian passport. Her date of birth was claimed to be  June  - when Queen Victoria was on the throne in Britain. But her passport gave only a year of her birth, not the exact day and month.   In extraordinary and moving testimony broadcast last year she spoke emotionally of the appalling day her native Chechen people were deported en masse by Stalin to the steppes of Kazakhstan  years ago. She told how people died in the cattle-truck trains - and their bodies were thrown out of the carriages to be eaten by hungry dogs. If her age was correct, Koku was  at the time, having earlier lived through the coronation of the last tsar Nicholas II two days before her th birthday - and his toppling when she was . “It was a bad day, cold and gloomy,” she said of the February morning in  when the entire entire nation was banished from their mountain homeland in the Trans-Causacus. “We were put in a train and taken … no one knew where. “Railway carriages were stuffed with people - dirt, rubbish, excrement was everywhere.” Stressing the cruelty of Stalin’s action, she told journalists determinedly in her native Chechen language: “Write that - there was excrement in the carriages.   “We were not allowed [to go] anywhere.” Young Caucasus girls died because from the rupturing of their bladders - they were ashamed to go to the toilet in crowded stinking the crowded trains. Older women tried to crowd round them to stop their embarrassment as they relieved themselves. Yet there was worse. “On the way to our exile, dead bodies were just thrown out of the train,” she said. “Nobody was allowed to bury the dead. “Corpses were eaten by dogs. My father-in-law was thrown out of the train in this way.” A paranoid Stalin had alleged the Chechens were collaborating with the Nazis. “We were told that we were bad people and thats why we had to leave,” she said. Before the war, she recalled “scary” Nazi tanks passing her family home. She suffered devastating personal bereavements in her Kazakh hell - her two sons both perished in the harsh conditions. “There were no doctors, no-one to treat them,” she said. “My younger boy came down with something and passed away really quickly.   Such things happened in every family. “When women gave birth children often died because there were no obstetricians, only neighbours and friends.” Weeping the old lady said: “I only kept my daughter Tamara.” She was exiled in Kazakhstan for  years then, after Stalin’s death, people were allowed toto their homeland. When she got back, many houses had been grabbed by incoming Russians - so she set to work building her own home, complaining her husband was too lazy for the work. She conceded that despite her earlier claim, the day she moved into her own house, built with her own hands, after ing from internal Soviet exile was “happy”. “I built it myself, the best house in the world,” she said. “I lived there for  years.” Asked about the secret of going le, she previously said: “It was God’s will. “I did nothing to make it happen. “I see people going in for sports, eating something special, keeping themselves fit, but I have no idea how I lived until now.” Her recipe for a long le was fermented milk, but she shunned meat and soup. She asked: Why did Allah give me such a long le and so little happiness .... “I would have been dead long ago,not for Allah who was holding me in his arms.” Koku said: “It is hard to live when all who remembered you died long ago. And it is very scary to die, however old you are.” The oldest documented human was Jeanne Calment, from France, who lived  years,  days, dying in . French scientists have dismissed a recent claim from Russian researchers who argued she assumed the identity of her dead daughter and was not as old as records show.

They’ve two games to come against County and one final crack at Ayr and, of those showdowns, two are at Tannadice.Yes, the two heaviest defeats of the season came there against County and Ayr but under Neilson that second defeat was the only one he’s suffered in seven home games so far.And last time he sent out a team to face County he did mastermind what was without doubt the best win of the campaign to date, a gritty - success on their patch, in November.If the manager can mould his rebuilt team over the next few weeks, wins like that one can be repeated.They’ll have to be, or United’s big-game failures will see them negotiating even more vital outings in the play-offs."},{"url":null,"title":"mcdonalds-launches-veggie-happy-meals-as-greggs-sells-vegan-sausage-rolls","story":"MCDONALDrsquoS restaurants across Glasgow have launched their first-ever vegetarian Happy Meal for children from today."},{"url":null,"title":"richard-madden-flashback-to-when-rising-actor-spoke-to-the-evening-times","story":"RENFREWSHIRE actor Richard Madden has picked up a Golden Globe for his role in gripping BBC drama Bodyguard."},{"url":null,"title":"second-taco-bell-to-open-in-glasgow-city-centre","story":"Glasgow is set to welcome a second Taco Bell restaurant."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-airport-helps-deliver-14bn-boost-for-scottish-economy","story":"GLASGOW Airport makes more than pound.billion a year for the Scottish economy and supports , jobs, a report has shown."},{"url":null,"title":"scots-take-an-extra-14-minutes-to-get-out-of-bed-on-cold-mornings","story":"Chilly winter mornings lead usto spend an extra  hoursin bed over the colder months - just from hitting the snooze button."},{"url":null,"title":"singer-tom-walker-to-perform-surprise-gig-on-busy-glasgow-street","story":"SINGER Tom Walker is to play a special performance in Glasgow city centre tomorrow."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-maternity-infection-source-may-never-be-known","story":"THEsource of an infection that contributed to the deaths of two premature babies in a hospital intensive care unit may never be known, NHS chiefs have said."},{"url":null,"title":"customers-overpaying-for-unused-mobile-data-7-ways-to-avoid-it","story":"MOST mobile customers on SIM-only deals are overpaying for unused data, Citizens Advice has warned."},{"url":null,"title":"neil-lennon-described-as-magnificent-human-being-by-irvine-welsh-after-exit-from-hibs","story":"Trainspotting author Irvine Welsh has showed his support for Neil Lennon."},{"url":null,"title":"ryan-christie-vows-celtic-are-determined-to-kick-on-after-opening-up-six-point-lead","story":"ltBodyTextgt"},{"url":null,"title":"council-bosses-could-change-plans-for-free-nursery-places-helping-10000-families","story":"UP TO , families could benefit from new council plans to increase access to free childcare."},{"url":null,"title":"cab-driver-hauled-before-licensing-committee-to-explain-speeding-ticket","story":"A CAB driver was pulled over by police for speeding as he tried to reach his pregnant we."},{"url":null,"title":"judy-murray-takes-on-role-with-kiltwalk","story":"JUDY Murray has been appointed a trustee of Britainrsquos fastest growing charity event, the Kiltwalk."},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04119000/04119423.jpg","title":"Clachnacuddin FC pays tribute to superfan from Yorkshire","story":"Bronwyn Wain , who lived in Huddersfield, was described as a ldquolovely lady and ldquoreal character by club figures.Despite living in Yorkshire, her unlikely association with the club began in  when she got in touch with the Lilywhites out of curiosity about the clubrsquos name and history.The links grew from there and she became a true Lily when she visited Grant Street as club guest in .

When did two players from Mid Argyll help Rangers win the Scottish Cup The answer is # . Local girls Jasmine McPhie and Carla Todd were both key players in Rangers Girls triumphant run in the Girls Under  Scottish Cup.In their run to the final, Rangers played the top four under  girls teams in Scotland beating Aberdeen - in the first round, then Hamilton - and Central Girls - in rounds two and three. A quarter-final tie against Glasgow City saw the Rangers Girls win - to set up an old firm semi-final against Celtic Girls in which the Rangers Girls emerged - winners in a close game.The final was played on Saturday November  at the Oriam Performance Centre in Edinburgh. In a competitive match, Rangers started strong but Hibernian began to come into the game and whilst both sides had chances, the score remained - at half time. In the second half, Rangers took the lead in  minutes but three minutes later Hibernian drew level.There were few chances in the remainder of the second half and at full time both teams were level at -. Rangers took the lead again in extra time with a deserved winner to secure the cup.Jasmine and Carla came through the Lochgilphead Soccer Centre from primary one age to primary seven, playing in local festivals.In   the girls were important members of the successful Lochgilphead Red Star  team which won the DFDL league cup and finished second in their league.

It was written for Count Friedrich Wilhelm, supposedly simplied for amateurs to play. However, Jamal and Jâms being master musicians showed the power of this often disregarded piece, to be immense. One of the first works to make piano and cello equal musical partners, it is full of ingenious dialogue between the instruments. The structure is unusual, but with such expert performers it delighted the audience who were moved by every turn and twist of this deeply emotional work.Jâms, from North Wales, after remarking on the three ferry crossings required to get to Ardrishaig via Bute, introduced the next piece, Ernest Bloch’s work ‘From Jewish Le’. In a style close to Jamal’s heart and heritage, having been born in Baku Azerbaijan, its three elements, ‘Prayer’, ‘Supplication’ and ‘Jewish Song’, are full of the pathos and sorrow felt by the Jewish nation and also full of the signature augmented intervals and minor key tonality of much of middle eastern musics. How beautully these pieces demonstrated the lyrical qualities of the cello. Jamal’s bow searched for all possible nuances of tone and dynamic as his instrument sang from its lowest notes to a seductive soprano register.The concert continued after the interval with a second Beethoven work. The audience may have noticed a minor kerfuffle at the piano as many pages were rapidly turned before starting. Would it be the ‘Seven Variations’ for cello and piano or the ‘Twelve’, both based on themes from Mozart’s Magic Flute  The ‘Seven Variations’ won, being on the theme from the ‘Pamina’ and ‘Papageno’ duet entitled ‘In men, who know the feeling of love’. This work exhibits Beethoven’s practised ingenuity in the iation form and brought a lighter mood to the programme.Jâms Coleman introduced the final work, Frank Bridge’s Cello Sonata. He told of the four years of torment for the composer as he struggled to express his feelings about the First World War, finally finishing the composition in . The adagio in the piece caused the composer the most dficulty as he struggled with ambivalence about his own pacist views. Jâms and Jamal dealt with the challenges of this complex work which tracks huge changes in the world of music composition that were under way at that time. Again, the lyrical powers of the cello came to the fore as did the virtuosic requirements heaped on the pianist. Despite its undoubted innovations, this piece generously reaches out to its audience. Bridge uses the new musical freedoms only when justied, being happy toto more traditional tonal stability in the lyrical sections.Fulfilled, but not overburdened by the weightiness of the final piece, the audience applauded Jamal and Jâms back to the concert room to perform the ‘Swan’ from Saint-Saens ‘Carnival of the Animals’ as encore. This piece so beautully confirmed the excellence of Jamal’s playing and the superb quality of his quite special instrument.PIC:Jamal Aliyev and Jâms Coleman. no_aJamalandJam"},{"url":null,"title":"inveraray carpet bowling club festive pairs competition","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Inveraray Carpet Bowling Club held its annual festive pairs competition.The first prize of turkeys was won by George Morrison and Alan Cameron.

It#s a therapy to assist your body to heal itself.#If you think about it,you go in for an operation, effectively that operation is a wound and your body reacts to a surgeon#s kne the same way as toyou cut yourself on glass. In many conditions, such as psoriasis, chronic wounds, sports injuries, fibromyalgia, these are all tissue-damaging and the body#s response to tissue damage is the same. So when we say that oxygen therapy will help with stroke and brain damage and a whole range of things, we#re not saying it#s specic for that purpose, we#re saying it will support and help the symptoms.#We#ve all seen it. Patients will go in for a session and when they come out their eyesight has improved, their balance has improved, their general energy has improved. After a week or two it deteriorates again.#We can now deliver oxygen as cheaply to many as delivering to one. So we can expand our operations to treat as many people as we can at no great expense.#MS Centre outreach worker Claire Cameron said: #The hyperbaric oxygen chamber has always been here the centre was built around it. But the new oxygen generator was only put in in May. That#ll save us about £, a year because we#re producing our own oxygen.#That figure in turn allows the MS Centre to ask for a suggested donation of £ a session, rather than the £ a session charged where, which will make it much more accessible considering doctors often suggest a session of an hour per day for six weeks.Claire said: #Another centre said they had people coming in with walking sticks and after  days, not needing the walking stick.#We are thinking about joining with other community groups, such as sports groups or alcohol and drug recovery groups.#Oxygen can aid a iety of ailments not even thought of, such as insomnia, repairing damage due to drug and alcohol abuse and even cancer.Claire added: #Plus it helps collagen, so it reduces wrinkles!#Booking session in the chamber is easy # just drop in to the MS Centre on Union Street, Lochgilphead."},{"url":null,"title":"houses and offices to create a loch fyne hub","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowClose to the rapidly-rising childcare centre building at the head of Loch Fyne, Ardkinglas Estate is building new offices for rent, while Fyne Homes has been given the green light to build six affordable housing units over the next year.With the support of EU Leader funding, the estate is building a new office development comprising eight large rooms that will be let either to start-up, small businesses or to existing ones that need additional space, with the addition of shared staff facilities on each floor.Ardkinglas Estate manager Jean Maskell said: #We are delighted that our new build office block has been started.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13926204.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_18355078.jpg","title":"ayr united 2 inverness 3","story":"NewsAyr United  Inverness : John Roberston hails Somerset Park among best grounds in worldThe Inverness gaffer was full of praise for the old fashioned surroundings as his side clung on in the face of a stirring fightback.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN NewsNathan Austin puts Caley - up \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailJohn Robertson hailed Somerset Park as one of the best grounds in the WORLD after Caley held off a storming Ayr fightback. Inverness were three up and on easy street after a crazy opening  minutes which saw United gt-wrap the game. But a Lawrence Shankland inspired comeback almost grabbed a share of the spoils for Ian McCalls title contenders. A relieved Robertson said: Had it finished - you wouldnt have been surprised. Somerset Park is one of these grounds that sucks you inyou give them a snf. Its a good throwback and their fans make it intimidating and a good atmosphere for teams when you lose a goal. Its brilliant...one of the best grounds in the world to come and play your football. In the past we might have lost a game like this so Im delighted.  Ayr knew a win here would take them top of the Championship and started well with Robbie Crawford missing a good chance in the first minute. But they soon hit the self destruct button as their defence went AWOL to allow Nathan Austin in for a double before Liam Polworth rammed home a third. The game looked over with barely  minutes on the clock and shellshocked Ayr took time to regroup. Coventry-bound Michael Rose rocked the post with a header before Michael Moffat drew a fingertip save from Cammy Mackay. McCall turned to the bench at half time and introduced top gun Shankland who immediately turned the tide. He set up Declan McDaid to haul Ayr back into the contest with a close range finish eight minutes after the restart. And a resurgent Ayr thought they had a penalty when Carl Tremarco appeared to handle in the box but ref Nick Walsh waved away loud protests. United continued to pour forward as the clock ticked down and Shankland set up a grandstand finish when slamming home a  yard free kick with five minutes left.  But their comeback proved too little too late as Inverness clung on. Ayr boss McCall said: Im just gutted. Weve conceded three goals and at least two of them were gted with just crazy defending. And were the team with the best defensive record in the league. I think a draw would’ve been fair but it’s just one of those nights.

She said: “I wondered what it was. “I could hear the doorbell and by this time the smoke alarm kicked in. “Luckily I woke and came down the stairs and there was my hero at the door. “Buthe hadn’t of been here I would’ve been a goner with the smoke alone. “Even now, anything you touch you’re covered in black soot. “I was in a state of shock. “The table caught fire and the windowsill. “I had to go to the doctor two or three days later because I kept wheezing.” Daughter Lesley Watson, , added: “It could’ve been so much worse –Lewis just caught it in time. “If that young man hadn’t been passing, she wouldn’t be here today.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13938225.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_JS165962684.jpg","title":"driver who sped 70mph through","story":"NewsDriver who sped at mph through streets of Troon is jailed for  monthsMark Kirkby almost killed his passenger when he finally crashed into a wall following the high speed chase.ShareByAyrshire Post:,  FEB NewsMark Kirkby was jailed for the reckless driving\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA man who drove like a maniac through the streets of Troon has been jailed for  months, writes Edwin Lawrence. Mark Kirkby, , almost killed passenger Kerrie Anne Monaghan when he finally crashed into a wall. Miss Monaghan was in Ayr Sherf Court on crutches to hear the sentence on her partner, who she is standing by. The court heard Kirkby did not even have a driving licence and Sherf John Montgomery banned him from holding one for four years. Depute fiscal Lindsay Bain told the court police spotted a silver Volvo being driven erratically from Barassie Street into Portland Street. The police car’s blue lights went on and Kirkby initially slowed down before increasing speed. He was hitting mph in Templehill before heading into Harbour Road. And Kirkby’s car was said to have taken off as he drove across a mini roundabout into Port Ranald Drive. He hit mph in North Shore Road, eventually crashing into a wall at the Beach Road Kilmarnock Road junction in Barassie. During the whole episode, which began around .am on October  last year, Kirkby drove dangerously through junctions and swerved round corners.  When the crash occurred the car’s airbags were deployed but this did not prevent Ms Monaghan’s horric injuries. She had to be cut out of the car by firefighters and suffered numerous fractures to her face, head, body and limbs. “Kerrie Anne Monaghan is very lucky to be alive,” said fiscal Ms Bain. The court also heard of offences committed by Kirkbywhose address was given as Barlinnie Prison, on June . This time he was in a grey Ford Mondeo around .am when police spotted the car stationary on the A near the Pennyburn Roundabout. Kirkby was unsteady on his feet and slurring his speech, although a breath test proved negative. A a blood test found substances identied as cocaine and benzocaine. Defence lawyer Hugh Duncan said Kirkby’s relationship with Ms Monaghan was still ongoing. “He accepts full responsibility,” said the lawyer. “He comes across as remorseful to the injuries his partner suffered and to potential harm he could have done to others.” Mr Duncan said Kirkby had been remanded in custody since October , had undergone a detox programme, and had come to a realisation of his mental health issues. Sherf John Montgomery told Kirkby: “You drove dangerously at high speed for an extended period. I see no option but a custodial sentence.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnHMP BarlinnieVolvoAyrCourtsJusticeTroon"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13927335.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_JS122635663.jpg","title":"exclusive uk government announce 100","story":"NewsEXCLUSIVE: UK Government to announce £ million for Ayrshire Growth DealThe long awaited Growth Deal will be rubber stamped tomorrowwith the regions economy set to receive a \"massive boost\".Share with the regions economy set to receive a massive boost.\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _JS.jpg\" data-tracking\"facebook|share|\" with the regions economy set to receive a massive boost.\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _JS.jpg\" data-tracking\"messenger|share|\" with the regions economy set to receive a massive boost.\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _JS.jpg\" data-tracking\"twitter|share|\" with the regions economy set to receive a massive boost.\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _JS.jpg\" data-tracking\"whatsapp|share|\" with the regions economy set to receive a massive boost.\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _JS.jpg\" data-tracking\"linkedin|share|\" with the regions economy set to receive a massive boost.\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _JS.jpg\" data-tracking\"flipboard|share|\" with the regions economy set to receive a massive boost.\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _JS.jpg\" data-tracking\"email|share|\"ByStephen Houston:,  JAN NewsSecretary of State for Scotland David Mundell will announce the investment \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe UK Government is handing over pound million to try and make Ayrshire great for employment again.

A senior source said: “The UK Government’s contribution to the Ayrshire Growth Deal will be in the region of pound million. “It’s clear from the growth deal process that a lot of very exciting projects have been put forward. We are confident the deal can deliver a massive boost to the local economy.” The Ayrshire Growth Deal will provide signicant investment in the key sectors of aerospace and space at Prestwick, le sciences, manufacturing and tourism. It has been talked about for years as a poundm fund but the Scottish Government and three Ayrshire councils have all failed to reveal their financial input. The aim is to make key investments that will grow the economy and lead to , new jobs.  To do that the poundm public sector finance will have to trigger poundbillion of private investment. It is widely accepted Ayrshire has missed out on big investment deals as it has three councils scrapping for superiority, rather than a single strategic voice. Growth money is expected to be spent on luring a medicines manufacturing innovation centre, developing brownfield sites for industry, improving the Bellfield Interchange, upgrading digital infrastructure and free port status at Prestwick , the Port of Ayr and Falkland Rail Yard in Ayr and a renewable energy hub in Cumnock. It is expected the signing of heads of terms - the stage when all the ious partners get together and announce which projects will receive funding - will be reached within several months. All seven of Scotland’s cities are now covered by the deals and Ayrshire is in the first wave of regions. The poundm for Ayrshire takes total UK Government commitment to pound. billion across Scotland.

Danielle Smith, , used a metal pole to shatter windows of a home on Ness Glen Road, Dalmellington on November , . But she didn’t act alone as Smith was spotted alongside a male when the pair terried their targets inside. Ayr Sherf Court heard he appeared to be carrying a black air rle. But Smith, of Castle Croft, Dalmellington, admitted shoving the barrel of the rle into the home. And the victims inside cowered in fear as they could hear Smith shouting “Get out here, get our here.” CCTV footage captured the pair on their threatening violent spree. Almost every window in the home had been smashed and holes in the windows were consistent with shots of the rle. Blood smears were spotted on the living room window. Police were called and discovered the metal pole used by Smith the following morning. A search warrant in Smith’s home uncovered pellets for an air rle in a box within her bedroom. But she told officers that the other person had been carrying the gun and she had never seen the gun before. She also stated that she threw the metal pole away as she believed the other person would have used it. Solicitor Steven Maxwell told the court he had viewed the footage. The lawyer commented: “It’s quite clear that she was quite literally in his stead and following him. “She cannot provide the court any reasonable explanation of how she managed to get herself in this situation but she was using and abusing drink and illegal substances. “At the time she would have followed this man where-ever he went. “If you fly with the crows, you get shot with them.

However, it has a narrow focus in terms of local taxation.ldquoGiven the consultation only concluded last Friday, it is surprising that the Scottish Government were able to announce the tourist tax today.The new deal with the Scottish Greens includes an extra poundm for the core local government settlement, a move to three-year local authority budgets and legislation that will give councils control over tourism taxes.The deal also includes raising the council tax cap, meaning local authorities will now be able to increase council tax by .%, up from %.Fellow Tweeddale East councillor Stuart Bell, also leader of the councilrsquos Scottish national party opposition group , said: ldquoSignicant announcements have been made on a phased development of alternatives to the council tax. ldquoAlthough I donrsquot advocate that locally we should immediately take advantage of the proposal to give local authorities power to introduce a tourist tax, or the suggested workplace parking levy, these are adjustments that some Scottish city authorities will want to take up after the necessary legislation is approved.ldquoI am also pleased that talks on meaningful alternatives to council tax will restart and that with a three-year funding settlement, as opposed to the current one-year deals, there will be more clarity for local authorities on future funding.ldquoThere are also small changes in the - revenue grants for local authorities.

It was a cold day but my friend, who is skilled in bushcraft, had brought his portable fire pit with him.We searched for drtwood and sat by the fire, roasting marshmallows and warming our hands. It was a short walk but dramatic rock formations loomed above us, making it feel like a real adventure. The kids climbed them and explored the rocky beach, where once there had been an open-air bathing pool.On our , we went through a small tunnel-like arch. I stopped for a moment, suddenly taken by the view. The ruins of Dunbar Castle were beautully framed by the archway. Locals call this archway the keyhole and I reflected that the term is a perfect name.When we look through a keyhole, our vision is narrowly focussed. Such was the effect here. It cast a visual spotlight on what is left of what was once a mighty fortress.The kids trundled on before me, noticing smaller wonders: a frozen worm on the path, a sea shell and interesting-looking stones. But I stood for some moments, taking in the view beyond and thinking of what stories those old stones of the castle could tell.Many people pass this way every day, both locals and visitors. Itrsquos a section of the John Muir Way. I have often been with my family to Dunbar Leisure Pool and the harbour and town. But somehow I had missed this short but spectacular nearby walk until this day.Dunbar Castle is now but a fallen-down ruin. Indeed, itrsquos dficult to imagine what it once was. But the weathered sandstone castles on the shoreline built by nature still stand defiant, somehow reminding us of their greater permanence in the face of human transience. But as I stood looking at the ruins, the keyhole focussed my thoughts as well as my vision.History is also viewed through a keyhole, a very narrow one. The lives and events of the castle were lived in most part unrecorded by it. The spotlight of history has illuminated only brief moments, and even then the characters have been only those deemed lsquoimportantrsquo.There are moments where the view through the narrow keyhole of history has included insights to untold stories. The bravery of Black Agnes, as she defied the siege in , is one of those. With her husband away, she was in charge of this important fortress during war with England. She refused to give up the castle, even in the face of bombardment and attempts to starve her small garrison into submission. Her mocking of her besiegers by dusting down the battlements with her maids after a bombardment is an image seared in legend.But itrsquos a chink of light on a huge untold story we are led to believe by historyrsquos silence that women were insignicant players in events. For sure they were oppressed and put down by a system that centred on male power, but they are half of humanity and at least half the story.As the actions of Black Agnes reveal, even with such constraints put on them, women were there, part of events and often refusing to accept their assigned role.The le of Mary Queen of Scots has always been for me an example of this. Yes, she was privileged and powerful by birth, but because of this history took notice of her.Despite all the political and religious challenges she faced, it was her womanhood which men deemed her main failing. And so she was judged by dferent standards. Had she behaved with the morals of her father she would not have lasted five minutes in power. But no one raised an eyebrow because he was a man.But more than this, even though Mary was the monarch, her royal authority was deemed diluted and even less legitimate merely because she was a woman.So she understood she needed to find a husband to bring her royal authority to full strength in a country full of powerful and bullying misogynist men.She chose the dashing young Darnley, and the fact that he turned out to be dross was not, in my opinion, Maryrsquos fault. How easy it is to blame a woman for a manrsquos failings. She was taken in by him it was he who was the failure, not her.Thatrsquos what Irsquove always maintained, despite the protestations of my tutors at university. And her third husband Bothwell, well he was a disappointment as well.It is the stones of Dunbar,they could speak, who could tell us of the truth of his forced union with Mary. She had been taken there by him in April . The circumstances of this still remain debated. Was she abducted by him as later claimed, or did she go willingly It was also claimed she was raped and forced to marry Bothwell soon afterwards to save her honour . This idea has been disputed by some because Mary is said to have miscarried with twins while imprisoned at Lochleven Castle some months after, suggesting a relationship with Bothwell even before Darnleyrsquos murder. So a woman cannot be abused by a man she has had a relationship with  Really If they could talk, the stones of Dunbar would whisper the truths of those events in , and the despair and desperation of a strong and clever woman whose destiny was stolen mainly because of her sex.These were my thoughts as I stood looking through the keyhole towards Dunbar Castle.

I still have many of the books I bought with pocket money when I was young, carried through le like a lucky charm. TS Eliotrsquos Prufrock may have measured out his le with coffee spoons I have measured out mine with Puffins and King Penguins, Peregrines and Pelicans. If pressed, I could tell where I found each one.Like radio, the demise of the book has been often foretold. Books, we were unreliably informed, were yesterdayrsquos technology, so th century, so redundant in a digital age. I well recall the gleeful obituaries. The internet would sweep them away with tsunami-like ferocity. Kindles, apparently, were the future, and even I owned one once. Who knows where it lies unloved now. And who cares Similar prophesies of doom were made about bookshops, for what need was there for themno one wanted books  And for a while things did look a bit glum. With the demise of the Net Book Agreement, which determined that books must be sold at their cover price, many privately-owned bookshops found they couldnrsquot compete with the discounts offered by supermarkets and chain stores. Inevitably, sadly, some went to the wall or sold out to more voracious competitors.Of late, however, in what has been the bleakest of midwinters for the high street, there are signs that reports of the death of the bookshop were premature. In the last couple of weeks, I have heard of two new bookshops opening in Edinburgh. And last Saturday evening, I attended a mini book festival in Linlithgow, organised by the local independent, Far From the Madding Crowd, which was very well-attended, a testimony to the loyalty and warmth the shop engenders.The best bookshops are like that. When one of them is threatened it is a cause for mourning and resentment and the raising of petitions. For me, a town without a bookshop is unworthy of the name, a place where civilisation is yet to reach, where culture must surely fail to thrive. I have been in such outposts and nothing would drag me back.Where there is at least one bookshop there is hope. A year ago, I visited Christchurch in New Zealand, which is still struggling to recover from the devastating earthquakes of  and . The centre of the city was preternaturally quiet and the shopping mall was bereft of customers. But the one shop that was buzzing was Scorpio Books, also independently owned, which against all odds had managed to resurrect itself. Would the same, brave decision have been made by the fund managers who control chain stores  Perhaps. Then again, perhaps not.One of the new Edinburgh shops will be Toppingrsquos, which has a wonderful branch in St Andrews. The companyrsquos founder is Robert Topping, formerly of Waterstonersquos in Manchester, which he left after being told to limit the size of the stock. The story is told in a new memoir by Glasgow-born Sir Tim Waterstone, of whom I was briefly an employee ndash the least said about which the better. ldquoThe Waterstonersquos model, recalls Sir Tim, ldquowas simply this: the highest class of heavily stocked literary bookselling run on a national scale by an unusually enthusiastic and highly knowledgeable young staff.Waterstonersquos was born in  when the book trade was in dire of need of modernisation. Complacent, rival shops kept short hours and unsatisfying stock, and their staff were more inclined to turn custom away than welcome it. Waterstonersquos ndash which was in the vanguard of Sunday opening ndash initiated a bookselling revolution and played an intrinsic role in making the literary novel cool. In the store in which I worked, on any given night you might catch a reading by Gore Vidal, Richard Ford, Raymond Carver or Edna OrsquoBrien. It was like a club of which anyone could become a member.Scratch any writer and they will regale you with tales of their favourite bookshops. I have one ndash Main Street Trading in St Boswells ndash a handful of miles from where I live in the Borders. Some prefer charity shops, others, such as my biblioholic husband, emporia like the Strand in New York with its eight miles of books.

But it is the EU which said at the beginning that nothing is agreed until everything is agreed, and who voiced approval when Parliament insisted on having its say in the deal. Bearing that in mind, the fact is that the shape of a possible deal on an orderly ndash as opposed to a ldquono deal ndash exit, is very slightly clearer.Or, at least, there is a clear mandate from the Commons for what they donrsquot want: they donrsquot want to remain, they donrsquot want to extend Article  , they donrsquot want a second referendum, they donrsquot want ldquono deal, but they may be prepared to vote for Mrs Mayrsquos dealshe can secure changes to the Irish backstop.A lot of sceptics describe this set of priorities as a unicorn, meaning no such thing can exist in reality. That, I think, is to mistake what reality is. Reality includes a lot of things, including unicorns, which people imagined and then wrote down. Treaties and trade agreements ndash though this is, letrsquos not forget, not a deal about our future relationship with the EU, merely about how we leave ndash are not fixed natural features of the landscape, theyrsquore things people invent and bring into being. If it comes to that, even physical features like national borders are articially created.Those who imagined that a second vote, or simply remaining, could happen should now concede that the parliamentary arithmetic makes that a more fancul idea than some amended version of the withdrawal agreement going through. The prospect of some sane Norwegian or Swiss-style Brexit, unfortunately for those of us who hoped for that, also looks much less likely now.The same is not true of the vote disapproving of no deal in principle, however, and not just because it was advisory, and has no legal force. Itrsquos theoretically possible that ndashno adjustments are forthcoming on the backstop ndash Parliament will try to vote to call the whole thing off, or at least to delay. But given the dficulty of finding any mechanism to avoid no deal so far, itrsquos hard to see how, especially given that there are enough MPs ndash including Labour rebels, judging by the majority this week ndash who think that the political fallout of not leaving will be even worse than any disruption a no-deal Brexit might bring.Parliament, whatever inidual MPs may want or think, is clearly not prepared to imagine a hard border in Ireland. Buttheyrsquore insisting there shouldnrsquot be one, it should make it obvious that the only group arguing for this horrible prospect are the EU.The strangest aspect of the argument over the border is how seldom anyone points out that it already exists, with restrictions on goods and dferences in taxation on either side, and that there was free movement of people across it long before either Ireland or the UK joined the EU. If it becomes a more dficult border in future, it will be for one reason only: the preservation of the EUrsquos single market. Thatrsquos also, by the way, an indication that the single market is not some idealistic free trade area, but a protectionist tarf arrangement for the benefit of EU member states.The question is which of the two stories told by the Commons votes the EU chooses to listen to. One is that there is, potentially, a Commons majority for the withdrawal agreement ndash which, I should point out, is a truly terrible deal for all sorts of reasons which have nothing to do with the backstop, and probably worse than either staying in the EU or leaving without any exit deal ndash but onlythey will drop their claims to enforce and police a section of the UK indefinitely. The other message is that therersquos a narrow majority against no deal at all.That second declaration doesnrsquot strengthen the EUrsquos position in resisting any changes in what has so far been put down as much as it might like, however. There was a much bigger majority against the Cooper amendment that is, against any delay in leaving. The story could, judging by its improbable twists and turns so far, go in almost any direction now, not many of them involving a happy ending. But the only one that avoids no deal and ends this sorry chapter is rewriting the current withdrawal agreement.Read more: No  knocks back Hunts signal of possible delay to Brexit"},{"url":null,"title":"saving-the-wildcat-now-only-a-whisker-away-from-extinction","story":"But numbers have been virtually decimated because of persecution, habit fragmentation and interbreeding, leaving fewer than  remaining in the wild.Now an animal conservation charity wants to build a national wildle reintroductions centre in Scotlandrsquos largest national park in a bid to save the endangered Scottish wildcat ldquofrom the brink of extinction.The Royal Zoological Society of Scotlandwants to build the centre on land in the Cairngorms National Park as ldquoa matter of urgency for the elusive native species.Plans include a state-of-the-art breeding facility, with wildcat experts and a dedicated veterinary unit to bolster the diminishing population of the so-called Highland tiger.The RZSS says the cats would go through a ldquorigorous training regime before being released into the Scottish Highlands. The centre could also help save other threatened species, such as insects and birds.The charity, which already looks after wildcats at its existing Highland Wildle Park in the Cairngorms National Park, has now launched an appeal for donations from the public to help turn the plans in to reality.A charity spokeswoman said: ldquoMost of us yearn to catch a glimpse of the glorious Scottish wildcat, yet never do. If we donrsquot act immediately, we never will.ldquoThe wildcat is teetering on the edge. Though revered, wildcats in Scotland have been persecuted for centuries. Add to that habitat fragmentation, and interbreeding with domestic cats, and it is doubtful that their numbers in the wild now reach three figures.ldquoThe wildcatrsquos survival now hangs tenuously on a dramatic plan to create a National Wildle Reintroductions Centre, in the Cairngorms National Park.ldquoThis state-of-the-art breeding facility will bring together wildcat experts, a dedicated veterinary unit, and a specialised pre-release training programme, focusing initially on wildcats, yet with the flexibility to help other priority species in the future.The mammal is the only wild member of the cat family to survive in Britain. Although they were once found throughout mainland Britain, they have only managed to survive in Scotland. They are the same subspecies of wildcat found in continental Europe, but has been separate since the end of the last ice age around , years ago.Besides hybridisation, other threats to the population include historical and accidental persecution, disease and collisions with vehicles on roads.Although it bears a striking relationship to the tabby cat with regard to its markings, the wildcat can be recognized by its distinctive bushy tail which features black rings, a thick blunt tip, and no stripe down the middle. It also never has white feet.A breeding programme, which is co-ordinated by Scottish Wildcat Action, has been working to restore viable populations of the mammal. The last wildcat to be born in captivity was born at Chester Zoo in August. RZSS is one of multiple partners in the programme.As part of RZSSrsquos appeal, Scottish wildle filmmaker Gordon Buchanan narrated a video where he described the wildcat as ldquoBritainrsquos most threatened mammal... a totemic creature that is equally revered in Scottish culture as it is a precious part of our fauna.Mr Buchanan said: ldquoAs a matter of urgency, ambitious plans are under way to build a national wildle reintroduction centre in the Cairngorms National Park. The Royal Zoological Society of Scotland will run this state-of-the-art facility.ldquoIt will provide the perfect environment for breeding wildcats with the aim of releasing them to re-establish viable populations in key locations.ldquoThe Royal Zoological Society and their partners will use the innovative centre with its expert veterinary provision long in to the future.ldquoOver time, this could help to save other threatened mammals, birds and insects.Appealing for donations, Mr Buchanan added: ldquoScotlandrsquos wildcats are but a whisker away from extinction. Current estimates suggest there could be less than  remaining in the wild.ldquoIf we do not take immediate action, it will be too late. If we donrsquot, the fierce green fire in the eyes of the Highland tiger will be extinguished forever.To donate, visit the RZSS website."},{"url":null,"title":"buddy-bench-scheme-helping-pupils-make-playground-friends","story":"The Buddy Benches scheme encourages youngsters to be kind to their primary-age peers who want someone to play with.Lyne Souter, parent council member, at Warddykes Primary, Arbroath, Angus said: ldquoIf a child feels lonely, they can go to the bench as a signal that they need someone to play with.More than  pupils came up with designs for the benches in a competition and the winning entries were crafted into real benches by Tom Harris-ward, a local chainsaw craftsman.The parent council raised pound, at a Christmas fair for the benches, which have already been popular in schools in America, Ireland and England.Parent council member Julie Hartley thought the idea would work well in her school and decided to hold a competition for children to make their own designs.The competition attracted more than  entries which were judged by councillor Lois Speed.Mrs Hartley said: ldquoIrsquom excited to see an idea turned into something amazing.ldquoThis is the type of thing the parent council love being involved in and itrsquos so positive for the children with a very important message behind them ndash be kind to others.Ms Speed said she was overwhelmed by the quality of entries for what she described as ldquoa heartwarming project.She added: ldquoI absolutely love this project and all that it stands for.

The only problem for the Tory leader would be trying to hold a fractured party together. Nothing new there. Of course people may have failed to vote for many reasons. Among them being that they did not feel that they had the information to make an informed decision of such magnitude.Personally, I believe that the \"golf club rule\" should apply to a ballot on any major change. A mere voting majority is not enough,so, apathy could rule the day. For any major change, people must actively fall in behind it.

So please, would Members of Parliament please try to remember what they are there for: to represent the best interests of the British people as a whole, not those in Parliament with the loudest voices.Ken Johnson,Alves, West Gates Avenue,Lochwinnoch.DUNCAN McFarlanesuggests that a second referendum would not be undemocratic, but his point that anti-Brexit leaders have tarnished their argument because their motive is for the UK to remain as part of the EU is surely wrong. He seems to be implying that Brexit is a done deal and no one should oppose it. Assuming that democracy means the will of the people, asking them to have their say on such an important decision as this is essential before stepping into the dark.To call this process a second referendum is a misnomer. The question that it would be asking would be confirmation from the electorate that its intentions for the UK to leave the EU are as they were in June . Leave yes no and If yes to Leave do you want Leave with deal no deal. Should Theresa Mays deal be taken off the table and only No Deal remains, it would be a very brave government which leads us down that road without getting confirmation of it from the people it represents.Mr McFarlane suggests that further questions such as a Norway-style deal or just staying in the single market could be added to the ballot paper. This would only serve to muddy the waters as neither is currently on the table. A confirmation of a decision such as this will only work by asking simple yes no questions that are not open to interpretation.Bill Hendry, Blackwood Road, Milngavie.OUR local MP recently insisted to me that their role is not as delegates, representing sectional interests, but to promote the national interest. His subsequent voting behaviour showed the precise opposite of this, but at least he is right in principle. The appalling self-seeking and tribalism that is evidenced by recent events in Westminster show how far Parliament has abandoned the tenets of Parliamentary democracy.It is now self-evident that there will be only two classes of beneficiaries from whatever form of Brexit occurs. The first will be the cadre of billionaire capitalists, desperate to avoid any controls from Brussels on their tax evasion, dubious financial dealings and exploitation of their workers. The other is the racists and xenophobes who, fed a diet of lies and half-truths by elements of the press, believe that anyone of a dferent skin colour or culture should be prevented from entering this hallowed isle, orthey live here, be sent away. For the rest of us, there is a future of economic problems, reduced opportunities and a retreat from liberal ideals hard won over decades.Yet MPs shamefully continue to hide behind claims about ldquothe will of the people to promote the interests of those two minorities, and to make use of the first-past-the-post election system to keep their place on the gravy train.

Setting engine standards to reduce particulate matter and nitrogen oxide, the greatest proportion of which come from diesel cars, will have a positive impact.It is only part of the solution to the air quality and congestion challenge facing cities and major towns across Scotland. Journeys donrsquot generally begin and end within a city centre or LEZ. There has been a trend over many years of commuting to work from suburbs or further afield to reduce the burden of mortgage payments, so itrsquos critical we also look at policy interventions that can help deliver more sustainable end-to-end journeys.Urban motorways were once hailed as the future but the extra road space has simply encouraged greater traffic and resulted in gridlock at peak times. Manchesterrsquos M and the Inner Ring Road around Birmingham have become synonymous with daily tailbacks and wasted hours behind the wheel.Glasgowrsquos urban network, including the heavily used M, M and M, has similar challenges. The solution is switching journeys from car to mass transit solutions and better use can be made of the existing road space on the Glasgow urban motorway network.One option is to allow buses and coaches to access the hard shoulder.Bus and coach priority measures such as this have real potential to benefit the thousands of passengers travelling into Glasgow on services operated by multiple operators, including Scottish Citylink, National Express, Stagecoach, First, McGills, Parks of Hamilton and Stuarts Coaches.Motorway priority measures have already proven safe and successful on the M connecting Fe and Edinburgh.Buses and coaches are permitted to use the hard shoulder, with the safeguard of a speed limit, from Halbeath to Ferrytoll. They then continue across the Forth Road Bridge, now a dedicated public transport route, on to the A with queue relocation measures from Dalmeny to Cramond Brig. Stagecoach Fe to Edinburgh services which benefit from these measures have seen passenger numbers increase by % year on year.Many bus and coach services using the M and M could be protected from bottlenecks at motorway junctions by being given sole access to the existing outside lanes, with the hard shoulder becoming a running lane for general traffic.These would then naturally become the lanes buses and coaches use to leave the motorway at the Kingston Bridge or to access Cathedral Street to get to Buchanan Bus Station. This could equally be made to work on the M, one of the busiest motorways in Europe.Such initiatives will not reduce the road space available to general traffic but will encourage modal sht. The vast majority of Stagecoach buses accessing Glasgow city centre are Euro VI standard, and along with high interior quality this gives passengers the optimum journey experience, only let down by the signicant iability of journey time caused by congestion on the motorway network.All of these strategic transport links are critical to connectivity for our communities and growth in our economy. If we are serious about these objectives, itrsquos time for bold thinking to prioritise buses and coaches on our urban motorway network, not just in our city centres.Robert Andrew is Chair, Confederation of Passenger Transport ScotlandFor more information please visitwww.cpt-uk.orgThe Heraldrsquos Climate for Change initiative supports efforts being made by the ScottishGovernmentwith key organisations and campaign partners.

A lower rate of economic growth will further eat away at cash for the NHS and education.ldquoRather than stomp their feet, the SNP should face the facts: breaking up is hard to do, he added."},{"url":null,"title":"onshore-wind-energy-jobs-down-a-third-in-scotland","story":"The Office for National Statisticsstatistics show employment in onshore wind fell by , jobs from , in  to , in

collected once every three weeks in new council strategy","story":"Aberdeenshire residents will be encouraged to become recycling champions with the introduction of a controversial three-weekly collection programme.The revised waste strategy for all , properties in the Shire was approved in a - vote by the council’s Infrastructure Services Committee despite an alternative option from Peterhead SNP councillor Stephen Smith who said it was “too much, too soon”.From April next year, households will have weekly kerbside collections for one of three bins including a  litre bin for paper and card and  litre bin for metals, plastics and cartons.However under the new scheme, the existing general residual bin for non-recyclable waste will be signicantly reduced to a  litre capacity.Councillors were told by waste director Philip McKay that while it was a considerable reduction, the service felt it “should be manageable for most households”.He added that while a three-weekly non-recyclable waste collection might feel a bit daunting to residents initially – as did the move from weekly to fortnightly collections in Aberdeenshire a few years ago – experience from other Scottish local authorities showed that it is workable and can lead to a signicant increase in recycling rates.Mr McKay also stressed that given the larger recycling capacity provided in the favoured option, it provided “more flexibility in the future” for the addition of other recyclable materials without the need for additional recycling containers.Councillors were told that the scheme had the potential to save waste services £, per year at the lower end of the scale and even morethere was a higher uptake in recycling.However, Peterhead councillor Stephen Smith said the proposals as they stood were a step too far for North-east communities.In a bid to address concerns about the potential impact of any necessary changes to the waste strategy, he proposed that instead of using a -litre bin for three weekly collections, Aberdeenshire Council instead do what has happened in much of the rest of Scotland and keep the  litre bin for three weekly waste collections, with new  litre bins – which are expected to be funded in large part by ‘Zero Waste Scotland’ – being used for paper and card recycling for a transitional period.Councillor Smith’s proposal – which he claimed would have saved an estimated £, annually – followed confirmation from council officers that such a proposal would be compatible with Zero Waste Scotland’s requirements for helping to fund the cost of the new bins required.But council depute leader Peter Argyle warned against “changing horses” halfway through the programme as it would only lead to confusion.He told the committee that with an imminent landfill ban on biodegradable waste “coming down the tracks” by , it was “unacceptablewe don’t recycle” and questioned how people would be encouraged to recycle morethey continued to have the larger residual waste bin.data-src\"https:res. jpress image fetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.fraserburghherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\"

It was windy that night too and a lot of people who fly drones have told me it wouldrsquove been too windy that night to fly one.Keith Banks, an amateur meteorologist who writes a monthly weather column for the John OrsquoGroat Journal, says mphgusts were blowing during the period the UFO was witnessed.ldquoIn my view the very blustery conditions would have effectively precluded a drone from flying, he said.Dedicated drone flyers agree, including Barry Scollay from Wick who says he has been flying the unmanned aerial vehicles for a decade.ldquoNo way a drone would have flown in those winds ndash thatrsquos a certain fact, said Mr Scollay, who has a Facebook page called Highland Aerial Views which has over , followersldquoIt would have to have been able to maintain its location in high winds. Irsquove flown very large drones in mph wind but that was the limit, he says.ldquoYou can [even] hear the wind howling in his video.Whatrsquos more, he says that software in operation at the nearby Wick airport would not allow such a drone to take off.Small hobby drones ldquocanrsquot fly within the airportrsquos no-fly zone.Charlie reckons the UFO was about ft above his head, larger than a car and made no sound.Although he took photos and video on his smartphone he admits that the quality was not the best.ldquoIt was like seeing a car at the bottom of your street, it was that clear. Itrsquos just not as clear with the phone.The object disappeared not long after a police van appeared at around am.ldquoI couldnrsquot get to sleep and kept going to the window and the door to see it but it was gone, he says.Since posting the video online he has had numerous calls from self-professed ldquoUFO investigators.Therersquos been so many of them, he says hersquos now ldquovery waryof callers who ask ldquotoo many questions.ldquoItrsquos like being interviewed by the FBI, he said. ldquoVery weird and over the top with the secrecy.Since his sighting, an organisation called the British Earth and Aerial Mysteries Societyhas said it believes he saw an ldquointerdimensional plasma craft.The craft have also been suggested as a cause for recent disruptions at Gatwick and Heathrow airports.A spokesperson for Wick John OrsquoGroats Airport confirmed that it was closed during the period the object was sighted, and there are also no reports of the emergency services operating in the air at that time.Charliersquos video can be seen at https:youtu.be xdHBiqtkWhat do you think he saw  Email d.scott@nosnwith your suggestions.Friday  Feb  : PM"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04094000/04094553.jpg","title":"Plans to tackle Wick town centre parking hailed as very good news","story":"Local Highland councillor Andrew Sinclair said he welcomed the proposals outlined in a traffic order as they give the local authority greater powers to deal with what has been a contentious issue for many years.Many other areas of Wick would also be subject to restrictions.Councillor Sinclair, who represents the Wick and East Caithness ward, said: \"I think this is very good news for the town. We have been calling for more parking enforcement in Wick for a while now.\"High Street and Bridge Street are far too regularly packed with cars parked where they shouldnt be. Its an issue that has been raised time and time again by both drivers and pedestrians. Some people think they are above the rules and for too long theyve got away with it.\"He added: \"Under the current proposals Bridge Street and much of High Street will essentially become double yellows, meaning no parking at any time. This should also help stop the constant issue of people selfishly parking in areas like the Market Square.\"The parking bays there are intended only for those who are disabled badge holders but these rules are often ignored by people who just canrsquot be bothered walking.\"Councillor Sinclair said the order would give council officers the power to enforce parking restrictions once they receive the required training but, initially, existing enforcement staff would carry out the work.\"We should expect a much more regular presence than under the old system,\" he said. \"The discussions Irsquove had with the officer responsible for parking have been extremely encouraging.\"Having an enforcement officer in the town for regular and random visits is a great start butthe situation doesnrsquot improve we will still be pushing to get someone in this post locally to clamp down on rogue drivers.\"He explained that in Inverness several council employees have been trained to undertake parking enforcement duties as well as their day-to-day jobs. \"There is no reason why the same couldnrsquot be done up here. If these orders get the go-ahead, and I am confident they will, then I hope we will begin to see a dference in peoples behaviour.\"The Caithness civic leader, Councillor Willie Mackay, also backed the plan. \"It is a fantastic idea but it is the enforcement that is the key to the success of this,\" he said. \"If we can get enough staff trained up to act as traffic wardens ndash and I am pretty sure we can ndash then their presence will deter bad parking.\"Parking in the centre of Wick has been a contentious problem for some time and has often been raised by the local community council and others.

In addition, D photogrammetry is taking place so that digital D models of the wreck can be produced. By using these techniques, in essence, the team is able to digitally bring HMS Royal Oak to the surface.Survey organiser and licence-holder Emily Turton said: “The wreck of HMS Royal Oak is the final resting place of  men and boys. As the most intact underwater dreadnought-era battleship, she has an architectural grandeur befitting of any national memorial.

We are also very aware there needs to be some internal structural alterations.Given the urgency, the board is using its capital reserves to order the new air handling unit which is should be installed in March.ldquoIf the equipment breaks down between now and then, the pool will have to close, Mrs Manson said. ldquoSome people attend the pool on a weekly basis and that is what keeps them going. If it has to close for a number of weeks, it can make a real dference to their mobility and pain control.Retired GP Helen Charley, board chairman, said:ldquoHaving been a GP in Cromarty for  years, and having needed both hips and knees replaced, I am all too aware of how vital the Puffin Pool is to the good health and wellbeing of so many patients like me, she said.Established in  by Dr Malcolm Stevens, the pool has provided an average , sessions each year over the past four years. They are supervised by qualied supervisors and leguards.The majority of income is from its charity shop In Tulloch Street and the fees which are kept affordable for those on benefits, pensions and low incomes although these have increased by  per cent.Supporters are rallying to support the appeal and staff plan a -mile sponsored walk from Tain to Dingwall.To donate, see www.puffinpool or pop in to the pool or shop.Friday  Feb  : PMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The success of the Dingwall BID depends upon our local businessesrsquo support.ldquoWe are working hard to gather information from all the businesses in Dingwall and we need to hear from everyone. This is your chance to have your say and add to the overall business plan. Then all you have to do is vote yes in the ballot and we can make these projects happen.ldquoWe really want to make sure that nobody is missed and that everyone gets their opportunity to vote because this could be a monumental time in our townrsquos history. This could become the year when Dingwall businesses take control over the townrsquos economic future.Mr Murray said: ldquoWe are aware that there must be a decenton their investment. I believe Highland Council currently collect a wee bit more than pound million per annum from non-domestic ratepayers and Irsquove calculated that the levy would need to be between . to three per cent.ldquoThis would allow us to invoice the council for approximately pound,. Itrsquos also possible we would be able to almost match fund this figure from other sources. This would be an amazing amount banked in Dingwall to be spent on Dingwall. This is how we would fund the five-year plan ready to start after a yes vote.He wants remaining surveys, seeking feedback from businesses to a number of questions, ed by Friday, February .Survey results will then be collated with a five-year business plan set to be drafted by the end of March. A yes no vote on BID would then be held in May.Gordon McIntosh, practice manager of Munro  Noble, is a director of BID Inverness and believes the scheme can pay idends for Dingwall too.He said ldquocoach ambassadors had brought more tourists into the city, increasing spend. It meant local businesses were stakeholders in any centre development plans and have the ability to lobby the council over issues of interest. The scheme also paved the way for successful events such as classic car shows, Easter egg hunts and bar and business awards.He said: ldquoWith representatives from a cross section of businesses on the board the strong advocacy we have provided has achieved some notable results. These results have been for the betterment of our business and social community.

We have worked with local volunteers, school groups, young offenders, dementia groups, local walking groups and adult learners.In tune with the sustainable development ethos of the group, logs for Mags Wood build have been sourced locally and dragged to the site by Tarzan, a French-bred horse trained for forestry operations ndash and something of a visitor attraction in himself, hugely popular with the school groups who visit the site from time to time.The building project has been able to call on the expertise of local log building expert Henry Fosbrooke, project co-ordinator David Smith and a local volunteer, Don Fraser, who previously worked on the new Queensferry next to the Forth Road Bridge.Mr Harry said that such expertise ldquohas meant that all the measurements done are near perfect.The project has been funded by the Forestry Commission through a community grant amongst ious other sources.Mr Harry said: ldquoThis will be something special for the area and is involving many iniduals and groups in its building ndash truly a community project and something that will last a very, very long time.He is still hoping to find a supplier willing to help with the timber roof cladding required to complete the project, hopefully by the end of March. That would involve around  m x mm larch planks. The alternative will be to process locally sourced timber from the site.Anyone interested in becoming involved or who can help out can contact Simon Harry by email at simon.harry@forest-education or by calling  .Friday  Feb  : PMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

But when I was in Parliament on Tuesday, when MPs voted on a raft of Brexit amendments, it felt like many MPs were living in their very own micro-bubbles – particularly on the Labour side. There are as many Labour positions on Brexit as there are Labour MPs. Those in leave-voting seats have a tough gig. They are trying to listen to their constituents and listen to their gut instincts about what they think is best for the country. Who they are not listening to is their leader.For a man famed for such clarity on many other issues, Jeremy Corbyn has played an elusive game on Brexit. The Labour position is still unclear to many and Labour MPs have decided to do what the Fleetwood Mac song says: “You can go your own way.”Although the Labour leadership eventually supported the key Yvette Cooper amendment to delay Brexit, it was very late in the day and that sent a signal that it was a soft whip. The Labour MPs who defied the whip or abstained and helped a beleaguered Prime Minister secure that vital Brexit win won’t even get put on the naughty step.: Brexit: Ireland warning over ‘threats’ as EU rejects May’s dealLabour loyalists are relaxed about Theresa May’s victory. It’s all still a shambles, they say, which is an absolutely fair point. The Labour plan seems to be don’t block Brexit, let the Tories own the chaos, chillax until the General Election then romp home to victory. Simples!Well, not quite. Many Labour strategists seem to have forgotten that Labour cannot win a majority without winning seats in Scotland. The obsession with Labour votes in the North of England has meant that the rather large, cold place north of that has been somewhat forgotten.A large majority of people in Scotland voted to remain. Many hate austerity and want more radical, socialist economic policies but also think staying in the EU is the best option – angry Corbynistas take note, it is possible to hold those two positions and not be a traitor.Many Labour activists in Scotland have their head in their hands. They are desperately worried that Labour may end up doing a deal with Mrs May, be seen to be colluding with the Tories and being on the wrong side of the Scottish people. And Brexit is coming up the doorstep.: Brexit: Barclays given green light to transfer £bn to IrelandOne activist told me that it’s not the first thing people mention but when they get onto it, they cannot believe what is playing out in London and are following it closely. There is anger on all sides. It has confirmed the belief that the Tories don’t care about Scotland, but there is resentment and confusion about Labour’s position, especially on why it won’t support another referendum.There is, of course, one political winner in Scotland as a result of the mess in Westminster. One Labour voter summed it up: “There’s no leadership in Westminster – but at least Nicola Sturgeon is showing some.” Now this person was notan SNP or independence supporter but they were a strong remainer.Brexit could transcend party allegiances in Scotland. A two-horse race in England may well benefit Labour but in Scotland, they could find themselves once again painfully squeezed between a remain-supporting SNP and a leave-supporting Tory party.

It could see Scotland remain in a “British Union” while also signing to the European single market, according to economist Professor John McLaren. The Brexit chaos has brought home the real impact of breaking up a “closely knit economic union” and the SNP’s recognition of this is likely to resonate in a second independence campaign, a paper by the former Scottish Government adviser today states.: Tories call on SNP to ‘sever links’ with pro-indy bloggerA vote for Scottish independence could result in the same “rainbow” of future arrangements being proposed similar to those on the current “soft and hard Brexit” spectrum.“The idea of true political and economic independence in the modern age is largely an illusion,” the paper states.All official data, including the SNP’s growth Commission, makes it clear that Scotland would start out with a net deficit outside the UK of about £ billionin “fiscal transfers” for public spending it currently receives.: Claim that Brexit saps support for independence“This in turn may make it more likely that an alternative form of independence is proposed which helps ameliorate some of these impacts.”It may mean that an independent Scotland joins a “British Union” similar to the current EU model, but also signs up to the European Economic Areawhich keeps Scotland in the EU single market.Prof McLaren said: “The UK Parliaments Brexit discussions have provided a useful insight into how the next Scottish referendum may pan out.

Publicly, the government has stated that it is focused on getting its spending plans passed and is confident of reaching a compromise.In , when an SNP minority government had its budget defeated by the Scottish Parliament, then-First Minister Alex Salmond threatened a snap election before the deadlock was broken.The current SNP minority has struck a more conciliatory tone and sought to calm speculation about an election, with Finance Secretary Derek Mackay last night appealing for MSPs to “act responsibly”.Last ditch talks are set to continue today in the final hours before a vote, with the Green Party holding out for concessions on local government spending and council tax reform.Mr Mackay must secure the support of the six Green MSPs to pass his budget, with all other opposition parties committed to voting against it.Green Party co-convener Patrick Harvie has dismissed suggestions his party could bring down the government by rejecting the SNP’s budget as a “myth”.But senior Nationalist figures were openly speculating about the possibility of an election earlier in the week, with SNP committee convener Gillian Martin warning Green MSP Andy Wightman on social media that voting down the budget could force an election and put a second Scottish independence referendum at risk.“You’ve seen the way the other parties coalesce against us to try and bring down the government,” Ms Martin posted on Twitter. “Since  everything for them is about defeating the pro-Indy Parliament.”She added: “We are at risk of an election that might see pro Indy parties lose seats and put us in a weaker position.”Polls show the SNP remains in the lead in Scottish Parliament voting intention, but that the nationalists have lost ground compared with their performance in the  Holyrood election where they narrowly lost their majority.Scottish Conservative shadow finance secretary Murdo Fraser claimed uncertainty around the budget showed the SNP were “unfit” for government.“The SNP has neglected the day job so badly that it’s now struggling to get the single-biggest responsibility taken care of. Nicola Sturgeon is so resigned to the weakness of her own administration, she’s been forced to rally the troops for another election.“Hers would be the first government in the history of the Scottish Parliament to call an election because it couldn’t pass a budget.“That would be a shameful legacy, and shows just how unfit the Nationalists are for government of any kind.”Scottish Liberal Democrat campaign chair Alex Cole-Hamilton MSP said: “We’ve made clear to the SNP that we want a budget that focuses on education, mental health and local government funding.“If their inability to get a budget through necessitates a new Scottish Parliament election then I have every hope that people in Scotland will want to use that to eject the Nationalists.”A Labour spokesman said “no credible anti-austerity party would propose” the draft budget put forward by the SNP.With no deal last night, Mr Mackay said: “Our spending plans for the coming year contain additional money for schools and hospitals, protecting vital public services and investing in our economy, while also providing stability amid the ongoing uncertainty caused by Brexit. “With that backdrop in mind, there has never been more need for MSPs, of all parties, to act responsibly and not add to that uncertainty.”Mr Mackay added: “We are open to compromise in order to ensure we deliver the Budget that the country expects.” ©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4862285.1548404780!/image/image.jpg","title":"alex salmond unique case is not unprecedented says advocate","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Many people are asking whether Alex Salmond, with his major public profile, could possibly get a fair trial in Scotlandany charges proceed.Many people are asking whether Alex Salmond, with his major public profile, could possibly get a fair trial in Scotlandany charges proceed.If challenged, the court’s answer will be considered in the context of the publicity around the allegations. To date no case in Scotland has been stopped because of prejudicial publicity and that’s despite there having been some high-profile cases that attracted considerable, sometimes extremely prejudicial, media attention.These cases were dferent in that the accused were not well-known public figures, but it was argued that publicity about the allegations could prejudice any trial.I wouldn’t call this case unprecedented, but it has its own unique aspects. However, the challenges for the court have been considered before. Two examples are the trial of William Beggs for what became known as the “Limbs in the Loch” murder, and that of Nat Fraser, who was accused of killing his we, Arlene. There had been a great deal of reporting about the cases and the courts had to decide whether fair trials could be achieved. In both situations, the courts decided the cases could proceed fairly, referring to the safeguards of the passage of time between any publicity and a trial the focusing effect for a jury of listening to the evidence and the strong directions given to a jury in such cases to decide only based on evidence they hear in court.Those representing Salmond may argue that he is uniquely well-known and that some allegations against him have, to an extent, been canvassed in the media. They may say that it will be almost impossible to find jurors who have never heard of him. But that doesn’t matter – more to the point is whether it will be possible to find jurors that are untainted by prejudicial knowledge about the allegations.The Crown will say Contempt of Court rules apply and no-one can now publish anything that might prejudice the trial. There is now signicant protection in place and the media can only really report on procedural aspects such as the fact he has been charged.Very senior people at the Crown Office will be involved in decisions about possible proceedings once they have seen all statements and reports.

If anything, it should be amplied.It turned into a trilogy. There was a Great Book of Skye Two in , and now we have the #Great Book of Skye Three#.That was perhaps predictable. In the first volume, Cailean Maclean commented that he had two problems in persuading Norman Macdonald to prepare the book. The first problem was to get him to start the second was to get him to stop.Three books and , pages later, the prof has stopped — or so he says.The three volumes comprise a Dictionary of Skye Biography. The lives of almost , people are profiled and illustrated inside their pages. They have all #been Skye born or bred or are people who have had an intimate connection with the island. They have all been noteworthy in one way or another… #There has never been more than , people living in Skye at any one time, and for much of history — particularly recent, recorded history — its population has been much smaller than that.Nobody, however, will be too surprised that Norman and Cailean uncovered and portrayed over a thousand eminent Sgiathanaich. Without wishing to kickstart Norman once again, the miracle is that they enumerated so few. The island, like almost all Hebridean islands, has been a breeding ground of talent and character.The only other qualication for entry in the Great Books of Skye is that you must be dead. You, dear reader, however, accomplished you might be, will not be able to read your entry unless metaphysics permits you access from your celestial cloud. These are obituaries, not panegyrics.That lends a sombre tone to certain pages of the Great Book of Skye Three. There are people featured here who, we are sharply reminded, were alive when volume one was in preparation.Here, for instance, is the smiling face of Dr Vicky Ann Galbraith, who was born in Portree in  and who died at home in Aird Bernisdale of brain cancer in .Vicky Ann was achievement personied. A leading scientist for Roche Pharmaceuticals, she also played for Scotland#s national women#s rugby union team on  occasions. Following her fatal diagnosis, she raised thousands of pounds for cancer research by leading sponsored walks from Portree to Glasgow, up the West Highland Way and where.Here is Thomas William Mackenzie. You may have known him as Tommy. He was born in  and he died last March. He was, in the GBS abbreviated subheading, a #printmaker, etcher and gallery owner, Chieftain of Skye Highland Games, boat race devotee, tug-of-war revivalist, shinty enthusiast, and half-marathon runner.#That just about covers it, as a dictionary of biography is forbidden to indulge itself and cannot add that for very many people, Tommy Mackenzie was the face and personality of modern Portree.These volumes, these hefty Great Books of Skye, are a leisurely parade along Wentworth Street and then out to the peninsulas, pausing to wave at or pass the time of day with Victorian land reformers, clan chiefs, bards, teachers, surgeons, fishermen, and climbers. It#s a verbal Skye equivalent of the cover of #Sergeant Pepper#s Lonely Hearts Club Band#.Sir Harold Boulton was not a Sgiathanach. He came from Hertfordshire and was educated at Harrow and Oxford.In  he married into the Highland quality via a Dingwall military family. Boulton already had an interest in Gaelic song and music.He enters the Great Book of Skye because, in the late th century, Boulton seems to have heard a Gaelic rowing song and put his own, English, words to the tune.Those lyrics and that tune have become internationally known as #The Skye Boat Song#. Norman Macdonald digresses wonderfully on Boulton#s creation of a supposed Jacobite anthem.We are still left with the dilemma of the bonnie boat#s journey. The original Gaelic version may have celebrated a voyage from Torrin to Loch Coruisk. For most of the th century, it was assumed to refer to Charles Edward Stuart#s post-Culloden flight by sea from the mainland to Skye.As Charles never made such a journey directly by sea, pedants have more recently suggested that Boulton must have been referring to the Pretender#s actual sea voyage It really, really, does not matter. We are in the realms of mythology. Charles may as well have been sailing from Papua New Guinea. Harold Boulton invented the whole damn thing — the misty isle#s most famous song is a Victorian concoction — and in recognition of that, he deserves his entry in the Great Book of Skye Three.And finally, here we are back in Portree. William Cowie was born in Kiltarlity in  and became an agricultural advisor in Skye in the s. The brother of a professional footballer, Cowie devoted himself to shinty and became one of the greatest players of his era.Fittingly, he married in  a grand-daughter of the captain of the Skye shinty team which had won the inaugural MacTavish Cup in .William and Margaret Cowie had two sons, Ross and William. He died too young, at the age of  years, while playing badminton in Portree Drill Hall.William Cowie would, therefore, have been shy of his th birthday had he led his natural course to June  and a day in Fort William which would have caused him, more even than the rest of Skye, unimaginable pride.It is tempting to say of all three Great Books of Skye that they are for dipping in and out rather than reading as a single narrative. The trouble with that suggestion is that once you#ve dipped in, it is very hard to dip out again.As a trilogy, they are a phenomenal publishing achievement. They should take their place, alongside the inevitable Tommy Mackenzie print, in every home in Skye."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/INDOOR-SHINTY-19-P4-7-FINAL-2.jpg","title":"skye schools indoor shinty competition all the action in","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineYoung shinty players fromthroughout Skye gathered to take part in two indoor tournaments for primary school teams last weekend.Portree High’s Fingal Centre hosted competitions for P-P and for P-and-under teams.On a fast and furious day of excellent shinty action teams fromBun-sgoil Ghàidhlig Phort Rìgh won both competitions.Broadford were runners up in the P- competition, with North West taking second spot in the P-under tournament following an epic final."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/web-subs-3.jpg","title":"skye charities work to be showcased at skeabost","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineA multi-charity event will be held in Skeabost on Saturdayto highlight the work of several good causes across Skye.The event will be held at Skeabost Memorial Hall from  am until  pm and will provide information on the work carried out by a iety of charities in the area, as well as insight into the costs and challenges they face.to raise awareness of the event, which will support Skye and Lochalsh Young Carers the Skye and Lochalsh Foodbank Crossroads Care # Skye and Lochalsh Macmillan Cancer Support Skye Dance Bloodwise, and Rotjanas Hands, which Mr Williams set up with his we nearly  years ago.He said: “I have been an independent fundraiser for many years – I am a trustee of Rotjanas Hands – formally known as Hands Across the Water – which I set up alongside my we following the Indonesian Tsunami .”He added: “For me, it has always been important to share particularly when we are so fortunate and others not so.

Before his Patriots took the field to play the Chargers in the AFC Quarter finals two weeks ago, hetold his players this would be his last home game.His team came out fired up, and played a perfect first half of football and the game was never in doubt.Last week, he was non-committal on his future again, and heading to Kansas City to play the favoured Chiefs, his teammates came out fired up.His buddy and favourite target Julian Edelman printed up t-shirts that said #Bet Against Us# and no doubt, which had his team feeling like they were true underdogs, and they were finished # the dynasty over.If you bet against Tom Brady # you lose. You usually lose. However, Brady was asked yesterday what was the chance that Sundays final would be his last game. #Zero.#He should have led us and everyone to believe that he would retire after the Superbowl, Surely at  years old, he can#t go on anymore. Chiefs, Steelers, Ravens and basically fans of the other  teams would be happy to see him retire, and stop hogging all the rings.Why retire, when you can basically take the regular season off, play the terrible teams in your own ision twice a year, make sure the referees don#t let anyone knock you down, and play two playoff games before taking the stage in another Super Bowl  He says he wants to play  more years. His playoff stats are ridiculous. Nine Super Bowl appearances.  AFC Championship games.  straight ision titles.I suppose I should mention the other team playing in the Superbowl # the LA Rams. Yes they spent big money to get here, yes they have Aaron Donald, and wonder-coach Sean McVay. And even though I was born in Los Angeles, I have a hard time taking this team serious. They looked finished in the beginning of the Saints game, only to find their composure, and with the help of the referees, they won in New Orleans. But this game is something dferent.The Patriots have a whole dferent playbook for the Superbowl. They#ve been there before, again and again.

Pre-referendum Boris famously came out for Brexit in his Dailycolumn. But what people didn’t know until some time later was that Boris had written two columns that week for the : one pro-Brexit and one pro-Remain. In the pro-Remain column, which was never published in the paper, he wrote: “Shut your eyes. Hold your breath. Think of Britain. Think of the rest of the EU. Think of the future. Think of the desire of your children and your grandchildren to live and work in other European countries to sell things there, to make friends and perhaps to find partners there.” Cue soaring violins. Boris’s most recent comment on the single market was that it is “useless” In  he said in Paris: “Personally, I would like to stay in the single market. We need to stay in the council of ministers of the internal market. In my view, the British have done good things for Europe.” Google Boris’s stunned reaction when the referendum vote was announced and then remember what Nick Soames tweeted.Nigel glad to be rid of the EU Former UKIP leader and Brexit poster boy Nigel Farage has two children by his German we, Kirsten Mehr. He has told journalists that both of them support England at the football, so that’s alright then. Except they both have German passports and so, thrillingly, unlike their English neighbours, will continue to enjoy free movement throughout the EU post-Brexit. And, of course, Nigel will continue to draw his £, per year EU pension – no-one hates the EU that much, not even our Nige. Squinter was particularly moved by Nigel’s claim in the weeks leading up to the referendum that staying in Europe would “spell the end of the steel industry in this country”. But Nige and his UKIP colleagues were in  among a tiny number of MEPs to vote against a move to tighten up rules on the import of cheap non-EU steel. Business, as they say, is business. The Man from the Daily MailFormer Daily Mail editor Paul Dacre was the man responsible for all those headlines that frightened the horses during the referendum campaign and, subsequently, the attacks on Parliament and the judiciary as the political and legal implications were fought out. So he’s the Brexiter’s Brexiter. But it’s estimated that as a landowner Dacre benefited to the tune of around £, a year in EU subsidies. The veteran journalist was on over £m a year towards the end of his time with the Mail, so he’ll not be begging outside the Red Lion in his local villagethe UK leaves the EU. Brexit-voting and Mail-reading Farmer Browns, however, may be left sucking thoughtfully on a wheat stalk as they contemplate their own looming subsidy deficit, which may not be so lightly borne.Bordering on the ridiculousThe DUP’s singular focus as we hurtle towards Brexit D-Day is to block any deal that involves regulatory ergence with the mother ship – in other words: we must be treated exactly the same as Britain by the EU. Whether that’s a gentle wave goodbye with best wishes, or a massive, eye-watering boot in the ging-gangs matters not. We’re all in this together . The DUP’s insistence on alignment with the ‘mainland’ may be extremely touching, but it is an entirely new concept, for this little corner of empire long ago gave up any pretence of a claim to be as British as Finchley. Presumably, the party will continue to lobby for a dferent VAT and Passenger Duty regime post-Brexit, for they were white-hot on those ideas before the EU balloon went up. They’ll continue to block defamation law reform, keeping loyal Ulster as a magnet for libel tourists . Most famously, the DUP remains the bulwark against the equal marriage and abortion rights that are accorded to every other part of these two islands. Luckily, the party stood firm and insisted that Are Wee Country has to have exactly the same RHI regime as across the water, avoiding the possibility of widespread and catastrophically expensive abuse of the boiler scheme*Sub-editors: please check this last line for accuracy. Thanks, SquintPapers, pleaseAndrew Bridgen, Tory MP for West Leicestershireis another European Research Group charmer, without the profile of Jacob Rees Mogg but with the same level of warmth and likeability. Andy’s most notable brush with fame before Brexit thrust him into the public eye alongside Boris and Jacob was his posting of a raunchy video on a WhatsApp group composed of Tory MPs, some of them ministers. Suffice to say that the video included a scantily clad woman, a man and a sports car. A suitably repentant Andy explained to colleagues that it had been a terrible error caused by “fat fingers”. In October past he said in a radio interview that all English people are entitled to an Irish passport, a claim that nearly caused Twitter to explode and was the impetus for more jokes than Ian Paisley’s summer holidays.In response to a question on free movement between Britain and Ireland post-Brexit, Andy said: “As an English person, I do have the right to go over to Ireland and I believe that I can ask for a passport. Can’t I ” No, Andy, mate, you can’t. We’ve enough West Brits on this island, ta very much.Doctor Jekyll and Mr SnideThat Michael Gove’s a reasonable bloke, ain’t he  There he’s been for the past few months, urging cool heads and common sense, quietly and assiduously working to help Prime Minister Theresa may with a withdrawal agreement that’s harder to sell than a Northern Ireland shirt in O’Neills. While those nasty Brexit nutjobs in the ERG snarl and threaten, Michael’s been a model of loyalty and stf upper-lipped British discretion. But wait. Wasn’t it a bloke who looked exactly like him who said during the campaign that Turkey was about to join the EU, opening the gates to allow five million-plus Turks to come cascading into the UK.Yes, indeed: it was Michael Gove who made that claim. He has subsequently admitted that it was baloney and should not have been made. So them Turks stay in the mess they’re in.

An SDLP conference is scheduled to take place on February  in Newry where the party membership is set to vote on the plans.Speaking exclusively to the Andersonstown News. West Belfast Councillor Tim Attwood said he was “not an advocate of the SDLP and Fianna Fáil partnership”. It’s known that South Belfast MLA Claire Hanna is also at odds with the party leadership over its move to link up with Fianna Fáil.“I recognise that the political landscape of this island has been changed utterly given the failure of the DUP and Sinn Féin to bring back the power-sharing Executive, the catastrophic consequences of Brexit and the emerging debate about Irish unity,” said Cllr Attwood.Cllr Attwood continued: “I have the greatest respect for the leadership of the SDLP and recognise that in a post-conflict situation there is a natural and wider debate about political realignment on this island,” he said. “The reality is my politics is steadfastly rooted in the social democratic and labour traditions embodied by the SDLP and parties of the Party of European Socialists.”Mr Attwood, who has served as a West Belfast councillor these past  years, said that over the coming days he would be speaking to his family and SDLP members in his constituency area about the proposal for a new partnership between the SDLP and Fianna Fáil. “I will make a further statement after these discussions,” he added.Meanwhile, SDLP Lagan Valley MLA Pat Catney is supporting the party leadership in entering into a partnership with Fianna Fáil.Mr Catney said: “Northern Ireland is crying out for a response to the fast changing and signicant challenges across these islands as a result of Brexit. “Twenty years after the Good Friday Agreement, people here must be offered something new, credible and forward-looking in its approach.”The Lagan Valley MLA added: “Brexit has shted the political sands dramatically. It poses many challenges that sit outside the boundaries of local devolution. Our politics in the past two years, a politics of ision, of deadlock and of repetition is frighteningly at odds with the vast challenges that now face us. Old solutions to new challenges can no longer cut it.“It has always been the SDLP’s vision to unite our people. To seek an Ireland, befitting of the st century, where opportunity and prosperity are more than slogans on a placard but a way of le whether you are Catholic, Protestant or Dissenter. That will never change.“I am all too aware of the uneasiness some of my unionist neighbours may feel about this new partnership. Neighbours who have put their trust in me in countless elections. But let me be crystal clear a new Ireland, one without the full inclusivity of unionism is not one I want to be part of let alone build. You are part of the fabric of this island, woven into history every bit as much as any nationalist and you are a critical part of its future.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"fundraiser in memory of limestone mother","story":"A FUNDRAISING night will be held this Saturdayin memory of a North Belfast woman who died suddenly just two weeks after she became a grandmother for the first time.Marie Branfdied suddenly at her Limestone Road home on St Patrick’s Day  after suffering a heart attack and going into cardiac arrest. Despite efforts by her family to perform CPR, they were unable to resuscitate her.This Saturday, the mother of four’s family are holding a charity night in St Malachy’s Old Boys’ Club to raise money for British Heart Foundation Northern Ireland in her memory. The charity funds research into heart and circulatory diseases including the prevention and treatment of heart attacks.Marie’s daughter Zara said her mum had been delighted to have become a granny for the first time just two weeks before she died.“Mummy’s death came as such a shock to us all. We knew that heart disease ran in our family and my grandparents had had heart attacks at a young age but we didn’t expect this to happen,” she said. “Just two weeks before she died my wee nephew was born and she became a granny for the first time. She couldn’t wait for the baby to be born and had everything all in for him coming. She just doted on him but she only got two weeks with him before she died.”The charity night in St Malachy’s Old Boy’s Club will raise funds to power research into heart and circulatory diseases.“We don’t want another family to suffer like we have,” added Zara.“My wee brother found mummy in the house and between us we tried to resuscitate her but it was too late. We want to raise money to help fund research and stop this happening to other people. So many people loved and miss her. Her husband David, her children and her four brothers and all her friends. The night will be a lovely tribute to her.“Saturday will be a really good night and so many businesses and local people have been really generous with ballot prizes. It would be greatpeople could come along and enjoy a great night.”Órla Clarke, fundraising manager for BHF NI said: “Thanks to Zara and the Branf family for organising the charity night which will raise much needed funds for research. Our research has saved thousands of lives. Before the mid-s, nobody fully understood the cause of heart attacks and  per cent of people here who suffered a heart attack didn’t survive.“Our research has meant that today  per cent of people do survive a heart attack. But stories like Marie’s story show there is still so much to do.“ No family should lose their mummy at just . We need to keep funding research so that more lives can be saved.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"mates pull pensioner from blaze","story":"A RIVERDALE man has recounted the dramatic moments when he and a friend saved two of his neighbours from a blaze that gutted their home.Antoin Carlisle and Terence Young saved an elderly woman in her s and a man in his s from the house fire in Riverdale Park South around .am on Saturday morning. After noticing smoke billowing from the property, the brave pair sprang into action, racing towards the fire to bring the people inside to safety.Recounting the dramatic ordeal, Antoin told us: “I couldn’t see the fire, so I thought it was the end house on my street. As soon as we got to the end of the street we could see the flames through the back windows – the whole lot was on fire.“Nobody lives in the house next door so I kicked in that door thinking somebody had broken in and set it on fire. Then I came round and hit the other door a boot and the fire nearly blew me off my feet.“I started smashing windows to let the smoke out. I smashed the front window and then climbed up and smashed one of the top windows and shouted at the top of my lungs, ‘Is anybody there ’“We found out there were people at the back of the house. We couldn’t get in the front because the flames were too big, so we went to the old couple next door, got them settled, and then my mate Terence started breaking down the fence with his shovel to get into the house. He got in the back way and lted the two people out of the house and out through the broken fence.“The smoke was all over the place so I thought all the houses were going to go up. I went to the houses on the other side and got them up. My neighbour had one of the kids and I had to bring the other one up the street to get them away from the smoke – I was trying to keep my hand over the child’s face to stop them breathing in the smoke. The black smoke was following us the whole way up.”Antoin added: “I think most people would have done it. I just did it because it was my own neighbours. I knew there were old people in those houses so I had to do something. When it’s your own street you can’t just walk past it. I have to thank my friend Terence too becausehe wasn’t here then God knows what would have happened.”A spokesperson for the Fire Servicesaid: “Firefighters were called to a house fire on the ground floor of a two storey, mid-terraced property. A man in his s and a woman in her s were out of the property before the arrival of fire crews. Firefighters wearing breathing apparatus extinguished the fire.“Both casualties were treated at the scene for smoke inhalation and shock and taken to hospital. An elderly neighbour was also treated at the scene and taken to hospital. The cause of the fire is believed to be accidental.”"},{"url":null,"title":"giant rats causing light bulbs to explode northern ireland homes invaded by rodents size of cats","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It was the first arms control measure to ban an entire class of weapons: ground-launched cruise missiles with a range between  and , miles. Russia denies being in violation.US officials have also expressed worry that China, which is not party to the  treaty, is gaining a signicant military advantage in Asia by deploying large numbers of missiles with ranges beyond the treaty’s limit. Leaving the INF treaty would allow the Trump administration to counter the Chinese, but it is unclear how it would do that.US secretary of state Mike Pompeo said in early December that Washington would give Moscow  days toto compliance before it gave formal notice of withdrawal, with the actual pullout taking place six months later. Technically, a US withdrawal would take effect six months after this week’s notication, leaving a small window for saving the treaty, but in talks this week in Beijing, the US and Russia reported no breakthrough in their dispute, leaving little reason to think either side would change its stance.Russian deputy foreign minister Sergei Ryabkov was quoted by the Russian state news agency Tass as saying after the Beijing talks: “Unfortunately, there is no progress. The position of the American side is very tough and like an ultimatum.” He said he expected Washington to suspend its obligations under the treaty, although he added that Moscow remained ready to “search for solutions” that could keep the treaty in force.Russia’s violation of the INF Treaty is a serious problem.However, U.S. withdrawal from the treaty without an effective strategy would be counterproductive.Read the policy outlook by @pranayrvaddi and @PerkovichG.https:t.co BsiTsdA— Carnegie EndowmentJanuary , Nuclear weapons experts at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace said in a statement this week that while Russia’s violation of the INF treaty is a serious problem, US withdrawal under current circumstances would be counter-productive.“Leaving the INF treaty will unleash a new missile competition between the United States and Russia,” they said."},{"url":null,"title":"coroner fixes date andrew allen inquest","story":"Donegal Coroner Dr Denis McCauley has set the date for the inquest of Andrew Allen , the Derry man shot dead in Buncrana on  February, .Sitting in Buncrana Court House, Mr McCauley said Mr Allen’s Inquest would take place on Wednesday,  September, in Buncrana.Mr Allen , who was from Derry’s Waterside, had been living in Links View Park, just outside Buncrana at the time of his death.

It is situated at Belvedere Pl, Mountjoy, in Dublin which is a short five-minute walk to Temple Street Children’s University Hospital and close to other hospitals in the city.Whilst at Hugh’s House, parents are also able to share their own experiences which helps build an important support network at what is a very distressing time.‘Lesaver’googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshCllr Donnelly said the fundraising event at Creggan Community Collective on January  exceeded all expectations with people throughout the city supporting it.  The sponsored spin cycle covered  miles - the distance from Derry to Dublin.He commented: “We had a huge response, a lot of people took part in the cycle.  It was a km cycle and all sorts of people did shts, organisations, women’s groups and we well exceeded what we expected.“There is still some money coming in, UNISON just donated £ today and parent and toddler groups helped us out too.  When me and Paul Gallagher went down the Lord Mayor of Dublin was running afor Hugh’s House and there was another gentleman.  We were lucky enough that we met Ade and Martin who took us a tour around.“And whilst we were there we actually met two families from Letterkenny, but there have been a number of families from the council district who have been using it over the last while that we know of.”Speaking about local families who have availed of the service, he added: “I know a family who was supported by Hugh’s House in recent weeks, the mother was rushed to hospital in Dublin because there were no beds in the north.  The father was upset and they were stranded in the middle of Dublin with no contacts and had to find somewhere to sleep.“So it was through that that we phoned Hugh’s House and they were very helpful.  They then go through a social worker and visit the people in hospital, and they were lucky that two rooms had become available at the time.  The father was moved in and then when the mother got out of hospital she was able to use it as a base from which to visit the baby in hospital on a daily basis.“We talked to one of the families from Letterkenny who have three other children and, they said to us, ‘without this service we don’t know what we would have done.’  If you put yourself in that position, the hotels in Dublin are expensive, a child can be in for weeks, months or even a year in some cases then you couldn’t survive, people have bills to pay – it’s a lesaver for some people.”Photo: Cllr Paul Gallagher, Maria Kirby-BrennanAde Stack, Martin Curleyand Cllr Gary Donnelly."},{"url":null,"title":"newly acquired duncreggan road land may provide student parking solution","story":"The Ulster University Vice Chancellor has been urged to make available newly acquired lands at the old Foyle College for student parking in order to ease congestion in the Duncreggan area.SDLP MLA Mark H.

However, councillors subsequently switched attention to the former St. Maryrsquos Girlsrsquo Primary School campus at Shanslieve Drive.Despite a number of protracted attempts to secure the site and hopes that a deal could be agreed, it was bought by supermarket giant Lidl.While widely regarded as one of Northern Irelandrsquos premier tourist resorts, Newcastle does not have a modern indoor leisure facility and while there are some politicians who would like a swimming pool as part of any new development in the resort, this seems unlikely given there are local authority pools in Downpatrick, Kilkeel and Newry.It was previously suggested that the sale of the Annesley Buildings would free up the site for a new hotel and, signicantly, generate funds to help provide new leisure provision in the resort. But that now looks unlikely.As part of the drive to signicantly enhance leisure provision in the resort, council officials are continuing to work alongside education officials to develop a major new sports hub.Shimna Integrated College is planning to redevelop its King Street site which would include the creation of additional sports facilities at nearby Donard Park.It has been suggested that the proposed sports facilities could potentially be developed by the Department of Education in partnership with Newry, Mourne and Down Council with pitches and a sports pavilion forming the new sports hub which could also used by the community.While discussions are ongoing, the local authority still has to address the issue of no meaningful indoor sports facility in the resort to cater for both residents and visitors and is turning its attention to the Annesley Buildings site.Senior council officials have admitted that their initial thoughts about using the location for a town centre hotel have changed, confirming they are working to make a final decision on the way forward. It is also being suggested that the most likely outcome is developing a new leisure-cum-community facility at the Central Promenade site.A feasibility study on the redevelopment of the town centre site for a new hotel was completed several years ago which suggested a two or three-storey extension extension would be acceptable.The new hotel was viewed as a key ingredient in the plan to deliver highly ambitious proposals outlined in the Mournes Gateway proposals aimed at shaping future tourist provision in Newcastle.Other proposals include a gondola ride into the heart of the Mournes and a visitor centre at the site of the old quarry at Thomasrsquo Mountain.It has emerged that work on the high profile tourism project is progressing with moves to establish a board to deliver its ious elements, with membership including representatives from the local council, Tourism NI, Forest Service, Mourne Heritage Trust and National Trust.Over the next month, work is scheduled to start on tendering for consultancy and architectural services, alongside the recruitment of environmental and traffic management services.

However, the book kept me from thinking dark thoughts. Soon, all I wanted was to hold a copy of the book in my hand.Maureenrsquos dream came true in the autumn of  when her haunting story was finally published.Maureen, who is the mother of five grown-up children, explained some of the background as to why she put pen to paper.She added: ldquoI was initially setting out to piece together my family tree and the computer screen flashed up information on my great aunt Brigid. I was so fascinated with what I read that I could see the story unfold in a book and in turn I felt the plot would work well on screen too.Research took Maureen to the Presentation Convent in Co Kildare, which Brigid entered at the age of .Maureen said: ldquoI met with such a warm and friendly welcome from the community of sisters, that it gave me the desire to pursue Brigidrsquos story further. I travelled to Australia shortly after and I received the same, warm and friendly welcome from the sisters of the Presentation of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Wagga Wagga.On herMaureen set about sting through a mountain of information and carefully crafted the remarkable story of her great aunt. The book was published in July  and was officially launched a few months later to a rapturous reception in Murphyrsquos Bar in Downpatrick.A chance meeting which her web designer, Michael McLaughlin, had had a year later led to a further development.She said: ldquoMichael was working on a display in Eclipse Cinema in Downpatrick for another movie when he struck up a random conversation with Colin McIvor.ldquoAs they chatted Michael mentioned that he had recently read a book written by a Downpatrick woman which he thought might make a great movie.ldquoWithin days Colin, with the backing of Northern Ireland Screen, was in my house and we were signing contracts on a movie deal. That was in July last year and since then the whole thing has snowballed.ldquoIt has been a pleasure putting the whole thing together. I wrote it like a novel which makes it easy for the reader to follow the story. My story is entirely based on fact.As Maureen describes the plot her face lights up. She believes her great aunt would be delighted at her revealing the long-lost tale to a new generation.ldquoBrigid had trained as a teacher and in  there was a great demand for priests and nuns with skilled trades in Australia and so she was shipped off to the mother house in Wagga Wagga.ldquoBrigid proved herself capable and popular with the children she taught for six years. But a bad day in front of a teaching inspector led the convent demoting her to refectory duties.ldquoTwo weeks turned into two years of hard labour that took their toll physically and mentally on poor Brigid. Requests toto her former duties were denied and feeling she had no real means of complaint, it left Brigid desperate.ldquoOne day she wandered outside the convent walls. Tears welled up in her eyes as she called at a strangerrsquos home. Her afternoon of tea and warm company by the fire ended all too soon and Brigid was sent back to the convent, seen by a doctor and put to bed, Maureen added.The story really begins in earnest at this crossroads in Brigidrsquos le. Drawing on every ounce of courage she had, Brigid leapt from her bed that night and made a hasty escape barefoot in her nightgown on a foggy winterrsquos night in .This night set the scene for a religious storm unprecedented in Australiarsquos history. Brigid found refuge in the home of Protestants who refuse to disclose her whereabouts to the Catholic authorities.A bishop swore before a magistrate that Brigid was insane and a warrant was issued for her arrest. She was hunted down like an outlaw and the local media attention created a level of sectarian tension rarely unseen in that part of the world.Later, when there was no apology from the bishop for the arrest and slur on her character, Brigid turned to the courts for redress. But taking on the bishop meant taking on the Catholic Church.Maureen had a challenging time presenting Brigidrsquos story.She said: ldquoIt was a scandal at the time but I had to be careful to write it from both sides and let people judge for themselves. Itrsquos all I can do.Maureen says she is looking forward to the filmrsquos premiere.She added: ldquoIt will be the culmination of not just my five years of writing and telling the story, but all the hard work and effort that my family have put into supporting and helping me and, of course, the efforts of the film company, the director and the actors.Colin spoke of his enthusiasm over Maureenrsquos forthcoming film.ldquoI am thoroughly delighted to have optioned such an amazingly powerful book and to have met the inspirational Maureen and her family through the process, he said.He is currently adapting the book into a screenplay. ldquoI believe the film will offer a fantastic role for a strong female lead and supporting cast, he said. ldquoTo be able to bring this beautully written, dramatic and deserved piece to the silver screen some day would be just fantastic.Log on to Maureenrsquos website toon the forthcoming movie premiere at www.theextraordinarycaseofsisterliguori..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C January 30%2C 1979  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK mdash A Strangford man had a narrow escape from death when he turned up for work on Monday morning at the new Abbey Lodge Hotel, outside Downpatrick.A muffled explosion during the night had ripped apart a section of the hotel mdash which was due to open in three weeksrsquo time mdash but no alarm was raised and workmen were unaware of the danger when they reported for work.One of the men, Mr Francis Black, from Strangford, passed through the lounge and noticed a black bag and two yellow tins.

The Swts approach of containing their hosts paid idends and they frustrated Saintfield in the first half to a couple of half chances, with James Milliganrsquos late strike against the crossbar the best of the action.In the second half Saintfield established more control with their passing game causing the visitorsrsquo defence more problems. However, they found the Swts lsquokeeper to be in good form.The gamersquos deciding moment arrived in the th minute with Ryan Sofley picking up the ball in his own half and, as the Swts tiring defence retreated, he advanced and shot into the top corner from  yards.A goal worthy of winning any game. As the visitors pushed men forward seeking an equaliser, Saintfield threatened to put the game out of reach with numerous attacks. However, the Swts lsquokeeper made three or four terric low saves to deny more goals.With the Swts best threat coming from set-pieces, there was a nervous finish when two late corners caused some problems for the Saints. However, two terric headers from Callum McCloskey and Justin Rea maintained Saintfieldrsquos lead and preserved a clean sheet for stand-in lsquokeeper Tony Liken, deputising for the injured David Harper.The Bangor connection continues this weekend when Saintfield host st Bangor in a Clarence Cup third round tie, with a . kick off..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Superstar Ed Sheeran teams up with Downpatrick businessman  ","story":"IF there was ever a guitar dream team, then the new collaboration between Ed Sheeran and Downpatrick-based Lowden Guitars is it.The news that the globally acclaimed singer songwriter and the master guitar maker from Co Down have teamed up to produce a new range of guitars took the music world by storm earlier this week when it was announced at a major industry conference in Calornia.The new range, Sheeran by Lowden, is aimed to inspire a fresh crop of players mdash and hopefully younger musicians mdash by playing one of the most revered names in music.Now being recognised in the same league like classic music brands such as Gibson and Fender guitar, the new range will be priced at an affordable range of pound-pound for such a quality instrument.The collaboration will cement Lowdenrsquos growing international reputation.and itrsquos a major affirmation for founder George Louden who handmade his first professional guitar in .A  year-old George made a guitar with a couple of friends with the help of his boat-builder father from Groomsport.George confirmed that there should be new additions to the -strong workforce at Louden Guitars, which is soon to move to new premises.ldquoOur new premises are located between Crossgar and Saintfield. These premises will be our new premises with dedicated areas for Lowden acoustic guitars and new electric guitar ranges, said George.ldquoWe are currently planning out the logistics of our move from Down Business Park. This will require attention to detail and be orchestrated stage by stage to minimise any disruption to our ability to complete and ship our guitars to waiting customers.Lowden Guitars successfully managed to keep news that it was working with Sheeran mdash one of the worldrsquos biggest music artist, who has sold  million albums and has had more than  billion streams mdash under wraps for considerable time. Sheeranrsquos influence around the world is extensive mdash his  hit lsquoShape of Yoursquo is the most streamed song on Spoty to date.Stars like Eric Clapton, Paul Brady, Luka Bloom and Richard Thompson are all Lowden devotees. Sheeran got his first Louden as a gt from Snow Patrol frontman Gary Lightbody in .Lightbody commissioned George to make a guitar especially for Sheeran, which turned out to be the Wee Louden which he plays on stage and on studio recordings.Sheeran has since built a personal collection of Lowden guitars which appear on stage with him often, including Lowdenrsquos electric guitar, the GL-.He said: ldquoI grew up wanting Lowden guitars as all of my favourite artists played Lowden guitars. But a starting price for a Lowden was three grand. When yoursquore , three grand may as well be a million pounds.ldquoThe dream of any kid who likes music is to have a guitar and the dream of any musician is to have a signature guitar.George realised that he needed to make a range that was something special and revealed that he sought inspiration from the North Coast.ldquoEvery guitar that I design and make I have to feel afterwards proud of it, I have to feel that I have achieved something with it. That itrsquos not just a normal guitar, he explained.ldquoThe main aim was to design and make a guitar here at an affordable price noticeably better than anything  at that price range. So I went up to the North Coast and spent a week at the Giants Causeway walking and thinking and drawing. Then having designed it, of course I sent it off to Ed and the rest is history.Sheeran has previously bemoaned that fewer youngsters seem to be interested in guitar-playing these days.ldquoThere are fewer guitar bands and fewer artists using guitars now, and not as many kids picking up guitars, he added.ldquoThat is something I would like to change by getting these great quality guitars, made in Ireland, into kidsrsquo hands and encouraging them to learn and progress.The Sheeran by Lowden acoustic guitar range features eight inidual models across two small body sizes familiar from the Lowden range, known as the S and the Wee Lowden.The guitars have been designed for uncompromising tone and playability and are made using sustainably-sourced wood including naturally fallen trees and reclaimed spruce.George says that the new range combines years of hand-crafting and traditional luthier methods with new construction technology.ldquoItrsquos taking everything I have learnt over the last  years, cherry-picking from that a few traditional methods of working by hand and introducing those into a whole series of new groundbreaking procedures for guitar making so that the end result is a guitar made in Ireland but one which really sings and which I hope inspires many young musicians and older ones as well, he added.The first orders should be shipped in March. The range will be available to order through select music merchants.

It is essential that four runners from a club cross the finish line in order to constitute a team.All eyes were on the tortuous drag to the finish line when out of the gloom emerged Deirdre, who responded to the cheers and crossed the line in th place.After the points had been tallied up, Omagh Harriers were declared the winners with Willowfield second and East Down third.However, just after the presentation of the trophies, an error in calculations was discovered and the revised result showed East Down first and Omagh second..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Wells blasts £60k gay parade boost for ‘tiny minority’  ","story":"A DECISION by Newry, Mourne and Down Council to allocate a pound, underspend in its tourist budget to a group organising an international gay parade in Newry has been criticised by a DUP politician.South Down MLA Jim Wells said in addition to funding the summer event, the local authority will provide staff to help with the events.He said it was also his understanding that additional funding from the organisationrsquos tourism events budget will be granted to the organisers.The Assemblymanrsquos criticism comes weeks after his party colleague on the local authority, Harry Harvey, said he was also against the decision to award the money to the Newry Rainbow Committee which is organising the event.Cllr Harvey said he did not agree with spending such an amount of money in one area over a few days for a small percentage of the districtrsquos population.Mr Wells claimed the event was aimed at ldquoattracting gay activists from across Northern Ireland and further afield.He said: ldquoLast year, there were , marriages in Northern Ireland and  civil partnerships registered mdash a ratio of  to one.ldquoIn Newry, Mourne and Down, there were , marriages in the district and nine civil partnership ceremonies.

The site will potentially generate up to  new work positions across management, supervisory, warehousing staff and apprenticeship roles.Speaking of the new facility and what it will bring, Mr Rattenbury said: ldquoWe are delighted that our vision of a lsquoone stop shoprsquo for our customers is being realised and having a  hour, seven day a week co-packing facility in the heart of Wales, is a game changer for our industry. We can now offer our customers a streamlined product supply chain package by integrating their co-packing requirements with the grouprsquos warehouse and transport subsidiary companies.ldquoLogistically, this works out to be more cost effective overall, but also lowers the carbon footprint on the transportation of food products, which is something we are passionate about.Wild Water Group has a current annual turnover of poundm and Mr Rattenbury believes the company can increase that figure by a further poundm within  months and then reach poundm within two to three years.The project is backed by a pound. million investment from Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking and the Development Bank of Wales and has secured Welsh Government funding under the new economic contract.Using a similar business model to the grouprsquos other three sites in Merthyr Tydfil, Llanishen and Cardf Bay, the first phase of development will be the conversion of available space into a large ambient open plan co-packing facility, which will be operational early November  to meet festive season demand.During the first quarter of , Wild Water Group will move the entire Cardf Bay co-packing facility to Aberbargoed, once freezer facilities, production lines and machinery are in place.The company will then continue services such as frozen to frozen storage, bagging, over wrapping, sleeving and tray sealing, as well as the full spectrum of print labelling applications required under the Food Safety Technicalspecications.Economy Secretary Ken Skates said: ldquoThis project will not only see a successful, growing Welsh business create an additional  jobs, it will also create a new strategic hub and facility for both large and small food and drink businesses across the region to pack or store products themselves. This could, in turn, open up new markets for those businesses ndash so Irsquom excited about what this means not only for Wild Water Group and Aberbargoed, but for the region more widely.ldquoIt shows that both our Economic and Food and Drink Action plans are delivering what we had hoped ndash jobs, prosperity and sustainable growth. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

I now intend to present an amended report to cabinet on February .ldquoThe report will propose that option one in the previous report now be taken forward, which retains the current roundabout though enhances the gateway route into Penarth whilst providing much safer crossing opportunities for cyclists and pedestrians. There is no requirement to complete any spending on this project by the end of this financial year.ldquoIt is very dficult to please everyone with highway improvement schemes but I very much hope that this option provides the active travel benefits we are seeking and is viewed by residents and visitors to Penarth as being the most appropriate. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It was made with willow grown in the grounds of Cogan Primary School.More than  people attended the hill rolling ceremony down Clf Hill towards Penarth Esplanade - with the school pupils from Cogan and pupils and families from Ysgol Pen Y Garth helping to roll it along.The head was accompanied by a wooden frame from the Mabinogion stories called the Window of Sorrows made by Tony Simms, and the artist Ifor Davies undertook the ritual sawing of the Window of Sorrows on the clftops and read the Bendigeidfran story from the Mabinogion tales before the rolling went ahead.The head of Bendigeidfran and the Window of Sorrows was accompanied by Penarths Mari Lwyd which is a symbol of hosting, and negotiating hospitality through song and teasing. Richard Parry led the Mari Lwyd this year, and on arriving at the bottom of the hill the celebration visited local shops and resaurants along the sea front wishing the proprietors and customers a Happy New Year. We sang for Romeo Italian restaurant, The Fig Tree, James Sommerin, The Crazy Cafe and Hamptons seaside shop. After reaching the bottom of the hill the head was carried by the children along with the Mari Lwyd to the shops and cafes along the seafront where dferent New Year songs - called Calenig - were sung in each venue and led by local opera singer Richard Parry.Speaking about the event, artist Haf Weighton said: \"I loved working with Cogan School. Itrsquos a hidden gem in Penarth with very enthusiastic staff who were happy to jump in to get involved in this project at short notice. Richard Parry and the schools deputy head Tom Lewis, ran a assembly to the whole school on the new year traditions. Then children from across the school came to see me working on the piece. \"It was lovely to hear children who donrsquot come from homes where Welsh is spoken enthusing about the mabinogi tales and Welsh traditions. Children from Pen y Garth joined in after the head was created. They helped us roll it down the hill from the clf tops.\"Richard Parry, who helped to organise the event and led the Mari Lwyd, said: \"It was great to see so many people come together to celebrate Hen Galan in Penarth. The giant Bendegeidfran got his name because he was the Blessed Bran - the best friend anyone could ever want - and in the stories of the Mabinogion he was loved by those who knew him. He is a symbol of friendship and celebrating together. \"The community celebration on the clftops was thoroughly enjoyed by children and adults alike, and even though its a bit chilly it was wonderful to see so many people out of doors, celebrating, singing and enjoying wishing everyone we met Blwyddyn Newydd Dda and Happy New Year.\"The head will now go on display at a iety of places, including Pen y Garth School, Cogan Primary School, Penarth Library and The Hearth Gallery Llandough Hospital. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work.

We cannot be the only country in the world unilaterally bound by this treaty, or any other.Nato said thatMoscow failed to destroy all new missile systems that Washington insists violate the treaty, ldquoRussia will bear sole responsibility for the end of the treaty.Russia is in material breach of the #INFTreaty  must use next  months toto full  veriable compliance or bear sole responsibility for its demise. #NATO fully supports the US suspension  notication of withdrawal from the Treaty: https:t.co VOhUBHoAd pic Rwicqromdash Jens StoltenbergFebruary , A US withdrawal had been expected for months, after years of unresolved dispute over Russian compliance with the pact.It was the first arms control measure to ban an entire class of weapons: ground-launched cruise missiles with a range between  and , miles. Russia denies being in violation.US officials have also expressed worry that China, which is not party to the  treaty, is gaining a signicant military advantage in Asia by deploying large numbers of missiles with ranges beyond the treatyrsquos limit.Leaving the INF treaty would allow the Trump administration to counter the Chinese, but it is unclear how it would do that.US secretary of state Mike Pompeo said in early December that Washington would give Moscow  days toto compliance before it gave formal notice of withdrawal, with the actual pullout taking place six months later.Technically, a US withdrawal would take effect six months after this weekrsquos notication, leaving a small window for saving the treaty, but in talks this week in Beijing, the US and Russia reported no breakthrough in their dispute, leaving little reason to think either side would change its stance.Russian deputy foreign minister Sergei Ryabkov was quoted by the Russian state news agency Tass as saying after the Beijing talks: ldquoUnfortunately, there is no progress. The position of the American side is very tough and like an ultimatum.He said he expected Washington to suspend its obligations under the treaty, although he added that Moscow remained ready to ldquosearch for solutions that could keep the treaty in force.Russiarsquos violation of the INF Treaty is a serious problem.However, U.S. withdrawal from the treaty without an effective strategy would be counterproductive.Read the policy outlook by @pranayrvaddi and @PerkovichG.https:t.co BsiTsdAmdash Carnegie EndowmentJanuary , Nuclear weapons experts at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace said in a statement this week that while Russiarsquos violation of the INF treaty is a serious problem, US withdrawal under current circumstances would be counter-productive.ldquoLeaving the INF treaty will unleash a new missile competition between the United States and Russia, they said..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: US abandons key arms control treaty with Russia article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He’s just taken over at the helm of the internationally renowned next generation science park which is home to  innovative knowledge based companies, who are employing more than , engineers, researchers, entrepreneurs and executives, across four locations – and has his sights firmly set on making Northern Ireland a leader in two key innovative areas of tech business.Taking on the role as chief executive of Catalyst from stalwart Professor Norman Apsley OBE, just two months ago, plans are under way to build on the foundations of an organisation which has an estate of , sq ft of agile workspace filled with innovative companies. Catalyst leads the way in innovation and entrepreneurship by supporting the creation and growth of innovation companies in Northern Ireland.“We have a rightful place in leading the world. We aren’t going to follow anybody. Let’s get back to leading the world,” Steve tells Ulster Business.“I am going to take the foundation that Norman left and look at how we leverage that by a signicant factor – in terms of economic activity and dynamism for Northern Ireland.“We need deeper, more strategic partnerships with key institutions. It is through collaboration we can do something to scale and put Northern Ireland on a world map.”Catalyst is the thriving, beating heart of Northern Ireland’s booming technology sector and leading the way in educating and preparing companies and young people for the changing world of work through the impact of the ‘Fourth Industrial Revolution, which is seeing the impact of new technologies impacting on le, work and society.Formerly known as the Northern Ireland Science Park, Catalyst is an independent not-for-profit organisation operating across the region. It provides agile workspace across four locations – the main site in Belfast’s Titanic Quarter, the Innovation centres in Londonderry, and Ballymena and most recently opened Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub, a co-working space dedicated to the fintech sector in Belfast city centre, which is a partnership with Danske Bank.“The business model we have had for the first  years was the perfect model for that period. We need a new model for the next. We are identying a simple, but ambitious strategy – building on the existing foundation.”Part of the strength of Catalyst is in attracting big international firms, such as Citi, in close proximity to businesses at the very birth of existence. Steve says as a result, “accidental encounters” lead to relationships and outcomes which otherwise, would not have happened.It also plays host to Queen’s University’s leading research body, ECITwhich itself is home to CSIT .Some of the leading thinkers based at the site include ECIT’s Professor Maire O’Neill – one of the youngest ever engineering professors at Queen’s, one-time UK Female Inventor of the Year and a leading researcher. “You have US companies looking at why would they want to move to Northern Ireland – they want to meet Professor O’Neill. She’s amazing,” Steve says.“Then there are cyber companies, like B-Secur. The firm specialises in technology which can read your ECG heartbeat as a unique biometric identy verication.“There are other indigenous companies, like Titan IC in cyber-security, Displaynote and ProAxsis. We have great companies that are now making a dent in the world.”And pushing forward with what his predecessor Norman Apsley built, plans are under way to expand and redevelop Catalyst further still.That includes another new building, Pierpont  – which will provide another , sq ft of space – and a revamp and refurbishment of Catalyst’s Innovation Centre, as part of an addition £m investment.“We want to make this the best place to work – improving the environment, the flow around the campus, the accessibility, and the experience, so that you love being here.“We want to refresh some of the buildings on the site. The Innovation Centre will be modernised by March and we will freshen-up our identity.”His big goal is to lead the way in two areas of technology and business at Catalyst – putting Northern Ireland front and centre.“We want to help to incubate two clusters where Northern Ireland leads the world.“How do we build on what ECIT is doing  We take the start-up capability, and ecosystem we have in Northern Ireland and leverage that further.“We want to make it easier for corporations to set up in Belfast and Northern Ireland in order to access amazing research talent. They want to define what the next big breakthrough is.“We can develop something for global companies that they can’t find where in the world. We want to create clusters, that will act as a magnet to attract hundreds of companies.”One of the unique elements of Catalyst is Connect – a network of experienced entrepreneurs, business professionals, top research talent and potential investors who provide their time and experience pro bono to help foster and develop the next generation of entrepreneurs.“It’s helping entrepreneurs to figure out how to build a company around their product idea and providing the support to validate and access the marketplace, capital, investment and or talent,” Steve says.“With the Connect network, we had  early stage companies or entrepreneurs engaged in our programmes last year. There is a lot of exciting and vibrant activity going on at the moment.”And it was Connect, which Steve founded and developed at Catalyst, which first drew him back home to his native Northern Ireland, following years of running and founding tech firms in the West Coast of the US.“I was an entrepreneur in Calornia for a number of years, in San Francisco and San Diego. I was there for the peak of the dot coms,” he said.That included his own start-up business, Kineticom, as well as other tech companies. It was his time in San Diego which resonated strongly with Steve.“Personally, I became obsessed with the San Diego story and the parallels to Northern Ireland. When they started on their journey in , San Diego had a population of . million people, % of their economy was dependent on the public sector. They have an ocean to one side, a mountain range around them and another country to the bottom of them.”San Diego went from the bottom of every league table to the top – with the collaboration of top universities, research and development and entrepreneurship, building the city into the tech stalwart it is now.The Connect  emanated from San Diego – a concept which help shaped the programme in Northern Ireland.“Meeting Norman Apsley at the Science Park was just the most beautul thing ever,” Steve says.The financial and economic impact and contribution that Catalyst has is hard to ignore. It’s estimated the businesses which operate there contribute around £m in GVA each year.“Everything we do is based on the simple belief that innovation has the power to transform our economy. People around the world are all innovating quickly, adapting new technologies, articial intelligence, for example. In Northern Ireland,people are producing goods and services, but are behind in adopting those new technologies, our economy is going to be in trouble as we will not be competitive.“The question is, how does innovation become the foundation on which everything is based ”And as a result of Catalyst’s research into the NI Knowledge Economy, an annual report published later this month, which acknowledges the huge changes to the workplace in the coming year, Catalyst is hosting their second Future of Work summit in May  – aimed at demystying how roles and traditional jobs are changing, right across the Knowledge Economy sectors.Of course, Brexit is still on the horizon. For Steve, the main concern is around the availability of talent. “The tech sector is hungry for talent, but with the uncertainty in the last couple of years, fewer people have been willing to consider moving to Northern Ireland. That places a lot of pressure on the existing employees in the sector.”“Long-term, we have to be optimistic and look at the opportunities which can come out of Brexit. The businesses within the Knowledge Economy are export driven, representing over % of all NI exports. With % of these exports outside the EU, the Knowledge Economy is the sector least dependent on Europe and should be the key for driving growth at this time of uncertainty.”So, for Steve, his level of optimism and dynamism is clear in his new role, one which he says he is “very fortunate” to have.“It’s a position which comes around so rarely, and whoever gets the opportunity is so blessed and fortunate to have the opportunity to lead. We have a talented team of people who are all passionate about what is possible. It’s so exciting. The opportunities and possibilities are endless.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/323433.jpg","title":"theresa mays brexit deal voted down business reaction","story":"Posted on Wednesday  January  by John Mulgrew Business groups have overwhelmingly raised concerns over crashing out of the EU without a deal after Prime Minister Theresa May’s withdrawal plan with Brussels was overwhelmingly rejected by MPs. Ann McGregor, chief executive of Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry “The business communities that we represent have always had a erse range of views on what form the UK’s future relationship with the EU should take, however they do agree on the need to avoid a messy and disorderly Brexit. “To achieve this we therefore need an agreement that will secure the transition period and protect jobs. As businesses wait to see what happens next in Parliament, it is crucial that those at Westminster move beyond tactical manoeuvring and look at all the options in order to avoid a ‘no deal’s scenario. “Firms are in the dark on too many aspects of le after March . This has already led to many businesses taking action – pausing on recruitment and investment, stockpiling goods, and relocating factories in other parts of the EU. In fact, a third of NI Chamber members are currently putting growth and investment plans on hold in the absence of clarity from Westminster. There is however nothing to stop government acting decisively on areas within their control, such as migration and customs procedures.”  Aodhan Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium “The result this evening will be a cause for concern across the Northern Ireland business community. Northern Ireland businesses desperately need certainty about the UK’s future trading relationship with the EU and will be severely disadvantaged by a no deal. A no deal Brexit means that Northern Ireland households will face higher prices and less choice on the shelves something they can ill afford. “Se need politicians  to coalesce around a workable solution that protects consumers from the costs and disruptions due to the loss of tarf-free and frictionless trade we currently enjoy with partners in the EU. We are now closer than ever to the possibility of a no-deal that will be a disaster for Northern Ireland.” “  Angela McGowan, CBI Northern Ireland director “Every business will feel no deal is hurtling closer. A new plan is needed immediately. This is now a time for our politicians to make history as leaders. All MPs need to reflect on the need for compromise and to act at speed to protect the UKs economy. “No deal would immediately put Northern Irish jobs and businesses at risk and jeopardise years of positive economic development and integration across the island.  It must be avoided to protect our all-island economy.”  Glyn Roberts, Retail NI chief executive “This is a disappointing but not unexpected result. While the Prime Minister’s draft Withdrawal Bill was in no way perfect, it was definitely preferable to crashing out of the EU with no deal. “The Government now needs to work on a cross-party basis with Labour and other opposition parties to reach a broader agreement for a withdrawal deal and secure the transition period, protect jobs and a positive future relationship with the EU  Colin Neill, chief executive, Hospitality Ulster “Leaving the EU without a deal would damage the sustainability of the Hospitality industry and impact on the potential growth of Tourism in Northern Ireland. We appeal to our elected representatives to work together in a spirit of consensus government to ensure that a no deal scenario does not happen.”  Tina McKenzie, FSB NI policy chair “With the clock ticking down to Brexit Day in just  weeks, we are running out of time to avoid a clf-edge, no-deal outcome. “A disorderly exit from the EU would be deeply damaging for small businesses, causing disruption to supply chains, increasing costs and stling investment. “A no-deal is something which we simply cannot countenance, so it is imperative that political leaders sharpen their focus and do all they can to reach agreement in the short time available.”  View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"no deal brexit could cost ni economy bn by ","story":"Posted on Monday  January  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland’s economy could suffer a £bn drop in output by  in the event of a ‘no deal’ Brexit, it’s been claimed.

The CBI calculates this could amount to an annual loss of output worth almost £bn by , based on today’s prices. It says “manufacturing activity is particularly important in Northern Ireland, and the agri-food sector, which employs thousands, is likely to be severely impacted as it is particularly exposed to the risk of higher tarfs and trade costs”. Angela McGowan, Northern Ireland director of the CBI, said: “CBI members across Northern Ireland are clear:the new approach to finding a Brexit deal continues to be a game of who blinks first, the Northern Irish economy will pay the price. “The deadlock will only be broken by a genuine attempt by all MPs to find consensus and compromise, not stick to rusting red lines and political conditions. Like the rest of the UK, Northern Ireland is not – and cannot be – ready for no deal. “The projected impact on our economy would be devastating and while business will do all it can to reduce some of the worst aspects, a no deal scenario is unmanageable. “The message from the CBI to our politicians is clear – we must see compromise or the whole country faces the unforgivable prospect of a disorderly Brexit which will affect jobs and livelihoods in Northern Ireland for decades to come. It’s time to put prosperity before party politics and dogma.”  View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Air-1.jpg","title":"eight part belfast made airbus passenger jets delivered","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by John Mulgrew Eight part-Belfast made Bombardier Airbus passenger jets were delivered at the end of last year – bringing the total number to  during .

We tell client’s stories through engaging content written by former journalists – grab their customers’ attention with stunning design, maximise conversions by using the latest digital marketing expertise, and develop websites which are living, breathing, online stores or shop windows. As content director, my role is to bring almost  years’ experience in journalism, political communications, corporate PR, crisis management and digital content crafting to Grofuse. How did the business start and how has it grown The business was created by a fusion of expertise to achieve sales growth, including experienced digital marketers, PR consultants, web developers, software developers, graphic designers, illustrators and motion designers. I co-founded the company with expert digital marketer Denis Finnegan who has spent  years fuelling online lead generation for businesses. Growth has been swt over the last  months. We’ve employed an effective combination of marketing efforts and created fans of our existing clients.What is your background I’m a seasoned hack, having worked in print journalism for almost  years followed by a few years as a political communications adviser. I spent a brief period teaching English and history at secondary level before entering a newsroom. The working environments were poles apart in terms pace, excitement and... language choices. As a school pupil and university student, I worked on building sites, supermarkets, farms, bars, bread delivery vans, a bakery and even a bacon factory kill-line. However, I had never encountered such flurries of expletives as I did in newsrooms. Great places to work. High pressure, tight deadlines and great target-setting – a superb way to fuel productivity in any work environment.What do you do dferently from your competition and what are your strengths Clear communication with our clients is our greatest strength. We listen intently to what our clients’ goals are, take time to learn about their products and gain full understanding of their ideal customers. We start with a blank canvass and devise bespoke digital strategies to fuel each client’s business growth by engaging their target market effectively and delivering genuine sales leads that are easily quantiable.Who are your main customers Our customers operate across a wide range of sectors. We are currently working with clients across the UK and Ireland, US, France and Spain. Do you have a target in mind in terms of where you want the business to grow We are currently focusing the bulk of our efforts on the island of Ireland with a particular focus on Dublin and Belfast. What challenges have you faced The somewhat ‘snake-oil industry’ reputation of digital marketing sometimes poses a barrier to speaking with decision makers who in the past have invested with little . However, once we’re given an opportunity, we like to let the results do the talking. Who most inspires you Those who thrive in the face of adversity and have strong growth mind-sets. The type of person with the right measure of accountability, skill and relentlessness to inspire their teams to achieve targets. It’s a mind-set akin to that of a top athlete whose body is screaming ‘slow down’ in the business end of a race but whose mind interprets that as a cue to go faster. My we Martina – a former operations manager with Lidl Ireland who co-founded and runs leading human resources consultancy, HR Team – has these qualities in abundance. She inspires me in everything I do.Where do you see yourself in the next few years I love living and working in the North West. Whatever people like to call Derry or Londonderry, it’s a very special place with a lot of talent and a big future in driving the cross-border regional economy. With our headquarters at Catalyst Inc and plans underway for satellite offices in Dublin and the UK, we want to ensure our agency plays a part in shaping that economic prosperity with the provision of more high-quality jobs for the area.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
