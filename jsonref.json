I need ammunition, not a ride,” he said, demonstrating from the beginning of the war a penchant for memorable soundbites.Zelenskiy’s gifts as a performer before entering politics have been apparent as he exhorts his fellow Ukrainians to resist the Russian invasion while cajoling the international community to do more.He is now among the most recognisable people in the world, but in 2017, when he visited Ireland, nobody outside the Ukrainian and Russian-speaking communities knew who he was.The ones who did know filled the TLT Theatre in Drogheda for a one-off show on November 4th, 2017. “He was the number one star in Ukraine, ” said the promoter Nick Levchenko who brought him to Ireland.Levchenko has been living in Ireland for 22 years. Before the pandemic, he made his living as a promoter with his company Zavedenie Events putting on discos and shows for Ireland’s Eastern European community, mostly those who have Russian as their first language.Occasionally he would bring over stars of Russian and Ukrainian TV and they did not come much bigger than Zelenskiy at the time. In 2015, Zelenskiy’s comedy drama Servant of the People was first shown on Ukrainian TV. It featured a lowly history teacher whose rant about the state of the country is secretly filmed by a pupil. The rant goes viral and the Zelenskiy character becomes an accidental president.Art imitated life when Zelenskiy became Ukrainian president in 2019, but there was no talk of him running for office when he visited Ireland in 2017.Zelenskiy brought his team with him from his production company Kvartal 95 for a song and dance revue. Video footage from the night shows they got a great reception from the crowd which was mostly Ukrainian, but also Russian and from the ex-Soviet Union countries. The concert was performed in Russian, Zelenskiy’s first language.“The concert sold out very quickly. The response from the Ukrainian community was huge. It was a dream come through that he came to Ireland,” says Levchenko.“All the people were just happy to be there. They didn’t want to leave after the concert. They hugged each and sang songs. They felt very proud after the gig.”The concert ended up with a rap duet between Zelenskiy and Eugene Koshovy, his co-star in Servant of the People. The song had political overtones. Ukraine was compared to a woman Russia to an overbearing man.Zelenskiy’s patriotism was apparent at the time, the promoter recalled. “He always promoted Ukraine. He had been talking for a long time about corruption in Ukraine. He wanted to bring peace in Ukraine. The song is all about politics. The whole audience stood at the end and applauded him.”Afterwards Zelenskiy and the other performers signed an Irish flag which they took back to Ukraine with them.Zelenskiy and his wife Olena spent three more days in Ireland. Levchenko took the pair around Dublin where they visited the Guinness Store House and a few pubs. Zelenskiy was impressed with Áras an Uachtaráin, recalls Levchenko, and how accessible Irish politicians seemed to be to the Irish public.They then drove west to the Cliffs of Moher where the couple met more delighted Ukrainian expatriates.“Ireland seemed to him like a magical place with all different houses and different colours. He liked to see the people with smiling faces. He was very happy to be in Ireland. I am not just saying it but he was very keen to come to Ireland.”He was taken by Ireland, Levchenko says, and expressed a desire to return some day.He will get a different reception when he addresses the Dáil on Wednesday. He has become the personification of his country’s resistance to Russian aggression.Levchenko says he was honoured to act as Zelenskiy’s election agent in Ireland in 2019. The community abroad has a vote in that election.He hopes that Zelenskiy will thank the Irish people for taking in refugees and for the support of the Irish Government which is providing humanitarian support.“He is an incredible person.

Video: ReutersUkainian president Volodymyr Zelensky (centre) visits the town of Bucha, northwest of the Ukrainian capital Kyiv on April 4th. Photograph: STRAFP via Getty ImagesUkrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Monday it had become harder for his country to negotiate with Russia since Kyiv became aware of the scale of atrocities carried out by Russian troops in Ukraine.Mr Zelenskiy spoke on national television from the town of Bucha in the Kyiv region, where tied bodies shot at close range, a mass grave and other signs of executions have been found in territory retaken from Russian troops.Moscow has denied any accusations related to the killing of civilians in Bucha.“These are war crimes and will be recognised by the world as genocide,” Zelenskiy said, wearing body armour and surrounded by military personnel.“It’s very difficult to talk when you see what they’ve done here,” he said. “The longer the Russian Federation drags out the negotiating process, the worse it is for them and for this situation and for this war.”“We know of thousands of people killed and tortured, with severed limbs, raped women and murdered children,” he said.After Mr Zelenskiy spoke, Ukrainian officials took journalists to the basement of what they said was a summer residence for children and showed them the bodies of five men with their hands tied behind their backs.The officials said the five people, who all wore civilian clothes, had been killed by occupying Russian soldiers before Ukrainian troops retook control of the town.“They were shot, shot either in their head or in their chest. They were tortured before they were killed,” said Anton Herashchenko, an adviser to the Ukrainian interior ministry.“Now we are investigating this and we show (it) to the international press.”He said Russian soldiers had set up camp inside the building and stayed there for three weeks.Reuters could not independently verify his account.Bucha’s deputy mayor said on Sunday that 50 residents had been victims of extra-judicial killings carried out by Russian troops.In nearby Stoianka, about 15km south of Bucha, Mr Zelenskiy surveyed the damage to a motorway bridge which was almost split in two. One car stood abandoned, bulletholes peppering its bodywork and windscreen. A nearby housing estate was flattened and advertising hoardings were scarred with bulletholes.Russia denies targeting civilians since invading Ukraine on February 24th in what it calls a “special military operation” aimed at demilitarising and “denazifying” Ukraine. Ukraine says it was invaded without provocation.The Kremlin on Monday denied any accusations related to the murder of civilians in Bucha.“This information must be seriously questioned,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters. “From what we have seen, our experts have identified signs of video falsification and other fakes.”The destruction and civilian deaths in Bucha look set to galvanise the United States and Europe into additional sanctions against Moscow, with officials raising the prospect of restrictions on Russia’s energy exports.“The world has already seen many war crimes. At different times. On different continents. But it is time to do everything possible to make the war crimes of the Russian military the last manifestation of such evil on earth,” Mr Zelenskiy said in a video address on Sunday, adding that actions would be considered by the UN Security Council at a meeting on Tuesday.Iryna Venedyktova, Ukraine’s prosecutor-general, said 410 bodies of civilians had been recovered from the Kyiv region.Images of charred corpses and reports of mass graves have prompted the EU to prepare more sanctions against Russia, with European Council president Charles Michel saying new measures were “on their way” following the Russian retreat from Bucha.The Ukrainian army said it had retaken more territory from Russian forces, reclaiming a village near Chernihiv, about 150km northeast of the capital, and Pripyat outside the Chernobyl nuclear reactor, about 150km northwest of Kyiv.But the military warned that Russia would continue to attack critical infrastructure, particularly in the besieged port city of Mariupol, and in Odesa, which was targeted at the weekend.Rocket attacksThe mayor of Mykolayiv, Oleksandr Senkevych, said Russian troops launched several rocket attacks on the southern city early on Monday.US officials and leaders from across the EU condemned the reports from Bucha and other areas near the capital, with Richard Moore, head of the UK intelligence service MI6, saying “we knew Putin’s invasion plans included summary executions by his military and intelligence services”.China, which has refused to condemn Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, offered a muted response on Monday. State media did not mention the alleged killings, and posts on Chinese social media by prominent bloggers questioned the veracity of the reports.Russia’s ministry of defence denied the accusations, saying they were a “provocation” designed by Ukraine for western media.Mr Zelenskiy vowed that a “mechanism of justice” would be formed by the foreign affairs ministry, the prosecutor-general’s office and other branches of government to help “bring to concrete justice those who unleashed or in any way participated in crimes against our people”.Mr Zelenskiy also criticised former western leaders who were slow to react to Mr Putin’s aggression and had offered too many concessions to the Russian president for more than a decade.“More conclusions are needed. Not only about Russia, but also about the political behaviour that actually allowed this evil to come to our land,” he said.‘Fake attack’Meanwhile, Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said on Monday that Ukraine’s version of what happened in the town of Bucha was a “fake attack” aimed at undermining Moscow, the TASS news agency reported.Mr Lavrov said the dead bodies were “staged” and that images of them and what he said was Ukraine’s false version of events had been spread on social media by Western countries and Ukraine.Russia’s top diplomat also called on Britain, which holds the presidency of the UN Security Council for April, to fulfil its responsibilities in that role after it rejected a Russian request to convene a meeting over Bucha.The Kremlin said on Monday it categorically denied any accusations related to the murder of civilians in Bucha and said Ukrainian allegations on the matter should be treated with doubt.“This information must be seriously questioned,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said. Mr Peskov said that Russia’s diplomats would press on with their efforts to convene a UN Security Council meeting to discuss what Moscow has called “Ukrainian provocations” in Bucha despite their first effort to arrange such a meeting being blocked.Humanitarian corridorTaras Schevchenko (43) said Russian soldiers had refused to allow men to leave through a humanitarian corridor, instead shooting at them as they fled across an open field.Bodies, he said, were scattered on the pavements, with some of those killed having been “squashed by tanks, like animal skin rugs”.Mr Shevchenko’s mother, Yevdokia (77) said she had witnessed an elderly man who had challenged a Russian soldier being shot dead as his wife stood next to him. “They shot him dead, and ordered the woman to leave,” she said. The accounts could not be independently verified.Reporters from Agence France-Presse saw at least 20 bodies, all in civilian clothing, strewn across a single street in the town of Bucha on Friday. One had his hands tied behind his back with a white cloth, and his Ukrainian passport left open beside his body.“All these people were shot,” Bucha’s mayor, Anatoly Fedoruk, told AFP, adding that a further 280 bodies had been buried in mass graves in the town.The UN secretary general, Antonio Guterres, said: “I am deeply shocked by the images of civilians killed in Bucha, Ukraine. It is essential that an independent investigation leads to effective accountability.”War crimesUK prime minister, Boris Johnson, said the killings added to evidence of Russian war crimes, while the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, expressed shock about the “terrible and horrifying” footage from Bucha.Streets littered with bodies. Bodies buried in makeshift conditions. There is talk of women, children and the elderly among the victims,” Mr Scholz said.The British ambassador to Ukraine, Melinda Simmons, said it was clear that rape had been used as a weapon of war by Russian forces. She said: “Women raped in front of their kids, girls in front of their families, as a deliberate act of subjugation. Rape is a war crime.”The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, described the killings at Bucha as “a punch to the gut” and joined western allies in vowing to document the atrocities to hold the perpetrators to account.The head of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said she was “appalled by reports of unspeakable horrors in areas from which Russia is withdrawing”. An independent investigation was urgently needed, she said, and “perpetrators of war crimes will be held accountable”. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2022.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Decades of progress overshadowed by Putin crackdowns and confrontation with WestRussia\u0026rsquos land of the midnight sun said to have inspired creator of Chanel No. 5Atomic icebreakers and floating power plants to help Kremlin develop Arctic shipping routeMinority nations feel squeeze as Putin\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquopower vertical\u0026rsquo crushes republics\u0026rsquo autonomyHistory of bloodshed and tragedy haunts stunning region shared by Muslims and ChristiansOil wealth and new mosque and churches help keep Tatarstan on Kremlin\u0027s sideOfficials claim West wants to \u0026lsquoGermanise\u0026rsquo and instil special identity in strategic regionNato monitors heavily armed Kaliningrad as locals long for borders to reopenAttack on renowned Memorial rights group deepens opposition anger and international alarmSaint Petersburg Letter: Russia\u0026rsquos old imperial capital celebrates 200 years since birth of Crime and Punishment creatorEnergy giant hopes vast forests will offset carbon costs and ease green transitionCircassian heritage trampled and property rows continue as Winter Olympics city boomsKremlin criticised as most Russians reject vaccination and hospitals face huge strainKremlin changes tack on global warming and looks to vast forests to offset emissionsRussia and Japan co-operate on Sakhalin despite row over nearby Kuril islandsIndustry and struggling communities fear wildlife support could stifle Far East developmentCity with echoes of San Francisco is thrillingly original, yet tarnished by graft and neglectGrowing energy, security and diplomatic links between Moscow and Beijing worry WestDecembrist rebels and their aristocratic wives embraced \u0026lsquoreal Russia\u0026rsquo in Siberian exileFears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo roleInside Russia: More protests planned as officials reject calls to address e-voting complaintsMoscow Letter: Poet\u0026rsquos statue has been a magnet for generations of Russian dissentersOn the eve of an expected sham election, many of Putin\u0026rsquos political opponents are already jailed or dead"},{"url":null,"title":"young africans","story":"\u0026lsquoEntertainment is such a good way to bring forth change,\u0026rsquo says play\u0026rsquos narratorPhenomenal success of Nigerian artists is bringing both opportunities and criticismAuthors are tackling topics from transgender rights to Islamic extremism, and picking up plenty of awardsTom Saater has a rags to riches story and a unique insight into Nigeria\u0026rsquos biggest cityIn one of the world\u0026rsquos most dangerous places to attend school, teachers lead lessons and the students comeAfrican country\u0026rsquos tech innovators call for international investment and domestic supportYoung Nigerians dance out onto world stage with pride, confidence and high ambitionWomen-led organisation aims to stop atrocities of dictatorship from reoccurringIn the Gambia, a flourishing comedy scene is used to convey serious messagesStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"putin found god","story":"It was a sodden spring day in May 2009. A small group of men trooped solemnly across a leafy cemetery in central Moscow. The priest in flowing black robes was Archimandrite (Abbot) Tikhon Shevkunov of the Sretensky Monastery. Obligingly, he held a black umbrella over his honoured guest, President Vladimir Putin.Much of the graveyard was filled with victims of the Soviet secret police, the Cheka, but it was not they he had come to see. The president was there to pay his respects to a philosopher called Ivan Ilyin, whose body had on his orders been dug up in Switzerland four years before and flown 1,400 miles to be reinterred in Moscow. He laid a bouquet of red roses before the black granite headstone and stood with Tikhon a short time, regarding the grave. Then he left.This week, across Russia, devastated families also gathered to honour the dead. They were burying young men killed fighting for Moscow in Ukraine. At one funeral witnessed by The Moscow Times, the priest spoke of the deceased, a lad in his 20s: “He fought against evil, Satanic spirits: Ukrainian Nazis, created by American multinational corporations.”The young man in the coffin was separated by 80 years from the remains of Ilyin in that Moscow cemetery, but according to the Kremlin’s increasingly strident ideological creed, the dead shared one important feature: they were part of the same God-given mission to gather up the scattered lands of mother Russia and rebuild its Christian empire.Putin doesn’t strike most of us as the pious type. He wears a £10,500 coat, reportedly owns a £500 million superyacht and is known the world over for vaguely homoerotic, topless photoshoots. He is brutal to the point of being labelled a madman or a psychopath. He spent the first 16 years of his career fulfilling a childhood ambition to work for the KGB, the secret police of a regime that persecuted Christians and preached atheism. And he is, in the words of various Western leaders and scholars, a “war criminal”.Yet somehow, this billionaire Soviet gangster has become a leader beloved by the Russian Orthodox Church, held up as an ideal by a messianic, neo-fascist movement called Eurasianism and presented by his propaganda machine as the man who will establish the Third Rome of Christendom in Russia.Western analysis, trapped in its own worldview, has tended to focus on arguments about Nato, the EU, resources or spheres of influence in the search for Putin’s rationale. But this misses that the war in Ukraine is a conflict with an overwhelmingly religious and cultural dimension, in which the Ukrainian government is cast as a malignant tool of Satanic and degenerate Western forces. The Russian takeover of this land was to be the start of a great revival of the ancient Russian civilisation, welcomed by its virtuous Slavic inhabitants, and signal a precipitous decline for the decadent, doomed West.Somehow, while most of the West wasn’t paying attention, Russia’s nostalgia for Soviet greatness merged into a longing for the imperial father-king, the tsar, and Putin duly transformed himself from a ruthless but boring state functionary into a modern approximation of the old autocrat: an infallible messenger of God in Aviators. But how did this happen, how did it help to justify a bloody invasion of Ukraine and what will happen now that the venture has stalled and Russia is teetering on the cusp of bankruptcy?Growing up poor in a dingy Leningrad tower block, Putin spent his youth chasing rats around the stairwell and dreaming of a future as a KGB strongman. He joined the secret police straight out of university, but it was not exactly a 007 existence. His first posting was in Dresden, a relative backwater in Soviet East Germany.Accounts differ as to what exactly he was doing there – grooming agents to smuggle Western technology, fostering the growth of anti-Western terrorists or more humdrum work. Whatever Putin was up to, it gave him a front row seat on the collapse of the Soviet Union. After witnessing the crumpling of East Germany’s Soviet government, he returned to St Petersburg (then Leningrad) to see the Soviet motherland succumb to the same disease.When and how he left the KGB has never been entirely clear, but Putin quickly made himself indispensable to a wide array of politicians and officials. He moved from a job working for Anatoly Sobchak, the St Petersburg deputy mayor seen at the time as a pro-democracy liberal, to a role at the Kremlin, where he won President Boris Yeltsin’s favour through mastery of his brief and zealous loyalty.But when Yeltsin passed on the reins in 2000, he handed over a country that had just been through a calamitous economic depression, during which its economy halved in size, inflation took off, the ruble was devalued and the state went bankrupt. This was to be the experience that many Russians now associate with their brief period of “democracy”.Still, Putin quickly disappointed his authoritarian fans by adopting a firmly pro-Western stance, in particular supporting the US invasion of Afghanistan after 911. Russia’s economy, buoyed by a rising oil price, recovered, and US president George W Bush declared that he had peered into Putin’s “soul” and seen a good man.Even back then, Father Tikhon was no ordinary, run-of-the-mill Orthodox priest. Rumoured to be the man who brought Putin to Christianity and hears his confessions, he was also a rising star of a new generation of conservative imperialists in the Church, who openly advocate a return to Russia’s monarchist days. “He’s a very conservative cleric with an imperial mindset,” says Lukin.One way of forgetting is to reach back beyond the Soviet era to a much older period of history. In that vein, in 2008 Father Tikhon released a documentary on the collapse of the Byzantine Empire, called The Lesson of Byzantium. The film purports to be a straightforward history of the empire, although in interviews Tikhon admitted that it is also “propaganda” aimed at giving Russians a place in history and a spiritual mission.The 70-minute film argues that Byzantium collapsed primarily because it failed to stay true to the Orthodox faith and abandoned a highly centralised model of imperial control that stamped out nationalist separatism. Instead it succumbed to the oligarchy, Italian finance and corrupting Western notions about the primacy of the inidual over the collective.Still, the empire did pass on an invaluable treasure to the Russian people: their Orthodox Christianity. “It was upon this treasure our forebears founded not banks… or pawnshops,” Tikhon preaches. “They founded Rus, the spiritual successor of Byzantium.” The “forebear” to whom he refers is, in fact, Prince Volodymyr (or Vladimir) of Kiev, a Viking ruler of a region encompassing much of modern Ukraine, who was baptised by Byzantine priests in the 10th century. Ukraine, in this reading, is simply relabelled as ancient Russia.Despite its obscure subject, Tikhon’s film was a runaway success, reportedly sparking more than 500 articles, many hours of radio and TV coverage as well as conferences and speeches. Fans of the film declared that Moscow must rediscover an ancient tsarist tradition of seeing itself as the Third Rome of Christendom.By 2013, the year before his invasion of Crimea, Putin himself took part in a state-produced follow-up film called The Second Christianisation of Rus, which positioned Russia’s post-Soviet surge of interest in Christianity as a second iteration of Volodymyr’s original conversion to Eastern Orthodoxy. The next year, in the midst of Russia’s annexation of Crimea, state TV aired a reading of an essay by Fyodor Dostoevsky chastising Slavic tribes who were ungrateful to mother Russia. In addition to being a brilliant novelist, Dostoevsky was also a committed monarchist who believed that Russia would one day reconquer the Byzantine capital Constantinople (modern-day Istanbul).In truth, according to Peter Eltsov, a professor of security studies at the US National Defence University, this obsession with Byzantium was hardly an ancient tradition: “It’s a 19th century invention.” The idea of Russia’s spiritual Byzantine roots took off in this period as an explicit bulwark against the break-up of empire, just as the notion of national identity was taking hold in Europe. As the anti-Western, monarchist philosopher Konstantin Leontiev argued: “Whether we like this Byzantine foundation or not, whether it is good or bad, it is the only secure anchor not only of Russian but of all-Slavic preservation.”In both Putin’s 2021 essay and 2022 presidential address on the invasion of Ukraine, there are clear echoes of the same strategy, appealing to an ancient religious bond between the peoples of Russia and Ukraine as a justification for war: “Ukraine is not just a neighbouring country for us. It is an inalienable part of our own history, culture and spiritual space,” Putin wrote in 2021. “Since time immemorial, the people living in the south west of what has historically been Russian land have called themselves Russians and Orthodox Christians.”The Eastern Orthodox Church, in other words, is a way to stitch the Russian Empire together.The heritage of Byzantium Rus was not the only idea to emerge in the dying days of the tsarist era with the aim of countering the appeal of the Western nation-state. Alongside a soup of conservative, religious and exceptionalist ideas of Russia, a new breed of Russian fascism was being developed. And that is where we return to our disinterred friend, Ivan Ilyin.Ilyin was a conservative philosopher exiled from communist Russia for his opposition to the Bolsheviks. He washed up in Berlin just as the new ideology of fascism was taking off in Italy and Germany. Ilyin saw in Mussolini and Hitler models for the reinvention of a new Russian tsarism, in which a strong leader could abolish the iniduality of his people and bind them into one spiritual, collective whole, free of corruption and impurities.Putin is clearly no philosopher, but of all the intellectuals in Russian history, it is Ilyin whom he quotes the most. According to the Yale historian Timothy Snyder, just as troops were being readied to invade Crimea in 2014, the Kremlin arranged for all of Russia’s senior officials and regional governors to be sent a copy of Ilyin’s Our Tasks, in which the philosopher predicts the emergence of a “national dictator” who will be “the living organ of Russia”.Today, the task of popularising this sort of messianic fascism falls to a movement called Eurasianism, propounded by a zealous supporter of Putin named Aleksandr Dugin, who appears with regularity on Russian TV screens. Russia must rediscover itself as a Eurasian civilisation, according to Dugin, which means that it must impose upon the continent a new political model that is collectivist, religious and autocratic. For this task, he maintains, conquest of the old Russian Empire is essential.Like Ilyin, Dugin casts this battle in apocalyptic and moral terms. He claims that it falls to Russia to save the world from Western degeneracy and nihilism, evidenced by phenomena like gay marriage and the transgender debate. In this, Dugin is at one with the Russian Orthodox Church.On March 6, 10 days after the invasion had begun, Patriarch Kirill gave a sermon calling the war “a metaphysical struggle”. It was essential for Russia to intervene, he said, to combat the “so-called values” offered by the West, in which “you have to have a Gay Pride parade” to be a member of the club.Putin, in his presidential address on the eve of the war, likewise blamed the West for trying “to destroy our traditional values” and replace them with “attitudes that are directly leading to degradation and degeneration, because they are contrary to human nature”.But the hostility to Gay Pride is not just ideological. The opposition to anything seen to undermine the family, like feminism or homosexuality, is mixed up with a more worldly anxiety that Professor Eltsov believes is driving the war: demographic change.Like much of Europe, Russia is undergoing a significant demographic shift. Its Muslim population is having more babies than its Christian population and, by some projections, Russia could become a majority-Muslim country in the foreseeable future. By taking over Ukraine, using largely ethnic minority, non-Christian conscripts as cannon fodder, Eltsov says “the idea was to get a bunch – 40 million people – who are Slavs and Europeans”.In his 2008 film on Byzantium, Tikhon had explicitly linked the failure to have children and the rise of abortion to the empire’s spiritual decline and “demographic problem”. The obvious result, he noted, while showing footage of a modern Istanbul student smoking a cigarette, was that the city succumbed to Sulton Mehmed, a homosexual 21-year-old, who, in his telling, demanded the 14-year-old son of its governor as a lover immediately after his conquest.Aside from demography, the Church’s anxiety has been exacerbated further in recent years by a direct threat to its authority: a schism.In 2018, the chief patriarch of the Eastern Orthodox Church, Bartholomew I of Constantinople, decided to recognise a new, independent Ukrainian Orthodox Church. At a stroke, Ukrainian Christians were taken out from under Russian religious authority, changing an arrangement that had existed for centuries. Patriarch Kirill immediately cut all ties with Constantinople – the very seat of Byzantine Christianity from which Russia supposedly derives its entire spiritual heritage.In a letter written to fellow Orthodox churches in mid-March this year, Kirill blamed the West for the war and emphasised that “the peoples of Russia and Ukraine, who came from one Kievan baptismal font, are united by common faith, common saints and prayers, and share common historical fate”. Kirill and his fellow clerics believed that the Ukrainian government had deliberately engineered the schism, and began to push for measures to undo this calamity with increasing urgency.The Church was not the only authority feeling threatened by developments outside Russia. Putin himself moved further and further away from the liberal values he had talked about in the 1990s in response to a series of challenges. At first, he cracked down on Russia’s oligarch-owned media to avoid criticism of his mistakes, like his poor handling of the 2001 sinking of the Kursk submarine, in which 118 crewmen died, and the security services’ mismanagement of a 2002 terrorist siege in a Moscow theatre, which resulted in 170 people dying.After that, the Arab Spring and the colour revolutions spreading across Eastern Europe unsettled the aspiring dictator. Faced with the need to legitimise his rule and consolidate power, he turned to the Church and the useful hodgepodge of imperialist, autocratic ideas floating around Russian military and intellectual circles. It wasn’t long before his regime was televising footage of priests sprinkling holy water over missiles bound for Syria.Unfortunately, he appears to have spent too much time drinking his own Kool-Aid. He convinced himself that the story told about the ancient, spiritual union of the Russian and Ukrainian peoples was true. If Russia were bold enough to regather the land, the lost Russians of Kiev would soon come flocking back to the bosom of the motherland.Still, there is not yet a general sense in Russia that the war and its consequences threaten Putin’s grip on the country. Sergey Utkin, a scholar of international relations at the Russian Academy of Sciences, is one of the few Russian academics brave enough openly to state his opposition to the war. But he does not believe speaking out will change anything. Hostility to the West is too deeply embedded to dissipate and ordinary Russians will simply blame Nato for the impact of sanctions, he believes. “What’s happening is catastrophic for Russia. It’s not opposition to what’s happening, but the nature of what’s happening that will reveal it was a terrible idea,” he says.Nor are Western ideas likely to make inroads. Utkin used to call himself a liberal, but he has found “realist” models of international relations, like Samuel Huntingdon’s Clash of Civilisations, better predict the course of events. Similarly, Lukin says he is disillusioned by Western hypocrisy over Iraq and its mismanagement of Covid: “I used to be a pro-western guy but now I am very disappointed with the West… I’m thinking more and more about the China model as most suitable.”Over in the US, however, Eltsov, a native Russian who grew up in Leningrad, sees the war as a pivotal turning point not just for Putin, but for Russia as we know it. His 2019 book, The Long Telegram 2.0, argues that for all of the weird and wonderful dogmas promoted by the Kremlin, from Byzantium Rus to Eurasian fascism, at the base of it all is “absolute cynicism”. There is no truly unified Russian identity that could be held together by these ideas if the region weren’t ruled by a brutal autocrat, he argues, and sooner or later – sooner, given the impact of sanctions – he thinks Russia is likely to break up.The prospect is surely stomach-churning, I suggest, given that Moscow controls the world’s second-biggest arsenal of nukes in the world. But Eltsov points out that a similar problem was resolved after the break-up of the Soviet Union. “It’s solvable,” he says, “but it’s frightening.” The future, he believes, lies not with Putin’s new Holy Russian Empire, but with the fragmentation of Eurasia. “Russia is over,” he says. “It’s the beginning of the end.”More from NewsUS Secret Service rents $30,000 a month California mansion to protect Hunter BidenRussia-Ukraine latest news: Putin regroups \u0026#39tens of thousands\u0026#39 of troops for assault on eastern regionsBucha killings: ‘We brought the dead here because the dogs were trying to eat them’Becoming transgender a sacred journey of becoming whole, says ex-Archbishop of CanterburyThe EU can’t win in its eternal battle against Hungary’s PM, Viktor Orban‘Boozy’ leaving do for woman who wrote Covid rules leads to ‘partygate’ finesMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"dan walker leaves bbc channel 5 talent exodus continues","story":"Dan Walker will leave the BBC for Channel 5, becoming the latest high-profile figure to join an exodus of talent from the corporation.  The BBC Breakfast presenter has announced that he is leaving his £295,000-a-year role to become lead anchor on 5 News, with his exit following those of Andrew Marr, Jon Sopel and Emily Maitlis.The exodus comes amid shrinking wages at the BBC, insiders said, as well as efforts to clamp down on moonlighting by requiring stars declare earnings from paid work outside the broadcaster.It has been suggested big-name talents facing salary reductions of up to 10 per cent may be frustrated at having to disclose how they bolster their incomes outside the BBC. Mr Walker, a former Football Focus presenter, was last year included on the first register of staff earnings from outside engagements, alongside Mr Marr and Ms Maitlis.It is understood he will have a more bespoke role at Channel 5 and encouraged to help pitch and create new programmes. The channel has said he can expect hosting roles on a slate of new shows.Mr Walker said the chance to do something different was too good to turn down, adding: I love their ideas and creativity, and it\u0027s rare to get an opportunity like this where paths and ambitions meet.He will continue in his role as BBC Breakfast in the short-term, with a leaving date yet to be announced by the BBC.A source at the corporation said: People come, people go, but we have lots of existing talent and new and emerging stars, and there is always a natural point where people move on.Richard Frediani, the BBC Breakfast editor, said Mr Walker had been a brilliant part of the BBC Breakfast team for over six years.More from NewsUS Secret Service rents $30,000 a month California mansion to protect Hunter BidenRussia-Ukraine latest news: Putin regroups \u0026#39tens of thousands\u0026#39 of troops for assault on eastern regionsBucha killings: ‘We brought the dead here because the dogs were trying to eat them’Becoming transgender a sacred journey of becoming whole, says ex-Archbishop of CanterburyThe EU can’t win in its eternal battle against Hungary’s PM, Viktor Orban‘Boozy’ leaving do for woman who wrote Covid rules leads to ‘partygate’ finesMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"nicola sturgeon addicted covid powers","story":"When the Scottish Government launched a public consultation on whether ministers should have the power to amend primary legislation by decree during an emergency, the response was, shall we say, unusual.Around 90 per cent of the 4,000 organisations and iniduals that responded opposed the change. As one legal academic, Dr Andrew Tickell of Glasgow Caledonian University, pointed out, such powers “require clear justification and anxious scrutiny” so it was “surprising that the Scottish government have provided no explanation or justification of this provision” in the documents accompanying the bill.The purported aim of the legal changes being proposed by Nicola Sturgeon’s government – which, opposition notwithstanding, are likely to happen – will allow ministers to respond more quickly to emergencies such as another pandemic. But Dr Tickell’s observation still stands: the Scottish Parliament co-operated quickly and constructively when ministers asked for emergency powers in 2020, so why is this new legislation – allowing ministers to bypass the parliament completely – even being contemplated?After all, Sturgeon objected volubly when Boris Johnson asked for similar “Henry VIII” powers to allow his ministers to amend legislation without parliamentary scrutiny in the aftermath of Brexit. Why are such powers referred to as “a power grab” when proposed by Johnson, but deemed perfectly fair and democratic when proposed north of the border?In fact, one of Sturgeon’s ministers has already confirmed that these undemocratic reforms (and in this case, “undemocratic” is not a pejorative term but a simple, factual description of powers aimed at circumventing the democratic process) are to be justified by the SNP’s hatred of Boris Johnson himself.So there we have it: the SNP need the same Henry VIII powers that Boris Johnson demanded in order to prevent people who share Boris Johnson’s politics from making decisions the Scottish Government dislikes. It is perfectly reasonable for the likes of Sommerville to conjure up the spectre of the Prime Minister, because all her colleagues – especially her boss – do it all the time, and the evidence is that most Scots are open to whatever argument they are proposing provided they set it in the political context of “we hate Boris Johnson”.On the more substantive – and worrying – issue of the emergency powers themselves, you might expect that with 90 per cent of responses to the consultation giving it the thumbs down, ministers face a considerable penalty in the opinion polls and at next month’s local elections. In most countries, this would certainly be the case, but in the SNP’s case, voters tend to vote first and ask very few questions afterwards. Moreover, while the politically engaged elements of civic Scotland can see the danger of legislation that allows ministers, free from legislative scrutiny, to govern by fiat, a larger proportion of Scottish society is extremely relaxed about allowing the government to dictate how they should live their lives. Many Scots do not spend large amounts of time in England and so are unaware of the freedom their southern compatriots have when it comes, for example, to mask mandates. If they did, would they still be inclined to trust in Sturgeon’s edict that the mask mandate in Scotland should be phased out as slowly as possible? That England\u0027s infection rate has often been less than Scotland’s since “freedom day” can be safely filed under  “grievance”.Unfortunately, therefore, powers to ignore the Scottish parliament and to change laws without democratic oversight will probably be greeted by Scots with a shrug of the shoulders. Ronald Reagan famously warned that the scariest nine words in the English language were: “I’m from the government and I’m here to help.” In Scotland, that is less a warning than a promise that Big Brother really does love us and wants only the best for us, provided we don’t ask too many questions.More from NewsUS Secret Service rents $30,000 a month California mansion to protect Hunter BidenRussia-Ukraine latest news: Putin regroups \u0026#39tens of thousands\u0026#39 of troops for assault on eastern regionsBucha killings: ‘We brought the dead here because dogs were trying to eat them’Becoming transgender a sacred journey of becoming whole, says ex-Archbishop of CanterburyThe EU can’t win in its eternal battle against Hungary’s PM, Viktor Orban‘Boozy’ leaving do for woman who wrote Covid rules leads to ‘partygate’ finesMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"right have charging anxiety electric car","story":"Electric car owners are twice as likely to call for emergency help because they have run out of juice compared to petrol or diesel drivers, according to data from the AA, as “charging anxiety” becomes one of the biggest barriers to uptake.Nearly four per cent of callouts for electric vehicles in 2021 were the result of them running low on charge while on the road, compared to around 1.5 per cent of petrol and diesel car drivers running out of fuel.The AA points out that there is “no jerry can” for electricity, and a breakdown requires them to tow cars to the nearest charge point.Public charging infrastructure has failed to keep pace with the rise in popularity of EVs, putting the Government\u0027s plans to ban petrol and diesel cars at risk.The number of plug-in cars on the road grew by 280 per cent between 2019 and 2021, but charge points increased by just 70 per cent in the same period, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT).There are around 29,000 publicly available chargers, for some 365,000 EVs across the UK.There are only around 4,500 rapid chargers across the country, which cut waiting time from several hours to around 30 minutes.Between six and 10 per cent of charge points are out of order at any one period, with the problem particularly bad for fast chargers, according to data from Zap-Map, leaving some drivers stranded when their planned stop is out of service.In the first eight months of 2021, the AA responded to callouts from around 21,000 EVs, with 3.8 per cent of them saying they were running out of charge.Sir Edmund King, the president of the AA, said charging infrastructure could become a major issue as electric cars continue to grow in popularity.“The problem comes when the uptake is far greater than it currently is,” he said. “At the moment, we’re still only about two per cent of cars that are EV. When that multiplies to 20 per cent of course we will need more, and more reliable, charging infrastructure, and to fill gaps in the rural areas.”The proportion of callouts for running out of charge has halved from eight per cent since 2015, which the AA says is down the increase in range of EV models.But the SMMT says anxiety over finding a charge point is now the second biggest barrier for people when considering whether to buy an EV, after the high upfront costs.Last month, the National Infrastructure Commission said the slow pace of the charge point rollout threatened the Government\u0027s goal to end the sale of petrol and diesel cars in 2030.Sir Edmund said drivers would need to “change the way they think” about charging, and plug in whenever they had an opportunity, rather than wait until the battery was low, in case they find charging points are not working.“It does take a bit more planning, and reliability has been a problem,” he said. “You can make a plan on getting to charge point B and then find it’s not working. That is happening.”The AA says around half of callouts for charging are not for those with a completely flat battery, but because their warning light has come on to tell them they are running low.The Government has pledged to increase the number of charge points tenfold to 300,000 by 2030.More from NewsUS Secret Service rents $30,000 a month California mansion to protect Hunter BidenRussia-Ukraine latest news: Putin regroups \u0026#39tens of thousands\u0026#39 of troops for assault on eastern regionsBucha killings: ‘We brought the dead here because the dogs were trying to eat them’Becoming transgender a sacred journey of becoming whole, says ex-Archbishop of CanterburyThe EU can’t win in its eternal battle against Hungary’s PM, Viktor Orban‘Boozy’ leaving do for woman who wrote Covid rules leads to ‘partygate’ finesMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"dwp set start slowly moving","story":"Exclusive: DWP set to start slowly moving .million people onto Universal Credit within weeksThe Mirror understand ministers want to restart the managed migration of legacy benefit claimants onto Universal Credit this Spring - and finish it by the end of .

The transfer was put on hold due to Covid - but the Mirror understands ministers plan to restart it this Spring. The Department for Work and Pensionswill start with a small number of Tax Credit claimants, up to a cap of , households. They then plan to remove the cap and move onto disability and other benefit claimants, to have everyone on the new six-in-one benefit by the end of . But the Social Security Advisory Committeewarned the change “creates a signicant risk” for benefit claimants, many of whom have “complex lives”.  It also creates risks for the DWP in delivering its plan, the committee warned. Chair Dr Stephen Brien warned there must be “independent oversight and scrutiny”. He announced he would be seeking further advice from experts over plans to lt the ,-household cap. Ministers insist Universal Credit is often more generous than old-style benefits, after they were repeatedly forced to reform it amid public anger and poor Brits turning to food banks. The six-week wait was cut to five, allowances for people in work were raised, and the amount given to debt repayments was cut. But campaigners point out some people could still be worse off. Anela Anwar, chief executive of anti-poverty charity ZK, said lting the , cap must get fresh approval in Parliament. She added: “It ensures DWP avoids a repeat of the shambolic early stages of Universal Credit, when many people were left without anything to live on for weeks or sometimes even months on end. “That resulted in MPs getting hundreds of complaints from desperate and angry constituents.”  Dr Brien was one of the original brains behind Universal Credit, and faced questions over his impartiality in  when he became SSAC chairman. He hit back at this at the time, insisting his work would be “evidence-based”. He told ministers on the latest change: “I can provide assurance that we do not wish to unduly delay the process. “We will not be undertaking a large-scale public consultation on this occasion but intend to seek the advice of a small number of experts, including those with signicant experience or expertise of agile processes and their governance.” But he added: “For the public to have confidence in this process and to minimise risk further consideration needs to be given to establishing appropriate independent oversight and scrutiny of the programme as it moves forward.” DWP Permanent Secretary Peter Schofield said in November that he was “determined” to see Universal Credit fully rolled out by December . He told MPs: “We got the funding in the spending review to finish this on time.” The benefit’s director general Neil Couling suggested the transfer would be a “slow, slow, slow experience”, adding: “You need to develop your processes and do that with small volumes.” A DWP spokesperson said: “Universal Credit is a modern dynamic benefit which supports people in and out of work. We have always been clear about our ambition to move people over from the legacy systems, which are complex, inefficient and based on aging, inflexible IT. “The Department will continue its regular engagement with the committee and our ambition remains to see the rollout of Universal Credit delivered safely and on time by .” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Department for Work and PensionsPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

On Thursday all of us spent the day desperately reading gas and electric meters, photographing them from seven angles and spent two hours trying to send the numbers to a crashed website, while we screamed and family members muttered “take six deep breaths and try again” because the next day the price was going up by two million per cent. Thanks to this sense of fun from companies such as EDF and E.On, from now on we can play this jolly game every year. It can become like searching for Easter eggs, and we’ll all laugh about the time Grandma didn’t quite get her reading in on time, bless her, so she spent the next month living in the sideboard clutching guinea pigs inside her nightie to keep warm.  In a few years, it will be a festival, like Halloween. Each March  one person will dress up as the EDF man and ­children will scream “aaaaagh don’t take our heating away”. People will run from house to house looking into cupboards with a torch, then we’ll all eat raw pizzas that we cannot afford to cook to celebrate ­Meter-reading Day. This has happened becausewe don’t have an exact reading from the moment the price goes up, the energy companies can charge us for everything at a higher rate. They’ve been given a licence to do whatever they fancy. Next week it will be announced: “Due to rocketing fuel prices, energy companies can marry one person from every household” and it will be considered a great honour to hand your sister over to Scottish Power.  The Government gives advice on how to “shop around” for cheaper tarfs, as it’s our responsibility to see which of the big six suppliers are slightly less impossibly expensive than the others. It’s like the police saying: “There have been a lot of robberies in this area lately, so we’ve decided to crack down. We’ve set up an app, so you can contact all the muggers in the area and arrange which one you would like to hold you at knepoint and run off with your bank card.” Because it’s all down to you. This is why you’ll find Government websites that give advice such as: “Save money on boiling water by filling a pan, and taking it to your local crematorium to pop it on the furnace during a funeral, so you enjoy a well-earned brew.”  The only people who aren’t told by the Government how to reduce energy costs are the energy companies who set the costs. I suppose there’s no point in ordering them about as they’re completely helpless. Since  they’ve paid £billion to their shareholders, but there’s nothing they can do to stop that. Their prices and profits just keep shooting up until eventually they’ll own the universe, and creatures from other galaxies will wonder why they have a bill for £ from British Gas.

Common ailments such as a sore throat, muscle pains and diarrhoea have been confirmed as signs of infection by the UK Health Security Agency - more than two years after the pandemic began.Symptoms of Covid were previously only a fever, a new and persistent cough, and a loss or change in taste or smell. The move comes days after free universal testing was axed in England and raised questions about the cost facing Brits checkingthey have Covid or an ordinary cold.The NHS website says these are very similar to symptoms of other illnesses, such as colds and flu. The Prime Ministeraposs official spokesman said providing universal free testing was simply unsustainable at a cost of £ billion per month. Askedpeople should have access to free test in light of the changes, the spokesman said: I think we need to look at where we are in the course of this pandemic. We know there is relatively high prevalence of Covid at the moment but because of vaccines, because of therapeutics and other approaches, we are not seeing it have the knock-on impact when it comes to requiring the most intensive hospital treatment. At the same time, the provision of free tests was costing taxpayers £ billion a month and that is simply unsustainable. NHS staff, care home workers and people working in high risk settings such as prisons and refuges are still eligible for free tests. Meanwhile, No said ministers expect the public to use their good judgment on whether to go outthey have symptoms. The spokesman said: I think anyone, even pre-Covid, would recognisethey have symptoms of an infectious disease, something like flu, they should stay home and not infect their loved ones or colleagues, and it is that sort of good judgment that we expect to see going forward.

The official said: “Russia is redeploying elements of the forces that are in Georgia to reinforce the invasion of Ukraine. “We don’t think that this was planned, it’s a very odd thing for the Russian military to do. So we suspect it’s indicative of the problems they are having in Ukraine.” The order came five weeks into Russiaaposs invasion, which has run into fierce Ukrainian resistance. The issue of conscriptsapos involvement in the war is highly sensitive. On March , the defence ministry acknowledged that some had been sent to Ukraine after Putin had denied this on ious occasions, saying only professional soldiers and officers had been sent in, Reuters reported. Putinaposs spokesman said at the time that the president had ordered military prosecutors to investigate and punish the officials responsible for disobeying his instructions to exclude conscripts.  The annual spring military draft, which runs from April  to July , will affect Russian men between the ages of  and , Putinaposs decree said. Shoigu said on Tuesday that those called up would begin to be dispatched to their assigned bases in late May. Most military personnel will undergo professional training in training centres for three to five months. Let me emphasize that recruits will not be sent to any hot spots, he said in remarks published on his ministryaposs website. However, Mikhail Benyash, a lawyer representing several members of Russiaaposs National Guard who refused an order to go to Ukraine, said that under Russian law conscripts could be sent to fight after several months of training.US President Joe Biden today called for a war crimes trial against Putin, and said he was seeking more sanctions after the reported atrocities in Ukraine.Biden told reporters earlier today: “He is a war criminal.  “This guy is brutal, and what’s happening in Bucha is outrageous and everyone’s seen it. “I think it is a war crime ... He should be held accountable.” At the press conference, Biden added that he plans to hit Moscow with additional sanctions for its conduct throughout the war - which began with Putin sending troops over the border into Ukraine on February . The president said, Iaposll let you know, when asked about the nature of those sanctions. Shocking footage emerging from journalists in Ukraine showed charred bodies on a highway near Kyiv. Ukraine said  of some  bodies found in Bucha northwest of Kyiv were victims of extra-judicial killings by Russian troops. Satellite images showed a -foot-long trench dug into the grounds of a church where a mass grave was found. Ukraine called for an International Criminal Court investigation that France and Britain said they would support, and rights group Human Rights Watch said it had documented apparent war crimes. Russia said alleged crimes by its troops in Bucha were a provocation and no resident suffered. The UK has said Russia appears to be committing war crimes but has stopped short of describing the action as genocide, as it is called in Ukraine. That is because the UK sees genocide as something defined by a court of law. A Western official said the UK is “quite legally purist” about the situation. Western officials hope the International Criminal Court will be able to play the role of prosecuting war crimes in Ukraine. Officials are doubtful about the possibility of setting up a separate Nuremberg-style war crimes tribunal, called for by Gordon Brown. An official said that would require a UN Security Council resolution - which couldn’t get through because Russia has a veto.

He’s very independent and likes to get things himself so we’ve been focusing on teaching him to ask first rather than just getting.  I said he was more than welcome to get one and they were in the bottom drawer of the freezer. However, Saffia had forgotten about the tubs of emulsion and gloss sitting in a box on top of the freezer. Denley accidentally knocked the box over, which in turn spilled their contents everywhere, but despite the destruction Saffia didnapost hear a sound. She added: I thought it was odd he hadn’t ed asking me to open [the ice cream]. I jokingly said to my Mum ‘He’s quiet - that’s never a good sign’. “But never in a million years did I expect that. When I first saw it I was stunned to silence, I truly had no words. I watched him for what felt like an hour . I think I was frozen in shock!

However, describing her nephew as an absolute sweetheart she added he was keen to help her clean up after making so much mess. Saffia said: “There was so much paint it was like he was recreating Bambi on ice. “I rang my husband and told him he needed to come home, I didn’t have the words to explain what had happened, just that he needed to come home as soon as possible. “That’s where the picture came from. He ran all the way home. Ryan took charge of cleaning Denley but needed to get him upstairs to the bathroom - we had just gotten new settees the weekend before so taking him through the front room was a big no! “Poor Ryan had to strip down to his boxers and carry him out the back door, round the house through the front door. “Ryan mentioned later that night he was very thankful I found the situation funny as he would’ve struggled to find the funny side!” Although no one on Facebook was able to give Saffia a miracle solution for getting Denleyaposs clothes clean, she enjoyed the funny comments she received. She added she had to send her in-laws to the shops to replenish her cleaning supplies when she tackled the kitchen. Saffia said: I was so fortunate that so many comments were filled with similar stories and that a lot of people found so much enjoyment in the photo. !I didn’t see any negative comments on the photo and I’m pretty sure I’ve got the admins of the group to thank for that!

Haleigh Walsh, , from Tipperary in Ireland, has struggled with her weight all her le - needing a custom gown made for her when she had her communion aged seven. As she got older, Haleighaposs weight crept up and at her heaviest, she topped the scales at st lbs and was wearing size  clothes. Haleigh said: I ate big portions and am shocked now looking back at just how much I could get through. I’d starve all day then have takeaways, share bags of crisps, chocolates, anything I wanted. For more of the news you care about straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here She added she refused to exercise and found herself in pain just from walking. People would tell me I had a beautul face. But I knew my weight was a problem, she said. After planning a holiday in Portugal with her friends, Haleigh says a friend told her something that made her think twice. She said: An old friend told me a horror story of a man who’d been so big he was marched out of his seat to the back of the plane. I was so terried of that happening to me that I bought a second seat, so I wouldn’t be impacting anyone. I remember sitting there on the plane and thinking, aposI am never doing this againapos. Knowing she had to do something about her frame, Haleigh spoke to a relative who had had successful weight loss surgery - and she had seen the results for herself.  While doing a clientaposs make up for a th birthday party, the woman told Haleigh sheaposd been on the waiting list for a gastric bypass in Ireland for nine years. Not wanting to wait that long, Haleigh started researching private clinics and just one month after ing from Portugal in August , she applied to the Nordbariatric Clinic in Kaunas, Lithuania. However, when she contacted the clinic, she was told she needed to lose three stone on her own before going under the kne to reduce the risk of the operation. So for the next  months, she stuck to a primarily liquid diet and managed to get herself down to st lb by July  - and she travelled to Lithuania to have the operation which cost £,. The procedure involves creating a small pouch at the top of the stomach connected to the small intestines, which makes the patient feel fuller after eating less food - and meaning they absorb fewer calories.She said: I wasn’t nervous at all about the operation.Even when the surgeon came to see me, I didn’t have any questions. I felt so confident after watching the surgery being done on the clinic’s Facebook page and reading testimonials about it.The surgeon performed  procedures in the two days I was in the clinic. He was so experienced that I knew I was in safe hands. After having the operation, Haleigh was on a diet of baby food and yoghurt while her stomach recovered. A week later she was allowed to fly back home to Ireland - and was already lbs lighter than when sheaposd flown out. Just months after the operation, Haleigh was slim enough to be able to start doing cardio exercise - and a few months after that, she was able to incorporate weights into her routine too.  As the weight fell off her, Haleigh barely recognised herself - but losing so much weight so quickly left her with some excess skin. Now weighing in at st lbs and fitting into size  clothes, Haleigh is looking to have her extra skin removed, and has her eye on Lithuania again. She said: “Since I’ve been training properly in the gym, I’ve really noticed how bad my loose skin is. I just want it off me now. My body is toning up underneath, but then I have these great folds and flaps of skin. It’s my arms that are the worst. I’m really confident with my size and shape, but still have to have something covering my arms at all times as they bother me so much. The operation, which sheaposs booked for October at the same clinic, will cost £,. Haleigh said: “I just have so much more confidence now. I love going for walks and out on adventures. Before all this I couldn’t even walk down the road without getting out of breath or my back hurting. Now I love taking exercise.

Tragically, they both died – Armani in February and Tom last week.  But during that last year of Amani’s le, it was Tom who brought her the joy of true friendship. And when she died, Tom suffered the loss of a true friend too. Amani’s family have the comfort of knowing what a dference Tom made to her final days. The disease that killed them both was an aggressive brain cancer known as glioblastoma multorme. Tumours like it kill more children and adults than any other cancer, yet only % of research money is allocated to finding a cure.

The -year-olds family has thanked everyone for their supportJanet Edwards vanished on December  last year Image: BPM MediaByAnnabal BagdiGraeme Murray:,  Apr Updated:,  Apr |commentsA family have paid tribute to an extraordinary mum found dead in a river. Janet Edwards from Tillington, Herefordshire, vanished on December  last year triggering a massive search. Her body was found three months later in the River Wye in Ross-on-Wye on March . The -year-oldaposs family thanked everyone for their support before her funeral on Wednesday. Birmingham Live reports they said: Janet was a wonderful and extraordinary mother, partner and friend. She had a long career as a nurse, in which she was sincerely valued and respected by colleagues and her patients. She will be dearly missed by all who had the pleasure of knowing her.  We would like to convey our heartfelt thanks to all those who helped in the search for Janet, and have supported us since her tragic disappearance. The investigation and searches conducted by the police were exceptionally thorough and extensive, and were clearly undertaken with great proficiency. We are also overwhelmingly grateful for the efforts of friends and the members of the public who volunteered to assist with searches. Importantly, we thank and applaud the West Midlands Search and Rescue Service, whose volunteers are highly skilled and devote their weekends to carrying out this often dangerous work. Their dedication and bravery is nothing short of heroic.  West Mercia Police said: The family would like to ensure that all who have assisted, paid tribute, and expressed their kindness and support during this dficult time are able to attend Janet’s funeral.Therefore, the family have asked West Mercia Police to release that the funeral will take place on Wednesday  April at pm at St Nicholas’ Church in Hereford.

Peter reveals how an informant has told him the gangsters are behind the suspected murders of Danny and Liam.He said: “The source said they weren’t implicating Parle directly, but told me that ‘the father and son from Burgess Hill won’t be seen again.’ “I later met my source face-to-face and discussed Danny and Liam. The source told me the criminal network surrounding Kevin Parle was responsible for their disappearance. “I’ve also identied a number of iniduals in Parle’s network, some of whom have residential and business addresses on the south coast and Sussex, not far from where Danny and Liam were living. Everything points to these two cases being linked.” Danny, , and Liam, from Burgess Hill, Sussex, traveled to Spain’s Estepona on Mother’s Day  carrying a suitcase containing £, in cash.  Relatives last heard from them the following day - April . The cash was never recovered and their passports and luggage were found abandoned in a hotel room on Estepona’s Valle Romano golf resort. Liam’s mum Lisa Berwick says her former husband had links with the drug world, and believes he and their son were killed in a deal gone wrong. Peter reveals his bombshell findings to Lisa and daughter Lauryn Poole - Liam’s sister - in the podcast.  Lisa said: “I was shocked to hear Peter’s information - it seems journalists have done more to investigate Danny and Liam’s disappearance than the police. “It looks totally credible and should have blown the case wide open - yet it appears the police have just sat on it.” Lauryn fights back tears as she tells Peter: “Dad and Liam have very easily been portrayed as criminals. It’s important people realise they’re not just that - they’re two people we love. We need closure.” Parle - nicknamed ‘Hemp’ - is wanted for the shotgun murders of a mum-of-three Lucy Hargreaves and Liam Kelly, . He is one of  criminals who appear on the National Crime Agency’s ‘most wanted’ list.The -year-old has spent  years on the run from British authorities. Liam was gunned down over a £ debt in  as he climbed out of a pal’s Vauxhall Astra in Toxteth, Liverpool.In August , Lucy Hargreaves, , was shot three times by masked gunmen as she slept on her sofa in Walton, Merseyside, before being doused in petrol and set on fire.Lucy’s partner Gary Campbell - thought to be the intended target of the underworld hit - fled through an upstairs window with their toddler as their home blazed. Ginger-haired Parle is believed to have fled to Spain and is wanted for questioning on both murders.It is believed Danny and Liam met two British men - one with connections to Merseyside - in Estepona the night before they vanished. Spanish police confirmed they arrested the two men in June , but the pair were never charged. One subsequently ed to the UK and is currently serving an eight-year sentence for aggravated burglary. The other has been linked to another high-profile, unsolved disappearance in Spain where he still lives today. Although the pair took £k in cash on their trip, Lisa revealed Liam asked her to send more money the day after the pair arrived in Spain.  “I told him that I didn’t have that kind of money, and in any case I didn’t want the paper trail coming back to me. “Of course I can’t say for certain what happened from there, but I can imagine a scenario where Liam was held for ransom until Danny came up with the cash - and somehow it’s all gone wrong.”Lisa has criticised the Spanish authorities and Sussex Police over their handling of her son’s disappearance.Sussex Police say they are powerless to investigate in Spain. And the Superior Court of Andalucia closed the case in September  – a mere five months after Danny and Liam went missing.Peter handed his dossier linking Parle with Danny and Liam to Merseyside Police in December .But it is unclear whether the information has been acted upon. Merseyside Police refused to confirm what information was passed on - or when - saying only it had been “processed and disseminated accordingly.” Sussex Police said: “I can confirm that we have no evidence to link Kevin Parle with the disappearance of Danny and Liam Poole. “This is and always has been a Spanish judicial-led investigation and the role of Sussex police has been to support that with UK-based enquiries and liaison with the family.” Peter said: “If there are criminals out there making people disappear, then it is absolutely imperative that they are found and brought to justice - becausethey’ve done it before, they might do it again. “Every single resource possible should be ploughed into establishing the truth.” Last Sunday, on the eve of the third anniversary of the disappearances, Lisa spent another Mother’s Day without a visit from her son. “It reduced me to tears - again,” she said. “They say it gets easier with time but it doesn’t, it gets harder.” Read MoreRead More Follow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Liam KellyBBCMerseyside PoliceSussex PoliceChannel Crime\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The biscuits were strewn across the road as they tumbled out of the dozens of boxes packed on the lorry. The bizarre incident happened in Sandiacre in Derbyshire at about pm this evening.

The blockage occurred around .am last Wednesday, resulting in a back up of vehicles on the interstate near the Burnside Bridge. Oregon Department of Transportation compared the incident to the Disney Pixar film series, joking the toys may have been on their way to Pizza Planet. Don Hamilton, DOT spokesperson, said one lane was closed to the cartoon creatures but said most of them were already to the side of the road. “It’s not often we get several hundred stuffed animals visiting our highways,” he added. It was not immediately clear where the toys came from. Hamilton claried they had, however, been taken to the North Portland maintenance yard for care and feeding. Twitter users were keen to get in on the joke, with one replying: Be sure to check under any traffic cones!He was referring to the scene in Toy Story  in which some of Andyaposs toys hide under traffic cones as they cross a busy road on their way to rescuing Buzz Lightyear.

And reports suggest William is planning to reinvent the role of the Prince of Wales - with his we, the Duchess of Cambridge, playing a key role in the future.Palace aides are said to be describing the strategy as aposthe Cambridge wayapos and sources suggest the couple have been doing a lot of thinking about how long-held protocols can be modernised - especially in the aftermath of their Caribbean tour.A source close to William told the Mail on Sunday : This approach isnapost a criticism of what has come before but just an acknowledgement of a desire for change. Itaposs about hope and optimism for the future. What is driving the Duke and Duchess in everything they do is urgency plus optimism equals action. This new strategy will reportedly harness Kateaposs popularity - and will seemingly see her royal role change in the future... New title One of the biggest changes Kate will see in the future is a change in her title.  Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm. Click here to sign up.When William becomes the heir to the throne and probably takes on the Prince of Wales title, Kate will automatically become the Princess of Wales.The last person to hold this title was, of course, Williamaposs late mother Princess Diana. Charlesaposs second we, Camilla, decided against using the title out of respect for Diana.And according to a source,and when this is to happen, it would be an emotional moment for William.They previously told the: I’m sure it’ll be a bit of a bittersweet moment.This is her son and his we, so in some ways, it will be coming full circle—but it will also be a poignant reminder of what we all lost. Solo overseas tours  Another way that Kateaposs royal role will reportedly change is that she may be seen on more overseas tours abroad - but without William. It comes as she is enjoying increasing popularity and is becoming a lot more assured as a royal.Just recently she embarked on a rare solo overseas trip when she spent two days in Denmark in February, which was deemed a great success.During this trip, she focused on engagements relating to her work in early years development - and also made time to have an audience with Queen Margrethe of Denmark.And who can forget the great pictures of Kate throwing herself down a huge slide during a visit to the Lego Foundation Play Lab Core causes  Another way they are said to be planning to shake up the monarchy is by having far fewer staff.According to the Sun, William and Kate will have just half the estimated  staff that currently work for his father Charles to create a more cost-effective and less formal team.And with less staff, this means that Kate will reportedly focus on fewer causes rather than spread themselves too thinly. These causes may only total five or six but would be comfortable and credible. A source also told the Mail on Sunday: Many of the causes adopted by the Duke and Duchess, whether itaposs Earthshot [the annual prize awarded by the Royal Foundation for contributions to environmentalism] or the early years work, also touches on every other aspect of society so itaposs not that theyaposre excluding other good causes by having a focus. More meet and greets Moving forward, itaposs been reported that both Kate and William will reduce the number of stage-managed events that they take part in. And it seems instead they will focus on more meet-and-greets so they can get under the skin of their causes. It comes after The Sun reports that William aims to “rip up the rulebook” and ditch old-fashioned methods to show they are modern royals.

Ray Ellis described Manchester Airportaposs operations as chaoticapos and has concerns about passengers.The hub has left passengers facing long delays and been hit by staff shortagesTravellers have struggled to get through security and faced y queues as the Easter holiday season approaches Baggage handlers are also facing more stress and some passengers have abandoned luggage to get away after long waitAirport chiefs have warned queues could persist as the start of busy summer schedules and international travel slowly begins toto normal levels Mr Ellis, a father-of-three and grandfather from Wythenshawe, Manchester said the airport, which is battling to attract jobs and has launched a recruitment drive, should reduce flights until the situation eases.He told the Manchester Evening News: I am health and safety through and through.I am very well trained and used to be a health and safety rep at the airport as well as a trainer. I have worn many caps there and I know how things should be run. They are not being run in the way they should be. I am making this point and speaking out because I am genuinely concerned for passenger safety. Mr Ellis has also contacted Manchester City Council, which has shares in the airport, the mayor of Greater Manchesteraposs office, the Civil Aviation Authority and the Department for Transport. I am quite willing and able to give a tour of the airport to point out my concerns to anyone who would benefit from that, he added. It is the first job at the airport that I have walked out on. It is dreadful at the moment and getting dangerous.Among a series of allegations, Mr Ellis cited workers being offered a apos£ incentiveapos to forgo breaks during one sht amid claims passengers were forced to wait up to two hours to collect their luggage - he said the move was in breach of working time directives and compromised safety. And he said: On Friday and Saturday there was a contingency plan in place to form the Terminal  departure queues outside the far and central entry doors when temperatures were predicted to be as low as freezing. My heart goes out to youyou ended up in it. To say the lunatics are running the asylum is an understatement. I resigned because of the chaotic way the airport is operating. I want to shout as loud as possible about it because I am a passenger as well. Security is not being taken seriously. They should have reduced flights to deal with the capacity. The inconvenience that passengers are suffering is unjust. I would say that passenger safety is being endangered. The security is nowhere near what it should be at a major airport. People are sat around in management crisis meetings. No one seems to be taking ownership or responsibility for this. They need to reduce flights until they get on top of it all. In T there can be the best part of , passengers all trying to get through security in two hours. We know the size of the terminal and we have logged some queues at more than a mile and a half long. The queues are that long they can compromise evacuations. A spokesman for Manchester Airport said: “We are currently facing staff shortages and recruitment challenges as we recover from the most dficult two years in our history, and we apologise to passengers affected by longer than usual queues in recent days. “We are grateful to all our colleagues for their hard work and dedication, especially during this period of operational pressure.We want to be clear that the safety and security of passengers and colleagues is, and always has been our first priority and we carry out regular reviews of our health and safety policies and procedures.This ensures that all working environments and equipment used by team members remain safe and secure.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Manchester Airport\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The research was conducted in response to the recent  per cent spike in online searches for ‘adoption centres near me’ suggesting many Brits may be gearing up to welcome a new dog into their homes this spring. The male name Max stole the top spot for Brits, followed by Dave at number two – and it seems they’re not alone – sharing their preferences with some of the nation’s best loved celebrities and Hollywood superstars. Heidi Klum named her beautul German Shepherd, Max, who lives alongside her two other dogs, fellow Sheppy, Freddie and Irish Wolfhound, Anton, who she adopted on National Dog Day back in .

Jayne Laycock, resident vet at YuMOVE, said “S pring is a popular time of year to welcome a new dog into the home. However, before you start to consider names for your new pooch, which we know people love doing, there are lots of other important decisions.Firstly, make sure you thoroughly research the traits of the breed you’re looking to buy or adopt to ensure it’s an appropriate fit for you and your lestyle. For example, some dogs require a lot more physical exercise than others, some are more suited to rural living and some will require even more specialist care and training. Likewise, consider the age of the dog you’re looking to get – puppies require a lot of time, effort and training, soyou’re looking for something a little more ‘seasoned’ - then perhaps look at a rescue dog that’s a little older that’s already house trained.

His only real problem is that he is consistent at making bad choices, and perhaps in time the worst of all will be when he decidednotto relinquish his motheraposs hand at the Westminster Abbey memorial for his father, to let her be led to her seat by someone  as he quietly slipped into his own.Instead Andrew kept her hand, eyeballed the Dean of Westminster into backing down, and flaunted the Head of the Church of England in front of a bank of TV cameras in the full knowledge that his fatheraposs memorial would be reduced to a news item re-upping allegations of sexual abuse.Worse than the public criticism, though, was the well-briefed fury of Charles and William, the next two monarchs who will not be as forgiving as the current one. And then the entirely-coincidental revelation that Andrew had not mended his ways, and had become embroiled with another scandal.This time itaposs a court case in which he, his ex-we and both his daughters are alleged to have been the beneficiaries of a grand swindle. A Turkish banker allegedly persuaded a Turkish millionairess to trust her cash to him, and she has told the court that he used the money to buy influence for himself with the Royals.The Turkish banker was applauded at the princeaposs now-defunct Pitch@Palace initiative, and around the same time Andrew received £.m, his ex-we £,, and his daughter Eugenie a further £,.The millionairess says she was told the money was for a passport. Coutts says they were told it was to pay for Beatriceaposs wedding. This is despite the fact a passport costs £., and Beatrice married a millionaire.  Andrew has now repaid the £,, but a further £, is unaccounted for. The Duchess of York has refused toher chunk, on the grounds it was paid for her work as a brand ambassador for a green energy company, even though it does not seem to be benefitting much from the connection. Beatriceaposs friends have described her as completely unaware of how her wedding was paid for, while Eugenie has let it be known she spent the £, on a surprise birthday party for her mother.And the question must now be asked of the entire family: what is it about dodgy money that attracts you Becausea £, bill for a wedding was settled by a Turkish political exile, any other bride would know about it. If any other woman got six-figure sums from her ex-husbandaposs chums she might wonder why. Andany one of us wanted to throw a surprise party and found it cost the same as a new car, weaposd throw a smaller onewe didnapost have the means to pay for it. Now the Royal Family finds itself in the unenviable situation of having paid £.million between them to make a scandal go away, just as the Duke of York manages to drive them smack into a new one - one which makes them look entitled, opportunistic, and desperate for cash to supplement a lestyle they cannot afford.At a time when the rest of the nation knows to the nearest penny what they can afford, and are turning off the heating or adjusting their shopping habits to scrape by, the fact that the future Royal Family canapost imagine a wedding that costs less than three quarters of a million pounds is not going to improve its long-term chances of survival.The timing of this court case, which has rumbled on for a couple of years, suddenly being made public in the week after Andrew embarrassed his relatives is interesting. And it may be linked to the fact that the Duke, who just a few months ago confirmed his public appearance at the memorial would be the last, is now reportedly considering smearing his pudgy chops across the Derby, a Falklands anniversary event, and the Platinum Jubilee. Why would a man who vowed to step away from the spotlight now be so intent on hogging it  Read more Prince Andrew is a true pauper prince - a man of poor wit, poor talent, and poor judgement. All that makes him rich is his title, and after giving up every other honoric his HRH is the one thing he has held onto. He is not allowed to use it, but he does still have it.He also held on to his daughtersapos titles, when other siblings relinquished them in favour of a more normal le. He fought for his daughtersapos Royal security, when it was costing £m a year and creating bad news as Met police officers were forced to trail after two girls on their gap yahs. For all the criticism levelled at Harry and Meghan for trying to trade off their Royal titles, Andrew and Sarah of York have done exactly that for decades, and with far more disastrous consequences. It perhaps explains why sheaposs still Sarah of York. Whoaposd want to change their name,it would cost you the chance to earn £, without having to go down the pit  Having lost his reputation, his ski chalet, millions of pounds and the trust of most of his wider family, Andrew seems to be intent on reinventing himself - not as a changed or chastened man, but as a prince, who needs to show no humility or shame. With the Queen by his side, Andrew can try it. But he has underestimated two things. The first is the fury of the British public, which does not forgive sexual misconduct in public le that easily, still less so when it involves someone legally a child. And the second is the ruthlessness of monarchy - the one quality which has been passed through that family since William the Conqueror. Charles may go easy on his younger brother, but William seems to feel nothing but scorn for playboy princes with dubious means of financial support.

Heavily pregnant Mariama Diallo says double parking outside Hotspur Primary School in Heaton, Newcastle, is putting pupilsapos lives at risk and needs to be stopped.The mum-of-three, , said sheaposs petried of allowing her daughters, Kadiatou, eight, and Aissatou, seven, to go to school on their own despite only living opposite it. Mowbray Street - where parking is only permitted on one side - often gets crammed full of cars. Mariama, ideally, would like to be able to watch from her door to check her children are safely at school - due to her condition making moving around dficult. But she said the current situation makes that too dangerous and sheaposs worried due to the sheer amount of cars moving in and out.Is there a similar issue on your street  Let us know at webnews@mirrorShe told the Sun: I am scared they will hit the children.Referring to the call for cars to be banned, she added it will be annoying but safety has to come first and is more important. Fellow resident, Francis Hamilton, , said the situation is horrible and when he drops his grandson at nursery he often canapost get a parking space at all. He said between .am and .am he canapost park or get his car out.  Parents park wherever they want to. They are double-parked from the bottom all the way up, he explained. While he is open to the idea of the council banning parents parking near his home he said it would exacerbate the issue as the problem could move to other streets. Linda Cherry, , said the local authority needs to introduce parking permits and install cameras to gather the culpritsapos registration numbers. She added that the back lanes near the school are also clogged up, while at all times of day people park in the area to go shopping in the town centre. She said she often drives around for  minutes trying to get parked up when ing home. Linda said as well as the children she is worried about her pet cats getting hurt. A spokesperson for Newcastle City Council said: “Since announcing our intention to put in place School Streets last year we have been working directly with the schools we’d identied as a first phase in the programme. One of the most important things in the delivery of this programme is to work with people who might be affected and listen to their concerns so we can address them. “One of our team has been visiting the schools regularly and working with the teachers, young people and those who live nearby to help understand the impacts and how we can promote and manage School Streets, or indeed where they might not be the right solution at this point in time. We’ve also undertaken trial runs of School Streets at a number of locations. “We had been waiting for government to formally transfer certain enforcement powers to local authorities, and to provide funding for measures of this type, something we’re happy to note has now been brought forward.Many schools have told us they would like to see these powers in place alongside implementing schemes to help ensure pupil’s safety. “Pupils at Hotspur Primary School are currently leading the way as part of our Big Walk and Wheel competition, with nearly two thirds of trips being active. “This is a competition we’re running with schools who’ve opted in across the city and it complements ongoing work we’re doing with the city’s Promise Board, which represents every single schools trust across the city, to bring forward a joint approach to improving safety and sustainability for the school run.” The Mirror has contacted Hotspur Primary School for comment.

There had been unfavourable coverage of some elements of the trip such as William and Kate riding in an open-top Land Rover during a military parade, which some said echoed Britain’s colonialist past. Later this month, royal couple Prince Edward and Sophie, the Countess of Wessex, are set to embark on their own tour of the Caribbean.They will be stopping off in Antigua and Barbuda, Grenada, St Lucia and St Vincent and the Grenadines.And according to the , palace officials are carefully studying the Wessexaposs itinerary to avoid any potential PR pitfalls.The publication adds that much of the criticism of the Cambridgeaposs tour came from engagements where they tried to emulate the Queen and Prince Philip during trips to the Caribbean many years ago.And it now reports that any potential plans for Sophie and Edward to greet crowds in an open-top car in Grenada - like the Queen and Prince Philip did in  - will have been quietly shelved.Last week, it was reported that Prince William had called an emergency summit to respond to the backlash of his royal tour of the Caribbean.

He brought together his most senior aides to thrash out a way of acknowledging concerns voiced by the people of the Caribbean nations visited last month, amid accusations of being “tone deaf” and actively paying homage to Britain’s colonial past. The future king told his staff the time had come for him to use his own voice and confront the issues head-on, such as protests on slavery reparations and anti-monarchist sentiment. Senior aides told how William had been rocked by widespread negative coverage of his and we Kate’s eight-day tour of Belize, Jamaica and The Bahamas and decided to go out on his own to deliver an unprecedented statement about the future of the Commonwealth. A senior palace source said of William: “He was keen to be heard and certainly thought there was a need to get ahead of the raft of negative headlines. “He said he needed to make it clear that any of the Caribbean nations he had visited were totally free and completely supported in any decision they may make in the future to choose their own destiny. “But he wanted to go further than that which is why the Duke made special mention of the Commonwealth in his speech. “He’s been thinking about these issues for a long time and realises the role he occupies is increasingly important to be able to adapt in an ever-changing world.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Kate Middleton, Duchess of CambridgeSophie WessexPrince Edward, Earl of WessexPrince WilliamRoyal Family\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The dog was hungry but healthy when foundHiker Oscar Alejandro Hernandez was found dead with his dog by his sideByHilary HansonSamantha Mordi:,  Apr |commentsA hiker who went missing for two weeks was tragically found dead - with his loyal dog by sitting by his side.Oscar Alejandro Hernandez body was found near a Los Angeles park on Thursday.The -year-oldaposs dog, King was found next to him hungry, but alive. His family raised alarm bells in mid-March, issuing a flyer which said his last known location was a merry-go-round near the Grfith par location. Hernandez’s family was present when his body was found, Los Angeles Sgt. Ruben Arellano. The man’s cousin said he believes King never left Hernandez’s side. Multiple agencies worked to retrieve Hernandez’s body from the hilly area.  Authorities have not yet released a cause of death for Hernandez, but there’s no reason to suspect foul play, Arellano said. Grfith Park covers more than , acres and includes around  miles of hiking trails and grassy areas. This comes after a loyal dog sat on the spot where its homeless owner died on a bench outside a hospital. The moving scene took place outside Rio Piedras Medical Centre in the Puerto Rican capital San Juan on the morning of February .According to the news site El Universal, the -year-old homeless man passed away in the night and the dog stayed by his side. The loyal pooch even remained on the bench as personnel from the Institute of Forensic Sciencestook the body away, gazing at the morgue vehicle as it disappeared from view. However, medical staff took a liking to the dog, and Dr Jose Antonio Herrera Dalmau reportedly decided to adopt the ownerless animal.  He told the newspaper El Nuevo Dia: I have already made an appointment to see a vet because the dog has a leg injury. It is not broken, but it has an injury. The hospital doctor added that he was thinking of calling the pooch Leo. He said he was told about the dog by a colleague and went outside to take a look.

The canine colourist spends up to £, a year on premium colours for her three-year-old poodle and claims that each makeover can take her up ten hours at a time. After each unique transformation, Walter looks completely unrecognisable as he sports bright blue, green and even checkerboard print fur. Each masterpiece involves a lot of planning as Jessica, who is now a full-time creative dog groomer, meticulously trims, colours and blow-dries her trusty service dog.Jessica said: Iaposve always had a passion for film. I used to work in the film industry, however I had to take some time off because I was getting sick. When it was lockdown and there was nothing to do, I started going crazy in the house looking to do something creative so I started practicing looks on Walter. After a year of having him, I started doing the crazy looks on him whenever I was having a dficult time as this really helped me.Iaposve had Walter since he was a puppy and he is trained to help me for when I have vertigo and migraine episodes.As well as being a great model, he really helps me because heaposs trained in de-pressure therapy. When Iaposm feeling light-headed, he lies on my body and really helps me control my breathing.Whilst Walteraposs looks turn heads in the street when heaposs out for walks, the creative groomer says that a lot of planning and effort goes into the looks and her doggy makeover addiction costs her a fortune. She adds: Luckily, I have a really well behaved dog and heaposs happy to sit there the whole time. Over the past two years, Iaposve spent around £, on colours which last up to  washes. When I do the slinky dog look, it took me up around  hours because I had to carve out where I would shave and it was really dficult to get the tail shaped right.After each crazy look, I shave him right down to the skin but heaposs a poodle so this grows back fully in about four months ready for the next look. At first, I was worried what people would think but when people see us on the street, they stop me to tell me how beautul he looks - some have even stopped traffic to tell me he looks amazing. Everything I use is vegan and cruelty-free, the colour is actually so safe a human could probably ingest it. Iaposve now undergone my own training and Iaposve started working in a shop, however I donapost recommend people trying this on their own dogthey donapost know what theyaposre doing.

When she was seven years old, Vanessa had her hair cut short. She hated how it looked, and pledged never to cut her hair again. As her locks grew longer and longer, she became used to compliments and accrued an online following for her Rapunzel-like hairstyle.Vanessa – who has a daughter Rose,  and son, Jasper,  with her husband,  – told News Dog Media : “When I was seven, I got my hair cut and hated it and promised myself that I would never cut it short again. “I loved having long hair and I was curious to see how long it would grow. I never expected that my hair would grow to my calves! “But it just kept growing. In fact, I saw the most growth in my hair when I had my two kids. “People began to compliment me on my long hair all the time. I was noticed for my long hair and it became tied up in my identity and self-worth. “Of course, sometimes it felt nice to have a compliment but increasingly it started to make me feel uncomfortable. “I wished that people would see that there was more to me than my hair. “My long hair had served me well for so many years. But after doing a lot of soul-searching, I realised it was no longer serving me and it was actually causing me more resistance in my le. “I was becoming a dferent person to who I used to be when I was seven years old.“I wanted to try something dferent and let go of that identity. Part of that transformation meant letting go of hair. “My four-foot long hair had always made me stand out. But I no longer wanted to be viewed just for my hair, I wanted to be viewed as a person.” In November last year, Vanessa secretly went to the hairdresser. She revealed her hair transformation to the world when she shocked her , TikTok followers with her short bob. She explains: “I only told a handful of people including my husband before I cut my hair. “I didn’t want anyone’s opinion to affect my decision. I wanted to cut my hair for me. “I was excited but nervous about getting the chop. I was shocked when I first saw it gone but I was also surprised that I felt pretty and confident with short hair too. “Also I had never realised the sheer weight of my long hair on my neck for all those years. It was so light now.Vanessa unveiled her dramatic haircut on TikTok with trepidation, and was worried that she would lose social media followers. But whilst trolls attacked her haircut, she also gained followers who were impressed by her bold decision. Now she wants to inspire other women to make liberating changes in their le as well. Vanessa says: “I was scared people would unfollow me when I cut my hair. Butanything, that solidied my decision to go to the hairdresser. I had to face my fear that some people only cared about my hair. “When I revealed my transformation on TikTok, of course there were people who told me I wasn’t special or unique anymore without my long hair. Some users threatened to unfollow me, whilst others tried to console me by telling me my hair would grow back. “But I actually got way more follows from my haircut video because it was so extreme. It was quite cool to see that!“Cutting my hair made me face lots of beliefs I had about myself. It made me see the beauty in myself – beyond my hair. “It made me realise my worth doesn’t change according to what I wear or how I look. “I want to show women that their worth doesn’t depend on certain attributes either. You’re amazing because you’re you. “I hope my decision allows other people to examine themselves too and seethey are holding on to things that might be negative. Letting go brought me so much joy. “I’m really loving my short hair right now.

Ashley Rogers from Las Vegas, US, was so determined to be a mum that she decided to go it alone.The air traffic controller welcomed her son Aiden James Rogers on November  . She had always wanted to be a mum, so when her partner revealed towards the end of their marriage that they no longer wanted children, the -year-old decided to file for orce. Ashley said: The fact that my ex didnapost want to have kids anymore was a deal-breaker for me. We had tried to have a baby together, but sadly it never happened for us and I suffered two miscarriages. Weaposd been together for ten years and I had a huge decision to make, but I knew how much I wanted to be a mum so I decided to orce in June .I initially tried a round of IVF by myself but it wasnapost successful. However, in February , I decided to try an IUI. I was able to buy some more vials of sperm from the donor and on  February, we completed the insemination which was successful. Ashley was overwhelmed when she got the good news. I was so excited but I was afraid to get too excited because of what I had been through before, she said. I was terried of losing the baby until I gave birth.Going through a pregnancy alone is a little sad. It would have been nice to have someone there to run to the shopsI wanted a random Taco Bell in the middle of the night. But it was the best decision I have ever made because now I have my beautul, sweet baby boy, who will soon be five months old. Ashley had a tough pregnancy as she suffered from intense sickness, but luckily Aiden was healthy the entire time. She says that becoming a single mum by choice was dficult and scary, but she has an amazing support system and a best friend who lives nearby and is always on hand to help. Ashley added: I sometimes question whether I made the right choice for Aidenaposs sake, but I have never regretted anything. My mum passed away during my pregnancy, meaning he doesnapost have a grandma anymore. I am an only child and I donapost have a large extended family. My ex had a huge family which I loved and made me really happy, but when we orced, that whole dynamic was taken away. It was really scary, but I really wanted to be a mum so I didnapost let these hurdles stand in my way. I had a lot of fear about being a single mum with a newborn from listening to other peopleaposs experiences but I decided to let this experience be my own and not take on anyone aposs anxieties.

Perhaps most surprisingly, the cosy bedroom lamp can become a hotbed of germsleft uncleaned, with bacteria building up quickly without the owner giving it so much as a second thought. According to this guidance, lampshades and map bases offer plenty of room for dust and dirt to settle and build, with lamps also known to be common touchpoints. This means a bit of dusting wonapost sufficewant to get them fully clean.Indeed, Online Bedrooms experts advise people to disinfect their lamps every week to keep filth at bay. Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. Another secret offender is your seemingly clean bedroom curtains, which will gather dust, dog or cat hair, and even mould spores as time goes on.Each time you open the curtains, particles of dirt end up swirling around the air. Therefore, itaposs recommended that curtains should be washed at least twice a year, and more frequently still should you suffer from dust allergies. Although there are few things more comforting than laying your head on your softest pillow at night, pillows can actually accumulate more than several thousand times more bacteria than a toilet seat in the space of a week. Organisms found on pillowcases thankfully tend to be mostly harmless, consisting largely of a build-up of skin cells, sweat, and saliva, but itaposs recommended that you wash your bedding every week to keep things as fresh as possible. With this in mind, people are also urged to change their mattress every seven to eight years, with yeast, mould, and bacteria known to make themselves just as comfy in your bed as you do. Microbes, skin cells, and particles of food are all transferred from our bodies to our mattresses, while airborne particles of dust and debris end up settling on the bed after floating around the room. Nic Shacklock, from Online Bedrooms, said: “It is no secret that germs live all over our houses, however there are lots of hidden spots that we may not ever think about during our cleaning rituals. “Spots like pillowcases and curtains are silent killers. Even though they might look fresh and clean, they are hiding a range of nasty bacteria that could lead to enhanced allergies, unpleasant odours, and skin issues.Do you have a cleaning-related story to tell  We pay for stories.

The acrobatic five-year-old pup hates getting his paws covered in pee, and will balance on his front two legs in an attempt to prevent it. Owner Tracy Thompson, , from Cheadle, Staffordshire, explained: I donapost know why he started doing it. He used to have very long hair and he got black skin alopecia - which some Pomeranians can get. to our TeamDogs newsletter for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories. When he had long hair he used to hate peeing on himself when he cocked his leg, so he started doing handstands. Then that continued, and now when he wees heaposll walk for ages down the path as well to avoid the mess - sometimes he can go quite a long way! Locals find Pandaaposs technique hilarious and he is often spotted doing handstands on walks down the road. In the funny video, the Pomeranian can be seen lting up onto his front paws and walking in a straight line, with a trail of pee behind him. The tiny white dogaposs hind legs are much higher than his head, but he still manages to remain balanced until he is finished weeing. Tracy, the dogaposs grandmother, added: An ordinary dog might just cock their leg and continue on their way, Panda though can just go on and on and on - the longer heaposs done it the further heaposs gone.Another clever pooch is stunning pet owners this week with his natural talent for playing tennis and ping pong. Two-year-old cocker spaniel Leo has incredibly learnt how to grip the racket handle between his teeth and play ball.Dog lovers are desperate to find out his training secrets - but owner Emily Anderson, , was just as surprised as them. She said: I ordered the tennis racket with a short handle. It arrived, I unpacked it and gave the racket to him. As with ping pong I asked him to back away, showed him the ball, threw it at him and he hit it for the first time. He just knew what he was doing, it really surprised me. I sat there for five minutes like aposwhat the hell just happened Emily added: He might not quite give Andy Murray or Rafael Nadal a run for his money but itaposs fun. It makes people smile.

As she and her new husband are both historians - who met through their research of the Regency era - they wanted their wedding to look just like something out of Bridgerton, as a way to honour our beginnings. When it came to her maid of honour, the -year-old bride decided on her childhood friend Jessica, who happens to have tattoos on her hands, legs, torso, and neck.When she asked Jessica what she intended to do about the tattoos on the big day so as to be in keeping with the traditional look, Jessica replied that, although she understood how important the theme was to the couple, she wasnapost going to be covering up her body art. Although the bride admits she was a little mfed by this reluctance, she didnapost push things any further and wanted to respect Jessicaaposs boundaries. She also wasnapost too worried, as the bridesmaids would be wearing gloves, meaning only her neck tattoos would be visible. Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. However, on the day itself, Jessica turned up wearing short gloves rather than the long ones the bride had expected, meaning her arm tattoos were on full display. Sheaposd also had her neckline unexpectedly adjusted at the last minute, taking her by surpriseTaking to Reddit, she recalled: I did not expect this and was kind of thrown off, but after a while, I stopped caring and was busy having the best day of my le.However fast forward to a few weeks ago, I got back the first set of pictures from my wedding day and the pics with Jessica in them were jarring, to say the least, because of her tattoos. It was honestly so out of place since I had asked my photographer to edit the pics to give them a historic portrait-like look. I wanted a particular pic of my husband and I, our families plus maid of honour and best man framed. However,anyone saw that pic the first thing they would’ve noticed was Jessica’s tattoos, and not my husband and I.The poster, who goes by the username u NefariousnessSafe, continued: I really wanted this one particular picture to look like an actual portrait drawn in  so I went ahead and asked the photographer to digitally remove the tattoos.The post-Photoshop pic came in the mail yesterday and I showed it to Jessica, I knew she would get annoyed with this and I was ready to apologize sincerely, but also let her know that I wonapost be ing the picture. Jessica was very very mad when she saw the pic and told me this was a narcissistic and disrespectful thing to do and stormed out of my house, she was madder than I ever expected her to be so now I’m not sureI was truly way out of line, or just a little bit selfish. Giving further clarication, the poster explained that she believes Jessicaaposs tattoos to be beautul and uniquely her, but simply felt they didnapost fit in with the theme of the ceremony. Her fellow Reddit users have sympathised with her position, agreeing that, as artistic as Jessicaaposs tattoos may well be, she shouldnapost have changed her neckline or gloves without first discussing it. They wrote: Franklyshe wasn’t willing to wear the clothes the poster provided then she should have declined being in the wedding party. Another said: You were wearing period costumes that you paid for and she modied herswithout your consent. The bride and groom are supposed to be the focus of attention at their own wedding, but she dominated the pictures because she insisted on displaying tattoos. If she couldnapost respect your wishes, then you have every right to mody any and all pictures to be consistent with that period and to keep the focus on yourself and your husband.Do you have a wedding-related story to share  We pay for stories.

In a video shared via TikTok, Adrian Ghervan, from London, could be seen pouring a portion of brown basmati rice into a glass, which he then filled up with a can of Coca-Cola.Adrian then wrapped the glass in clingfilm before setting it aside for a full  hours, during which time he claims the rice will have been perfectly cooked. The rice - which had absorbed the soft drink at this point - did indeed resemble the size and texture of cooked rice, however, a number of his followers were sceptical about how cooked it actually was. Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. Adrianaposs original post has so far clocked up more than , likes and has raised more than a few eyebrows. Many have noted that this method could actually prove pretty dangerous, given that the rice isnapost technically cooked. One person shuddered: Isnapost that how you get food poisoning ” While another pointed out: “Mate it’s not cooked it’s just soaked. A third suggested: “Why not just boil it for  minutes, quicker, cheaper and you don’t need to add a sugary chemical drink.According toHealthline,eating raw or undercooked rice can increase a personaposs risk of food poisoning, given that rice can harbour harmful bacteria, such as Bacillus cereus . Although this bacteria isnapost usually a concern with freshly cooked rice, when it comes to raw, uncooked, or improperly stored rice, the cooler temperatures could well cause it to grow. With this in mind, foodies should be very careful when it comes to how they cook their rice and should know that cooking rice at high temperatures minimizes the growth of harmful bacteria.This most recent video comes shortly after Adrian went viral for frying an egg using tea-light candles, claiming this to be an efficient way to save on energy bills.Do you have an unusual cooking hack to share  We pay for stories.

Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. Amanda said: “I found this cabinet and had a space in my living room that was in need of a cabinet. When I found this piece, I knew I could turn it into something beautul. “First, I took off all the hardware, nails, screws, and glass, before cleaning the whole piece from top to bottom. I decided to close the sides of the cabinet and keep the glass on the doors. “I used a thin backer board to fill in the space left by the glass and enclose the cabinet sides. Next, I filled in the holes and caulked all the seams, before I prepped the cabinet for paint. She continued: “I sanded the inside, as well as the outside, and then used ‘Grizzle Gray’ by Sherwin Williams to paint the whole cabinet. “I used a paint sprayer to get a clean, even look and once the paint was dry, I installed the original hardware for the doors as I loved the character they added to the cabinet.Amanda, who lives with her husband TJ and one-year-old son AJ, built the shelves from thick plywood, as she needed to be able to support the weight of the items she wanted to display. She measured and chopped the plywood, and then added a pine board to the front so as to create a “cleaner” finish. According to Amanda: “This makes a more professional look, as plywood has a raw, unattractive edge and I also stained the shelves before installing [this.] “I created cleats along the back and sides to support the shelves and brackets with pine boards and used wood putty to fill in the holes.” Amanda spent £.on new glass  and £.on wood and other such materials, with custom-made glass added to the doors, which she had measured and had cut at a local glass shop, setting her back £. . Altogether, the transformation took Amanda three days to complete from beginning to end and saw her spend a purse-friendly total of £. .To her delight, crafty Amanda believes she’s saved hundreds of pounds by “flipping” her furniture, having come across similar items online priced between £. to £,. . Amanda continued: “I absolutely love it. It fits our space perfectly and is completely custom. I used the original hardware to keep some of the same character and charm that it originally had, but with more of a modern feel. “It’s a fraction of the price of buying a new one. When looking at furniture, don’t let the first impression scare you away. Look at the bones of the piece andyou can see potential, know you can turn it into something that fits your style. Sharing the results with her . million TikTok followers, Amanda racked up more than , views and , likes for a clip that shows off the dramatic before and after revamp.She begins the vid by showing the old wooden cabinet, which looks in need of a bit of love, before cutting to the beautul finished product.One admiring person gushed, “I love it!

Explaining how a woman dropped off her -year-old dog to be euthanised, the vet said the poor pooch spent its final moments desperately scanning the room for her owner. She added: I told her we didn’t have a vet in clinic as she was on farm calls all day, but she insisted on leaving her there at am knowing that our vet wouldn’t be back until well after pm. She was too busy to bring her back later, so she left her sweet girl to be alone all day before dying.  I kept her with me for most of the day, took her for a small walk, bought her a cheeseburger and donut on my lunch and laid on the ground and cuddled her while she cried, scared and confused. I kissed her and told her she was a good girl while she crossed the rainbow bridge, but her eyes never stopped looking for her family. Dogs know what’s happening, don’t do this to them. Be there when they cross that bridge. It won’t kill you, I promise.Sharing their sympathies with those unable to stay with their pets as the injection is administered, the vet stressed: This very obviously does not apply to anyone who had absolutely no choice during the pandemic.While most users thanked the vet for their honestly, others recalled their own heartbreaking experiences with having to say goodbye to a beloved pet.One user said: While it is one of the hardest things we ever have to do, itaposs our last gt of love to them, after a letime of devotion. We stopped at McDonaldaposs and I ordered her a chocolate sundae. She had refused food for two days prior, but had a tentative, single lick of the chocolate while we cuddled her. My vet is one of the kindest people alive. He comes out to our car and gives her a big cuddle. He positions us so I can cuddle her and look into her eyes as she passes. He wants the last thing she sees to be me reassuring her. He checks her heart beat and steps away to let us have a private moment together, and I can hear him behind his own car having a quite cry to himself. He goes back in to treat his next patient, and when I am ready I go in to thank him. He cries again, I cry too. He gives me a hug and I head home with my lovely girl, to place her with her mates who went before her. Another added: I recently held my sweet little angel baby as her body went limp in my arms. A piece of me died that day but she was surrounded by love and died peacefully in my arms feeling safe. I cannot fathom not being there for her as she drew her last breaths. We truly don’t deserve the love, adoration and loyalty of dogs. A third said: I lost two dogs and a cat this year and my we and I rearrange our schedules to be with them as much as possible before they were put down and we were there during the procedures. It was horrible but we had them for  and  years so they were family. While I can understand not wanting to acknowledge that itaposs happening and wanting to pretend that they are just in the other room, trust me that itaposs better to be there for every second you can for closure and support.

Morgan, from the US, visited a hairdresser last year in the hopes of bagging a stylish platinum blonde look but was left devastated when she left the salon with disastrous results.In a video, the woman said: I think it’s hysterical now I look back on it but at the time it was super traumatic for me. Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. The person who did my hair had apparently been doing hair for  years. They told me she specialised in blonde and I was like aposOk cool, I want to be blonde blonde … I want to be platinum.apos But Morgan, who posts on TikTok under the username @morganjade, was then told by her stylist that she wouldnapost be able to have the style sheaposd asked, and the pair had a back and forth for some time about what she could have done instead.Eventually, Morgan agreed to settle for a balayage, which is a technique of applying highlights to the hair and would prevent the stylist from bleaching Morganaposs whole head - which could have damaged her hair because of how dark her base colour was. The woman allowed her hairdresser to finish her hair without her looking at it so she could be surprised at the end, but warning bells began ringing when she was told there were still spots left that needed touching up.She explained in another video: She blowdries my hair and straightens it for me and all the while I’m not looking at it. She’s got me turned around and I don’t what to see it until it’s done. I was getting excited. She was like, aposthere’s definitely some spots I want to touch up, so we’re going to let your hair rest and then next week, I’m going to have you come in and I’m going to touch these spots up.apos So I was like spots  She turns me around and I saw exactly what she meant. I was in utter disbelief. I was in shock. My face, I’m sure it was just white - pale as a ghost.  Instead of the flowing blonde that Morgan had hoped for, she was left with chunky blonde highlights that stopped abruptly before her roots, as well as several patches that resembled leopard print spots. She added: I felt sick to my stomach instantly, there were spots like literally leopard print spots in my hair. I didn’t even have words. Morgan admitted she ended up paying the full for the service plus a small tip, even though she wasnapost happy. And after breaking down in tears when she got outside of the salon, she called her mum who advised her to go back and tell the owner of the hairdresseraposs that she wasnapost impressed - and demand they fix her hair. The woman explained she did eventually get her hair fixed by the owner of the salon, and commenters on the video were quick to offer their sympathies to her. One person said: “I’m a stylist and I don’t know how a trained professional could let someone leave like that.” While another added: Oh hell no they better have fixed your hair for free at this point, I would have freaked out.Do you have a story to sell  Get in touch with us at yourmirror@trinitymirror .Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON HairstylesUmm what Viral\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\" to FREE email alerts with news to brighten your daySubscribeInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Arthur Ozerov has spent the past few years making a name for himself on the Kyiv drag circuit under the stage name AuRa. When not dressing up and wowing crowds, the -year-old was busy looking after his bee colony.As with many people in Ukraine, the Russian invasion at the end of February has required Arthur to turn his le in a dferent direction quite suddenly.Now on his social media s Arthur can be seen donning a camouflage unorm, having first signed up to the military at the beginning of March.  The openly gay man has taken a position in military administration with a focus on logistical coordination of local relief efforts.When asked why he stepped up and joined the battle against the Russian invaders, he told LGBTQ Nation : “I love my country. Therefore, I decided that I should make every effort to somehow help.“I can’t just sit home and watch how people are killed, houses are destroyed.” Arthur, who was married previously to a woman before realising something was missing, is out of the closet and supported by his friends. The role Arthur is performing in the military, and the clear pride he has for his country, may help to improve the reputation of LGTBQ people in a country with a complicated relationship with the community. As in Russia, gay marriage is banned in Ukraine, and attitudes about it are generally more conservative than in the UK.While gender and sexuality politics are not at the forefront of peopleaposs minds when hundreds of thousands of troops enter their country, they are clearly a key part of Vladimir Putinaposs propaganda war. In the past decade the Russian president has spoken forcefully for traditional values - a euphemism for nuclear, heterosexual families - and done much to undermine the safety and prosperity of those in the LGBTQ community. The  law banning “propaganda for non-traditional sexual relationships” among minors not only restricted opportunities speak and inform about sexuality and gender issues in public, but also designated homosexuality as a danger to children and to society. In  a ban on same-sex marriage was added to the Russian Constitution. The Kremlin has spun a narrative that LGBT rights are a weapon used by the West to weaken and destabilise Russia, the Boston Review reports. Speaking to students in Belarus in , Russia’s foreign minister Sergey Lavrov said Christian values needed to be protected from “same-sex values that are being imposed . . . coarsely and openly.” When the countryaposs tanks rolled into Ukraine on February , Putinaposs dramatic late-night speech was carefully drafted to touch on his hot button, culture war issues. Properly speaking, the attempts to use us in their own interests never ceased until quite recently: they sought to destroy our traditional values and force on us their  values that would erode us, our people from within, the attitudes they have been aggressively imposing on their countries, attitudes that are directly leading to degradation and degeneration, because they are contrary to human nature, he said.  This is not going to happen. No one has ever succeeded in doing this, nor will they succeed now. Patriarch Kirill, the leader of the Russian Orthodox Church, has been even more explicit about what he understands to be at stake in the war. For eight years there have been attempts to destroy what exists in Donbas, he said, referring to the long contested eastern Ukrainian state. Donbas has fundamentally refused to accept the so-called values that are being offered by those aspiring for worldwide power. There is a specic test of loyalty to these powers, a requirement for being permitted into the happy world of excessive consuming and apparent freedom. This test is very straightforward and at the same time horrying—the gay parade. The demand to organize a gay-parade is a test of loyalty to this powerful world. The implication when it comes to Ukraine is that the country is stuck in a tug-of-war between the liberal West and Russia, halfway between its liberal and conservative values.

An emotional Volodymyr Zelensky again accused Moscow of ­genocide after he toured the devastated town of Bucha, where  residents were found dead, some bound and gagged.The Ukrainian President claimed ­thousands of people have been murdered and butchered by rampaging Russian troops since they invaded the country. As more mass graves were discovered, Mr Zelensky said: “It will be recognised by the world as genocide. We know of ­thousands of people killed and tortured, with their limbs severed, women raped and children killed.”  Speaking about the massacre in Bucha, just outside the capital Kyiv, he added: “Hundreds of people were killed, tortured. Corpses on the street, mined areas. Even the bodies of the dead were mined. “Concentrated evil has come to our land. Murderers, torturers, rapists, looters who call ­themselves the army, and who deserve only death after what they did.” But shameless Moscow officials accused Ukrainians of staging the killings. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said: “From what we have seen, our experts have identied signs of video falsication and other fakes.” Mr Zelensky has set up a special body to ­investigate Russian war crimes – a call echoed by US President Joe Biden.He said: “I decided to create a special ­mechanism of justice in Ukraine to ­investigate and prosecute every crime of the occupiers in our country.” It will include “international experts, ­investigators, ­prosecutors and judges”. More than  corpses have been ­examined by forensic ­scientists preparing dossiers for future war crimes tribunals. Intelligence chiefs have a target list of Russian troops from  infantry brigades allegedly behind atrocities in Bucha.In Motyzhyn, to the west of Kyiv, the bodies of four people who appeared to have been shot at close range were seen in a pit. Boris Johnson branded the discovery “sickening”. Keir Starmer said Russian soldiers involved in war crimes in Ukraine should know “for the rest of their lives” they will be “chased down” and prosecuted. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss last night called for Russia to be kicked off the UN’s Human Rights Council over the ­atrocities. She said: “After these appalling crimes, Russia has no place on it.”As many as  schools daily have been hit by warplanes since the invasion started, Save The ­Children revealed. More than two million kids have fled while around . million remain. Up to , ­civilians are still unable to leave the besieged town of Mariupol. Grim ­statistics reveal  children have been killed and  injured.  Ukraine’s foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba said the port city had suffered an even worse onslaught than Bucha. He added: “The horrors we have seen in Bucha are just the tip of the iceberg of all the crimes that have been committed by the Russian army in Ukraine.” An evacuation convoy escorted by the International Committee of the Red Cross was blocked in the town of Manhush as it attempted to reach Mariupol last night. Kharkiv resident Olena Kolesnik, who fled to Poland, said: “This is genocide. This is fascism.

However the couple now face orce proceedings from one of their wives, Agatha, as the idea of polygamy isn’t as appealing as she once thought.“She wanted to have me all to herself,” Arthur, who has an OnlyFans page where he makes £, a month, told Jam Press. “It didn’t make sense – we have to share. “I was very sad about the separation and even more surprised by her excuse. “She said that she was missing a monogamous relationship.  “My other wives thought her attitude was wrong and that she accepted the marriage for adventure and not for real feelings. “I know I’ve lost a we, but I’m not going to replace her at the moment.” Now, he faces orce from Agatha following the separation.Despite his plans to hold off on marrying anyone new for the time being, Arthur hopes to marry two more women to bring his number of wives up to an even . He added: “I have a dream – my wish has always been to have  wives. “I only have one daughter, but I want to have [a child] with each one of my wives. “The love I feel for each of them is the same.

She said Vladimir Putin is hiding the scale of the war from Russian families, who many claim were deceived by authorities into sending their sons to fight.  Obviously, believing that the bodies of servicemen of the Russian Federation are not worthy toto their homeland and be buried humanely, Ms Vereshchuk said during an all-Ukrainian telethon. At the same time, the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine has developed and approved a step-by-step procedure for their transfer.

Growing evidence points to barbarism in Bucha with local women and children raped and shot and demands are growing for accountability over atrocities by Vladimir Putinaposs forces. Ukrainian reporter Evgeny Spirin said: “Some of the killed children had their arms tied up. Children…. They were tying up children. There were shot dogs.  He added: “Irpen, Bucha, Dmitrievka. How to live with this, and is it worth living at all  How do I explain this to myself, how  “They must cease to exist. They must all be destroyed, each and every one of them, turned into dust, into mud, into clay, all of them.”Ukrainian activists and web sleuths have identied the presence of Omurbekov’s forces - which are normally based in the far east of Russia - and a number of other Russian military units. Volunteers group Tretya Sila reported: In Bucha there was a military unit  from the village of Knyaze-Volkonskoye, Khabarovsk region... “Soon all these murderers, rapists and looters will be known by name. InformNapalm volunteers named Omurbekov as unit  of the th Separate Motorized Rle Brigade amid suspicions of grotesque war crimes in Bucha. In the city, too, according to the Ukrainians, were forces from the Fth Separate Guards Tank Brigade of th army of the Russian Eastern military district, the st Parachute Assault Regiment of th airborne ision, the th Parachute Assault Regiment of th airborne ision, the th and th Air Assault Regiments of the th Guards Air Assault Division,  and  separate guard brigades of special purpose the rd special operational regiments of the Russian national guard, and the th separate guards brigade of marines of the Pacic Fleet.  So far no commanders have been named from these forces apart from Omurbekov. Russian sources have hit back claiming the Ukrainians were responsible for the atrocities in Bucha and other locations - and are the ones guilty of war crimes. Russian ambassador to the US Anatoly Antonov said: “The Russian defence ministry has fully rejected these  accusations.” He said: ”I would like to point out that Russian troops left Bucha on March . “The Ukrainian authorities remained silent all these days, and now they have suddenly posted sensational footage in order to tarnish Russia’s image and make Russia defend itself.  I would like to emphasise with full responsibility that not a single civilian suffered from violence when the town was controlled by the Russian Armed Forces.ed Forces. On the contrary, our troops delivered  tonnes of humanitarian aid for civilians. Meanwhile, the fact that the Ukrainian Armed Forces shelled the town of Bucha right after Russian troops had left was deliberately ignored in the US. “This is what could have caused civilian casualties. That said, the Kiev regime is clearly trying to blame its atrocities on Russia.” Konstantin Kosachev, deputy speaker of the Russian upper house of parliament, said: “There are no doubts that it is a staging organised by Kyiv authorities. “And the fact that the West has picked it up and is hyping it makes it an accomplice of this cynical and immoral crime.”  Foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova claimed Kyiv colluded with the West in seeking to blame Russia. I think that the very fact that these statements were made minutes after these materials were released leaves no doubts as for who has contracted this story, she told state-run Rossiya- television channel. The West decided immediately Russia was to blame “based on the videos, seconds-long videos and several photos. “And they are ready to pour accusations. “No expert work done, no information from the other side throwing light on what is going on... She claimed the massacres were a provocation staged by the Ukrainian military and radical nationalists” to disrupt peace talks.

Much of the chamber music that Mozart composed was music for friends to perform and this trio is just one of these.Originally composed for clarinet, viola and piano, the viola part can be performed on cello as Harriet ably demonstrated. Very typically Mozart # easy to listen to and thoroughly enjoyable.On to the Craftsbury Trio, written by the American Gwyneth Walker. This trio has four movements, each depicting the small town of Craftsbury, Vermont.Up Country Toccata, The Lark in the Morning, You Can Buy It at the General Store, to the final movement Craftsbury Common depicting the green with a white picket fence.The movements are as descriptive as their titles and show many dferent skills on all instruments # fluttering sounds, jazz harmonies, numerous glissandos, syncopation, decorations and finishing with gentle rhythmic tapping.There is even a hint of Rhapsody in Blue in the third movement. If you only listen to one piece again this is the one and should be seen live,possible, and not just listened to.Rachmaninov’s Prelude in B minor for solo piano was Claire’s choice for the programme.This prelude, The Bell was Rachmaninov’s own favourite and was the one that he would often perform. The audience was delighted to be introduced to it by Claire.Brahms composed four chamber works which featured the clarinet later in le after a period when he wasn’t writing anything at all.This was the third trio of the evening and was again very dferent in style allowing Jenner , Harrietand Claireto demonstrate their considerable skills as a trio to a very appreciative audience.An arrangement of Consolation No. by Liszt for Trio Ecossaise was their encore.This was the second visit by Trio, and it is only a matter of time before they are welcomed back.There are two MAAA concerts planned for April # The Willow Trioand the Ugly Bug Ragtime Three.

It’s a hormone which helps build trust and attachment, as opposed to cortisol, which increases stress levels.We do sometimes need cortisol when faced with a challenge or fearful situation, so it does have its . It’s part of our fight and flight response. But the problem arises when levels remain too high for an extended period of time, as this keeps our bodies under a constant state of stress.When this happens, it can cause anxiety and depression, but also lots of physical issues such as headaches and tummy pain. It’s very dficult to concentrate and remember things when we are in this state.The study showed that for children in hospital, a time full of stress and worry for many reasons, storytelling resulted in an increase in oxytocin levels and reduction of cortisol, and so made the children feel less anxious and stressed, and even helped ease their physical pain.While the context of this research was children in the very stressful situation of being in hospital, I think the results and conclusions are also relevant for children in other stressful settings, including at school and home. I’m not making a direct comparison, but we’ve not had ‘normal times’ recently, and even in usual times, high levels of stress can be a big issue for many. So levels of stress and anxiety are heightened, even beyond the ‘normal’ for many of us.Some of the language in the article is related to the science of the findings, but the conclusions and observations are things teachers, parents and storytellers of all kinds will recognise. It describes how children being told the story “are transported to another possible world during storytelling sessions” and can “elicit positive physiological and psychological changes”. In other words, it can have a positive effect on physical and mental health.This transportation to “another possible world” is what storytellers often refer to as the story trance. It’s when children are absorbed in a story, and taken by their imagination to the world the story creates. The report explains that this absorption stimulates ious parts of the brain and aids the listener’s development of empathy, as well as a better understanding of their own emotions.None of this is really surprising, of course. But it’s really useful to have this kind of scientic back-up. An important finding was that the stories told were ones widely available and not specically adapted for therapeutic use just the kind of tales you find in a book from the library.And while they used professional storytellers for the research, a key point was that everyone can have this impact, including parents and caregivers: “It is important to note that even though we have used experienced storytellers for our research purposes, we believe that parents should be encouraged to tell their children stories. As we have shown, it is not necessary to use special stories or books or even specic techniques to achieve a successful outcome. Storytelling can be an effective means of creating important emotional bonds.”As I have said, this study looked at the impact of storytelling for children in hospital, which can be a deeply distressing time for both child and parents.Reading the report made me remember the time I was seven years old in the Western General Hospital, in an isolation ward by myself, very ill. I was told a story about a dragon who lived in a castle, and was given a model castle, made from used toilet rolls, and painted silver. I’d look at it when I was alone, which I always was except for visits. It was a stage for my imagination. I’d speak to the dragon and imagine the adventures I’d have with him when I finally got out of hospital. These stories were always my secret, but they helped me get out of hospital and have fun, when in the real world I could do neither.The thing is, our kids, as well ourselves, need this. The story is part of it, the characters, the challenges, the suspense, the connection to the emotions in the tale. It all works on our brain and our being. But it’s also the process of storytelling: the togetherness it creates, the shared space and attention, the heart-to-heart connection, the stimulation of imagination. Not even the best film on a screen does that.We are all storytellers, but sometimes it is good to be reminded just how important it is to be so, and that includes listening to, as well as telling, stories.As the report concluded: “Stories possess a symbolic dimension that seems to create a natural bridge to the core of our humanity.”"},{"url":null,"title":"leading-pig-farmers-plea-cabinet-secretary","story":"Mairi Gougeon MSP was accompanied by county MSP Paul McLennan on the visit to one of several high-health pig farms run by Mr Wyllie.Pig farms across Scotland are all operating at a substantial and growing loss.Mr Wyllie, of Ruchlaw Mains, Stenton, estimates that losses of about £ per pig in February last year have since deepened to more than £ per pig. Overdrafts are rising at an alarming rate and several Scottish farmers have already sold off sows to cut losses.The pig sector encountered signicant disruption during the Covid- pandemic which affected processing capacity and saw the partial closure of Scotland’s largest pig abattoir facility at Brechin.Much to the disappointment of NFU Scotland, several major retailers have continued to stock signicant volumes of imported pork, undermining, the union says, home production.And the dramatic spike in animal feed prices in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine has also signicantly increased the scale of current losses on pig farms.It is in the interests of Scottish consumers, processors, and retailers, adds the union, that farmgate prices for pigs rise immediately to stave off a rapid rate of herd liquidations.Speaking on behalf of NFU Scotland, Mr Wyllie thanked the Cabinet Secretary for the pig hardship scheme in Scotland, established following the Covid-driven closure of the Brechin abattoir, but called on her to consider further immediate, direct support for the sector to ensure a critical mass of production was preserved.He also asked for the Scottish Government to consider an ‘Ongoers’ loan scheme to help financially support those who saw their future in the industry.NFU Scotland called on the Scottish Government to seek greater retailer support for Scottish pork, highlighting that a small percentage increase in the volume of home-produced pork on supermarket shelves would make a considerable dference.Help in re-establishing the Chinese export licence at Brechin, lost because of the Covid outbreak at the plant, would also expand the market opportunities for Scottish pig producers.At a UK level, NFU Scotland called for the Scottish Government to push Westminster on the need for “proper border controls” to monitor pork imports and for the English language requirements for overseas butchers looking to come to the UK to work in the staff-strapped processing sector to be relaxed."},{"url":null,"title":"six-county-schools-come-together-climate-change-event","story":"Teams of  pupils had to produce a plan for a product or initiative and an accompanying poster and presentation, which was made to a judging .Belhaven Hill School hosted the event, which was attended by pupils from Gordonstoun Junior School, Strathallan Prep School, Ardvreck, Fettes Prep and Cargilfield, earlier this month.The categories for the climate change event were defined by the annual Earthshot Prize, with each team choosing from: the restoration and protection of nature air cleanliness ocean revival waste-free living and climate action.Olly Langton, Belhaven Hill headmaster, said: “We want to ensure our pupils know that they can have a signicant impact on their environment now and in the future.“So my we Rosie and I came up with the idea of developing a Community of Prep and Primary Schoolsin Scotland to energise the children and bring them together to form an alliance to protect the things they love.“We were also keen to involve members of the local Dunbar community, where there is a strong environmental ethos which encourages collaboration.”The teams presented to a  of judges from the sustainability sector: Jonathan Hodges, senior innovation engineer at Wave Energy Scotland Duncan Lang, senior environment specialist at the Asian Development Bank and Izzy Heard, technical officer for the Climate Disclosure Project.The lists introduced themselves before watching each -minute presentation and giving immediate feedback.The teams completed a number of environmentally themed talks and activities, while Surfers Against Sewage encouraged youngsters to ‘Think Global Act Local’.“It was a pleasure to hear the great ideas and passionate presentations from this next generation of climate-aware thinkers,” said Mr Hodges.“The projects started by these students have already created positive change in their schools and communities, and I have no doubt they will follow-up with more.”In the afternoon, pupils took part in the Scottish Prep Schools Debating Championship – the motion challenged the children to consider whether short-haul flights should be banned.Edinburgh’s Cargilfield triumphed in both competitive elements of the day.The prize for outstanding inidual award on the day went to a pupil from Ardvreck, who went away with a voucher for a surfing lesson at Belhaven Bay, thanks to the generosity of CoastCoast.The next day, the bay was also the location for the first ForthSHORE beach clean by pupils from Belhaven with GreenTweed Eco.All the children took away a bird box, thanks to the East Lothian Primary Schools Bird Box Project, sponsored by ArdMoor, and a certicate.The next stage of the venture is for all of the schools to take part in a joint fundraising venture in the summer term.

Poverty is very much still with us, even within our most well-off communities. East Lothian Council has an updated poverty strategy and the local area partnerships have had specic funding to tackle poverty and inequalities.The pandemic, Brexit and the war in Ukrainehave all added to the pressures on prices of le’s basics, from food to transport and utilities. A rural area like ours has many who rely on heating oil, which is now about £ a litre. Many in the villages have no public transport and need to run a car.I attend the East Lothian Friendly Food Network – a council-supported network of those involved in food from across the county. Many of those who attend are from the county’s foodbanks and community pantries.The Scottish Government recently ran a consultation on how the need for foodbanks may be ended. However, all facilities in East Lothian report growing calls for support.Those needing help include, as well as those on benefits, increasing numbers of those on low pay who find that the cost of basics is a growing proportion of their weekly income.There have been mounting calls for food that does not need cooking. There are increasing requests for help to pay for gas and electricity. The charges to those on prepaid meters are higher and the top-ups on a card last for much less time than before.One organisation has been giving hot water bottles as it’s cheaper to boil a kettle to fill a bottle than turn the heating on. Organisations across the county are arranging free community meals. Breakfast club provision for children is expanding to ensure children do not go to school hungry.I recently attended a national conference where the cost of living crisis was debated. The experience identied in East Lothian is replicated across the UK.The Chancellor’s Spring Statement could have given much more help than it did. Benefits and state pension remain lagging behind the rate of inflation and could have been increased VAT could have been reduced on fuel for heating, lighting and cooking the uplt in Universal Credit could have been restored the increase in National Insurance waived. Sadly, those with the least income are those who lost out and will continue to see the cost of living eating into their weekly money pot.In the meantime, residents can continue to support the many excellent local organisations offering support, whether as donations of food, money or volunteering time.

People are also being advised to take a test prior to visiting someone who is vulnerable.If you develop symptoms, you should continue to get a PCR test.On vaccination, the First Minister said: “The advice to everyone, of course, remains as important as ever – please do take the opportunity to get vaccinated as soon as you are able and make sure you get all doses of vaccine that you are eligible for. This remains the most important thing any of us can do to protect ourselves and others.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Now, many highly-skilled people have found themselves unemployed for the first time, and are considering new roles in new sectors. Jobcentre Plus can quickly put companies in touch with candidates who can make a real dference to their businesses.We talk to employers and employees about how they have benefited from working with Jobcentre Plus. vw, px\"  ‘Working with Jobcentre Plus is a no brainer’: Jordan, Contracts Manager, Elite Scaffolding, YeovilElite Scaffolding – a family-owned business that is part of the Denholm Group, reached out to Jobcentre Plus in a bid to reach younger potential employees looking for an apprenticeship.#We initially approached the jobcentre, simply for advice and to askthey could place an ad on their system. We did not expect the extremely positive and proactive response we received from the jobcentre. The team was very helpful,# said Jordan.The support Elite got from the jobcentre was invaluable in streamlining and accelerating its recruitment process which would take up to five weeks.#Now, the jobcentre advertises our vacancies via a sector-based work academy.#Candidates attend a two-week course at Weston College, Yeovil, to gain their Scaffolding Operative Training Scheme and Health  Safety Certications, as well as to prepare for an interview. Now when we interview candidates, they already have a scaffold labourer trainee card and the basic knowledge and understanding of the scaffolding industry. What’s more, all this support via the jobcentre comes without the additional fees of private agencies.#Out of seven candidates, six were offered jobs and five have remained with Elite which has  qualied operatives.#The process was seamless and effective, providing quality candidates who were keen to learn.#Working with the jobcentre is a no brainer! As well as alleviating the burden of interviews that don’t progress into jobs, the savings in cost and time to get candidates suitably qualied are a bonus. It takes the pressure off our own resources and provides top quality candidates in the process.#‘Delighted’: Simon, Employer Adviser, Yeovil JobCentreOnce approached by Elite Scaffolding, also based in Yeovil, he set up a meeting with one of its office managers and worked out a bespoke recruitment package.As part of the programme, he contacted the local Weston College and together they “built” the course content.At the end of the two-week course, six candidates were offered a place on the apprenticeship scheme at a starting salary of £,.#Elite had exhausted all other channels to recruit and were delighted with the outcome#, he said.Moreover Elite referred other local employers to the jobcentre and Simon is running another sector-based work academy with a local roofing company.#The jobcentre has an incredible pool of talent.

Everything went through really quickly.#Continued the  year-old: “My team at JD were great from day one. They made me feel welcome and supported me. I spent six months on the placement and I got paid, too. It’s a proper job which was exactly what I needed. Day to day, I’d look after anything from HR queries and issuing contracts to payroll and pension questions. It gave me a whole picture of what it’s like to work in HR and I’ve been doing it ever since.“After six months, there was the option to stay on and I’m now doing an apprenticeship with JD. Once I’d finished with the placement I got started on a qualication – CIPD level three in HR support. It was another perfect step for me and I’ve now been there for a year.

The identity of a person could undoubtedly be forged by the place of their birth and the community of that place, particularly at a time in the past when populations were less mobile.The traits of a person’s parents manest in their physical appearance their spirit, likes and dislikes, and sometimes even interests or inclinations might appear hereditary – not just from mother and father but perhaps from an ancestor remembered only by name and special characteristic, like poesy or craft skill..The failure by clan chiefs and other landed gentry to recognise this customary right held by the people since time immemorial underpins the Clearances, while demands for its recognition echo through much of the collective action undertaken against this violence, trauma, and dispossession. as far back in history as I can.The world and society these people lived in was so dferent to ours today, making context crucial to understanding the words being used and the philosophy from which they derive.Aside from the multitude which are in still in use today, there are published proverb collections as well as countless sound recordings, many digitized and made easily accessible by Tobar an Dualchais.By their nature proverbs cut across boundaries of class and gender, their survival relying upon oral transmission, on being commonly known in a community and thus reflecting its values.

It is now surely a matter of huge regret for our communities that so many small-scale care providers # despite their good reputation and obvious appeal in rural parts of the country – have been allowed to wither on the vine and disappear. on standards which followed the Covid outbreak in April and May .Budhmor’s owners are not a shadowy offshore conglomerate trying to put profit before care – but CrossReach, the social arm of the Church of Scotland. Despite their benevolent roots, the modern pressures facing the sector, they say, simply make it too dficult to keep their Portree home open.The building needs too much work and they don’t have the money to pay for it.The only option, families were told, is closure – with the suggestion that the  residents could all be accommodated nearby in a refurbished and expanded Home Farm.It is not dficult to understand why families are so aggrieved at this proposal.Things may well have improved at Home Farm since the horrors of Covid, but have all the lessons been learned The blanket national policy of shting patients from hospitals to care homes in the frantic weeks of early  was a huge factor in the devastating Covid death toll that followed.Yet now, with the pandemic still not behind us, families in Skye are being told they should accept the transfer en masse of their elderly relatives to the very home so ravaged by coronavirus when it was proven to be over capacity and understaffed.At Budhmor, they managed to keep the home safe from the worst of Covid-. Relatives of residents will tell you that was no fluke – but down to good standards, diligent management and conscientious staff.There will be some truth in the financial and staffing pressures that CrossReach cite in their reasons for closure. But two years on from the outset of Covid, should the sector not be doing all it can to preserve and build on the success of an institution which proved such a good example during the pandemic, rather than bowing to the bottom line and accepting its loss.There is also the matter of an options appraisal on health and care needs in the north of Skye, currently being prepared by NHS Highland.Closure must at the very least be halted until this review is complete – andthis requires support for CrossReach, our Government should find it.In the longer term what we really need are alternative models to those that are currently governed by economies of scale than on inidual or community needs. An agenda of rationalisation and centralisation has taken hold of far too many of our public services and is ultimately driving decisions like the closure of small care facilities offering a homely, personalised environment in favour of a vast, but possibly distant one many miles from an inidual’s home community.No-where has this been more obvious, or dangerous, than in the west Highland health and care sector.We should start the fightback by backing Budhmor care home, and keeping it open."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1636624618731.jpg--firmus_announce_another_price_hike___this_time_by_16_31_.jpg?1636624618000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20220331newsfirmus announce another price hike this time by 16 31","story":"Firmus energy has today announced an increase of .% from May ,  for gas customers in the Ten Towns area, impacting around , domestic customers.

Raymond Gormley, Head of Energy Policy at the Consumer Council said: “It is important that consumers are made aware that their domestic gas bills will stay high for at least the next year because the wholesale price that the companies pay for the gas continues to be much more expensive than the norm.

With the signicant rise in the cost of living, particularly the continued increase in gas and electricity prices, many are struggling to provide the basics of food and heat. Recent research indicated that one in every four children in Northern Ireland are living in a family which is struggling to provide basic requirements of heat, food, clothing, and childcare. Under these pressures many families are at risk of getting into further debt and are heavily reliant on food banks to supplement their financial situation. Carol Ervine, Choice Group Director of Tenant and Client Services said,“As an organisation we are committed to providing more than bricks and mortar and realise that whilst having a home is a human right, there are many who are living with the real threat of poverty and financial instability. With the cost of living continuing to rise, the cost of the weekly shop has become signicantly higher, and many families are making the decision between heating or eating. Working with the Trussell Trust, we are able to provide much needed food parcels to families in need, with the knowledge that this will ease at least part of the burden. The Trussell Trust support a UK network of food banks providing emergency food and support to people in poverty whilst campaigning for change to end the need for food banks in the UK. The Trust recently outlined that in the year  , .m food bank parcels were given to people in crisis in the past year across the UK with close to , emergency food parcels distributed across Northern Ireland in the same period. Jonny Currie, Northern Ireland Network Lead from the Trussell Trust said,“We welcome this partnership with Choice Housing providing vital support to our network of food banks in Northern Ireland. Food banks and their volunteers are extraordinary, and their response to need in their communities is inspiring. But that kind of response shouldn’t be needed. In the last year in Northern Ireland almost , emergency food parcels were provided by food banks in the Trussell Trust’s network – and more than , of these were for children. It’s not right that some of us cannot afford our own food.That’s why we are working towards a just, compassionate future, where no one should have to use a food bank to get by. Choice also manage a Financial Inclusion programme, through which they are supporting tenants to improve their money management, ensuring they can maximise their income. In the last year this programme helped tenants access pound. million in financial gains, and specialised staff at Choice are continuing to help tenants with benefits, debt, and budgeting advice."},{"url":null,"title":"belfast familys 1957 legacy to church now worth","story":"Enter your code here\" required\"\"The access code entered is not valid.

The window remains in place today.Neither Mr Craig nor his sisters ever married, and they are understood to have remained living together at the family home until his death in June , aged in his mid s.A report in the Ballymena Observer newspaper on October , , outlined details of Mr Craig’s will.According to the report, he left a block of five shops at Church Street in Ballymena and other property and land in the town to his two sisters, along with the house in Belfast.He also left £, for the upkeep of the window at Fisherwick Church.The will stated that the remainder of Mr Craig’s estate was to be donated to the Presbyterian Church in Ireland to set up a fund called the “The Frank McCaughey Craig and Sarah Remington Charles Trust” in honour of his parents.Mr Craig requested that the fund be used to augment the “salary and stipend of clergymen who are not paid the minimum of £ a year”.However, he stressed that this was not to include “assistants or retired ministers”.The newspaper report added: “An official at Church House, Belfast, said that they had known for some time that a substantial bequest was likely. Final details were not yet available, but it was estimated that, after several bequests and other questions had been settled, the sum would be around £,.”Tragically, according to the newspaper report, Hester Craig died a few days after her brother. It is believed she was around  years-old.As a result of her death, all of the family’s assets were inherited by Sophie Craig.However, Ms Craig did not live for much longer after the deaths of her siblings. She died in February , at the age of .Deaths notices which appeared in the following day’s Newsletter and Belfast  newspapers provided very little information about Ms Craig or her family.The notices simply stated she had died at her residence at Windsor Avenue and that the house and funeral were “private”.The details of her will were subsequently published in the Belfast Gazette a couple of months later in May .The notice states the will was originally written on May ,  before alterations were made on January , , and February , , just three days before Ms Craig passed away.In her will, the Belfast woman asked that £, be bequeathed to Fisherwick Presbyterian Church for the upkeep of the window in memory of her parents, as well as for the “interior decoration” of the church.The will stated that the rest of her estate was to be donated to the Presbyterian Church in Ireland to be added to the fund set up a few years earlier as a result of her brother’s bequest.When contacted by the Sunday Independent last week, the Presbyterian Church in Ireland was unable to say how much was added to the fund following Ms Craig’s death.A spokesperson for the church was also unable to provide the current value of the fund.However, the church’s latest publicly available accounts show that the Craig trust fund was valued at £,, on December , .

The church received a idend of £, from the Craig fund in .The money generated by the fund continues to be used by the Presbyterian Church to supplement the salaries of its ministers.A spokesperson for Fisherwick Presbyterian Church said they were aware of a fund having been set up to provide for the upkeep of the prominent stained-glass window in the church.However, he added that very little was known about the origins of the fund.Most ReadFake nun banned from Clonard Monastery after eccentric behaviourTeenager dies after M motorway road traffic collisionUVF demands UDA Rathcoole chief Gary Fisher punishes thug after home attack breached local peace pactBelfast family’s  legacy to church now worth nearly £mMan hospitalised following ‘serious’ road collision in County DownTop VideosPlayVideo: Police attend sudden death on M motorway outside LurganPlayRoy Reynolds just hours before his death videoed with Michael Campbell the man accused of his murderPlayVideo: Firefighters deal with a blaze in Derriaghy Industrial Park, The CuttsLatest Northern IrelandNorthern Ireland public face questions over doctor fee as new Covid symptoms cause lateral flow issueSam McBrideOpinionDUP’s predictable warnings may resonate with some voters but focussing on Sinn Féin threat presents another problemPatient safety warning as GPs call for Stormont Executive revival after electionsMan hospitalised following ‘serious’ road collision in County DownFirst and deputy First Ministers should be filled by the willing – Naomi LongLatestWallis says excluding trans people in conversion therapy ban a ‘broken promise’Ukraine: Atrocities against civilians are shocking but not a surprise, says Gulf War Colonel Tim CollinsSerie A leaders AC Milan held to draw by BolognaPatrick Vieira’s Crystal Palace beat former club Arsenal to dent top-four hopesWayne Rooney backs Mauricio Pochettino to take over at Manchester United,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

games and British army history will be central in a major £m development of the new Down GAA centre of excellence.The former army barracks at Ballykinlar, where future Taoiseach Sean Lemass was interned in , will now seek ‘Levelling Up’ cash from the British Treasury as a pivotal funder for the plan.A special sitting of Newry, Mourne and Down Council was provided with a key note presentation on the GAA sports facility and museum of shared history from the advisory board of the project on Monday.Down County secretary, Sean Og McAteer also highlighted the project’s aim to be cross community throughout with associated Irish history being recognised as well as events marking the history of the British army for example at the battle of the Somme.“These plans have been fully endorsed by all and they will now give usa home,” said Mr McAteer.“Ballykinlar has a historical signicance that will be enshrined at a national and regional level.“We will have a full shared history, it will be huge for people to reflect.”Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up The high-spec project will now focus on ‘Round ’ of the UK treasury’s levelling up money with a closing date for applicants this July.The proposal for the centre of excellence was mooted more than  years ago in  with the Ministry of Defence , though it was felt that the political climate was not right.The plans, which were picked up again in , were approved last year by NMDDC and will witness the acre Ballykinlar site establish itself as one of the leading sports training facilities of its kind in Ireland.Support of councillors from both Down and south Armagh was sought as the application for levelling up looks set to secure agreement for a co-bid from NMDDC and Down GAA.The council had recently agreed to surrender its lease of the lands apart from Ballykinlar cross community pre-school.The centre, as well as facilitating all GAA games will also provide a MUGAand a walking periphery around the pitches.NMDDC chairperson, Cathy Masonlabelled the centre of excellence as a game changer and praised those behind the ambitious prospectus.Derry’s  All Ireland GAA winner and dual star, Colm McGurk is the architect drawing up the development of the four flood pitch site that will also incorporate a museum dedicated to cross community education and remembrance.The timetable for completion would factor in a  month construction once the first sod is turned following an earlier procurement stage.The advisory board, which has steered the development has been lauded for its cross community membership with a unionist, a former UK cabinet minister, academia and the GAA.Board member, Fergal McCormack who is managing director of PKF-FPM accountants, has leaned on the need to expedite the plans with interest from all over Ireland, London and Australia.“This project has huge potential,” said Mr McCormack.The Warrenpoint man also suggested that the former Irish president, Mary McAleese could be recognised at the facility as a highly regarded Co Down woman who reached highest office in the land.“The people of Ballykinlar were so glad of the opportunity to speak on this.“We will keep total community involvement all the way…engaging and updating.“This will not go ahead without the support from NMDDC.“We are now about to enter a very important phase in the next few months.“I’d ask the council to form a working group or task force, we need to start flagging things up very quickly,” added the board member.Follow a query from councillors, it was revealed that most of the Department of Infrastructureissues had been dealt with successfully with an update to the Tyrella junction the next phase as well as a public path to the beach being secured.With full approval from the centre of excellence awaiting only the cash flow, CEO of Tourism NI, John McGrillen speaking from a tourism meeting at the Slieve Donard hotel urged the council to “grab this with both hands”.Most ReadFake nun banned from Clonard Monastery after eccentric behaviourTeenager

Credit: Peter Dazeley Getty ImagesLisa SmythTwitterApril   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailQuestions are mounting over whether people will have to pay to see their GP once free lateral flow tests are scrapped in Northern Ireland.The Department of Health has said the testing regime is being kept under review as it emerged officials in England have added a raft of symptoms of a potential Covid- infection.Throughout the pandemic, the UK public has been told a new, continuous cough, fever and loss of taste or smell are signs of a coronavirus infection.However, shortness of breath, unexplained tiredness, lack of energy, muscle aches or pains not due to exercise, not wanting to eat or not feeling hungry, headache that is unusual, sore throat, stuffy or runny nose, diarrhoea, or feeling or being sick have been added to the list of symptoms on the UK Government website.There are concerns over the addition of symptoms as health officials consider scaling back the availability of tests to the general public in the coming months.Dr Alan Stout, chair of the British Medical Association’s GP committee in Northern Ireland, has said it would be unacceptable to expect the public or GP surgeries to cover the cost of LFTs in future.As it stands, patients wanting to attend their GP surgery in Northern Ireland and who may have Covid are expected to take a test beforehand to rule out infection.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up It is understood the system is under review ahead of any potential changes to the testing regime here which could see patients collecting LFTs from their GP surgery before an appointment.However, it is believed a final decision has been made on the matter.“Under no circumstance should GPs be expected to pay for their patients to take Covid tests and patients shouldn’t have to pay for an LFT to access healthcare facilities,” said Dr Stout.“That would only add to health inequalities in that people who can afford to pay to have tests would be able to attend appointments.“Given the stretch in the cost of living, we would be concerned there will be an increasing number of people who won’t be able to go and buy LFTs.“There will have to be a mechanism in place to address this because healthcare settings can’t allow patients to attendthey might have Covid we have to protect staff and other patients, many of them are extremely vulnerable to the virus.”Sinn Fein health spokesman Colm Gildernew said: “It is counter-productive that people would have to pay for LFTs.“Covid is still in the community and testing is necessary to protect people from the spread of the virus.“People are already struggling with the cost-of-living crisis and having to pay for LFTs is an additional cost which many people will simply be unable to afford.”A Department of Health spokeswoman said Northern Ireland’s current official advice on Covid- is detailed on NI Direct.She said the website already acknowledges that symptoms “may y and may not be limited to the three central symptoms identied at the outset of the pandemic” although it does not list any of the additional symptoms listed on the UK Government website.According to NI Direct, anyone with any of the “main” Covid- symptoms should get a PCR test as soon as possible and should self-isolate until a negative result is received.The departmental spokeswoman continued: “Covid PCR and LFTs are still available free to the general public in Northern Ireland.“People in Northern Ireland with one of the three original symptoms of Covid  are still advised to stay at home and book a PCR test.“These continue to be available to everyone in Northern Ireland up to April .“If you have other symptoms of a respiratory virus, such as runny nose, sore throat or headache, you can take a LFT.“Evenyou don’t have Covid, your symptoms may be caused by another respiratory virus such as rhinovirus which can be easily passed on to others.“It is therefore advisable to stay at homeyou can and reduce contact with others when you have respiratory virus symptoms to avoid spreading infection to others.”On Monday, Northern Ireland recorded just  cases, although this is likely as a result of fewer people reporting positive test results.Six further deaths linked to the virus were recorded, while there were  Covid- ICU patients in hospitals across Northern Ireland.Most ReadTeenager dies after M motorway road traffic collisionFake nun banned from

Pics: PresseyeApril   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailMonday saw Northern Ireland’s two biggest parties set out their stalls for May’s election.First up, we had the DUP... A familiar DUP format at a curious locationParty leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson stuck to an all-too-familiar format when laying out his vision. Putting forward his “five-point plan for Northern Ireland”, the Lagan Valley MP was as ambitious as he was vague. The pledges listed are: fix the NHS grow the economy keep our schools world-class remove the NI Protocol and help working families. Where have we heard this format before  Ah, yes: back in July of last year Sir Jeffrey set out a series of ‘seven tests’ for any new arrangements the UK Government would announce regarding the protocol.This didn’t gain much traction, so the following January the DUP leader tried again, issuing a statement setting out “seven reasons why the Irish Sea border must go”. Now we have a five-point plan.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Given the lack of success with his previous tests, I think Sir Jeffrey should probably be trying a dferent tack.The DUP also picked a curious venue for their manesto launch: the Dundonald Omniplex Cinema.Curious because the Omniplex was also screening an animated movie called The Bad Guys, while showing on another screen was Uncharted, which is exactly where unionism could be goingMay’s election s a Sinn Fein first minister. Pie in the sky from Sinn FeinOver at Sinn Fein’s election manesto launch party leader Mary Lou McDonald  essentially set out the same plan as the DUP — bar the Northern Ireland Protocol, of course — however, Ms McDonald was wise not to go down the five-point route.“We want additional investment of £ billion in our health service over those three years to tackle waiting lists, to recruit doctors and nurses, to fund cancer and mental health services and to transform health,” she said.“We want to extend the £ home heating payment, which has already gone to , homes.“We want to give businesses an additional rates holiday, to help protect jobs, and give farmers a payment to help protect with rising feed and fertiliser costs. And we will continue to push the Tory government for a further cut to fuel duty, the reinstatement of the red diesel rebate for firms using plant machinery and industrial equipment, and a reduced VAT rate for hospitality.”Saying “we want” this and that is all well and good, but what would be useful is detail on how on earth this will actually be achieved and funded — the economy isn’t exactly in tip-top shape.Perhaps we can start with actually having a ing political system first and see where we go from there.The venue optics were interesting also: the Titanic Hotel — a hotel named after a ship that is famous for sinking. Good to be GreenWhile the focus of most pollsters is on the Executive parties – and specically the predictable scrap between the DUP and Sinn Fein – there’s always plenty of action at the other end of the league table as the smaller parties seek their big breakthrough.Green Party leader Clare Bailey might not have been pleased that yesterday’s Irish News poll suggested support for her party had fallen back, dropping two points in seven weeks to .%. But it should also be remembered that the Greens support in  election was around half that – a share of just .%. Could the recent passing of our first Climate Change Bill see the public warming to the Greens Most ReadFake nun banned from Clonard Monastery after eccentric behaviourTeenager dies after M motorway road traffic collisionUVF demands UDA Rathcoole chief Gary Fisher punishes thug after home attack breached local peace pactBelfast family’s  legacy to church now worth nearly £mMan hospitalised following ‘serious’ road collision in County DownTop VideosPlayVideo: Police attend sudden death on M motorway outside LurganPlayRoy Reynolds just hours before his death videoed with Michael Campbell the man accused of his murderPlayVideo: Firefighters deal with a blaze in Derriaghy Industrial Park, The CuttsLatest Northern Ireland Assembly election Sam McBrideOpinionDUP’s predictable warnings may resonate with some voters but focussing on Sinn Féin threat presents another problemPatient safety warning as GPs call for Stormont Executive revival after electionsFirst and deputy First Ministers should be filled by the willing – Naomi LongCost-of-living crisis main focus for Stormont election, Sinn Fein leader saysStormont Executive must get back to work to tackle cost-of-living crisis, says Sinn Fein#s Mary Lou McDonaldLatestUkraine: Atrocities against civilians are shocking but not a surprise, says Gulf War Colonel Tim CollinsSerie A leaders AC Milan held to draw by BolognaPatrick Vieira’s Crystal Palace beat former club Arsenal to dent top-four hopesWayne Rooney backs Mauricio Pochettino to take over at Manchester UnitedNorthern Ireland public face questions over doctor fee as new Covid symptoms cause lateral flow issue,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Establish who is talking to you. Is it the candidate, or simply someone who is friend of the candidate and not even a member of their party Askthe candidate is on your street andyou could talk to him or her. If not, ask for an elected representative — there will generally be a politician present.Once you get them, you are talking to someone who actually has power rather than to someone who may know less about politics than you do.. Ask bluntly: Why should I vote for you or your party  This easy question with which to start will give you a sense of the candidate’s priorities and whether they align with your own.. Ask about the issues which matter most to you — whether major political debates such as abortion, the legacy of the Troubles or climate change, or parochial concerns about being able to recycle glass or the state of your street.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Some of these issues will not be Stormont’s responsibility , butthey matter to you there’s no harm in raising them.Councillors and MPs will be out canvassing as well —you recognise one, talk to them about an issue for which they are responsible.  Read MoreSam McBride:OpinionWhen a prospective MLA knocks on your front door, you’re holding more power than them. Ask open questions which don’t reveal your own views. An unscrupulous candidate may hint that they agree with your views — or at least not spell out their ownyou tell them what you think, so keep them guessing.. Ask how they will pay for all the proposals in their manesto. If they say it will be paid for through “efficiencies” or “reducing bureaucracy”, ask them where and how much.Don’t settle for the line about their manesto being ‘fully costed’ — the candidate should know the detail and be able to explain it.You probably won’t need to be an expert in the public finances to get sense of who knows their stuff and who is bluffing.. Health is the most pressing practical issue facing the next Executive and impacts every voter. Expert reports have repeatedly called for the creation of centres of expertise for dferent conditions, but that will mean closing or downgrading some smaller hospitals which is unpopular.Whatever your view of this, ask the candidate to be explicit about what they would support.A politician who honestly tells you something you don’t want to hear is to be respected above someone whose honeyed words don’t reveal how they would use the power which they are asking you to give them.. The MLAs elected in this election will be the first to vote on the application of the NI Protocol in  .Whatever your view on this, ask the candidate on your doorstep how they will vote on the issue in .. If, like many people, you have a low opinion of how the Stormont system has performed over recent years, you can politely but firmly make this clear. If the person on your doorstep is an outgoing MLA, you could ask them what they most regret doing, or whether they accept that their party has played any part in the current mess.The answers will give you a sense of whether the candidate is capable of self-reflection, or just spews forth party propaganda which blames everything on his or her opponents.. Pay attention to the parties you don’t support. This is a proportional representation election, meaning that you can rank the candidates in order of your preference.Many people still fail to vote beyond their preferred party, meaning they have less say in who gets in.There are five MLAs to be elected in each constituency and it makes sense to vote for as many parties as possible.In the lower end of the ballot paper, it can help to think about it as voting against the people even lower down, because that is the effect which it has. To establish your views on these candidates, don’t dismiss them simply because you don’t support their party.. Ask the candidatethey can guarantee that they will serve out their term as an MLA , or whether they may walk away from politics after a few months or years, allowing their party to co-opt in a replacement.As the Belfastreported on Saturday, almost a third of MLAs in the last mandate were put into Stormont undemocratically by their parties rather than being elected by voters.Ask the candidate how they would be replaced — will they make public a list of possible replacements, or are you giving their party free reign to anoint someone of whom you may disapprove as your MLA Related topicsThe Executive OfficeNorthern Ireland AssemblyNI ProtocolMore On The Executive Office Premium‘Massive anger’ from nationalists at Stormont’s failure, says Aontu leaderFirst Ukrainian refugees have arrived in Northern Ireland after fleeing Russia’s invasion PremiumViewpointOpinionIntegrated schools failure shames NI PremiumSam McBrideOpinionUlster Unionist Party’s all things to all people manesto involves ambition as well as populism PremiumTalks need to begin over scrapping mandatory coalition, says Arlene FosterMost ReadFake nun banned from Clonard Monastery after eccentric behaviourTeenager dies after M motorway road traffic collisionUVF demands UDA Rathcoole chief Gary Fisher punishes thug after home attack breached local peace pactBelfast family’s  legacy to church now worth nearly £mMan hospitalised following ‘serious’ road collision in County DownTop VideosPlayVideo: Police attend sudden death on M motorway outside LurganPlayRoy Reynolds just hours before his death videoed with Michael Campbell the man accused of his murderPlayVideo: Firefighters deal with a blaze in Derriaghy Industrial Park, The CuttsLatest Northern Ireland Assembly election Sam McBrideOpinionDUP’s predictable warnings may resonate with some voters but focussing on Sinn Féin threat presents another problemPatient safety warning as GPs call for Stormont Executive revival after electionsAndrew MaddenOpinionA familiar DUP format to pie-in-the-sky Sinn Fein pledges: the key takeaways from the two parties’ election campaign launchesFirst and deputy First Ministers should be filled by the willing – Naomi LongCost-of-living crisis main focus for Stormont election, Sinn Fein leader saysLatestUkraine: Atrocities against civilians are shocking but not a surprise, says Gulf War Colonel Tim CollinsSerie A leaders AC Milan held to draw by BolognaPatrick Vieira’s Crystal Palace beat former club Arsenal to dent top-four hopesWayne Rooney backs Mauricio Pochettino to take over at Manchester UnitedNorthern Ireland public face questions over doctor fee as new Covid symptoms cause lateral flow issue,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Many people would prefer the salesman, but in fact this is a moment where voters hold more power than politicians.Knowing a little bit about how political parties approach canvassing and what they are hoping to achieve can help you to play the system to your advantage — and also help the politicians, eventhat involves the discomfort of hearing your disobliging comments about themselves or their party.Despite all the sophistication of modern politics, knocking doors to persuade a voter to back one candidate over another is still a key element of political success.Two decades ago, a US study by Alan S Gerber and Donald P Green at Yale University found that in a randomised field experiment of , voters in Connecticut voter turnout was increased substantially by personal canvassing, slightly by direct mail, and not at all by telephone calls.They hypothesised that falling electoral turnout was linked to a decline in face-to-face campaigning.Read MoreThe  key questions to ask candidates looking for your voteMuch has changed since then. Social media is now the sexiest tool for political parties and allows those with money to get ultra-targeted messages advertised on the screens of the voters they need — a particular benefit for parties struggling to attract dedicated campaigners to tramp streets.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up But some people — particularly some elderly voters — still value a personal knock on the door, believing thata candidate wants their vote enough they should come and ask for it.However, canvassing is not just one-way traffic.Yes, the canvasser is trying to sell their candidate to you — but they are also harvesting information.It might seem rude when they askyou would vote for their party, but that is part of a vast data-harvesting operation to identy likely voters whose names will be entered in their database .Depending on how likely you say you are to vote, you may be targeted again closer to the election or on polling day as the party moves to its ‘get out the vote’ operation.But they are not just taking in your answer to that one question they are hearing — or should be — what you are saying about other things your reasons for liking their party, your reasons for disliking it, your priorities, the things you think their party has misunderstood about people like you, or whatever it might be that you say.If large numbers of people are saying similar things to a party’s canvassers, the message is taken seriously by any competent party. This is a form of mass polling, and while politicians may say they don’t believe the polls when they deliver unwelcome news, they believe it when they hear it first hand or through colleagues. This is the most nervous time for a politician — especially for one in a party which is losing support.And yet few voters realise that this is the time when their power is greatest. Voters hold in their hands not only the careers of inidual MLAs, but the fates of parties.A veteran of canvassing in Northern Ireland said that % of people “want you off their door as quickly as possible”, and few say much about how they will vote. But that works in favour of those who do engage —you are part of the % who express your views, they will be seen as far more representative than in fact they may be, because so many other people declined to engage.However you engage with canvassers, be respectful — even to those from parties which you may detest. This is about more than basic good manners democracy can only candidates who profoundly disagree with each other put their names forward for election.Whatever you think about the candidates, it takes courage to put yourself up for what is a form of public popularity contest where the result is announced live on TV. It can be humiliating, and involves its own form of bravery.Many of the canvassers will not be politicians, will not be paid, and may not even be members of the party they are advertising.Today we bring you ten questions you can ask those knocking your door to both get across your views and tease out whether they are worthy of your vote.Most ReadFake nun banned from Clonard Monastery after eccentric behaviourTeenager dies after M motorway road traffic collisionUVF demands UDA Rathcoole chief Gary Fisher punishes thug after home attack breached local peace pactBelfast family’s  legacy to church now worth nearly £mMan hospitalised following ‘serious’ road collision in County DownTop VideosPlayVideo: Police attend sudden death on M motorway outside LurganPlayRoy Reynolds just hours before his death videoed with Michael Campbell the man accused of his murderPlayVideo: Firefighters deal with a blaze in Derriaghy Industrial Park, The CuttsLatest Northern Ireland Assembly election Sam McBrideOpinionDUP’s predictable warnings may resonate with some voters but focussing on Sinn Féin threat presents another problemPatient safety warning as GPs call for Stormont Executive revival after electionsAndrew MaddenOpinionA familiar DUP format to pie-in-the-sky Sinn Fein pledges: the key takeaways from the two parties’ election campaign launchesFirst and deputy First Ministers should be filled by the willing – Naomi LongCost-of-living crisis main focus for Stormont election, Sinn Fein leader saysLatestUkraine: Atrocities against civilians are shocking but not a surprise, says Gulf War Colonel Tim CollinsPatrick Vieira’s Crystal Palace beat former club Arsenal to dent top-four hopesWayne Rooney backs Mauricio Pochettino to take over at Manchester UnitedNorthern Ireland public face questions over doctor fee as new Covid symptoms cause lateral flow issueTiger Woods practises at Augusta National for second day running before Masters,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It holds a cherished place in our broadcasting landscape and we want that to remain the case.“We set out our preferred option for a change of ownership to give the corporation new freedoms to innovate and grow while continuing to make an important economic, social and cultural contribution to the UK. We will announce further details shortly.”Channel  rightly holds a cherished place in British le and I want that to remain the case. I have come to the conclusion that government ownership is holding Channel  back from competing against streaming giants like Netflix and Amazon.  — Nadine DorriesApril , Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries added in a tweet that she wanted the broadcaster to remain a “cherished place in British le”, but felt that government ownership was “holding Channel  back from competing against streaming giants like Netflix and Amazon”.She added: “I will seek to reinvest the proceeds of the sale into levelling up the creative sector, putting money into independent production and creative skills in priority parts of the country – delivering a creative idend for all.”Other ministers have not been as supportive of the announcement, with Tory MP Sir Peter Bottomley saying he opposes the privatisation as he feels it is “bad for the ersity of television, bad for viewers and bad for independent producers”.While Labour’s shadow culture secretary Lucy Powell described the move as “cultural vandalism”.She said: “Selling off Channel , which doesn’t cost the tax-payer a penny anyway, to what is likely to be a foreign company, is cultural vandalism. It will cost jobs and opportunities in the North and Yorkshire, and hit the wider British creative economy.“This shows that the Conservatives have run out of ideas and run out of road. Of all the issues the public wants action on, the governance of Channel  isn’t one.“The government should have a laser like focus on the cost of living crisis, and help people with their bills, not be fiddling around like this for ideological reasons.”My full comment on the breaking news that Channel  is to be sold off 👇👇 pic OQxXmIuvj— Lucy Powell MPApril , John McVay, chief executive of the trade body Pact – which represents UK independent production companies, added that he felt privatising the channel was “unnecessary” and risked damaging the UK’s TV and film production industry.He explained: “Unlike other broadcasters, it makes none of its programmes in-house – but a private owner could sht production away from independent producers to cut costs, with a knock-on impact on the wider industry.“Selling it off now risks reducing the opportunities for independent producers, and reducing the amount of programming commissioned outside London – levelling down, not levelling up. It isn’t too late for the Government to think again.”Philippa Childs, the head of the broadcasting, entertainment, communications and theatre union, described the action as a “short-sighted sale of an incredible UK asset”.She added: “This cynical move prioritises the interests of shareholders ahead of public service and ignores myriad responses to the Government’s consultation, and vehement opposition from the industry.“The Government is yet to present any evidence that a change in ownership would benefit both Channel  or the public.“Bectu condemns this short sighted and destructive move that deals a major blow to the UK’s creative sector, the creative economy and jobs of UK freelancers. With the creative industries amongst the hardest hit by the pandemic, and continuing to face a chronic skills shortage, there is no worse time to introduce such uncertainty, particularly for independent producers.” Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletter Receive todays headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.

I’m bitterly disappointed at the Government’s decision not to include gender identity in the ban on conversion therapy. Many have asked what my thoughts are. I’ve always believed that this debate attracts unnecessary hysteria and toxicity, and...— Jamie Wallis MPApril , The backbencher argued that it would be a “broken promise” to allow conversion therapy to be banned, but for it not to apply to trans people.The outcome of a double U-turn by the Prime Minister last week, in which he appeared to flip-flop on whether to legislate against conversion therapy, has reportedly seen No  settle on outlawing “only gay conversion therapy, not trans”.When announcing the initial consultation into the conversion therapy ban, the UK Government declared: “The proposed protections are universal: an attempt to change a person from being attracted to the same-sex to being attracted to the opposite-sex, or from not being transgender to being transgender, will be treated in the same way as the reverse scenario.“They therefore protect everyone.”LGBT and religious leaders, including former archbishop of Canterbury Dr Rowan Williams, have put pressure on Boris Johnson to include trans people in a ban on conversion therapy.In a series of tweets, Mr Wallis said: “I’m bitterly disappointed at the Government’s decision not to include gender identity in the ban on conversion therapy.“Many have asked what my thoughts are. I’ve always believed that this debate attracts unnecessary hysteria and toxicity, and meaningful results can only come from meaningful debate. Understandably, concerns need to be looked at and debated, but it is wrong to exclude protections for a whole group of people from a practice described as ‘abhorrent’.“I hope the announcement that a separate piece of work will now be done on this issue will be done at speed.“If the CTban passes through Parliament without any protections for the transgender community, it cannot be described as anything other than a broken promise.”The Government has said trans people should be “treated with the maximum possible generosity and respect” but that the “complexity of issues requires separate work to further consider transgender conversation therapy”.

Irsquod just broken up with my first girlfriend and I think it was me subconsciously expressing stuff about that.Confirming the sci-fi influence, Tim mdash who recently became a dad for the first time mdash said Girl From Mars mostly revolves around the verse and chorus.ldquoI wrote them as a slow little strummy thing and then when we worked on it as a band we rocked it out quite a lot. My little brother Pat was always my first port of call of seeinga song was good and then Irsquod bring it to [bandmates] Mark [Hamilton] and Rick [McMurray].ldquoI used to love going and knocking on his bedroom door and playing him ideas and I remember that he flipped out about the song and loved it. He had the idea for the quiet verse after the guitar solo and it was great.Tim said as soon as the band started playing it they got a really good reaction from their friends.ldquoI used to play stuff before Irsquod even fully written the lyrics wersquod play stuff at shows and Irsquod mumble my way through it. I donrsquot think I wrote the second verse until we actually recorded it two years later.ldquoI wasnrsquot too worried about lyrics back then, maybe because I listened to Nirvana so much and could never really understand them. Our manager and the record label were sure it was going to be a hit, so we put it aside until wersquod be able to promote it. We put it out as a single two weeks after leaving school and it just blew up.Meanwhile, as part of the Church Street investment plan in Downpatrick, around pound, has been earmarked for a shop front improvement scheme with the emphasis on painting and repairing existing facades.Elsewhere, it is proposed to spend pound, on what is being described as a ldquoconcept design of Church Street with the work due to be carried out by a consultant, with pound, earmarked for improving shop fronts in Bridge Street.Fteen thousand pounds has been earmarked for De Courcey Place in English Street to replace a number of heritage-style lamps and signposts, alongside the provision of new litter bins and planting out existing granite water troughs.Just over pound, is to be spent on other planting and landscaping schemes in the Church Street area, while there are also proposals for a new bus stop and power washing the area outside the former telephone exchange, with new safety railings installed outside  Church Street.There are also plans to invest pound, on new interpretation material highlighting the Tower Bell at Down Parish Church and the grave of United Irishman Thomas Russell in the church grounds.Last Christmas, new festive lighting was provided on the side of the Down Arts Centre and on trees in De Courcey Place.Downpatrick area councillor Dermot Curran has praised everyone involved with the work in Church Street, in particular, the talented artists responsible for the murals.ldquoCongratulations to everyone involved in the project designed to breath new le into this part of the town. Given the fact that it has missed out on major funding over many years, the pound, investment initiative is particularly welcome, he said.ldquoThe money will help property owners revitalise their respective businesses at a key part of the town where there are a number of family-owned businesses..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Ballynagross make it past Castlewellan  ","story":"BALLYNAGROSS progressed to the final of the Harry Clarke Cup after defeating Castlewellan Forest by way of penalty shoot-out at Ballyhornan on Friday night.Ballynagross arrived at the match looking for a fourth Harry Clarke final in a row, but Castlewellan Forest had momentum following a close win against Ardglass in the quarter-final.Ballynagross got off to the best start they could have hoped for after a great attack from their defence through the field found Philip Doran, who easily finished to put his side one up in the first seven minutes.Castlewellan stepped it up a gear when a throw-in close to the box found Aidan Dornan, who headed just wide.Castlewellan had an appeal for hand ball ruled out closely after in the Ballynagross box, with the referee having none of it.Ballynagross responded to the pressure from Castlewellan with a pass from Philip Doran to Shea McComiskey out on the right wing. McComiskey saw team-mate Joseph Burns in the mouth of the goal and looped the ball in, but Burnsrsquo effort goes just wide.Castlewellan had their first real chance on the th minute when their corner-kick met the head of Donagh Steele. However, the ball went just over the bar.Ballynagross got their second goal on the th minute after a throw-in from Ryan Tumelty to John Shields allowed the attacker to spray a pass to the right wing to find team-mate Doran. The lively lsquoGross forward found Joseph Burns and the chance was duly converted into a goal.With half-time nearing, it looked like Ballynagross would be going into the interval with a comfortable lead, but an error when clearing the ball from the defence enabled Castlewellanrsquos David Gilmore to close the lead to just a goal as the referee blew his whistle.Castlewellan came out in the second-half with an all out attack approach and it paid off through a corner kick in the st minute.This time Donagh Steele ensured the ball was going into the back of the net and the game was level. It was not to stay this way for long as the Castlewellan goalkeeper clearly took Ballynagrossrsquo Shea McComiskey down inside the box and a penalty was awarded.Connor Marron stepped up to take the penalty and finished well into the top left corner of the net.Castlewellan continued to push forward, but Ballynagross defence of Corey Davis, Connor Marron, Ryan Tumelty and Tom McNeill were holding strong.For the next  minutes it was pretty even, Castlewellanrsquos Sean Dornan took a chance on the edge of the box but Cathail Arnold easily saved. Castlewellan were awarded a free-kick close to the Ballynagross net, but David Gilmorersquos effort was straight at the goalkeeper.Ballynagross had a chance from a corner but it was well cleared by Castlewellan.Forest striker Shane Mooney found himself booked for his comments to the referee in the rd minute.Castlewellan were very much seeking out a goal to level and it came in the th minute after a scrap for the ball in Ballynagrossrsquo box resulted in Shane Mooney scoring with the last kick of the game to send the tie to extra-time.There were a few chances during extra-time for Ballynagross, although neither team could find a break through to escape the need for penalties. Castlewellan swapped out Brian McVeigh in goal for Sean Dornan.Ballynagrossrsquo Connor Marron, who had already scored a penalty during the game, was first to step up and easily converted.Castlewellanrsquos Shane Mooney and Ballynagrossrsquo Declan Dowie followed and both scored.Forestrsquos new lsquokeeper Dornan came out of the net and rushed his penalty, sending the ball over the bar.John Mahoney made no mistake to give his lsquoGross side a further advantage before Ciaran Stratton kept Castlewellan in with a chance.Ballynagrossrsquo John Shields walked up to take his penalty but the lsquokeeper saved to bring it level again.Eoin Travers converted his penalty and now it was sudden death.Tom McNeill confidentially scored his penalty meaning all of the pressure fell on Castlewellanrsquos Ryan Morgan to keep the game going.However, his effort was saved resulting in Ballynagross progressing to the final.Ballynagross: C Arnold, T McNeill, R Tumelty, C Marron, C Davis, J Polley, J Shields, J Burns, L Shields, P Doran, S McComiskeySubs: D Craig, D Dowie, J Mahoney, K Taggart, A Beattie.Castlewellan Forest: B McVeigh, C McCabe, C Stratton, C Burns, J OrsquoNeill, N Travers, S Dornan, D Steele, S Mooney, A Dornan, D Gilmore Subs: S Kinley, G Kidd, E Travers, R Morgan, J Murnin..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Dismal end to league campaign  ","story":"DOWN senior footballersrsquo miserable campaign reached its conclusion as they lost out on home soil to Clare on Sunday.The Mourne side entered this fixture already relegated from Division  and were hoping to gain some,any, momentum ahead of their crucial upcoming Ulster campaign.The uphill task will include having to better Monaghan on May  and then the winner of Cavan and Antrim to make the concluding stage to feature in the All-Ireland series and avoid ato the second-tier championship.Down took to the field in Newry against a Clare side who had endured a mixed bag of results within their league fixtures having won their opening three before losing the next trio of matches.For Down, the loss concludes a point-starved run of fixtures having finished with just one draw and six losses.Clare fielded what appeared to be a physically stronger outfit than their counterparts at Paacuteirc Esler and Downrsquos efforts werenrsquot aided by their lack of discipline.Both Gerard Collins and Pat Havern picked up black cards towards the end of each half while team-mate Finn McElroy picked up a red card with  minutes played.By that stage, the Mourne side didnrsquot appear to be getting anything from the game but that will be little solace to Down boss James McCartan, who has endured a nightmare beginning to his second stint at the helm.Aaron Grfin scored the first goal of the match with nine minutes played, courtesy of a smart left-footed finish which bested Kilcoo-native Niall Kane at his near post.To their credit, Down showed some resilience and managed to notch the next four from five points available with Burren man Liam Kerr kicking over a well-taken score amongst these.However, Clare continued to attack the Down goal and found their second major of the match thanks to Cian OrsquoDearsquos effort.His lowly struck shot took the wind out of Downrsquos sails and the Mourne side entered the break six points adrt at -

ndash The Government is poised to unveil an astonishing pound million scheme to replace the Strangford ferry service with a road tunnel under the lough.The scheme has already been approved at ministerial level and it is believed that the pound million originally intended for the Downpatrick bypass road will be used as start-up capital, with phase top-up grants being sought from the European Community and the Ireland Fund as the scheme progresses.Plans for the mile-long road tunnel have been drawn up by senior consultants engaged by the government and it is believed that the entry points will be manned toll booth terminals in Strangford and Portaferry.The move to replace the ferry service with a tunnel received an extra impetus recently when it was revealed that the ferry service was running at a substantial loss and villagers in Strangford vetoed plans for a new jetty for the vessels.Sources within the government say that the tunnel plan, which has been gathering dust for a number of years, has now been reactivated and local roads bosses intend erting the money intended for Downpatrickrsquos ring road to the scheme before the end of the financial year.Publicly, however, officials are remaining tight-lipped about the project. ldquoThe tunnel plan was first put forward several years ago, but as far as I am aware there are no plans to revive it, said a press office spokesperson.Nevertheless, conservation organisations have been consulted about the possible environmental impact of a tunnel, and a study of its possible effects has been carried out by a university team under the guidance of Prof A Lilo.Prof Lilo told the Recorder: ldquoAs far as I can see, there would be little threat to the loughrsquos balanced ecosystem from a tunnel.There may, however, be an unsightly visual impact created by the large tunnel entrances needed in Strangford and Portaferry.CASTLEWELLAN ndash A new school is to be constructed on the site of the existing St Malachyrsquos High School in Castlewellan, it has been revealed this week.South Down MP Mr Eddie McGrady said he has been informed of the commitment of the Department of Education to a new school in the town.ldquoAn investment appraisal has recently been carried out by the Department of Education to consider how best to meet the long-term needs of the pupils at St Malachyrsquos and this has come out in favour of a new school on the existing site, he added.Mr McGrady said this week: ldquoI welcome this development as I have been making on-going representations on the matter to Lord Belstead and his predecessor as Education Minister, Dr Brian Mawhinney.ldquoThe school definitely requires additional accommodation and I am keen that is is provided on the existing site, he added.DOWNPATRICK ndash Teenagers, some as young as , are taking part in open-air drinking parties at secluded parts of Downpatrick it was revealed this week.The youth are paying adults to buy drink for them and then going to quiet parts of the town for their parties, a special meeting was told on Tuesday.The police have raided a number of these gatherings in recent months but the teenagers simply move to a dferent location and continue their drinking sprees.While the problem of underage drinking in Downpatrick has not risen in recent years it is nevertheless sufficiently worrying to prompt a group of local community representatives to get together to discuss ways of tackling the issue.Last week youth workers, headmasters, teachers, publicans and councillors met together under the auspices of the RUCrsquos Community Relations Branch and debated the causes and possible remedies of underage drinking.The end result of the discussion was that public awareness needs to be heightened, while teenagers, and their parents, should be appraised of the dangers of alcohol abuse in the young.Superintendent Ronnie Hawthorne, Downpatrick sub-isional commander explained that the problem is a province-wide concern and is not just confined to Downpatrick.He added that underage drinking is also taking place in other parts of Down District.ldquoThere is a problem throughout Northern Ireland and we cannot stop underage drinkers ourselves, we need the help of the whole community, said Superintendent Hawthorne.ldquoThere are a lot associated problems with underage drinking and we will talk to every interested body in a bid to cope with this matter, he added.The full extend of the problems were highlighted by the youth leader in charge of the Patrician Youth Centre, Siobhan Byrne, who has compiled a report on underway drinking which is to be presented to Down Council.KILLYLEAGH ndash The town of Killyleagh is set for a financial boost to help revive its economic, commercial and environmental appearance, it has been revealed.A preliminary application has been made to the International Fund for a core project to help trigger a revival in the townrsquos fortunes.And by the end of the year, plans to designate the town as a conservation area will be completed.The investment in Killyleaghrsquos future was revealed when the chairman of Down District Council, Mr Sean Quinn, officially launched proposals for the regeneration of the town.A special exhibition in the townrsquos library also features a display on the proposed conservation area for Killyleagh.Mr Quinn referred to community-led initiatives in Seeconnell and Strangford, and stressed the importance of a community coming together to take full advantage of the funding which is available to help themselves.The South Down MP, Mr Eddie McGrady, told the launch gathering that he has been delighted to assist the committee towards its goals of reviving the town.Mr McGrady said Killyleagh had recognised that it was very much an era of self-help.He looked forward to the day when Killyleagh is selected as the site for the Strangford Lough Liaison Office and is designated as the Gateway to Strangford Lough, fulfilling its tourist potential.LEITRIM ndash An  month battle to have a Leitrim footpath declared a right of way has found its way to Westminster.The Parliamentary Commissioner for Complaints has

claim that the path is very old and was once used to reach a Mass Rock on the Backaderry Mountain and in later times, to give a short-cut to the new church in Leitrim.It is also believed the footpath is part of the old highway system that existed before the road system was introduced, and links into a system of lanes that go to Ballynahinch.The Council first became involved in the matter in August  when the petition was formally presented, and shortly afterwards the council voted overwhelmingly to adopt the pathway, subject to legal opinions.However, for the next  months no progress was made on the matter until the council appointed a countryside officer in August . He prepared a report on the footpath, which came before the council earlier this month when it was decided not to adopt itAfterwards a statement from some of the local people seeking the right-of-way said the footpath passes over land belonging to  dferent families and only one has an objection to the council adopting it..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Good Morning Down co","story":"THE head of one of the districtrsquos leading charities is officially stepping down from her role next month.Linda Baker has been Good Morning Downrsquos co-ordinator for the past  years and has watched the organisation mdash which provides a telephone befriending service to elderly and vulnerable people across the district mdash increases its operation considerably.The charity provides a valuable leline service to many people across the district, with its hardworking volunteers in regular contact with those who feel vulnerable or at risk, making telephone calls to members at an agreed time each morning.Linda said the service was especially important during the height of the coronavirus pandemic with the deadly virus unfortunately curtailing get-togethers that were organised for clients.Working in partnership with the districtrsquos Policing and Community Safety Partnership, the South Eastern Trust and the Housing Executive, the charity has also received invaluable support from the Allen Lane Foundation and and Halax Community Foundation.ldquoWhen I joined Good Morning Down there were four volunteers making calls to around  people. Since then, the organisation has grown and the level of support we provided has widened considerably, Linda revealed.ldquoWe now have a team of  volunteers who are in contact with  people across the district. Despite the global pandemic, we continued to deliver the service from our homes with the calls even more appreciated by clients who could not go out themselves.Linda said that during the pandemic, the volunteers made an additional  calls to people, such was the need of elderly and vulnerable people across the community.ldquoWe started off calling people for a little friendly chat but the service we provided started to evolve. While chatting with clients remains at the heart of what we do to support those who are isolated, we now find ourselves helping people with a range of complex needs.ldquoThe charityrsquos work has evolved and I suppose it will continue to in the future, but Good Morningrsquos Down core principle will always remain the same.Linda paid tribute to all the charityrsquos staff and those who have supported the organisation over many years.ldquoWe are like family and I will be sorry to leave, she said. ldquoI have spent a large part of my working le with Good Morning Down and have literally lived and breathed the organisation and have been assisted by great people.Linda said it was ldquotremendous to meet clients when the charity organised its get-togethers and while these were put on hold due to the pandemic, she hopes there may be an opportunity do something before the end of the year.ldquoThat of course will be guided by the public health situation at the time as we are mindful that our clients are elderly, with a number of them also vulnerable.Linda said the charityrsquos service has never been more important and while she is leaving the organisation, she knows it will continue to be a key part of peoplersquos lives.She added: ldquoI really enjoyed my time with Good Morning Down and worked alongside really great people. They were the friendly voice at the end of the telephone who helped make a dference to peoplersquos lives.ldquoFor many, their chat with our volunteers was the only interaction they would have with others during the day and we were always conscious of that. We worked to make a dference and you build a special relationship with clients which is why it was so wonderful to see them when we all did meet up.As Linda prepares to say her final goodbyes, Good Morning Down is looking for someone to replace her at the helm of the charity.Anyone keen to take on taking on her role or interested in getting involved in the work of Good Morning Down is asked to contact her on    or email lindabakergmd@yahoo..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"History project looks back at  Jewish family’s links to Shrigley  ","story":"THE remarkable contribution of Jewish families in saving Shrigley has been recalled in a unique history project.The story of how Jews, fleeing the Holocaust and Hitlers murderous purge in Europe, started arriving in the village just before the start of the Second World War and helped transform the fortunes of villagers after the Hungry Thirties is largely forgotten.But more than  years later, Shrigleys legacy is featuring in an on-line interactive map telling the stories of Jewish families who have left a lasting impact on Northern Ireland.Steven Jaffe has been researching the heritage of the Jewish community across Northern Ireland.ldquoThe goal of the Belfast Jewish Heritage project Shared History fund is to locate, preserve, document and make publicly available material relating to the Jewish community in Northern Ireland, said Mr Jaffe.ldquoIt shows  sites across Northern Ireland, including Shrigley, Saintfield and Downpatrick.

Villagers had suffered from the awful impact of the Hungry Thirties in one of the most socially deprived regions of the UK after the closure of the village spinning mill in .By November  United Chrome Tanners were employing  people tanning sheep skins and cattle hides for shoes, handbags and clothing.Within less than  years they were a world leader, employing more than  people and under the leadership of Erik Utitz became the first NI winners of the Queens award for exports.Leather tanning eventually died out in the village in .Details of the Jewish project, which received funding from the National Lottery Heritage Fund, can be found at this website: www.belfastjewishheritage.org..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Lawyer eyeing SDLP result in Strangford  ","story":"CONOR Houston is hoping to become Strangfordrsquos first SDLP Assemblyman when voters go to the polls on May .A lawyer and civic activist, he is going head-to-head against the DUP, UUP and Alliance who currently hold the constituencyrsquos five seats and as the parties ramp up their respective election campaigns, Mr Houston has outlined why he decided to put his name forward.He said he has been very fortunate to have had a lot of great opportunities throughout his career and wants to bring the experiences he has to make a positive impact on the people in Strangford.Mr Houston said while he has never been in politics before, there have been a few moments in his career that he believes shaped him for political le.ldquoAs a lawyer, I fought against unfairness and injustice, he continued. ldquoOne of the most frustrating things was seeing young people end up in the criminal justice system.ldquoSo many of them came from situations of poverty, abuse, addiction and been failed by our education and care systems.

They also cause signicant damage to wildle and the environment.Mourne Heritage Trust staff helped with the response to last weekrsquos wildfires using strimmers to create fire breaks, also helping with a controlled back burn and using its argocat all-terrain vehicle and fogging unit to extinguish one branch of a fire that was threatening some field boundaries.In addition, one of the Trustrsquos teams, along with a firefighter, used this specialist equipment to extinguish the fire at Finlieve near Rostrevor.NI Water has also warned that wildfires can have impact on drinking water supplies.The organisation controls so-called water catchment areas in the Mournes which supply water to all of Northern Ireland. The organisation said while it is working hard to deal with the problem of wildfires, it wants to assure customers that tap water quality is unaffected and is of a very high quality.But NI Water has warned that wildfires within catchments not only pose a terrible risk to all le but can remove the primary layer of vegetation, leaving the burned bare soil exposed to erosion which then makes its way into the reservoirs, from where water is abstracted for treatment to provide drinking water.ldquoThe erosion caused by wildfire increases carbon and other polluting chemicals signicantly in untreated water, with sediment accumulating in streams, lakes and reservoirs, said NI Waterrsquos Rebecca Allen.ldquoThis makes raw water especially dficult and more expensive to treat at our facilities to the stringent standards required by the Drinking Water Regulations. A signicant amount of other work by our water supply colleagues also has to be undertaken at the treatment works to ensure excellent quality drinking water during these times.Rebecca added: ldquoExtra water samples have to be collected and analysed, streams from burned areas need isolated, and other remedial measures must be taken like blocking streams to protect reservoirs.Mournes councillor Willie Clarke has praised firefighters, other arms of the emergency services and the Mourne Heritage Trust for their efforts to bring the blaze at the Bloody Bridge under control.He said firefighters in particular were overwhelmed by the support from the community.ldquoI witnessed the devastation of the wildfire first hand which impacted a site that is a protected habitat renowned around the world, said Cllr Clarke.ldquoThe emergency services, particularly local fire crews, should be commended for the professionalism they displayed when dealing with these incidents. However, malicious fires place a massive strain on very limited resources and as we approach the summer I would urge people to be vigilant and report any suspicious activity to the PSNI.Cllr Clarke said the damage caused by gorse fires has a lasting impact and that areas of outstanding natural beauty can take years to recover, calling for a co-ordinated response from the Department for Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs, NI Water, health and public safety departments and the Department of Justice.He continued: ldquoWe need to see a collective response with a sharing of resources and there needs to be additional funding provided to build upon the best practice Mourne Heritage Trust has undertaken to reduce the impact of these fires in the High Mournes. Controlled burns and better land-management needs to be re-established.ldquoMeasures should include the establishment of fire breaks to reduce the fuel load and a cross-departmental strategic response to ensure that the scale of these fires should never happen again.Cllr Clarke said it is important that police proactively investigate what are environmental crimes and those responsible need to be assured that these types of crime will not be tolerated in society.South Down MLA Sinead Ennis has also praised firefighters for their efforts in battling huge fires in the Mournes which started at Hen Mountain and Spelga Dam.She added: ldquoTragically, these fires will have caused widespread damage to the environment and our wildle. This is yet another stark reminder that everyone must behave responsibly while visiting the Mournes in order to protect the environment and the safety of the local community..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Reality TV star Matthew visits ex primary school  ","story":"FRESH from Dancing With The Stars Ireland, TV star Matthew MacNabb and his new girlfriend took the chance to visit his former primary school last week.Matthew and his professional dance partner, Laura Nolan, visited St Patrickrsquos Primary School, Legamaddy, after making it to the semi-final of the top RTE show.The visit to the school, which the Downpatrickrsquos manrsquos brother and sisters also attended, coincided with the school celebrating news of receiving a sizeable grant.It has been awarded pound, which will go towards creating a pollinator garden in the school grounds.Pupils were delighted to show Matthew and Laura around the school, particularly its new outdoor learning hub which allows to have an outdoor classroom for eco projects.The schoolrsquos Eco teacher, Mrs Bronagh Reid, said the school was delighted to welcome Matthew back.ldquoHe was very friendly to all the pupils, who found him very inspiring, said Mrs Reid. ldquoIt was good that he called with us on a day off and it was down to his mother Margaret, who sits on our board of governors.ldquoWe were all hoping that Matthew would make into the final but very impressed that he cog to the semi-final.The schoolrsquos cash injection is part of the Rural Community Pollinator Grants Scheme, which is financed by the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairsand managed by the civic-pride campaign, Live Here Love Here.It is designed to allow community groups and schools across rural Northern Ireland to benefit from funding between pound, to pound, to establish, enhance or develop a local community pollinator garden.A pollinator garden is a shared space with pollinating plants, habitats, wildflowers, flowers, shrubs and trees, and the grants support new initiatives aimed at protecting and providing for pollinators.Mrs Sarah McDowell, principal, said: ldquoWe plan to use the money to create an outdoor learning space which will enhance our school grounds and the local community.ldquoWe will build an outdoor classroom and plant fruit trees to attract more wildle to our school grounds.`We are delighted to receive the support of Live Here Love Here to help us create this space which will benefit the children in our school and will help to improve bioersity in the area.She added: ldquoWe look forward to starting to create this area after Christmas and have it ready for the spring term.The pilot scheme, which made pound. million available for  , aims to cover % of costs to community groups and schools wishing to embark on the community environmental project.Successful grant applicants were required to illustrate their plans to maximise pollinator-friendly land-management techniques to increase the bioersity value of an area by planting for pollinators, and to transform unused spaces into valued community spaces, adding habitats and greening-up formerly grey areas..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Students involved in All Island lights switch off climate event  ","story":"THE lights went out at Stormont at the weekend thanks to ecologically aware local high school studentsA group of pupils from St Patrickrsquos Grammar School and Down High School, who are involved in the All-Island Schools  Climate Action programme, asked for the lights at Stormont to be switched off for one hour on Saturday evening.Local MLAs Harry Harvey and Colin McGrath helped ensure that the request was fast-tracked, with Mr Harveyrsquos we, Sharon, doing a lot of the work behind the scenes.Mr Harvey met with staff and pupils from the two schools in the grounds of Parliament Buildings to observe the dimming of the lights.Stormont joined in solidarity with the  countries from around the world that participated in the th anniversary of the global Earth Hour.

Many of the people who make this point themselves care very much about the Irish Sea border — they want to keep it, either because they support staying in the EU , or because they see it as major step towards an economic united Ireland, and thus towards a more general all-Ireland.It is true that many of the more apolitical unionists are much more relaxed about the protocol than they should be, but that is typically because it is complex .It is also because such unionists heard that the protocol offered the best of both worlds .Thus unionists should have been, and should still be, trying to explain and reiterate to some of the more apathetic pro Union voters the ultimate impact of the NI Protocol. This would entail trying to revive some of the spirit of indignation that there was in the early months of , when many people across the Province were suddenly finding that they could not get deliveries from Great Britain that they had always been able to get before.The EU has been keen to agree to case-by-case exemptions to checks in part because it does not want the wider public to be troubled by the protocol. Needless to say, therefore, unionists badly need to see a large vote for parties that oppose the protocol.Doug Beattie’s approach to the Irish Sea border, of opposing it but calling for engagement in the pursuit of political solutions to the problems that it creates, has a high-wire quality. If the Alliance vote goes down, even slightly, on recent elections, and the Ulster Unionist Party vote increases, Mr Beattie will be able to say that his tactics have stemmed the decline of unionism by broadening its appeal.If Alliance continues upwards, and the UUP does not rise, he will be seen to have not only been weak on the protocol, but having failed to win over moderates in the process.l The second key thing to watch out for in the election is turnoutThere was a time in the s and early s when it seemed voters in the western world were losing interest in politics.Countries such as the UK and United States were increasingly wealthy and many bitter political disagreements of the s and s seemed to give way to a more bland, moderate politics. In Northern Ireland itself, this wider trend towards consensus seemed to be reflected in the  Belfast Agreement. But this sense of stable politics has evaporated, at home and abroad. There are now bitter ides on major issues of national and global importance, and much turbulence in voting patterns.The Brexit referendum of  had a higher turnoutthan most recent UK general elections have done.The Scottish independence plebiscite in  had an even higher turnout .The fiercely contested, and narrowly decided, US presidential election between Donald Trump and Joe Biden in November  had one of the highest turnouts of any presidential race in modern memory .In Northern Ireland, the turnout surged from % of voters in the  Stormont election to % a year later, in the more fraught atmosphere of the election after Sinn Fein collapsed the institutions.There is now keen interest in conflicts and politics at home and abroad. Before Russia invaded Ukraine, I feared people in the UK would not care much, seeing it as a distant problem. I was relieved to be proven wrong by the massive interest there was in such a serious global matter.A high turnout next month would show that the population in NI still think that Stormont and issues such as the protocol matter.l The final thing to watch is the vote shares of the two communitiesWill it be like the  general election, when the DUP and Sinn Fein dominated thingsor like  when they plunged to a combined % Will unionists get a combined vote share in the high s %, as in the  and  Stormont elections, or will they be down round %, as in  Westminster  Will nationalists combined get more than % of the vote, as they have done in some elections, or go back under that level It will be a bad day indeed for unionismthe combined vote is as low as %, as some polls have suggested, or even in the high s.ProtocolNorthern IrelandDoug BeattieBen LowryIrish Sea  \"       \"  Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up  Most PopularOwen Polley: Beattie’s unfortunate message to voters appalled by sea borderThese are the Easyjet flights cancelled to Northern Ireland today as Covid infections hit staff numbers | fears of future cancellations over coming daysGeorge Best  Jim Allister: Surprising link emerges during TUV leader election grillingIn Pictures - The official opening of the Royal Black Institution state-of-the-art headquarters in LoughgallNew UDR memorial is a bid to ‘keep good name of regiment alive’ in the face of efforts to ‘airbrush it from history’Most PopularTen of the best Mother’s Day afternoon teas from UK supermarkets and online stores for Mothering SundayBest air beds for camping UK : inflatable beds to keep you comfy from Outwell, Vango, and SnugpakBest patio heaters UK : weatherproof electric heaters and coal firepits, from Made, Wayfair, ConranBest men’s waterproof hiking trousers UK : walking trousers from Craghoppers, Berghaus, Montane, SalomonBest robot vacuum cleaner UK : top cleaners for pet hair and more from Dyson to Shark                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-jQrDum sc-fvxzrP bUrEZo ivPtAx\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement  News you can trust since Sign in   \"    Welcome backEdit Account-Sign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisUkraine CrisisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensPuzzlese-PaperMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessRecommended\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      RecommendedEntertainmentTechnologyLestyleHome and GardenFashion and BeautyDealsPublic NoticesContact UsFree Happy AdsFollow us       \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Photo by Kelvin Boyes   Press Eye.“To the teams of vaccinators, administrative staff and volunteers who have worked tirelessly over the past  months – thank you. Your commitment and dedication has been truly remarkable. This was a team effort and it has been a huge honour to be involved.“From the outset we have known that every jab counts and it is thanks to you that there have been many lives saved, and far, far fewer people seriously ill in hospital due to covid. You should be very proud of the role you have played.”Speaking to the public, Ms Donnelly said: “Thank you for rolling up your sleeves and helping to protect yourselves and those around you from this terrible disease. However we’re not at the finish line just yet. I’ve made plenty of appeals to the public in the past  months but I’m sure I’ll be forgiven for one more - please come forward for your jabs.“It’s vital that everyone in the  plus age group and those who have severely weakened immune systems come forward for their spring booster. I would again encourage everyone who is eligible for their booster to get it without delay. Vaccination clinics are still running across Northern Ireland and people are still coming forward for boosters as well as first and second doses. It’s not too late to get protected.”Patricia was a clinical psychologist by profession and held a number of key positions at Trust level before retiring. Her contribution to the health service will continue by chairing the HSC Clinical Ethics Forum and the NI Bereavement Network.A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityIt seems over the years, Barry Island seems to be the shining light of identity for the Barry and District.However, many times have I been asked this, \"Karl-James Langford, was Barry Island ever an island \"Well, I could ignore the question and reply in a sarcastic way, but one, never does. For when you look at the area today, it is dficult to think of a time when Barry Island was just that an island surrounded by water at hightide.For after  for all those dams, and bridges built across The Sound, slowly dragged Barry Island to the mainland. The water logged landscape has now been lost within a landscape of housing and other development.Barry Island until  was nothing more than a place lost in time with a rundown farmhouse, outbuildings and forgotten about sacred wells until things changed. Francis Crawshay purchased Barry Island in  a very eccentric man, who saw that his new home The Marine Hotel, was to accommodate friends visiting him on the Island.You may add that the image we examine today is of a dferent structure. The original Marine Hotel of Francis Crawshay building on the start of Friars Point, was eventually renamed Friars Point House, at which point the original name became redundant. However, as Barry Island became a focal point of day trippers, and visits for those building the dock, accommodation was required.Now, towards the end of the s, the Barry and District saw the construction of a number of Hotels, and  of which, after being opened never received the licences for the purpose they were built, such as the Sea View Hotel on Dock View Road, which became the Sea View Labour Club.One of these new purpose-built hotels one of which was on Barry Island, however opened in , and adopted the name The Marine Hotel, as it was no longer being used for the grand building Friars Point. The Marine Hotel on the corner of Plymouth Road and Friars Point, was infact a much larger building than you can find today alas some parts of it were demolished over the past few decades. However, what building still remains although it is now been converted into flats, is still impressive..removeBack in the day, in the late s you entered through a very impressive Portico entrance, with stone details picked out in Portland stone. The rest of the structure utilising locally sourced Red brick. The Marine Hotel was the place to stay on Barry Island, with an array of fine rooms to stay it, after a long summer evening eating icecream on the sands of the Bay, oryou had been visiting the Barry and District on business.Now when viewing the building facing onto Friars Road, the scroll work surrounding the lettering entrapping the words  MARINE HOTEL. This is an echo of times when we built in a much grander way. Most of the buildings of note were built to last in the late s, in such a way the Marine Hotel was constructed.One thing of final note is that one local resident told me story that The Marine Hotel was a haunt of Leguards and Coastguards from Barry Island. And then ironically inquests were held into deaths caused to drowning, and other reasons at the Marine Hotel also.Many thanks for joining us this week. More from our enigmatic Barry and District next week. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThe owner of Coaltown Coffee was still just a teenager when he started up his business – then called Roasted Joe’s – in  after leaving secondary school with no qualications.Nearly a decade after dad Gordon helped him build his first roaster, Coaltown’s products are being savoured around the world and the company is continuing to go from strength to strength.With the support of Gordon and mum Jennine, Scott has made a big mark on his hometown of Ammanford, with their Foundry Road roastery popular among locals and those from further afield.Given that his parents used to run their own café and older generations of the family were grocers and restaurateurs, it is perhaps no surprise that the coffee industry has been Scott’s calling.Great-grandfather Ben, a miner in the former coal town, inspired the rebranding of the company, and Scott hasn’t looked back since ditching the Roasted Joe’s name.“The mining industry was a big part of everyday le in this area and that’s gone, it’s been completely wiped out,” he told the Welsh Business Heroes webinar.“It was really impactful, and the idea of that industry that’s no longer here was very much the inspiration behind what we wanted to do with the brand, which is where the name came from.“We were doing some research into the mining industry and one of the terms for what they called coal was ‘black gold’.“Coal gave a massive amount of employment and industry to the area, and, when you look at coffee, black gold is the same term used for coffee growing regions.“They are two very dferent worlds but are tied together through black gold.”In , Coaltown became one of the first coffee companies in the UK to be B Corp certied, meaning they are committed to prioritising the environment and society in how they do business..removeAnd that ethical approach to doing things has, according to Scott, always been at the forefront of his mind as an entrepreneur.“We went on a trip to New York to see my favourite roasteries,” he said.“I can’t stress enough how massively influential that trip was. You really do need to go somewhere and soak it all in because it just inspires you and makes you have a completely dferent approach to what you do.“That’s where I first encountered Square as a brand before they opened in the UK, and it was also where I first encountered B Corp.“It’s a universally adopted accreditation which allows you to implement a lot of sustainability ethics into one brand.“B Corp is a really good thing for giving you a general overview of everything you do as a business.“What B Corp means is that you are putting your planet before profit and your business as a force for good and change before anything .“I don’t think any business opening as a fresh start-up today can open without that in mind. It’s not a tradable landscape for you to be able to grow within.“You have to have that ethical approach to everything you do.“B Corp, as a brand, really summed up everything we were as a business “We were awarded that in December  and announced it in late January , and we were the first specialty roastery in UK to get it so we were very proud of that.“It was a big feat because we were up against some really big players in the UK.“We all have the ambition to be ethical and do the best we can, but to get that certication first was a really big thing for us.“It’s looking at how you run your business from the ground up.“As a brand, we’ve been purpose driven, so it’s about how we can bring a new industry to our hometown, and now post-industrial towns across the UK.“It has always been our intention to have an ethical brand.“Essentially, the coal industry is the opposite of what we are, we’re trying to be the opposite of what the coal industry was with fossil fuels and bad carbon.”Watch the Welsh Business Heroes episode featuring Scott James of Coaltown Coffee in its entirety here - www.youtube watch vKZFsjhVei article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

I’m bitterly disappointed at the Government’s decision not to include gender identity in the ban on conversion therapy. Many have asked what my thoughts are. I’ve always believed that this debate attracts unnecessary hysteria and toxicity, and…— Jamie Wallis MPApril , The backbencher argued that it would be a “broken promise” to allow conversion therapy to be banned, but for it not to apply to trans people.The outcome of a double U-turn by the Prime Minister last week, in which he appeared to flip-flop on whether to legislate against conversion therapy, has reportedly seen No  settle on outlawing “only gay conversion therapy, not trans”.When announcing the initial consultation into the conversion therapy ban, the UK Government declared: “The proposed protections are universal: an attempt to change a person from being attracted to the same-sex to being attracted to the opposite-sex, or from not being transgender to being transgender, will be treated in the same way as the reverse scenario.“They therefore protect everyone.”LGBT and religious leaders, including former archbishop of Canterbury Dr Rowan Williams, have put pressure on Boris Johnson to include trans people in a ban on conversion therapy.In a series of tweets, Mr Wallis said: “I’m bitterly disappointed at the Government’s decision not to include gender identity in the ban on conversion therapy..remove“Many have asked what my thoughts are. I’ve always believed that this debate attracts unnecessary hysteria and toxicity, and meaningful results can only come from meaningful debate. Understandably, concerns need to be looked at and debated, but it is wrong to exclude protections for a whole group of people from a practice described as ‘abhorrent’.“I hope the announcement that a separate piece of work will now be done on this issue will be done at speed.“If the CTban passes through Parliament without any protections for the transgender community, it cannot be described as anything other than a broken promise.”The Government has said trans people should be “treated with the maximum possible generosity and respect” but that the “complexity of issues requires separate work to further consider transgender conversation therapy”..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Wallis says excluding trans people in conversion therapy ban a  ubroken promise u article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityShadow defence secretary, John Healey, hit out at the situation as he met veterans during a visit to Scotland.Speaking as he campaigned in Dunfermline, Fe, with Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar, Mr Healey said those serving in the armed forces had seen their pay fall over the last  years, insisting: “Ministers are failing Armed Forces families.“Everyone’s bills are going up and the UK Government is doing too little to help, so forces families are falling behind.Same funding figures, but no reference now to “real terms growth” in #SpringStatement which neatly covers up the autumn Budget’s real cut in day-to-day MoD spending and means less money for Forces recruitment, training, families. Higher inflation now also means a deeper real cut pic uAazeIR— John Healey MPMarch , “The Office for Budget Responsibility has said that we are set to see the biggest drop to household incomes on record this year.“Unfortunately, Forces families across the country will be faced with tough financial decisions.”Mr Healey continued: “Despite this, ministers plan a real-terms cut in day-to-day Ministry of Defence spending over the next three years. This means less money for forces recruitment, training, pay and families.“No other Whitehall department has a real cut in revenue spending, and the Defence Secretary should never have agreed to it.” vw,vw,px, px\"Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar says the cost of living crisis will be a key issue in the May  local elections His comments came as Mr Sarwar said that the local elections on May  would be focused on the cost of living crisis.“Every single Scot is living through the cost of living crisis and yet neither of Scotland’s Governments are doing anywhere near enough to help, Mr Sarwar said..remove“The reality is that, after  years in power, all the SNP are willing to do is give families a pathetic £ a week. Meanwhile, the Tories are putting up taxes in Westminster.“Scottish Labour are the only party with a proper plan to tackle the cost of living, by rolling out a one-off windfall tax on gas companies and reducing the costs of everyday living. Scotland needs action and it needs it now.”A government spokesperson said: “The UK Government has provided almost £ million in cost of living help for people in Scotland, on top of the record £ billion per year settlement announced at the spending review – the largest settlement since devolution.“Armed Forces personnel will benefit from our £ energy bill rebate, which is part of the £ billion of support to help with the cost of living. This follows a pay increase for junior personnel last year and introduction of additional support for service families, such as wrap around childcare.“We’ll continue to monitor how global events impact on energy bills here at home into the autumn and will consider further supportneeded.”.push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: UK Government not helping Forces families with cost of living, says Labour article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Picture: PA Twickenham Stadium, London​Saturday, February .pmNew Wales flanker Jac Morgan admits playing at Twickenham next week would be special given the historic rugby rivalry between England and Wales.Morgan won his first cap on Saturday as reigning Six Nations champions Wales bounced back from a Dublin drubbing against Ireland to beat Scotland - in Cardf.The Welsh-speaking Ospreys openside says he was so nervous before kick-off that he almost forgot the words of the national anthem ‘Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau’.“It’s always a dream to play for your country from a young age,” said the -year-old.“Growing up England is one of the biggest games with the rivalry between the two countries over the years.“Everybody knows how big the game is with the history between the two sides.\"Morgan produced an impressive debut display last weekend, as Wales revived their Six Nations title hopes before heading to Twickenham next Saturday.Courtney Lawes has resumed full training in time to reinforce the middle phase of England’s Guinness Six Nations title push.Lawes was unable to play in the opening two rounds of the tournament because of concussion but has now completed histo play protocols and comes into contention to face Wales next Saturday..removeDefence coach, Anthony Seibold, said: \"Courtney trained fully today , which is obviously really good news for himself and England. He looked sharp.\"Meanwhile, Wasps flanker Jack Willis is set to make his first appearance in a year after finally recovering from the serious knee injury sustained against Italy at Twickenham in the  championship.England v Wales Six Nations: How to watch on TV, live streamThe England v Wales Six Nations match kicks off at .pm on Saturday, February .You can watch coverage on ITV or live stream the game via ITV Hub.Alternatively,you cant make it to a screen, you can also listen live on BBC Radio  Live Sports Extra. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Do something instead‘Don’t worry!’ How often have we heard that and how often do we say it to others  I suspect it’s being said quite often at the present time, when there seems to be so much to be worried about, writes Rev. Ron Elsdon.By The NewsroomSunday, rd April , : am  \"       \"  There’s the state of the Health Service, the never-ending fallout from Brexit, the war in Ukraine, and the spiralling cost of living which is already inflicting so much hardship on so many. ‘Don’t worry!’ But the problem is that it’s far easier said than done. So when you come across it in the bible as well, you could be excused for writing it off as unrealistic. Please stay with me for a few moments, however, while I try to explain.        \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"     \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily NorthernIrelandWorld Today newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

It points you to something rather more than that. I offer you two examples where it offers you responses that are practical – strategies,you like.Ron ElsdonFirstly, Paul directs people to pray instead, and to pepper their prayers with thanksgiving . The trouble is that we’re so good at finding things to complain about, often trivialities, that finding things to give thanks for doesn’t come easily, even to people who pray regularly, but why not switch course and actually do it, then keep on doing it  Then, says Paul, the protecting peace of God is there to be discovered, even in the midst of stressful situations. Secondly, Jesus talks about worry in the Sermon on the Mount . When it consumes us, he says, what we need is a new set of ambitions which point us beyond ourselves “Seek first God’s kingdom and God’s righteousness” is His command to His followers. As I write, I’m thinking about a local politician, one I shan’t be voting for. I know he spends Christmas Day at a place for the homeless, helping to serve up hot meals for that I admire him greatly. As I write, hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians are fleeing the army of a tyrant from the east, many with nowhere to go in freezing weather. In neighbouring countries, churches and other organisations are swinging into action to help support these folk in their hour of desperate need. So, in their dferent ways, Jesus’ and Paul’s words in the bible are saying to us all, ‘Don’t worry! Do something instead.’Read: Covid travel requirement set to change"},{"url":null,"title":"late s and early s ballyclare may fair era captured in rhymes and ructions ","story":"Entertainer William Caulfield banned for driving up to an estimated ‘mph’   Young teenager dies in M motorway crash between Lurgan and MoiraNewsCoronavirusTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsHealthBusinessEducationPeopleEnvironmentRead ThisUkraine CrisisFootballIrish League FootballSportMotorcyclingIce HockeyOther SportWhats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyleFood and DrinkTravelHomes and GardensCars FamilyYour NIRetroOpinionAdvertise My Businesscanonical_urlCANONICAL_URLhostnameCANONICAL_HOSTNAMElocationCANONICAL_URLreferrerEXTERNAL_REFERRERpage_view_id_PAGE_VIEW_ID_scroll_SCROLL_HEIGHTgeo__INJECT_GEO__cid_ga:CLIENT_ID,comScore:CLIENT_ID,compass_uid:CLIENT_IDversionsha-wJFtySqNnAxBmRbBZGkmXyZeJTYkxlpMdJsFNIrrGVlru-DcIEIZ\" class\"i-amphtml-layout-container\" i-amphtml-layout\"container\"Loading...NewsPeopleLate s and early s Ballyclare May Fair era captured in ‘Rhymes and Ructions’The halcyon days of music and merriment in Ballyclare in the run up to the annual May Fair are revisited in a new publication by author and local historian Jack McKinney.By The NewsroomFriday, st April , : pm  \"       \"  ‘Rhymes and Ructions’ - with its eye-catching and locally-linked front and back covers - refers to the title of a series of concerts organised by the Ballyclare and District Historical Society in the town in the late s and early s.

They gradually gained popularity with the audience and, being held on the Monday night before the annual May Fair Day, reflected the atmosphere of jollication that pervaded the town at this special time of year.An eye-catching image from Ballyclare.“The music was provided by ious groups of instrumentalists – fiddlers, accordionists, tin whistle players – and their sessions were interspersed with songs, recitations and stories by local inidual entertainers drawn from the lore and culture of the Six Mile Water region. Many of these songs and much of the material came from an oral tradition and few were available in written form.”Verses of material from local ‘balladeers’ Ernie Scott, Sandy Robinson, Jock Gilmour and Matt Meharg together with short biographical details of these and many others feature in the pages of the book.Jack continued: “Sadly the concerts came to an end when the security situation dictated that crowds gathering in halls became impossible. The Historical Society planned to celebrate the th anniversary of the founding of the society in  by reviving the Rhymes and Ructions concert in  but the outbreak of the Covid- pandemic put paid to their plans.”In his introduction to Rhyme and Ructions Jack, who is the author of a number of local history studies including ‘Stories of a Letime’, also reveals what inspired this latest publication.Author Jack McKinney with his latest publication.“What I am endeavouring to do here is to compile a collection of the ballads and anecdotes that proved so popular at the concerts. The tone and subjects of the ballads y considerably from the amusing to those of a more contemplative nature. As for their credibility I leave the readers to assess this for themselves.”Jack has pursued his interest in local history and its characters with zeal since retiring in  after a four-decade career as an assistant and principal teacher in east Antrim primary schools. The former Mossley Primary School pupil, taught at Abbots Cross, Ballyclare and Whitehead Primary Schools. And in the manner in which he inspired many pupils, Jack is keen to share his enthusiasm for knowledge with a whole new generation of readers.A founder member of the Ulster-Scots Language Society, Jack added: “The ballads are recorded in the style of language used in the originals – standard English or Ulster- Scots. The stories and other text may contain either or both. I have often followed the style of a mixture of Ulster -Scots and English as in the Scottish ‘Kaleyard’ novels, familiar to readers of Archibald McIlroy’s books, where the conversational dialogue of characters is in Ulster-Scots with the rest of the narrative in standard English.”The ‘Wreck of the Never Budge’, ‘Courting and Possible Consequences’ or ‘The May Fair and lots of Houzeldoo’ provide a hint of Ballyclare May Fairs past and possible inspiration for future balladeers and storytellers.

With the signicant rise in the cost of living, particularly the continued increase in gas and electricity prices, many are struggling to provide the basics of food and heat. Recent research indicated that one in every four children in Northern Ireland are living in a family which is struggling to provide basic requirements of heat, food, clothing, and childcare. Under these pressures many families are at risk of getting into further debt and are heavily reliant on food banks to supplement their financial situation. Carol Ervine, Choice Group Director of Tenant and Client Services said,“As an organisation we are committed to providing more than bricks and mortar and realise that whilst having a home is a human right, there are many who are living with the real threat of poverty and financial instability. With the cost of living continuing to rise, the cost of the weekly shop has become signicantly higher, and many families are making the decision between heating or eating. Working with the Trussell Trust, we are able to provide much needed food parcels to families in need, with the knowledge that this will ease at least part of the burden. The Trussell Trust support a UK network of food banks providing emergency food and support to people in poverty whilst campaigning for change to end the need for food banks in the UK. The Trust recently outlined that in the year  , .m food bank parcels were given to people in crisis in the past year across the UK with close to , emergency food parcels distributed across Northern Ireland in the same period. Jonny Currie, Northern Ireland Network Lead from the Trussell Trust said,“We welcome this partnership with Choice Housing providing vital support to our network of food banks in Northern Ireland. Food banks and their volunteers are extraordinary, and their response to need in their communities is inspiring. But that kind of response shouldn’t be needed. In the last year in Northern Ireland almost , emergency food parcels were provided by food banks in the Trussell Trust’s network – and more than , of these were for children. It’s not right that some of us cannot afford our own food.That’s why we are working towards a just, compassionate future, where no one should have to use a food bank to get by. Choice also manage a Financial Inclusion programme, through which they are supporting tenants to improve their money management, ensuring they can maximise their income. In the last year this programme helped tenants access pound. million in financial gains, and specialised staff at Choice are continuing to help tenants with benefits, debt, and budgeting advice.  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_dbabbeecfc   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_bfbfcbccb   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
